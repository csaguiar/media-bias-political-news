Utah judge suspended for criticizing Trump on social media and in court,www.nbcnews.com,Phil McCausland,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/utah-judge-suspended-criticizing-trump-social-media-court-n1010331,"A Utah judge has been suspended for six months without pay after he made a series of critical statements about President Donald Trump online and in his courtroom over the past few years. The Utah Supreme Court filed its court ruling this past week on Judge Michael Kwan’s actions.
Kwan, who has served as a justice court judge in Taylorsville for 20 years, was cited for “improper use of judicial authority and his inappropriate political commentary,” the latter often involving President Trump.
The court noted multiple times when Kwan had provided political comments that criticized Trump, as a presidential candidate in 2016 and as president on his Facebook page and in court.
Three days after the 2016 election, Kwan wrote on Facebook, “Think I’ll go to the shelter to adopt a cat before the President-Elect grabs them all” — a reference to the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump was heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals without consent.
Almost a month after Trump’s inauguration, Kwan said “welcome to the beginning of the fascist takeover” and questioned whether Congressional Republicans would be “the American Reichstag,” this time referring to the political body of Nazi Germany.
Judge Kwan defended his online commentary by stating that he had a First Amendment right to share his views about elected officials' political and social stances, calling it “constitutionally protected speech” and describing his statements as “social commentary or humor.”
In response, the ruling written by Utah Supreme Court Justice John Pearce dryly noted, “It is an immutable and universal rule that judges are not as funny as they think they are. If someone laughs at a judge’s joke, there is a decent chance that the laughter was dictated by the courtroom’s power dynamic and not by a genuine belief that the joke was funny.”
The court ruling also noted a moment in court that demonstrated the judge’s political leanings and views of the president.
When a defendant said he was praying to get a large tax return in 2017 to pay off his fines and avoid going to jail, Kwan appeared to tell the man he shouldn’t hold his breath because of President Trump.
“Prayer might be the answer,” the judge said, “’cause he just signed an order to start building the wall and he has no money to do that, and so if you think you are going to get taxes back this year, uh, yeah, maybe, maybe not. But don’t worry, there is a tax cut for the wealthy, so if you make over $500,000 you’re getting a tax cut.”
The inquiry also noted a pattern of behavior by Kwan, including a lewd statement about President Bill Clinton’s sexual history and for his involvement with a politically biased nonprofit.
Though Kwan continued to defend his use of speech, and said that his Facebook profile remained largely private, Judge Pearce and the Utah Supreme Court said the judicial office requires sacrifice.
“Fulfillment of judicial duties does not come without personal sacrifice of some opportunities and privileges available to the public at large,” Pearce wrote. “And as a person the public entrusts to decide issues with the utmost fairness, independence, and impartiality, a judge must at times set aside the power of his or her voice.”

Ultimately, she said, she chose to survive. ""The last 17 days of my life have been the toughest days [of my] life, and it's been a really significant spiritual journey that I was guided on,"" she said in a Facebook video. Eller, 35, shared her experience from her bed at Maui Memorial Medical Center with her boyfriend, Benjamin Konkol, at her side. She was released late Saturday and was at a family member's residence in Maui, said her father, John Eller. ""There were times of total fear and loss and wanting to give up, and it did come down to life and death — and I had to choose,"" said Amanda Eller, a physical therapist and yoga instructor. ""And I chose life."" Eller was discovered by a helicopter crew Friday. Related News Hiker found in Hawaii forest after 2 weeks had access to waterfall, friend says She went for a short hike May 8, parking her SUV at the Maui reserve and strolling off without her wallet and phone, authorities said. Konkol reported her missing the next day. ""I woke up in the morning, she wasn't here,"" he told ""Dateline NBC."" ""And that's when I completely freaked out."" Eller's mother told reporters at a news conference Saturday that her daughter intended to go on a 3-mile hike but became disoriented after sitting on a log to rest. ""When she got up she was disoriented and followed her instincts to get back to her car — and she was going in the wrong direction,"" Julia Eller said. Her daughter heard helicopters that buzzed the forest for days, but none close enough to spot her until Friday, she said. Amanda Eller told The New York Times that she was injured when she fell 20 feet off a cliff and later lost her shoes in a flash flood. Ultimately, she said, she was reduced to crawling around the forest. Eller suffered an orthopedic fracture, as well as burns on her lower extremities, doctors said Saturday at a news conference. Sarah Haynes told NBC affiliate KHNL of Honolulu that her friend's key to survival was ""access to water."" ""She had a waterfall,"" she said. Dr. Zora Bulatovic of the Maui Memorial Medical Center told reporters Saturday that a patient who had such an experience would normally be dehydrated but that Eller was resourceful. ""She was able to manage to stay hydrated with the river water and eating fresh fruit from the trees,"" she said. Julia Eller said she doesn't think her daughter will return to hiking soon. ""We'll have her on a break from hiking for a bit,"" she said. Meanwhile, Maui police and fire officials were searching Saturday for another missing hiker, Noah Mina, 28, who was thought to be in the Iao Valley. He has been missing for five days.

Carlos Rivera faces charges of two counts of distribution of class B drugs to a minor, two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14, and one count of indecent assault and battery on a person over 14, the Lawrence Police Department said in a press release.
He was taken into custody at the police station after speaking with investigators. He's expected to be arraigned on the charges on Tuesday.
Chloe Ricard, of Amesbury, was left at Lawrence General Hospital around 4:50 p.m. on Monday. She died shortly after arriving.

Detectives said during their investigation they learned that Rivera was the one who dropped the teenager off. He was accompanied by a girl under the age of 16, whom authorities did not identify.
According to investigators, Ricard and the other teenage girl were at Rivera's apartment Sunday evening and most of Monday. A medical examiner will determine the cause and manner of Ricard's death, police said.
Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett called the girl's death ""tragic.""
“We will continue our diligent pursuit of justice for this victim,"" he said in the police department's press release.
Deborah Goldsmith-Dolan told the Boston Globe that she dropped her daughter off at a friend's house in Amesbury on Sunday evening and became worried when she had not heard from the girl by Monday morning.
After texting some of Ricard's friends, Goldsmith-Dolan said she was told that her daughter was safe at another friend's home in Haverhill. Ricard's child services caseworker later told Goldsmith-Dolan that there were ""red flags"" suggesting the teenager was planning on moving to Virginia.
Goldsmith-Dolan told the outlet that on Monday evening one of Ricard's friends told her that the teen had been taken to the hospital.
Ricard was an eighth-grader who previously attended Amesbury Middle School, the district said in a statement on Tuesday. The Boston Globe reports that she was a student at Solstice Day School in Rowley at the time of her death.
""Chloe was a talented young artist. She was creative and found that she could sometimes best express herself through her artwork,"" said Jared Fulgoni, superintendent of Amesbury Public Schools. ""She was kind to the younger students in the school and she showed great empathy for others. We will miss her smile, her creativity and her huge heart.""

The agreement was first reported by CNN; it was subsequently confirmed by NBC News.
On Wednesday a federal judge ruled that the banks could hand over the documents sought under congressional subpoenas. But leaders of those committees made a deal with Trump's team to halt the court-approved handover while the case is appealed by the president's lawyers.

His bail was initially set at $300,000, police said.
Morgan was previously arrested, on June 11, by the LAPD's Commercial Crimes Division for allegedly making false 911 calls on May 30 and 31 ""to further deceive Lee into believing he was in danger and needed to be moved from his home to a more secured condominium where Morgan had more control over Lee,"" police stated Saturday.

A disheveled, divisive populist, Johnson is the bookmakers' favorite to take over as leader of the ruling Conservative Party. Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson before he boards the Vote Leave campaign bus in Truro, Cornwall, ahead of its inaugural journey which will crisscross the country over the coming weeks to take the Brexit message to all corners of the U.K. before the June 23 referendum. Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire/AP file Breaking News Emails May 26, 2019, 6:54 AM UTC By Alexander Smith LONDON — Boris Johnson is one of the most divisive political figures in the United Kingdom. He is also favorite among bookmakers and pollsters to become the next leader of the Conservative Party — and therefore the next prime minister — after Theresa May announced Friday that she would be stepping down June 7 . But who is this mop-haired eccentric, viewed by many as an inspiring political entertainer and by others as a dangerous populist? May leaves a Conservative Party in open revolt. Johnson, a celebrity lawmaker who spearheaded the Brexit vote, is hoping to win over the rebels, finally make Brexit happen and be the leader to put the party back together. Related Analysis How Theresa May was beaten by Brexit But he's far from a consensus candidate. Thirty two percent of people have a positive opinion about him, according to the pollster YouGov, the highest of any politician in the country. But far more, 46 percent, hold a negative view. ""He has a polarizing effect,"" said Scott Lucas, a professor of politics and American studies at England's University of Birmingham. ""He's probably the most liked politician but also one of the most disliked as well."" Former London Mayor Boris Johnson dangles from a zipwire in London's Victoria Park on Aug. 1, 2012 in London, England. Rebecca Denton / Getty Images file Critics accuse Johnson of being an arch opportunist. In the past, he has argued for tax cuts and against rises in welfare spending, and in the House of Commons he has voted generally in favor of equal gay rights, according to They Work For You, a website that tracks lawmakers' decisions. However, there are still big questions about what his government would actually look like, including its relationship with the United States. In 2015, when President Donald Trump said parts of London had been ""radicalized,"" American-born Johnson, who was the city's mayor at the time, replied that the president's ""ill-informed comments are complete and utter nonsense."" He added, ""Crime has been falling steadily in both London and New York. And the only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump."" Fast forward to last year, and the two were exchanging pleasantries, with Johnson saying there were many reasons for ""admiring Trump"" and the president declaring Johnson is ""a friend of mine"" and backing him to be the next prime minister. There were also reports he had been talking privately with Trump's former senior adviser, Steve Bannon. Leadership race Johnson will face competition for leader. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary, are among those to have confirmed they will run. In the United Kingdom, choosing a new prime minister does not necessarily require a general election. If the leader of the largest party changes between elections, that person usually becomes the new prime minister automatically. This happened when Cameron resigned in 2016 and May succeeded him unopposed. London Mayor Boris Johnson laughs in action during the Rally Against Cancer charity match on day seven of the AEGON Championships at Queens Club on June 16, 2013 in London, England. Clive Brunskill / Getty Images file Johnson would likely face a sterner test, with perhaps more than a dozen potential hopefuls lining up against him. Conservative lawmakers would winnow down this long list to a runoff of two, and the winner would be chosen by the 124,000-odd party members. In any potential matchup, Johnson is the members' favorite ""by huge margins,"" according to a YouGov poll earlier this month. But whoever wins will inherit a Conservative Party in disarray. Its lawmakers are engaged in a civil war over Brexit and the party was polling as low as 7 percent ahead of European Parliament elections which took place in the U.K. on Thursday. Even those who dislike Johnson's disheveled style may see him as their best chance of defeating populists on both the left and right, such as Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. Controversial jokes Johnson — full name Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson — is among that rare club of politicians instantly recognizable by one name only — ""Boris."" Born in New York's Upper East Side, he held U.S. citizenship until 2006. He was educated at Eton — Britain's most prestigious private school — and Oxford University, before starting a career in journalism in the 1980s. But he was soon fired by The Times of London for making up a quote. He later joined the Daily Telegraph as a Brussels correspondent, which still pays him £275,000 per year on top of his lawmaker's salary for a weekly opinion column. Johnson is known for causing outrage with quips and turns of phrase that have been described as racist. In 2016, he called President Barack Obama ""part-Kenyan"" and suggested he had an ""ancestral dislike of the British empire."" In 2002, he said that Queen Elizabeth II probably enjoyed touring the Commonwealth because of the ""cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies."" He wrote that Tony Blair, then prime minister, would be met with ""watermelon smiles"" when he toured the Congo. He has also described Muslim women wearing the burqa as ""letter boxes."" In 2008, he was elected mayor of London and he served for eight years. He announced himself to the world in August that year, waving a giant flag at the Beijing Olympics to promote London's hosting of the Games four years later. Never shy of a photo opportunity, during the London 2012 Olympics, Johnson was pictured dangling helplessly from a zipwire waving a Union Jack flag. ""This is great fun but it needs to go faster,"" he told the assembled reporters.

Paul Ellis / AFP - Getty Images In 2016 he lent that star power to the Brexit campaign, electrifying the referendum with his crowd-drawing speeches and barnstorming rhetoric about Brexit being ""our independence day."" ""He isn't a typical British politician,"" Lucas at the University of Birmingham said. ""He has always played up the idea that he is this really smart guy, but also a bit of a bumbler."" Brexit has left Johnson particularly reviled by pro-E.U. ""Remainers,"" not least because of his campaign's discredited mantra that Britain sends £350 million to the E.U. each week. His Brexit victory forced the resignation of his old friend, the then Prime Minister David Cameron, who backed the opposing, pro-E.U. side in 2016. Johnson launched a leadership bid then — but withdrew after his ally Michael Gove unexpectedly announced he would run against him. But last week, even before May had announced her departure, Johnson confirmed he would be running to replace her. ""I'm going to go for it,” he said. “Of course I'm going to go for it.""

A 'Fornite' player's lawsuit against his own team is taking on the 'Wild West' of esports,www.nbcnews.com,Ben Kesslen,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/fornite-player-s-lawsuit-against-his-own-team-taking-wild-n1010161,"Tech News A 'Fortnite' player's lawsuit against his own team is taking on the 'Wild West' of esports “I don't know how likely it is to build an esports union but I do think it’s absolutely a necessity,” one industry expert said. A Fortnite booth at the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles on June 12, 2018. Mike Blake / Reuters file Breaking News Emails May 26, 2019, 7:50 AM UTC By Ben Kesslen In the young and lucrative world of video game streaming, few groups are as popular as FaZe Clan. And few streamers are as popular as Turney Tenney, 21, who goes by Tfue. Tenney has 10 million YouTube followers and regularly draws more than 10 million viewers each month to watch him play “ Fortnite ,” the multiplayer survival video game that has taken over the gaming and esports world in the past few years. With that kind of popularity comes sponsorships and brand deals that industry experts think have made him and the FaZe Clan millions of dollars. But just last spring, Tenney was just another anonymous streamer — until he was invited to join FaZe Clan, an esports group that houses and builds teams with some of the biggest names in esports. Now, Tenney and FaZe are embroiled in a very public lawsuit over how the money he generates is divided, a battle that shines a light on what esports lawyer Andrew Gordon calls “the Wild West.” Gordon compared the esports streaming industry to the early days of baseball before players unionized, when team owners had all the bargaining power. “When you’re a new guy that has no followers, what are you going to demand?” Gordon said. Tenney’s suit has caught the Internet’s attention, generating its own hashtag (#ReleaseTheContract), plenty of tweetstorms and some long YouTube video explanations. But behind the drama is a larger story: a labor dispute in a burgeoning and largely unregulated $ 1.1 billion industry ripe with questionable contracts agreed to by people who often aren’t yet of legal drinking age. Professional Fortnite player Tfue at an appearance during SneakerCon in Florida on Feb. 2, 2019. Sean Drakes / Getty Images file On Monday, Tenney filed a complaint in a California district court against FaZe Clan alleging the company is violating California’s Talent Agency Act, and calling the contract he signed with the group in 2018 that he has since tried to leave “grossly oppressive, onerous, and one-sided.” In the suit, Tenney alleges that the “Gamer Agreement” the two parties signed entitled FaZe Clan to a finder’s fee of up to 80 percent of the revenue paid by third-parties to associate themselves with Tenney. ""Until now, FaZe Clan has enjoyed the fruits of this illegal business model with impunity because no one could or was willing to stand up to FaZe Clan,"" the complaint reads. ""Those days are over.” FaZe Clan, which did not return a request for comment, denied these claims publicly on its Twitter account. Gordon said the case speaks to issues at the core of the fast-growing esports streaming market. Most of the biggest esports players are teenagers, plucked out of relative obscurity due to their video game skills. When groups like FaZe Clan approach them, these players are told they’ll be turned into a star, making thousands of dollars, and making their hobby into a career. It’s an enticing offer — and often one that will come to fruition. But the process of signing with one of these teams isn’t always the most transparent. “Players get pressure from these organizations to sign contracts right away,” often asking for a 48-hour turnaround, Gordon said. “These are 30-page contracts. You need time to review them.” At the same time, Gordon also said he can understand why companies like FaZe ask for a big share of the revenue that players generate. “FaZe spends time and money developing players’ personality and skills,” he said. Players often start with only a small social following that the organizations help build up. This takes a significant amount of financial investment, Gordon said. But Tenney, whom NBC News could not reach for comment, sees the situation differently. The complaint says he “seeks to shift the balance of power to the games and content creators/streams, those who are actually creating value and driving the industry.” Hasan Piker, a political correspondent with the liberal media outlet The Young Turks who also streams on Twitch, said that this shift in the industry’s “balance of power” is why the case has the potential to “change the dynamic of esports completely.” Prince Harry says Fortnite shouldn't be allowed: 'It's created to addict' April 5, 2019 01:05 “[Tenney] is one of the largest, if not the largest, Twitch streamer currently,” Piker said “If he had this type of contract only two years, one that’s exploitative and really predatory, imagine what the other people who don’t have that kind of influence and bargaining power have.” Piker said this situation is unique because Tenney has the audience and influence to push back against his team in a way that employees in other industries can’t. In this suit, Piker feels like “both parties have a similar amount of capital and resources,” making the case “as fair of an arbitration as you could ever get,” yet gives Tenney an opportunity to really change industry standards. He isn’t sure if Tenney’s younger viewers are interested in the labor issues instead of just the online drama, but Piker thinks it’s good that such a large content creator is being vocal about the industry’s practices. “I don't know how likely it is to build an esports union,” Piker said, “but I do think it’s absolutely a necessity.

The honor given to Trump was part of a charm offensive Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe continued Sunday as he courted the president with three things close to his heart: wrestling matches, cheeseburgers and golf.
Call it sumo diplomacy.

At the end, Trump stepped into the ring and presented the eagle-topped ""President's Cup"" to champion wrestler Asanoyama, making him the first American president to participate. Shoes aren't permitted in the sumo ring, but Trump wore dark-colored slippers.
""That was something to see these great athletes,"" Trump said before dinner at a Hibachi restaurant.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019 Trump's four-day state visit to Japan is designed to demonstrate the strength of the bond between the nations. The president received a warm welcome as he arrived at Mobara Country Club, south of Tokyo, for a steamy morning round of golf with the Japanese leader. It was their fifth golf outing.
Abe is pulling out all the stops as he seeks to placate Trump amid growing U.S.-Japan trade tensions and the threat of auto tariffs. Japan is also contending with the continued threat of North Korea and Trump's apparent dismissal of Pyongyang's recent tests of short-range missiles that could reach Japan.
Trump projects unity with Japan but splits with Abe on North Korea May 26, 2019 02:32 But minus several antagonistic tweets, Sunday was all about bromance and keeping Trump happy.
First it was the golf course, where Trump and Abe played 16 holes, joined by Japanese professional golfer Isao Aoki. Aoki, who is famous for his putting technique, was expected to present Trump with a putter he designed.
Japanese officials said Trump and Abe also had breakfast and lunch together. On the menu for lunch: double cheeseburgers made with U.S. beef.
Next, Abe introduced Trump to Japan's ancient sport of sumo wrestling — something Trump has said he said he finds ""fascinating.""
The president's attendance at the annual summer sumo tournament in Tokyo may bring back memories of the time he spent promoting the World Wrestling Federation. Trump sponsored major events, appeared in bits, and was inducted into the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2013.
On Monday, Trump will receive another honor when he becomes the first foreign leader to meet with Japan's new emperor, Naruhito, since he ascended to the throne on May 1.
Related World World Japan's emperor abdicates, leaving imposing legacy for his son Trump and Abe will also meet in a more formal setting and participate in a joint news conference. In the evening, Trump will be guest of honor at a banquet hosted by the emperor at Japan's Imperial Palace.
It's all part of a charm offensive that began before Trump took office, when Abe rushed to New York to greet the president-elect at Trump Tower. Japan is deeply dependent on the U.S. for security and Abe has tried to encourage Trump to maintain international agreements and keep up pressure on North Korea.
Golf, in particular, has been a bonding tool for the leaders, who both enjoy a love of the game.

He told reporters as he left for Mobara that Sunday's weather was great for golf and ""it seems we are in a good mood for sumo."" He later tweeted a selfie photo of him and Trump, smiling widely on the greens.
Trump tweeted that he'd had ""Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo,"" but also continued to stew about domestic politics, claiming that, ""Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed - Death Wish!""
There has long been a tradition of American presidents and candidates holding their tongues about rivals while on foreign soil — but Trump is not one to abide by such norms.
Earlier, Trump had gone after one of his potential Democratic rivals, former President Joe Biden, saying he'd smiled when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse.""
He also downplayed North Korea's recent series of short-range missile tests. He tweeted that the tests weren't a concern for him — even though they most certainly are for Japan, due to the country's proximity to the North.
""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" Trump wrote in a message that appeared to undermine his national security adviser, John Bolton, who told reporters Saturday the tests violated U.N. Security Council resolutions.
The president also sought to manage expectations that he and Abe will make significant headway on trade issues when they hold more formal talks on Monday. Trump has been seeking a bilateral trade agreement with Tokyo since he pulled the U.S. out of the multinational Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement two years ago, though analysts expect no breakthroughs during Trump's visit.
""Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!"" he wrote, referring to Japan's upcoming parliamentary elections.
The Trump administration has been threatening Japan with new tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts on national security grounds. Trump has suggested he will impose tariffs if the U.S. can't wrest concessions from Japan and the European Union."

Audra McDonald: Every homeless child is more than a statistic. Our treatment of them matters.,www.nbcnews.com,Audra McDonald,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/every-homeless-child-more-statistic-our-treatment-them-matters-ncna1009501,"America has wealth, but it is distributed unevenly: The upper echelon has most of the wealth, and there are so many people who are impoverished. That includes, as of the 2015-2016 school year , almost 1.5 million children. There are so many factors that lead to youth homelessness, from impoverished families to aging out of foster care to being kicked out of their family homes. In some of the latter cases, kids come out to their parents or guardians as LGBTQ, and they are tossed out of their homes. There's a million reasons that a child might end up homeless, and they all need help — a safe place to land, and an environment of support, and love and guidance that gets them on the right track.
For the children who are homeless merely because they are LGBTQ, because they have been completely ostracized from their families or society, they face unique challenges in both surviving and protecting themselves. We find that they sometimes turn to, or are enticed into, prostitution or into drug use as a means of physical and emotional survival. And sometimes, the drug use comes out of a need to medicate in order to endure the emotional turmoil of being told that who you are is fundamentally wrong and abhorrent.
 Equality Act won't end transphobia but it will protect transgender people I got involved with the Covenant House, which provides housing and other support services to homeless, runaway and trafficked kids, when I was doing the show ""Lady Day"" about Billie Holiday back in 2014. As a child, Billie Holiday was raped, forced into prostitution, and was homeless. I started thinking about the fact that if perhaps there had been a safe space for her to land, then perhaps she wouldn't have had to deal with some of her demons.

It's customary to give opening night gifts on a show, and so, when I started thinking what would be an appropriate place to give a donation, I remembered the Covenant House, which is fairly close to the Theater District.
Related Opinion Opinion Bernie Sanders: Bail criminalizes poverty and undermines our justice system I walked down to the Covenant House in between my matinee and evening performance on one Saturday to give them a check. But when I walked in, there were only two security guards there and they said, ""Well, it's the weekend, so we don't have anyone on staff that could take a check from you. Our weekend staff is just with the kids here, but we'll look around and see what we can find.""
And as they were making some calls and chatting with me, a young kid came in. He looked a little disheveled, and he had a trash bag that had a few items in it, I guess. And the two security guards who had been chatting with me in a lighthearted way suddenly jumped into action, as if they became Batman and Robin. They said to him, ""Hey man, it's OK, we got you. Why don't you come over here, come sit down."" And they helped bring this kid into their safe space, and set him on a journey toward where he needed to be.
That's what the Covenant House does. It starts with the immediate sort of triage of, ""What do we need to get you safe and healthy?"" And then, from there, we can get them into a Rite of Passage Program where they have apartments or housing with us, we get them job training, we help them finish their high school diplomas, we have Moms and Babies to take care of a lot of these kids who have kids of their own. The goal is to get them on the track to success and get them out into the world.
A lot of people, especially in places like New York or San Francisco, they are judgmental or rude when they see homeless people or disheveled kids on the street. But it makes such a difference to people to just be treated with respect. The Covenant House president, Kevin Ryan, says all the time that the least interesting thing about these kids is that they are homeless. They are remarkable souls, each and every one of them — diamonds that have just been discarded for whatever reason. And this organization takes them, polishes them up and gives them the strength, support and love that they need to discover what their dreams are and do what they want to do.
You have to see the soul and see the whole person, and not just say, ""This is just another statistic,"" feed a kid and wash your hands off them. Everyone is worthy. Everyone matters. They are who they are, and it's a beautiful, wonderful thing. As a society, we need everyone to find out all that they are, and achieve all of that potential that they have.

German official advises Jews to avoid wearing traditional yarmulkes amid rising anti-Semitism,www.nbcnews.com,Linda Givetash,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/german-official-advises-jews-avoid-wearing-traditional-yarmulkes-amid-rising-n1010381,"A German government official has advised Jewish people to avoid wearing yarmulkes in parts of the country amid rising incidents of anti-Semitism. Felix Klein, the commissioner for the fight against anti-Semitism, was Quote: d in an interview with the Funke newspaper group on Saturday as saying that ""my opinion has unfortunately changed compared with what it used to be"" on the matter.
""I cannot recommend to Jews that they wear the skullcap at all times everywhere in Germany,"" Klein said, without elaborating on what places and times might be risky.
Related World World Anti-Semitism is back in the open in Germany Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said Sunday that Klein's statement, which drew mixed reactions in Germany, ""shocked me deeply.""
He added: ""We will never submit, will never lower our gaze and will never react to anti-Semitism with defeatism — and expect and demand our allies act in the same way.""
The skullcap, also called a yarmulke or kippah, is a traditional Jewish head covering. There are around 100,000 Jews in Germany, and the vast majority are relatively secular and don’t outwardly display signs of their faith.
The symbol became the center of public awareness over the current hatred endured by some Jews when an Israeli Arab wore a kippah in Berlin recently as an experiment. Video of the man being subjected to verbal abuse and an attack by a teenage Syrian refugee spread quickly on social media.
The incident prompted several cities around Germany to host marches with participants of all religions wearing the head covering as a sign of solidarity.
But the number of attacks continue to climb. Government statistics released earlier this month showed that the number of anti-Semitic and anti-foreigner incidents rose in Germany last year, despite an overall drop in politically motivated crimes.
Anti-Semitic incidents rose 19.6% to 1,799 from 1,504 in 2017, with 69 classified as acts of violence, the report said. Of the total, 1,603 were committed by far-right perpetrators, while 102 and 52 respectively were listed as crimes committed on “foreign ideological” or “religious ideological” grounds.
At the ballot box, gains by far-right populists have also set off concerns. The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party won more than 5.8 million votes in parliamentary elections in September — or around 13 percent of the ballots cast.

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has also said that ""almost 95 percent of anti-Semitic crimes in 2017 had a right-wing motive.""
On Sunday, the head of the Central Council of Jews told the Die Welt newspaper that a societal shift away from anti-Semitism is needed.
""The aggressive political climate has an effect,"" Josef Schuster said. ""Overall, I am not prone to dramatization, but the situation in general has worsened.""
His comments followed an attack on a Jewish couple in the city of Hemmingen who had the doormat of their home set ablaze and the word ""Jew"" spraypainted in German across the front of the house.
Others were sharply critical of Klein's comment.
Michel Friedman, a former deputy leader of Germany's main Jewish group, said it was an admission of failure and that ""the state must ensure that Jews can show themselves everywhere without fear.""
Bavaria's state interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said that wearing a skullcap is part of religious freedom. ""Everyone can and should wear his skullcap wherever and whenever he wants,"" he said.
Anti-semitism has also reared its head in the United States .
In the aftermath of a second deadly U.S. synagogue shooting in six months, Jewish leaders around the world last month urged a ""wake-up call"" on the threat.

2020 Democrats face 2012 GOP challenges,www.nbcnews.com,Dante Chinni,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/2020-democrats-face-2012-gop-challenges-n1010376,"WASHINGTON - It’s been a month now since Joe Biden announced he was running for president and the Delaware Democrat has been sitting atop the polls since then. The Biden boomlet has come despite conventional wisdom that said the candidates on left of the Democratic Party held all the energy going into 2020. What’s happened to change the dynamic? Some of it may have to do with the situation in which the Democrats find themselves in 2019 . Analysts and the media may be comparing the 2020 race to 2016, but on the Democratic side, it looks more like where the GOP was going into 2012.
Biden’s position vis-a-vis the Democratic field looks very similar to Mitt Romney’s one month after the Utah senator’s 2011 announcement.
Biden's position vis-a-vis the Democratic field looks very similar to Mitt Romney's one month after the Utah senator's 2011 announcement. Both men held double-digit leads over their nearest competitors in a big presidential field. Biden leads by 17 points in the Real Clear Politics polling average over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Eight years ago, Romney led his closest opponent, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, by a little more than 13 points.
And beyond the simple position of the frontrunners, there is the larger environment around the Democrats in 2019 and the Republicans in 2011.
Beyond the simple position of the frontrunners, there is the larger environment around the Democrats in 2019 and the Republicans in 2011. Back in 2011, Republicans were feeling good about their chances in the presidential race. They were going up against an incumbent president, Barack Obama, who was under 50 percent job approval. Their party had just taken back 63 seats in the House of Representatives. And a large number of presidential aspirants were jumping into the campaign pool.
Sound familiar?
In 2019, Democrats are looking at an incumbent who is perpetually under 50 percent job approval in Donald Trump. They are coming off a midterm election where they picked up 40 seats. And their presidential field is bursting at the seams with more than 20 candidates vying for the nomination.
And there is another common thread between the 2019 Democrats and the 2011 Republicans: A deep, intense animosity toward the occupant of the White House.
There is another common thread between the 2019 Democrats and the 2011 Republicans: A deep, intense animosity toward the occupant of the White House. Eight years ago, self-identified Republican primary voters gave Obama very low marks for handling his job as president – 90 percent disapproved, according to a June 2011 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. And they were strongly down on the president personally, 81 percent had negative views of him.
Today’s self-identified Democratic primary voters give Trump similar grades for his time as president, 88 percent disapproved of his job performance in the latest NBC/WSJ poll. And 88 percent of those voters also have negative feelings about the president personally.
That’s a lot of commonalities between 2011 and now.
Eight years ago, that environment and set of views yielded Republican Nominee Mitt Romney, a candidate who didn’t seem as conservative as the party that selected him. Republicans had just experienced the Tea Party revolution and despised the Affordable Care Act that became law under Obama, but party voters selected a former governor of Massachusetts who had implemented the health care plan that was the foundation for the ACA.
Ultimately, the Republicans’ prevailing party ethos in 2012 took a back seat to the desire to win back the White House with the most electable candidate.
Those arguments sound similar to where the Democrats stand today . In many areas – climate change, race relations, criminal justice – the party has moved leftward in recent years and in some ways, Biden seems like a poor fit for those changes. But to many voters, he also seems the most electable.
And if the 2012 patterns hold, the parallels might seem to be good news for team Biden, at least up to a point.
It might be time to start working on that acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in Milwaukee. But remember there’s one big caveat to the good news for Biden: Romney lost the 2012 general election to Obama.

May 26, 2019 11:37 Breaking News Emails May 26, 2019, 1:03 PM UTC By Ben Kamisar WASHINGTON — North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump agree in their criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Sunday during an exclusive interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Speaking from Japan, where she is accompanying the president , Sanders defended Trump for evoking North Korea's criticisms of the Democratic presidential hopeful. And she accused the Obama administration of creating “messes” in places like North Korea that Trump has had to clean up. “I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden,” she said of Trump and Kim. “The president doesn't need somebody else to give him an assessment of Joe Biden. He's given his own assessment a number of times. I think you've seen it. I'm sure you've covered it on your program. The president watched him and his administration with President Obama fail for eight years.” She said Trump has ""cleaned up a lot of the messes that were left behind. We shouldn't even be in the position that we're in to have to deal with North Korea at the level we are if they had done their job in the first place."" ""They failed with Iran, they failed with North Korea, they failed on trade,"" she said, ""And we finally have a president that's being tough with these countries. We've put tougher sanctions on North Korea than the Obama administration ever did. But at the same time the president wants to develop that relationship."" Biden has come under increasing criticism from the president since he announced his candidacy last month. On Saturday, Trump responded to concerns over recent North Korean missile tests , saying he is confident in his relationship with Kim and seeming to support the foreign leader's criticism of Biden. North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019 The North Korean Central News Agency, which is run by the state, has taken an increasingly hostile tone towards Biden in recent days, with rhetoric scaling more hostile as Trump increases his own criticism of his potential 2020 challenger. A report from May 21 pans Biden as “reckless and senseless, seized by ambition for power,” as well as a “fool of low IQ.” Biden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates responded to both the North Koreans and Trump in a statement from earlier this week, arguing “given Vice President Biden's record of standing up for American values and interests, it’s no surprise that North Korea would prefer that Donald Trump remain in the White House."" “As Vice President Biden said in Philadelphia, Donald Trump 'embraces dictators and tyrants like Putin and Kim Jung Un' while alienating our closest allies. That is antithetical to who we are and it has to change,” Bates said. During her Sunday interview, Sanders echoed the president’s statements about North Korea’s recent weapons tests that came months after a February summit between the two leaders ended with no deal . On Saturday, national security adviser John Bolton said that the missile tests were a violation of U.N. resolutions, a statement Trump appeared to downplay in his public tweet. But despite the lack of an agreement to denuclearize the peninsula, Sanders said that good has still come from the attempt to “develop” the relationship between the two countries. “There have been steps that have moved us towards. For a significant period of time there was no missile testing. We got hostages back home to the United States and remains of American war heroes. I don't know how you can say that that's nothing,” she said. ""To me, that is certainly something.

"Once dominated by white hosts, now is an 'exciting time' for Asian American podcasts",www.nbcnews.com,Saleah Blancaflor,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/once-dominated-white-hosts-now-exciting-time-asian-american-podcasts-n1007801,"When Paola Mardo developed her podcast ""Long Distance"" in 2018, she wanted to embody the experience of both Filipinos in the United States and abroad. Born in Los Angeles, Mardo grew up in Manila and Kuala Lumpur and moved back to the United States as a teenager. She related to Filipino Americans who grew up in the United States but also wanted to know more about their roots.
So, episodes of ""Long Distance"" have included the telling of a love story of two high school sweethearts who were separated overseas and reconnected 40 years later, as well as an exploration of Little Manila in California and a closer look at the vandalism at a Filipino community center in Stockton, California.
Mardo said it was important for her to create something for an audience like her. She noted — like most other forms of media like film or television — podcasts have been predominantly white.
""I think that's a typical podcast — white men talking about stuff with each other,"" Mardo said. ""That's it. To me, I think there's room for more""
Related News News 'Racist Sandwich': This podcast wants you to think critically about race and food Mardo isn't alone. In a 2017 article, the Columbia Journalism Review found that the iTunes Top 100 podcast chart was dominated by white hosts though research had showed that nonwhite podcast audiences were growing. In spring of that year, only five shows featured any African American hosts, with the highest-ranked at number 45. The only other ranked show with a nonwhite host was ""Hidden Brain,"" an NPR program hosted by Shankar Vedantam, who is Indian American.
According to a 2018 analysis by Edison Research , 58 percent of podcast listeners were white while 4 percent were of Asian descent. Ten years before, 73 percent were white while 2 percent were Asian.
This January, ""Long Distance"" was selected as one of six shows to be a part of the inaugural Google Podcasts creator program with PRX . More than 6,000 teams submitted applications to the program, which aims to remove barriers to podcasting by putting podcast teams through a bootcamp that includes technical and business training and editorial input, among other elements.
Mardo said that while she's grateful for the opportunity, managing an independent podcast has obstacles tied to not being a part of a radio station or media company.
""It is an exciting time, but it's a challenge,"" Mardo said. ""Now, more than ever, it's so important for independent podcasts to continue.""
Paola Mardo Long Distance Quincy Surasmith, producer for the podcast ""#GoodMuslimBadMuslim"" and host of ""Asian Americana,"" said he has always loved public radio and long-form podcasts such as ""This American Life"" and ""RadioLab,"" but he wanted to do a similar program that focused primarily on Asian American culture and history.
He said he noticed an uptick in independent podcasts in 2015 , following the success and popularity of the crime podcast ""Serial."" That was when Surasmith became more serious about brainstorming ideas for his own narrative podcast, which ultimately became ""Asian Americana"" and featured episodes about the character of Claudia Kishi from ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" and the Asian American magazine Giant Robot.
""I think a lot of my shows focus and are founded in this philosophy that Asian American-ness isn't something that needs to be proved nor is it something that is defined by monolithic culture or prescriptive identity,"" Surasmith said. ""It's not defined by liking boba or being interested in specific YouTube artists, and I wanted to focus it on this idea that Asian American identity is descriptive.""
While he hopes his podcast continues to pave the way for these type of discussions, Surasmith doesn't want to take credit for being the ""first"" of his kind nor does he want his program to take the place of an Asian American studies degree.
""I value — as part of my show's identity and the work I'm doing — that I'm part of a long tapestry of work of Asian American thinking and media,"" he said.
Related APAHM APAHM Write Our Stories: Asian Pacific American History and Heritage Surasmith added that the reason he's so drawn to audio is because there's something intimate about the relationship between the broadcaster and the listener.
""It forces you to listen and to engage the depth I'm trying to convey in these stories that I wouldn't be able to tell in image, text or video,"" Surasmith said.
Similar to Mardo, Surasmith said one of the challenges of running independent podcasts is that he doesn't have access to a big staff.
But groups such as Potluck: An Asian American Podcast Collective are working to create visibility for some of the existing Asian American podcasts. That group's founding members include Surasmith and Marvin Yueh.
Yueh said while he had been an active listener of podcasts for five to six years, his involvement began when he started ""KollabCast,"" a pop culture podcast about Asian American arts and media affiliated with the nonprofit arts groups Kollaboration, in 2015. He was also part of "" Books and Boba ,"" which he created with journalist Reera Yoo after she told Yueh about a discussion she had with a stranger who told her that there weren't any Asian American authors.
Related News News Wikipedia edit-a-thon wants to fill in the gaps in Asian American literature While Yueh said the podcast industry isn't as diverse as it could be, he does feel like it's getting better.
Earlier this year, the Center for Asian American Media announced that it would help launch "" Self Evident,"" a podcast about Asian American stories hosted by writer Cathy Erway. The project raised more than $40,000 in a crowdfunding campaign and has also received foundation funding.
""In the last two years, representation has become a thing, and I think the effect is that there are more people looking to tell their stories,"" Yueh said.
""I want to see more creators take chances on finding and highlighting these stories,"" Yueh added. ""I want to see more Asian Americans, more people of color, more queer and more marginalized voices continue to get their use of this medium to amplify their voices.""

Trump's proposed Memorial Day pardons dishonor veterans — and pervert justice,www.nbcnews.com,Glenn Kirschner,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-proposed-memorial-day-pardons-dishonor-veterans-pervert-justice-ncna1010241,"In May, President Donald Trump pardoned former U.S. Army Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who was convicted of stripping naked, torturing and then executing an unarmed Iraqi man in 2008. We now hear that Trump is considering pardoning other war criminals as some kind of grotesque Memorial Day celebration . While Trump may think such actions honor the sacrifices of our veterans, they actually do a disservice to all law-abiding U.S. soldiers, endanger military members currently serving in hostile environments around the world and send a morally indefensible message to Americans and non-Americans alike. These contemplated pardons represent a degradation — not a celebration — of Memorial Day. These contemplated pardons represent a degradation — not a celebration — of Memorial Day.
Let’s look at some of the men the president is reportedly thinking about pardoning. Navy Seal Edward Gallagher is scheduled to be tried at court-martial in June. He is charged with multiple counts of murder, obstruction of justice and bringing “discredit upon the armed forces.” In one incident, Gallagher is alleged to have used his sniper rifle to shoot and kill an elderly Iraqi man and a school-aged girl , both unarmed and posing no threat to anyone. He’s also charged with murdering a teenage Islamic fighter — who was being held as a military prisoner — by stabbing him to death and then proudly posing with the corpse. Several of Gallagher’s Navy Seal teammates are expected to testify against him.
Want more articles like this? Sign up for the THINK newsletter to get fresh, provocative political analysis delivered weekly Lieutenant Behenna, who Trump has already pardoned, was found guilty of murdering an Iraqi prisoner, Ali Mansur, who was suspected of being involved in a roadside bombing that killed two U.S. soldiers. After military authorities were unable to find enough evidence to connect Mansur to the bombing, Behenna interrogated him again on his own and without permission, ultimately shooting him dead. Behenna claimed that he acted in self-defense, but his conviction was affirmed by military appellate courts. Nevertheless, Trump pardoned Behenna for his war crimes.
Military commanders and prosecutors agonize over whether to charge soldiers because we recognize the sacrifices members of our armed forces make for their country.
As a former career prosecutor, including six years spent as an Army Judge Advocate General (JAG), even the idea of potentially pardoning war criminals sickens me. Our military criminal justice system protects the rights of soldiers accused of crimes as well as, if not better than, many civilian systems. It’s rarely an easy decision to prosecute a soldier, particularly for crimes committed during a time of war or in an hostile environment. But we expect, indeed demand, that our soldiers not commit murder or other atrocities. Indeed, in order to maintain good order, discipline and a cohesive fighting force, soldiers must always act in a law-abiding way — even under the most difficult circumstances.
Military commanders and prosecutors agonize over whether to charge soldiers because we recognize the sacrifices members of our armed forces make for their country, putting their lives on the line to protect our people and our freedoms. When the decision is made to court-martial a soldier, the system takes great pains to ensure that he or she receives excellent legal representation and a fair trial. Enormous time and effort go into investigations, prosecutions and, in the event of conviction, appeals. I know this firsthand, having handled as an Army prosecutor (in both the trial courts and appellate courts) cases involving murder during Operation Just Cause, espionage during Operation Desert Storm and death penalty litigation.
Adm. Stavridis reacts to Trump considering pardons for troops accused of war crimes May 24, 2019 03:17 Besides the military veterans, Trump reportedly is also considering pardons for Blackwater security firm employees convicted of unlawfully killing 14 Iraqi citizens and injuring another 18. That incident occurred on Sept. 16, 2007 and became known as the Nisour Square massacre. The New York Times editorial board described it as “among the most abominable abuses committed by Americans during the Iraqi war.”
Blackwater Security Consulting was a private, for-profit company that provided security in a variety of hostile environments. Blackwater, later rebranded as Academi, is owned by Erik Prince , brother of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.
The Blackwater defendants were U.S. civilians (and military veterans). Among other convicted Blackwater defendants, Trump is contemplating a pardon for Nicholas Slatten. Evidence at trial showed how Slatten called Iraqis “animals” and “less then human.” According to Slatten, Iraqi lives were worth “nothing.” It wasn't just words. On September 16, 2007, 19-year-old Ahmed al-Rubia’y was driving his mother, Dr. Al-Khazali, to a local hospital where she worked as a doctor. As their car approached a Blackwater-run security checkpoint, Slatten opened fire, with no legal justification, killing Ahmed. This unprovoked act by Slatten prompted other Blackwater members to open fire on unarmed Iraqis, killing the 14 and injuring more than a dozen more.
Many of the Blackwater members there on the day of the massacre did not open fire, however. Instead, they testified about the unlawful nature of the shootings. Stating the obvious, it can be extremely difficult for teammates to testify against one another, a barrier for both military and mercenary trials.
Related Opinion Opinion Don Jr.'s subpoena proves Mueller's investigation is far from 'case closed' My former office, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, prosecuted the Blackwater case (I did not work on the case), obtaining convictions and ensuring that the surviving victims and the families of the dead saw some measure of justice. I saw the enormous time, energy and resources that went into that prosecution, efforts that would be swept away by presidential pardons. Pardons would also be horribly disrespectful to the victims and their families and would pervert the justice that so many worked so hard to achieve. It could also inspire hostile feelings abroad, endangering our soldiers serving in countries around the world.
What I know from my time in the military and my experience working inside the military criminal justice system is that the vast majority of service members value the rule of law. Indeed, we fight to protect and preserve the rule of law because without it, there can be no free, orderly, civilized society. Regardless of Trump’s intended goal, pardoning those who commit the most egregious violations of that law does a disservice to our law-abiding troops, to our country and to the victims of these atrocities. It would be, in other words, the absolute worst way to celebrate a holiday dedicated to the men and women who have sacrificed everything so that we can all live happily in a just society.

Here's how to get the best deals on plants and shrubs,www.nbcnews.com,Herb Weisbaum,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/here-s-how-get-best-deals-plants-shrubs-ncna1009476,"Garden centers and nurseries are bursting with color and overflowing with merchandise right now. It’s hard to walk by without buying a few plants. (You can never have enough, right?) If you’re making a significant purchase, especially for expensive shrubs and trees, take the time to shop around.
A recent survey by Checkbook.org — published by the Center for the Study of Services, an independent, nonprofit consumer organization — shows that price and quality vary greatly from place to place.
Checkbook surveyed prices for 27 different plants at big garden centers, hardware stores and nurseries in and around seven cities: Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.
""Our undercover shoppers found big price differences at the local garden centers we surveyed,” said Kevin Brasler, Checkbook’s executive editor. “Some charged five times more than the lowest-priced stores for the same size and type of plants.”
A few examples:
Lavender (#1 container/6” pot) ranged from $4.99 to $15.99 around the Puget Sound False cypress (#3 container) ranged from $12.98 to $57.50 in Boston Boxwood (#3 container) ranged from $12.49 to $69.50 around the Delaware Valley The big guys have the best prices, but what about quality? If you want to pay the lowest possible price for your plants, shop at one of the big chains. The Home Depot (29 percent lower than average) and Lowe’s (26 percent below average) had the best prices in all seven cities Checkbook surveyed. While none of the independents surveyed beat The Home Depot or Lowe’s for price, they did score significantly higher on quality.
“The Home Depot and Lowe’s got really lousy ratings from the customers we surveyed for their overall quality,” Brasler said.
Here are the average quality scores (out of 100) from customers Checkbook surveyed in the seven cities:
Quality of the products
The Home Depot: 38 percent Lowe’s: 44 percent Independent stores: 83 percent Advice
The Home Depot: 25 percent Lowe’s: 32 percent Independent stores: 77 percent Overall quality
The Home Depot: 33 percent Lowe’s: 39 percent Independent stores: 78 percent “This is one of the few topics we cover at Checkbook where there’s actually a relationship between what you pay and what you get,” Brasler told me. “Stores that offer really high-quality plants and great advice tend to charge higher prices.”
NBC News BETTER contacted The Home Depot and Lowe’s. Lowe’s did not respond.
The Home Depot said it “strives to give our customers the best value and convenience.” In its statement, the company said it is “pleased to see customers are coming to us for the best price and product selection.”
I think a lot of gardeners are like me — we shop at more than once place. If I just need some annuals for the back deck, I go to one of the big box stores to get the best price.
On the other hand, if I’m looking for an expensive tree or shrub that I expect to grow for years and years, I head to the local nursery. I know I’ll pay more, but the plants are top quality and the advice I get is invaluable.
Related Good Eats Good Eats 100+ summer recipes for Memorial Day weekend and beyond Those plants may come with a guarantee Some stores guarantee their plants. If something goes wrong within a reasonable amount of time, you may be able to get a refund or replacement. At Lowe’s and The Home Depot, perennials, trees and shrubs come with a 1-year guarantee, so save your receipts.
So, when you go plant shopping, especially if you’re buying something expensive, check the guarantee and find out what you need to do to keep that guarantee in force — there may be caveats. At a smaller store or nursery, see if you can get that guarantee in writing.
Stores that offer really high-quality plants and great advice tend to charge higher prices.
Kevin Brasler, executive editor, Checkbook.org
A few shopping tips Make sure the plants you’re taking home are in good condition. Healthy plants will live longer and look better.
So what should you look for?
Check the leaves: Look for signs of disease, such as brown or grayed areas or spots on the leaves or stems. According to HGTV , you want leaves that look “vigorous and perky, with strong color, and show no signs of mildew, black spots or extensive insect damage,” Check the soil: It should be moist. If it’s dried out and rock hard, move along. Check the drainage holes: Look at the bottom of the plant container. Excess white residue indicates over-fertilization. Before you leave, ask for instructions on planting and proper care.

"At San Quentin, LGBTQ prisoners and once-biased inmates try to heal together",www.nbcnews.com,Kate Sosin,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/san-quentin-lgbtq-prisoners-once-biased-inmates-try-heal-together-n1010026,"Ten years ago, Rafeal “Nephew” Bankston landed in solitary confinement in San Quentin State Prison for refusing a gay cellmate. “Where I grew up, we called it gay bashing,” he said. “We hated them, robbed them,” Bankston added matter-of-factly.
On a Wednesday afternoon in April, he told that story to a classroom of 15 other inmates. About half of them were LGBTQ. Photos of LGBTQ icons — Janet Mock, Ellen Degeneres, James Baldwin — smiled down from a whiteboard at the front of the room.
Rafeal ""Nephew"" Bankston is an inmate at San Quentin State Prison. Kate Sosin No one said a word. Lisa Strawn, 60, a transgender woman, was sitting next to Bankston and didn't move.
Bankston, 37, was smaller than most of the others in the room. He wore plastic-frame glasses and a blue prison shirt that looked several sizes too big. Like many in the room, he has spent more than half of his life behind bars. He entered prison at 18 and said he learned at a young age to hate gay and trans people.
Half a life later, he wants to talk about Jussie Smollett. He wants to know how his LGBTQ peers feel about Smollett now that the TV star’s reported anti-gay hate crime has been refuted by Chicago Police.
 Georgia nonprofit is helping trans people adjust to life after prison “When we walked out of here, here, everybody was pulling for him because it was wrong, how he got treated,” Bankston said. “Do you all still feel that way?”
He posed the question to members of Acting With Compassion & Truth , or ACT, a restorative justice group that meets weekly at San Quentin. Restorative justice is an alternative to punishment, one in which offenders and victims try to heal together.
'I didn’t know where I fit in' Each week for a year, LGBTQ and straight inmates meet for two hours in a small yellow classroom. They talk about everything from what it means that Janelle Monáe came out as pansexual to how to respect intersex people. Their goal is simple: heal together and work toward a better world for LGBTQ people.
Inmates Michael Adams and Juan Meza currently lead the group. The lessons have been designed by LGBTQ prisoners.
The group is as diverse as the world on the outside. Ages range from 25 years to late middle age, and races and ethnicities vary. Almost all of the attendees are what are referred to as “lifers,” those convicted of felonies so serious that their sentences range from many years to life in prison. These include murder and sex crimes.
Three of the group’s attendees are transgender women. Lisa Strawn is among them.
Lisa Strawn is a transgender inmate at San Quentin State Prison. Kate Sosin Strawn, who prefers no pronouns, entered prison 25 years ago on three-strikes burglary charges and has served much of that time at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, another men’s prison. Strawn transitioned to female at age 18 but has always been housed with men.
That’s because in most prisons across the nation, transgender inmates are housed according to their birth sex, despite federal requirements in the Prison Rape Elimination Act that inmates be housed on a case-by-case basis.
Strawn has grown accustomed to navigating men’s prisons as a woman.
San Quentin is California’s oldest prison, built in 1851 by prisoners at the edge of the San Francisco Bay in Marin County. The views from the entrance are so heavenly it is often remarked that it’s astonishing the prison has not been flattened and divided up for real estate.
San Quentin State Prison overlooks the San Francisco Bay. Kate Sosin The 600-man cell block looms at six levels. There is no air-conditioning in the unit, and fans run in the background. Cells are just wide enough to stand in sideways. They house two people each and the sum of their possessions, crammed into cubbies above bunks. At one end of the cell block, men make calls from a line of pay phones. At the other end, they shower out in the open.
With a blond ponytail and carefully-applied eyeliner, Strawn decidedly stands out at San Quentin.
“Honestly, I’ve had problems, but then I guess myself personally, I think a lot of it is how you carry yourself,” Strawn said. “Every time I walk into a room I better own it.”
San Quentin State Prison Kate Sosin At Vacaville, Strawn helped establish an LGBTQ group. Leaving that a year ago to come to San Quentin was devastating.
“I hated this place when I got here,” Strawn said. “I didn’t know where I fit in, and I knew where I fit in there. But when I came here, I got into ACT."" Aside from the restorative justice group, Strawn also got into journalism by writing for the San Quentin news outlet, The Beat Within.
Transgender women like Strawn report exceedingly high rates of violence behind bars, according to data from the National Center for Transgender Equality. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that transgender people were nine times more likely than the general prison population to be sexually assaulted by other inmates.
Trans Inmate Holly Stuckey participates in San Quentin's restorative justice group. Kate Sosin It was due to that hostility that trans women approached the Insight Prison Project in 2015, where Billie Mizell was then serving as executive director. Inmates asked Mizell to support the formation of an LGBTQ education program at San Quentin. They didn’t want a support group.
“What I kept hearing from them was, ‘We live our lives here every day surrounded by thousands of people who have been for the last 20 or 30 years who haven’t had exposure to the evolution that we know is happening out there,’” Mizell explained, noting that the transgender inmates wanted to ""bring that inside"" the prison's walls.
Working with several inmates, Mizell brought a yearlong curriculum to the prison. She has been leading the Acting With Compassion & Truth group as a volunteer at San Quentin ever since.
Billie Mizell leads San Quentin State Prison's Acting With Compassion and Truth group, a restorative justice program. Kate Sosin This year, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation allowed her to replicate the program on San Quentin’s death row, which remains intact despite California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recent decision to halt executions . That group, comprised of five people, meets Tuesdays. It is not open to reporters.
ACT is entirely voluntary, although many admittedly come to the Wednesday class because it looks good for the parole board. Mizell, however, won’t let anyone in who is not genuinely committed to the lessons.
Still, the resulting class presents a strange juxtaposition. Prisoners, some convicted of extreme anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, spend a year in close proximity with the prison’s most vulnerable LGBTQ population.
'I was so ashamed' Among the group’s founding members is Phil Melendez, who faced 30 years to life in prison for two counts of second-degree murder, partially motivated by animus against a lesbian.
In 1997, Melendez’s father was stabbed while collecting a drug debt. Melendez justified avenging the assault because one of the assailants was a lesbian. On a phone call with NBC News, Melendez, who has since been released from prison, rattles off the slurs he used as he burst into a house and killed two people.
In prison, Melendez said he had a lot of time to think, not just about the crime he committed at 19, but about the homophobia behind it.
“I noticed that there was that element of LGBTQ bias in the slur that I used,” he said. “In that slur, I was actually dehumanizing a human being.”
 Trump administration rolls back Obama-era health care protections for transgender people When the country debated marriage rights for LGBTQ people, he said found himself frustrated.
“I actually took offense at people who were against gay marriage,” he said.
So in 2015, when ACT started forming, Melendez took his own life experiences and used them to help design a curriculum for other straight peers in the class. Two years ago, Melendez was released. He is now a national advocate for restorative justice and LGBTQ rights.
Among those who benefit four years later from his work inside are attendees like Lee Xiong, who was struggling to face his younger brother who he suspected was gay. Trying to grapple with that, Xiong found ACT last year.
“I always thought that transgender or gay were nothing,” he says. “I thought it was a choice.”
Lee Xiong, center, participating in San Quentin's restorative justice group. Kate Sosin Xiong has spent more than a year unpacking those feelings. When his brother came to visit him at San Quentin, Xiong asked his brother to come out to him. It took him five minutes to even reach the question.
“I was so ashamed,” he tells the group. “I asked him that question. Is he going to get hurt? Or is he in fear to tell me? But he just came out and said, ‘Yes man, I know what you’re going to ask me.’”
His brother told him that when he came out to their parents, they told him to “get the f--k out” and disowned him.
“I told him that, “You know what, don't worry man, when I get out, we’ll talk to my mom,’” Xiong said.
This story, of straight prisoners connecting with LGBTQ family because of their time in ACT, is highly common. Bankston’s sister came out to him as transgender.
“I cut off communication,” Bankston said. “I don’t want to talk to you more. I don’t know what to say to you. Nobody likes you.”
 New York Yankees announce LGBT scholarship recipients at historic Stonewall Inn But Bankston recently picked up the phone and called his sister. He asked how she was.
“He, excuse me, she ran with the whole rest of the conversation,” Bankston said, correcting himself on his sister’s new pronoun.
“It's going to take some time and to adjust to my sister's new lifestyle,” he explained. “I got some struggles with that. I'm not perfect.”
In May, Bankston’s sister agreed to come visit him at San Quentin for the first time since he entered prison 17 years ago.
The planned visit was a moment for the group to reflect on how far Bankston had come, according to Mizell. When he entered ACT, he was looking for a “chrono,” or a positive write-up to help his parole case. “And now I am out here being an ally, raising awareness and answering questions,” he said.
'I was able to be authentically me' Straight prisoners aren’t untangling their homophobia and earning parole at the expense of LGBTQ inmates in the group. For those who are LGBTQ, the group can be deeply healing.
“There was a time I would be deathly afraid of someone like Nephew,” 52-year-old Adams, tears pushing at his eyes, said of Bankston.
“This group is the first time I was able to talk about my lived experiences, as related to being a member of the LGBTQ community,” Adams said. “It was the first time I was able to be authentically me and also feel safe. That’s a profound feeling of humanity.”
 'I'm gay': Mormon Republican lawmaker in Utah comes out Adams, who has been incarcerated for 19 years, struggled for years before coming out as bisexual publicly on San Quentin’s podcast, Ear Hustle , last June.
He noted that not a single man in ACT identifies as gay. “In here, it’s life or death,” he said of coming out.
The group aims to ease some of those challenges by adding to the number of allies on the inside.
In order to build this empathy, Meza tries to draws parallels between straight inmates and their LGBTQ peers.
Juan Meza uses ""The Genderbread Person"" as a learning tool during a session of San Quentin's Acting With Compassion and Truth group. Kate Sosin He shows the class “The Genderbread Person,” a visual tool for talking about gender identity that resembles a Gingerbread man. He draws kind of a stick figure on the whiteboard. The group labels the person by distinguishing where different LGBTQ identities live: Anatomy is on your body; gender and sexual orientation are in your heart and brain.
“My culture would say that I'm a 'two spirit,' because I have the spirit of the masculine and the feminine at the same time,” Meza explained. “So it just really has to do with how I express myself and how I know myself.”
The group is then asked to rattle off words used to hurt marginalized groups: racist terms, sexist words, anti-LGBTQ slurs and hurtful terms for the incarcerated. Adams and Meza drew lines between the groups of terms, noting that insults hurled against prisoners, like “punk,” are also used to hurt LGBTQ people.
“Intersectionality,” Nythell Collins, 43, pointed out.
Nythell Collins is an inmate at San Quentin. Kate Sosin Meza noted that using the wrong pronouns for a transgender person can be just as harmful as a slur.
“We've said it many times, when we can't express ourselves for who we are … a lot of the community ends up killing themselves,” Meza warned.
Class in April goes well over the allotted two-hour time. Egypt Senoj Jones, 25, a transgender, sings a song she composed herself, called “I Know.” She stands in the center of the arranged tables, her arms outstretched, tilts her head up toward the low ceiling vents and closes her eyes.
“I know what I gotta do,” she sang. “Now that I know the truth, there is no excuse.”
She sang about growing up in foster care, transitioning to female, dropping out of college and popping pills. She is snapping her fingers. By the end, the whole group is singing the chorus with her. She finishes and they erupt into applause.
Outside in the yard, Strawn poses for the camera in the sinking sunlight. Strawn beams in a movie-like pose, sunglasses glinting against the glare.
“This is how we do it at San Quentin,” Strawn said playfully.

Sarah Sanders defends Attorney General Barr's investigation into origins of Russia probe - NBC News,www.nbcnews.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/sarah-sanders-defends-attorney-general-barr-s-new-investigation-origins-n1010401,"Attorney General William Barr's investigation into the origins of the years-long probe into whether 's campaign conspired with Russia in 2016 took center stage Sunday as White House press secretary Sarah Sanders seemed to suggest there was only one possible outcome from it — the one the president seeks. Speaking with NBC's Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press,"" Sanders was pressed on whether Trump would accept the results of the investigation if Barr were to exonerate many of the F.B.I. and intelligence officials that have come under Trump's wrath for their role in the Russia probe.
“We already know that there was an outrageous amount of corruption that took place at the F.B.I. They leaked information. They lied. They were specifically working trying to take down the president, trying to hurt the president,"" Sanders said. ""We'll leave the final call up to the attorney general and he'll get to the bottom of it. But we think Americans deserve the truth. The president's asked for that. And we should expect nothing less.""
Todd noted that Sanders' answer ""sounds like the president has already determined the outcome,"" adding that it did not sound like the White House wants Barr ""to do his job.""
Despite 'treason' tweet, Trump hasn't made judgment call on Barr investigation May 26, 2019 02:43 “Chuck, that's the reason that he's granted the attorney general the authority to declassify that information, to look at all the documents necessary, is so that we can get to the very bottom of what happened,"" Sanders responded. ""Once again, we already know about some wrongdoing. The president's not wrong in that. But he wants to know everything that happened and how far and how wide it went.”
Asked if Trump expects former F.B.I. Director James Comey to be arrested, as the president has accused Comey of treason , Sanders said: ""The people that were responsible and that were part of this unprecedented obstruction and corruption at the F.B.I., those people should certainly be held responsible"" and Trump ""expects that to take place.""
Late last week , Trump ordered the U.S. intelligence community to ""quickly and fully"" cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation — his highest profile call to investigate those who were involved with the early stages of the Russia probe. The president also gave Barr the authority to unilaterally declassify information related to the investigation.
Last month, Barr said he would probe the “genesis and conduct” of the Russia investigation, weeks later appointing U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine just that.
Related Politics Politics Trump turns the full force of the government on perceived political enemies The move comes weeks after special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his 400-plus page report to Barr. Though Mueller did not file criminal charges against the president or any associates for conspiring with Russians, his report detailed extensive contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians — including a willingness by some to accept their help — and detailed Russia's efforts at interfering in the 2016 presidential election.
A number of top Trump campaign aides and longtime Trump associates were charged, convicted, or pleaded guilty as a result of Mueller's investigation. Among those were former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and former longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen.
As part of the Justice Department's investigation, Barr has the ""full and complete authority"" to declassify documents relating to the Russia probe, as Sanders detailed in a statement last week.
Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed they were spied on during the 2016 campaign. Intelligence officials have pushed back on that allegation, saying they acted lawfully.
“We’re not compromising national security here,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We’re trying to create a system to make sure this never happens again.""
Also on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said that although the numerous contacts between Trump officials and Russians ""may not have amounted to conspiracy,"" he doesn't believe ""anyone can look at those 200 pages of contacts between the Trump team had with the Russians and say, 'Oh we want this to happen again in 2020.'""
Swalwell, a Democratic presidential candidate who sits on the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, called Trump's order to the intelligence community was ""an abuse,"" noting that the Justice Department's inspector general was already probing the issue.
""For the president of the United States to instruct his attorney general to do that, it looks like he's using the attorney general to be his personal lawyer rather than having the attorney general look at whether there are still ongoing threats to our country,"" he said.
On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said ""the American people have to find out what went on"" regarding the launch of the Russia investigation.
""But, at some point,"" she continued, ""we need to move on from this issue.""

"Bart Starr, legendary Green Bay Packers quarterback, dies at 85",www.nbcnews.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/obituaries/bart-starr-legendary-green-bay-packers-quarterback-dies-85-n1010426,"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Bart Starr, the gentlemanly quarterback and catalyst of Vince Lombardi's powerhouse Green Bay Packers teams of the 1960s whose sneak won the famed ""Ice Bowl"" in 1967, died Sunday. He was 85. The Packers selected Starr out of the University of Alabama with the 200th pick in the 1956 draft. He led Green Bay to six division titles, five NFL championships and wins in the first two Super Bowls.
The Packers said Starr died in Birmingham, Alabama, where he lived. He had been in failing health since suffering two strokes and a heart attack in 2014.
Green Bay Packers super star quarterback BART STARR passing during first quarter of the 1968 Super Bowl. Sporting News Archive / Sporting News via Getty Images ""A champion on and off the field, Bart epitomized class and was beloved by generations of Packers fans,"" Packers President Mark Murphy said in a statement. ""A clutch player who led his team to five NFL titles, Bart could still fill Lambeau Field with electricity decades later during his many visits.""
Until Brett Favre came along, Starr was known as the best Packer ever. The team retired his No. 15 jersey in 1973, making him just the third player to receive that honor. Four years later, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.
After losing the 1960 NFL title game in his first playoff appearance, the Packers never lost another playoff game under Starr, going 9-0, including wins over the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders in the first two Super Bowls.
Starr's college career wasn't very noteworthy and it wasn't until Lombardi's arrival in Green Bay in 1959 that Starr, living by his motto ""desire and dedication are everything,"" began to blossom.
Lombardi liked Starr's mechanics, his arm strength and especially his decision-making abilities. Under Lombardi's nurturing, Starr became one of the league's top quarterbacks.
""If you work harder than somebody else, chances are you'll beat him though he has more talent than you,"" Starr once said. He credited Lombardi for showing him ""that by working hard and using my mind, I could overcome my weakness to the point where I could be one of the best.""
The gentlemanly quarterback's status as a Packers icon was tested by his struggles as the team's head coach. In nine seasons from 1975-83, he won just 41 percent of his games, going 53-77-3, including 1-1 in the playoffs, part of three decades of futility that followed the glory years.
After football, Starr, became a successful businessman in Birmingham, Alabama, not far from his hometown of Montgomery, where he was born on Jan. 9, 1934.
Starr was a four-time Pro Bowl selection and two-time All-Pro. He won NFL titles in 1961, '62, '65, '67 and '68. He was the 1966 NFL MVP and was named to the 1960s All-Decade team. He also was named MVP of the first two Super Bowls.
But the play he was most famous for was a run.
In the NFL championship on Dec. 31, 1967, Starr knifed into the end zone behind guard Jerry Kramer and center Ken Bowman with 16 seconds left to lift the Packers over the Dallas Cowboys 21-17 in what became known as the ""Ice Bowl.""
The Packers had spent $80,000 for a heating coil system that was to have kept the field soft and warm, and forecasters said not to worry because the approaching cold front wouldn't arrive until after the game.
""It was 20 degrees the day before,"" the late Tom Landry once recalled. ""It was great. Vince and I were together that night and we talked about how good the conditions were and what a great game it would be.""
They were half-right. When the grounds crew rolled up the tarpaulin, a layer of condensation had formed underneath and, with 40 mph wind, the field promptly froze like an ice rink. Packers running back Chuck Mercein would later compare the ground to ""jagged concrete.""
With a temperature of minus-14 and a wind chill of minus-49, it was the coldest NFL game ever recorded. The wind chill had dipped another 20 degrees by the time the Packers got the ball at their 32 trailing 17-14 with five minutes left.
With one last chance for an aging dynasty to win a fifth NFL title in seven seasons, Starr took the field as linebacker Ray Nitschke hollered, ""Don't let me down!""
Starr wouldn't, completing all five of his passes and directing one of the most memorable drives in NFL history.
""We all have a capacity to focus and to concentrate to a unique degree when we're called upon to do it,"" Starr said on the 30th anniversary of that game. ""That's exactly what I did that day. And I think the same was true of the Cowboys. Let's face it, they obviously were not accustomed to something like that and yet they were the team which had surged and come back in the second half and were in a position to win it.""
With 1:11 remaining, tackle Bob Skoronski opened a hole and Mercein charged through the middle for 8 yards to the Dallas 3.
Halfback Donny Anderson slipped twice on handoffs, so Starr called timeout, went to the sideline and suggested a sneak because of the poor traction.
""Then run it and let's get the hell out of here,"" Lombardi barked.
The play worked perfectly, a flawless finish to that coldest of games so frozen in time.
""I've never been in a huddle where there was greater composure and where there was a higher level of intensity and concentration,"" Mercein once told The Associated Press.
Mercein is the one in the famous photograph of the play diving into the end zone behind Starr with his hands held high, as though he's signaling ""Touchdown!""
""But what I'm actually doing is I'm showing the officials that I'm not assisting or aiding Bart into the end zone,"" Mercein said.
That would have been a penalty and it would have negated history's most famous quarterback sneak.
Mercein and the rest of his teammates thought he was going to get the handoff on the play. Nobody knew but Starr and Lombardi that it was to be a quarterback sneak. So, Mercein dug in, thinking he was getting the ball, and he got a great takeoff on the frozen field.
""As a matter of fact too good because after a couple of steps I realized I wasn't going to get the ball. But I couldn't really pull up because it was so icy,"" Mercein said. ""So that's why I dive over the play and I have my arms upraised, which appears to everyone in that famous picture that I'm signaling touchdown.""
Two weeks later in sunny Miami, the Packers defeated the AFL champion Raiders 33-14 in Lombardi's final game as head coach of the Packers.
When Starr retired following the 1971 season, his career completion percentage of 57.4 was tops in the run-heavy NFL, and his passer rating of 80.5 was second-best ever, behind only Otto Graham.
Starr replaced Dan Devine as Packers head coach in 1975 and would be replaced himself by former teammate Forrest Gregg in 1984 after failing to lead the franchise to the kind of success he did as a player.
In 1965, Starr and his wife, Cherry, helped co-found Rawhide Boys Ranch in New London, Wisconsin, a facility designed to help at-risk and troubled boys throughout the state.
The couple dealt with tragedy in 1988 when their son Brett died at 24 due to complications from cocaine addiction. They also had another son, Bart Jr.
""While he may always be best known for his success as the Packers quarterback for 16 years, his true legacy will always be the respectful manner in which he treated every person he met, his humble demeanor and his generous spirit,"" Starr's family said in a statement.
""His love for all of humanity is well known, and his affection toward the residents of Alabama and of Wisconsin filled him with gratitude. He had hoped to make one last trip to Green Bay to watch the Packers this fall, but he shall forever be there in spirit.""
Starr has an NFL award named after him, given annually to a player of outstanding character.

Donated organs to stay close to major transplant centers,www.nbcnews.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/donated-organs-stay-close-major-transplant-centers-n1009371,"The United Network for Organ Sharing, a group that decides which patients receive life-saving organ transplants in the United States, has reinstated a policy that gives transplant centers first dibs on donated livers in their communities. The decision comes amid a long and winding legal battle involving that group, which is a nonprofit organization that's under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, patients and major transplant centers.
At issue: There are far more people on the waiting lists for organs than there are organs available for donation. About 13,250 are on the list to receive a liver , according to UNOS. But in 2018, just 8,250 livers were transplanted.
Historically, transplant centers received organs donated in their surrounding communities. But opponents of that policy said that it wasn't favorable to areas with higher demand and less supply . Patients in New York filed a lawsuit claiming UNOS's policy left them waiting longer for the liver donations they desperately needed, while people with less-severe diseases were receiving livers in other parts of the country.
Controversial change in liver donation rules highlights transplant challenges May 26, 2019 02:09 In response, the group adopted a new policy, expanding the area in which a liver could be donated to 500 nautical miles from the donor. But some transplant centers balked at the new policy.
""In fact what happens is, more people die,"" said Dr. Seth Karp, director of the transplant center at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Karp explained that traveling farther for a liver can lead to poor outcomes. He says his transplant team aims to get a liver within six to 10 hours, and every additional hour on top of that starts to compromise the quality of the liver.
""Getting the organs from one place to another is not trivial, it's hard to do,"" Karp said. ""It takes time, it takes resources and the complexity that that adds leads to increased discarded organs.""
A son gives the ultimate Mother's Day gift: A life-saving organ transplant May 12, 2019 01:31 When UNOS announced its new policy, some transplant centers, including those in Georgia, Kansas, Michigan and Missouri, sued.
But last week, a federal court judge ordered that the policy be halted, and the group said it would reinstate the original distribution policy.
On Thursday, UNOS posted a message on its website stating that liver transplants would continue uninterrupted: ""UNOS wants to reassure the donation and transplant community that despite the legal proceedings underway, donated livers continue to be allocated to patients on the waiting list; there is no disruption to this important work.""
The group still aims to implement some kind of new policy to expand access to organs. ""It's easier to transplant the organs than it once was,"" Brian Shepard, CEO of UNOS, told NBC News. ""We think the system should take advantage of that and transplant candidates who are the sickest, regardless of where they live.""
Meanwhile, thousands of people in need of a new liver continue to wait. Tamsin Skeels, 48, of Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of them.
Skeels, who has end-stage liver failure , is on the list to receive a liver at the Duke Transplant Center, just a two and a half hour drive away. She was an alternate once for a donated liver, but did not receive it.
Despite her condition, Skeels expressed only gratitude. ""That first recipient was first for a reason. It was somebody who needed it as much as I did, even more so,"" she told NBC News.
While UNOS and transplant centers try to work out the best methods of distributing organs, Karp says efforts to increase organ donation in general would make a significant impact.
""In Tennessee, we have one of the best organ donation infrastructures in the country,"" Karp said. ""If a place like New York improved its donation just to what Philadelphia does, it could get another 1,000 to 1,500 organs.""

Meek Mill blasts Las Vegas hotel as 'racist' for banning him 'without incident',www.nbcnews.com,Janelle Griffith,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/meek-mill-blasts-las-vegas-hotel-racist-banning-him-without-n1010391,"Rapper Meek Mill on Saturday accused the Cosmopolitan Hotel of being racist for denying him entry to the Las Vegas property and threatening to have him arrested for trespassing. https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx5z723A45V
A video of his exchange with security personnel at the hotel posted on his Instagram account had more than a million views as of Sunday morning.
In it, the musician, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, is seated in a vehicle outside the hotel and can be heard asking two men, ""How can you tell me I'll be locked up for trespassing?""
One of the men responded, ""We're a private property. At this time, with the information we have, we're refusing to do business with you. We have the right to do that.""
Meek continued to question him, ""You're telling me I'll be arrested if I don't leave. If I walk upstairs to get something to eat, I'm going to be arrested? For what? For being a rapper?""
The man then said the hotel has ""officially trespassed you.""
Mill asked again, ""For what though? But what did you trespass me for?""
The man repeated, ""We have a right to do that.""
Mill's publicist told NBC News he was at the hotel to support DJ Mustard, who has a residency at Marquee Nightclub, and that he never got out of the car or entered the hotel.
Mill said the Cosmopolitan Hotel and others in Las Vegas employ these tactics against black entertainers, specifically, telling them they are banned ""without incident,"" ""because they don’t want too many blacks"" on their properties.
""This happens to a lot of black entertainers not just me either,"" Miill said on Instagram. ""I felt crazy being put out by these white men for no reason!""
The Cosmopolitan Hotel said in a statement, ""As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on legal matters. Our guests' safety and security always remains our top priority.""
Mill’s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, provided NBC a copy of a letter he sent Saturday to Anthony Pearl, general counsel and chief compliance officer for the Cosmopolitan Hotel, in which he accuses the hotel of discrimination.
""It has come to our attention that your hotel, through its security personnel, brazenly denied access to Mr. Williams without just cause,"" the letter said. ""In fact, the incident of exclusion was captured on a recording. And, evidenced thereby, despite inquiring as to the reason for his denied access, Mr. Williams was offered no explanation whatsoever.""
Tacopina also said that ""the Cosmopolitan maintains a list of African American recording artists who should be denied access for no other reason than their culture and skin color,"" which, he said, constitutes discrimination and exposes the hotel to ""significant monetary damages.""
Tacopina threatened legal action unless the Cosmopolitan Hotel ""promptly"" apologized and granted Mill access. On Sunday, Tacopina told NBC News the time for that apology ""has expired"" and he plans to file a complaint within the next week or so.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg rips Trump for possible pardons of war criminals,www.nbcnews.com,Allan Smith,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mayor-pete-buttigieg-rips-trump-possible-pardons-war-criminals-n1010406,"Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg ripped for considering whether to pardon convicted and alleged war criminals. In an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" that aired Sunday, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is also an Afghanistan War veteran, said ""one of the things that protects our troops morally and physically is the knowledge that if anybody in uniform does commit a crime, they will be held accountable by military justice.""
“For a president, especially a president who never served, to say he’s going to come in and overrule that system of military justice undermines the very foundations, legal and moral, of this country,"" he added.
On Friday, amid reports that Trump could issue such pardons over Memorial Day weekend, the president told reporters at the White House that he hasn't ""made any decisions yet.""
""There’s two or three of them right now,"" he said. ""It’s a little bit controversial. It’s very possible that I’ll let the trials go on, and I’ll make my decision after the trial.""
""Some of these soldiers are people that have fought hard and long,"" Trump added. ""You know, we teach them how to be great fighters, and then when they fight, sometimes they get really treated very unfairly.""
Buttigieg lambasted the latter remark, saying: ""The idea that being sent to war turns you into a murderer is exactly the kind of thing that those of us who have served have been trying to beat back for more than a generation.""
""Frankly, [Trump’s] idea that being sent to fight makes you automatically into some sort of war criminal is a slander against veterans that could only come from someone who never served,"" he added.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had requested the necessary paperwork to pardon a series of accused or convicted war criminals — possibly as soon as Memorial Day weekend. Those accused or convicted war criminals were involved in shooting unarmed civilians or killing prisoners. The best known of those cases is that or Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who is set to stand trial on charges or murdering an Iraqi prisoner and shooting multiple unarmed civilians. That news came after Trump this month pardoned Michael Behenna, a soldier who was convicted in 2009 of killing an Iraqi prisoner.
Last week, The Daily Beast reported that ""Fox and Friends"" co-host Pete Hegseth, a veteran and informal Trump adviser, has been privately lobbying Trump for months to issue those pardons.
The potential pardons were a subject across the Sunday political talk shows. On ABC's ""This Week,"" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., side-stepped a question on the pardons, saying it was up to the president ""to make a decision"" on whether or not he would issue them.
""We'll see what happens,"" Cheney said, adding that Trump ""has absolute power to pardon and I will watch and see how he exercises that.""
On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, expressed a stronger take on the possibility, saying Trump needs ""to be very careful"" regarding such pardons.
""But I would say that, if our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, if they are accused and found guilty of war crimes, we need to be very careful in that, because it is not OK to perpetrate war crimes,"" she said. ""It is not OK.""
Ernst, an Iraq War veteran, added that ""we need our young men and women in uniform to understand that we operate under a code of ethics.""
""Even though they may serve in armed services, they still are human beings,"" she said. ""And we do have a code that we have to operate under. So, I would just advise the president to be very careful, scrutinize, of course, each case individually, and, if it's warranted, grant a pardon. If it is not, and someone has committed a war crime, then a sentence should be served.""

Jens Schlueter / Getty Images file Breaking News Emails May 26, 2019, 7:08 PM UTC / Updated May 28, 2019, 8:19 PM UTC / Source: Variety LOS ANGELES - Top global gaming organizations are asking the World Health Organization to reverse its inclusion of ""gaming disorder"" as a disease, according to a press release sent by the Entertainment Software Association on Saturday. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially recognized gaming disorder over the weekend as a part of its 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). This was a decision the industry was awaiting since the WHO detailed its intentions last summer. Now, in an effort which includes the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), several organizations have released a statement which states that ""gaming disorder"" needs more evidence before it can be included in such a classification. The organizations behind the effort include the ESA as well as the Entertainment Software Association of Canada, the Interactive Games & Entertainment Association, the Interactive Software Federation of Europe, and the Korea Association of Game Industry (K-GAMES). ""The global video game industry--including representatives from across Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, South Africa, and Brazil--today called on World Health Organization (WHO) Member States to re-examine at an early date its decision to include 'Gaming Disorder' in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11),"" the organizations stated in a collective quote in a press release. ""The WHO is an esteemed organization and its guidance needs to be based on regular, inclusive, and transparent reviews backed by independent experts. 'Gaming disorder' is not based on sufficiently robust evidence to justify its inclusion in one of the WHO's most important norm-setting tools."""

SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:
And we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.
CHUCK TODD:
The president walks out of a meeting with Democratic leaders.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
I walk in to look at people that have just said that I was doing a cover-up. I don't do cover-ups.
CHUCK TODD:
Then promises no legislating as long as Democrats are investigating and turns on Pelosi.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
Crazy Nancy. She's not the same person. She's lost it.
CHUCK TODD:
What are the chances of getting anything done now? Plus the Democrats’ impeachment debate. While a growing number say the time is now.
REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY:
You know, I believe we have no other choice.
CHUCK TODD:
Speaker Pelosi says investigations must come first.
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:
It may take us to a place that is unavoidable in terms of impeachment or not. But we're not at that place yet.
CHUCK TODD:
My guests this morning White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and two Democrats on opposite sides of the impeachment debate. Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Plus President Trump orders a review of the Russia investigation.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
I declassified everything. Everything they want.
CHUCK TODD:
The growing concern over politicizing intelligence. Joining me for insight and analysis are presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, Yamiche Alcindor, White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour and David Maraniss of the Washington Post. Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.
ANNOUNCER:
From NBC News in Washington, the longest running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.
CHUCK TODD:
Good Sunday morning and we hope you're enjoying your Memorial Day weekend. As Democrats debate whether to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump they're facing a dilemma. Growing activist base is asking what are we waiting for? Meanwhile Democrat leaders warn impeachment could be a fool's errand resulting in Senate acquittal and allowing the president to argue he's been vindicated in an election year.
The last time Democrats faced a similar quandary politically was in 2002. Many chose to vote to authorize a war in Iraq they did not fully believe in because the leaders at the time thought it was good politics in the fall of an election year with a Democratic Senate that was in control by the Democrats but sitting on a knife's edge.
And it was until it wasn't. When the war went badly and Democratic voters turned sour on those Iraq war supporters. Today's Democrats face a similar what do we do now situation. Do they ramp up impeachment? President Trump seems to want that remembering Bill Clinton's 73% Gallup approval rating after he was impeached.
Do they fight him on his terms, trading insult for insult? Last time a Democrat tried that Hillary Clinton wound up calling some of his supporters a basket of deplorables. How'd that work out? Or do they try to do what the president now insists he won't do, conduct the nation's business?
Remember, Democrats won back the House by promising to fix health care in a lot of swing districts. Whatever happened to that? What is clear is that the path ahead for Democrats is not at all clear: impeaching, fighting or ignoring all have their political downsides. It's a party divided with a base growing impatient for impeachment. And a more cautious leadership saying, ""Not yet.""
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
The only we're going to beat him is to impeach him. How about that?
CHUCK TODD:
President Trump can't stop talking about impeachment.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
Whether or not they carry the big “I” word out, I can't imagine that. But they probably would. The “I” word. The “I” word. Can you imagine? I don't speak to Russians about campaigns.
CHUCK TODD:
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told colleagues this week she thinks Mr. Trump wants to be impeached even as he denies it.
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:
I think what really got to him was that these court cases and the fact that a House Democratic caucus is not on a path to impeachment. And that's where he wants us to be.
CHUCK TODD:
Pelosi under growing pressure from a vocal minority of her own members to begin impeachment hearings now is trying to focus on the president's conduct instead.
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:
This president is obstructing justice and he's engaged in a cover-up. And that could be an impeachable offense.
CHUCK TODD:
And she's trying to placate more progressive members who say it's past time to follow through with impeachment.
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:
This is no longer about politics but this is about upholding the rule of law.
REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY:
I believe we have no other choice.
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:
An impeachment is a very divisive place to go in our country. And what we can get the facts to the American people through our investigation it may take us to a place that is unavoidable in terms of impeachment or not. But we're not at that place.
CHUCK TODD:
In recent polling a majority of Americans oppose impeachment hearings.
REP. JERRY NADLER:
If we were call, to hold an impeachment inquiry in the hearings in the judiciary committee how would they differ from what we're going to be doing if we don't call an impeachment inquiry? And the answer is they wouldn't.
CHUCK TODD:
Meanwhile, the president is raising questions about the F.B.I. and C.I.A.'s role in the Russia probe using the word treason and ordering Attorney General Bill Barr to declassify intelligence that led to the investigation.
PETER ALEXANDER:
Who specifically are you accusing of treason?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
Well, I think a number of people. You look at Comey, if you look at McCabe, if you look at probably people, people higher than that.
CHUCK TODD:
On Wednesday the president walked out of an infrastructure meeting with Democrats saying there will be no legislating as long as the Democrats are investigating. For both the president and for House Speaker Pelosi a clash may be politically convenient. Mr. Trump is trying to ensure Democrats share blame for government dysfunction.
REPORTER:
Is there anything that you are willing to work with Democrats on now? Because you said -
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:
Everything -- I’d like to work with everything -- No, no, they have to go down their track. Let them get rid of the nonsense first.
CHUCK TODD:
While Pelosi focuses her members on the primary thing uniting Democrats, President Trump.
SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:
Another temper tantrum. I wish that his family or his administration or his staff would have an intervention for the good of the country.
CHUCK TODD:
And joining me now is the Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Congressman Jeffries, welcome back to Meet the Press, sir.
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
Good morning, Chuck.
CHUCK TODD:
I want to start with what Republican Congressman Justin Amash laid out as his principal conclusions for reading the Mueller report in that infamous tweet storm last week, he said, ""President Trump indeed engaged in impeachable conduct."" And he believed that Attorney General Bill Barr, ""Deliberately misrepresented” the Mueller report. Do you agree with Congressman Amash's two principal conclusions?
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
Well, I certainly think there's reason to believe that there was obstruction of justice. The Mueller report laid out ten different instances that we need to look into separately as part of our investigation as to what may have taken place. And it certainly appears to be the case that the so-called attorney general intentionally misrepresented the conclusions of the Mueller report as part of an effort to fool the American people. We won't let that stand either.
CHUCK TODD:
Well, if that's the case then why aren't you ready to start impeachment hearings? You, you, you're referring to an attorney general as a so-called. He is the confirmed attorney general. I think he even had a Democrat or two I think vote for him if I'm not mistaken. But if this is the case then why aren't you for starting impeachment now?
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
Well, Democrats can sing and dance at the same time just like Beyoncé. We have to keep our focus primarily on our “For the People” agenda which, we've been working on lowering health care costs, strengthening the Affordable Care Act, protecting people with pre-existing conditions, driving down the high cost of life-saving prescription drugs. These are all areas where we've passed legislation this month. At the same time, we recognize in the new majority that the House is a separate and coequal branch of government. We don't work for Donald Trump. We work for the American people. We have a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on a potentially out of control executive branch. But we will not overreach. We will not over-investigate. We will not over-politicize that responsibility. We'll proceed as Speaker Pelosi has eloquently laid out methodically yet aggressively to get to the truth.
CHUCK TODD:
Is it possible though you're making a political calculation about impeachment and then that in itself is actually something to, I mean, I opened my, my monologue here about the Iraq war debate. And Democrats, many of them, were convinced to make a political decision in the fall of '02 that down the road they would regret. What seemed like good politics in the moment, so in this case not impeaching seems like the right politics of that moment. How do you know that? And how do you know that isn't going to be bad politics five years from now?
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
Well, the only way to proceed is to make sure that politics don't dictate a decision to impeach or politics don't dictate a decision not to impeach. We need to follow the facts. We need to apply the law. We need to make sure that the constitution is the guiding principle in terms of the way forward. The Judiciary Committee, for instance, has indicated through our chairman, Jerry Nadler, that we will conduct hearings on obstruction of justice, we will conduct hearings on abuse of power, we will conduct hearings on the culture of corruption that appears to exist at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But we are, in fact gathering mode right now. At the same time, we're going to continue to work on issues of importance to the American people. That's what we promised that we would work on should we win the majority. Now that we're in the majority we have to work to make life better for every day Americans and that's what we're going to continue to do.
CHUCK TODD:
Do you worry, though, you talked about this, the various investigations that are going on. You're doing obstruction of justice, you're investigating abuse of power, you're looking at his financial records. Do you understand why maybe the country just looks like, it looks like Democrats are throwing subpoenas up against the wall to see what sticks? Why is there not a focus, laser-like focus, for instance, on the Mueller report?
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
Well you have a variety of different committees of jurisdiction who have important work to do. But with respect to the Mueller report, we have indicated that we want to see the full and complete unredacted Mueller report. We can't trust the attorney general's redactions to be presumptively legitimate. We want to see the underlying documentation. And, of course, we'd like to hear from Bob Mueller who needs to tell his story to the American people. But besides that, we do have important things to work on like infrastructure, you know, the president didn't just walk out on a meeting with Nancy Pelosi and infrastructure, Chuck, he walked out on the American people. Donald Trump is functionally a studio gangster. He pretends to be a tough guy. But he really is just playing that role on TV. Hopefully he will have gotten his temper tantrum out of his system. He can come back from Japan. We have crumbling bridges, roads --
CHUCK TODD:
Okay.
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
-- tunnels, airports, mass transportation system. We need to get to work to fix it. We have a plan. And we'd like to do it in a bipartisan way.
CHUCK TODD:
Is there a point where impeachment becomes, does -- it becomes unfeasible because of the political calendar?
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
Well, we are at the very beginning of our new majority, as you know. This is the start of the clock. We just crossed into the 100 day point of the House Democratic majority last month. And so I think we have to proceed methodically. We have to gather the information. And then at a certain point we'll have to make a determination as to how best to present that to the American people.
CHUCK TODD:
What, what, I mean but, is there a timetable, I mean, is there a realistic time table here? Is it the summer? Do you have to sort of, if by Labor Day you're still equivocating then you're probably not impeaching?
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
I think that's a timetable that will be guided by the facts. I don't think it'll be guided by any political calendar. And we've been pretty clear, the presidential candidates are out in the campaign trail and they should make their case to the American people. We want to promote prosperity in every single zip code and hopefully they'll continue to do that. We have to do our work in the majority to govern, to pass bills, to send them over to the Senate as we've been doing and then try and get legislation to the president's desk to be signed into law.
CHUCK TODD:
Is there a, is there a point here in all of this where you're just arguing over semantics? I mean, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said what he's doing now, if you called it an impeachment inquiry, it'd be the same thing. So what should we take away from that? You already really have opened an impeachment inquiry, it's just not formerly called one?
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
No that's not the case. I think what Jerry Nadler has indicated is that he's going to look at some troubling facts that have emerged out of the Mueller report. But we have to conduct our own investigation separately because that is our responsibility. We cannot just simply take what Mueller has done because we don't even have all of the --
CHUCK TODD:
Okay.
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
-- underlying information.
CHUCK TODD:
Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, member of leadership, head of the Democratic caucus, thanks for coming on and sharing your views this morning. I really appreciate it.
REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES:
Thank you, Chuck.
CHUCK TODD:
All right, joining me now is Democratic Congressman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan taking the other side of this conversation. Congresswoman Tlaib, welcome to Meet the Press.
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
Thank you.
CHUCK TODD:
You are easily, I think, one of louder voices when it comes to impeachment. I'm curious of your reaction to Congressman Jeffries in this respect. Do you believe that leadership is being methodical or do you believe that leadership is trying to buy enough time where they say, ""We're too close to the presidential election,"" in order to take it off the table quietly?
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
Well, I can tell you as one of the newest members of Congress, the traditional Congressional oversight process isn't working. From subpoenas and trying to figure out what's going on with children being caged at the border, still waiting for a response from this administration, from even my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when we're asking for big pharma to come before our oversight committee to testify about high cost of insulin, and they're telling them, ""You don't have to come before the committee."" A lot of the corruption that you see through the Oval Office is already seeping into the Congression -- into the halls of Congress. I can tell you from day one this president has misled Congress, has undermined his own cabinet members and has lied to the American people. I have to tell you, this is a pretty remarkable time in our country. And if you saw the largest class, incoming class, before our class was the Watergate class. And at that time even though many people say --
CHUCK TODD:
Okay.
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
-- that we didn't campaign on this, look at the fact that the majority, the majority of states across this country saw an huge historic turnout of people coming out to vote for the first time. And I feel like in many ways that's a referendum to stand up to a bully, to a president that --
CHUCK TODD:
Right.
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
-- subverts the United States Constitution every single day.
CHUCK TODD:
I want to play for you a Quote: from an interview I had earlier this week from an Ohio Democratic activist who is a bit frustrated with all of the subpoenas on Capitol Hill. Take a listen and I want to get your reaction on the other side.
[BEGIN TAPE]
DAVID BETRAS:
They don't give a rat's you know what about his taxes. And they don't really care. I'm not saying that Congress should not walk gum -- chew gum and walk at the same time. But the volume on issues, kitchen table issues, needs to be louder because I want to win this election. I don't want to lose.
[END TAPE]
CHUCK TODD:
You hear -- he, he, look -- I have no doubt and Congressman Jeffries ran down, I know you guys have passed other legislation. And you do --
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
We have.
CHUCK TODD:
--other stuff, other than talking about the president's personal conduct. But his point was it's the volume of conversation. It's the loud voice that he believes, “Win the election in 2020 and stop worrying about his tax returns.” What do you say to Mr. Betras about that?
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
Look, this is not about 2020 election. It's about doing what's right now for our country. This is going to be a precedent that we set when we don't hold this president accountable to the rule of law and to the United States Constitution. Just look at the fact that currently over a number of abuses of power but the public's trust is at stake. And we can't sit back idly and think that we can just pass health care reform and all of these issues, which are critically important, but at the same time, you have an administration that's not providing the information, not following through on subpoenas. It goes hand in hand. And I think we need to stop separating the fact that we're trying to change people's lives for the better but we have an administration that continues to violate the United States constitution. Did you know, Chuck -- I mean he has not complied with the United States Constitution when he took the oath of office by divesting in his businesses. So we have an upgraded version of pay-to-play. So, when I'm on the ground right now in my district fighting against the T-Mobile and Sprint merger, T-Mobile is turning around, spending $195,000 at the Trump Hotel in D.C. as again, an upgraded version of pay-to-play to get access to the most powerful corridor to power in our country, the president's office. And so for me, to fight back against big pharma, for many of my colleagues that came there to pass really important reforms that are needed, we can't do it when the president of the United States continues to lie to the American people --
CHUCK TODD:
Why --
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
-- continue to not follow through on subpoenas and give us the information--
CHUCK TODD:
Congresswoman --
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
--that we need.
CHUCK TODD:
-- why do you think you can't convince a majority of House Democrats that it's time to impeach him?
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
No, I think it is moving towards that. It's going to demand it. It already is. This is a time in our country right now that we can't look -- I mean, think about what just happened recently. The first time historically did we exercise our war powers and said, ""No more armed deals. No more kind of interaction in helping the Yemeni humanitarian crisis through our relationship with Saudi Arabia."" And he turned around and pretty much ignored the Congress' decision, a bipartisan decision. Understand, again, it goes hand in hand. And I think the American people understand that, that we can't do our job if the president thinks he's above the law, thinks that he cannot abide by what the United States Congress is passing through --
CHUCK TODD:
Yes.
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
-- and asking and demanding of him. I've got to tell you, from the wall, to the children at the border --
CHUCK TODD:
Okay.
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
-- to immigration reform, to everything. We can't be able to do our jobs if we don't hold him accountable.
CHUCK TODD:
I'm curious, a fellow Michigander, Justin Amash, became the first Republican essentially to call or at least believe that it is time to have an impeachment inquiry. I know on Twitter you invited him to meet with you and sign your resolution on that. Did you meet with him? Have you spoken with him? And if you have, what did he say?
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
No, I haven't. But I've got to tell you, I've worked with him in the Michigan legislature for a term. And he is somebody that truly believes the Constitution is brilliant, it's awesome. He's all about putting country first. I've known that about him for a very long time. He actually is one of the few that supported subpoenas towards the Trump administration about at least understanding what's going on at the border with children being separated from their family. He's one of the more courageous people that really does believe in the institution and believes in the rule of law.
CHUCK TODD:
Okay.
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
And I respect that very much and I continue to uplift his courage and for him to, again, put country before politics.
CHUCK TODD:
All right, Congresswoman, I'm going to leave it there. Rashida Tlaib, Democrat from Michigan. Congresswoman, thanks for coming on and sharing your views. I appreciate it.
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB:
Thank you.
CHUCK TODD:
When we come back the perils of trying to impeach President Trump, and the danger in not trying. The panel is next. And as we go to break, as we do every Memorial Day weekend here at Meet the Press we want to remember the American service members who died in the line of duty since last Memorial Day.
CHUCK TODD:
Welcome back, panel is here. The former North -- Republican Governor of North Carolina, Pat McCrory, Yamiche Alcindor, White House correspondent for the PBS NewsHour, presidential historian, Doris Kearns Goodwin whose latest book, by the way, is Leadership in Turbulent Times and David Maraniss of The Washington Post. And he's author of a new book, A Good American Family. It's about his own family's ordeal during the Red Scare and McCarthyism of the 1950s. Nice to see you, David, Doris.
DAVID MARANISS:
Chuck.
CHUCK TODD:
Yamiche, I want to start with this sound with Nancy Pelosi. We've gone over about a two-month period where she's going from defiantly anti-impeachment to rhetorically more open to it. Take a listen.

SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI:
They wanted me to impeach President Bush for the Iraq war. I didn't believe in it then, I don't believe in it now. It divides the country. The president is demonstrating on a daily basis his obstruction of justice. This president is obstructing justice. And he's engaged in a cover-up. And that could be an impeachable offense.
[END TAPE]
CHUCK TODD:
Yamiche, is she getting closer to impeachment or is she trying to keep Congresswoman Tlaib happy?
YAMICHE ALCINDOR:
Well, if you speak to the Pelosi camp it sounds as if they are still saying she's saying that we need to be in a fact finding. Obviously Hakeem Jeffries just told you that they're still in the middle of really gathering the information. But I talked to a source this week who said this freshman of Democrats has a really loud voice and they have more power than freshman classes before them. So when you listen to Rashida Tlaib and you asked her specifically why can't you convince the majority of the House to go with you, she didn't, she didn’t blink. She sounded very confident when she said that we're moving in that direction. So I think she's in some ways pointing to Nancy Pelosi's move and saying, ""Hey, we're hearing that her language changed."" I also talked to someone at the White House who said when they, when the president heard Nancy Pelosi talk about a cover-up he instantly started thinking about President Nixon. And the idea what gave in or what really took down Nixon was the cover-up. So that source told me she knows what she's doing. So I think most people including people in the White House see that not just as a shift of rhetoric but her moving closer and closer to impeachment.
CHUCK TODD:
David Maraniss, you forced yourself to get out of Washington a lot. You go back to the lovely country of Wisconsin, as we there. What, what do they say? What is the conversation there when it comes to Trump and impeachment?
DAVID MARANISS:
I think it's not that different from Washington, honestly. I think that there are a lot of activists who very much are pushing in that direction. And the majority of people are not, not thinking about it. We define Washington as just the political class. But there's a lot more to it here than that. But I think that's what happening is that Nancy Pelosi, there's a fine line between not acting out of fear and acting out of political smarts. And whenever you act just out of fear or not act out of fear then, then that's a mistake. But she's trying to be politically smart and get to that point where it's an act of --
CHUCK TODD:
Pat McCrory, does the president want to be impeached? That's been a question. Does he want it or does he just want to create the wedge?
FMR. GOV. PAT McCRORY:
I think it's helpful to the Republican Party and Trump's reelection if this process continues. I don't think it's good for the country. And I don't think--
CHUCK TODD:
You think it's good politically though for the Republicans.
FMR. GOV. PAT McCRORY:
It's good politically but I don't think it's good for the country. And it's not good for the presidency. This presidency or future presidencies. I do say this that Speaker Pelosi I think can no longer be called the adult in the room because she's pressured, like her predecessor was in the Republican Party, Speaker Ryan, by a caucus that frankly has gerrymandered districts. Their fear is from the left and future primaries, not in a general election. The same dynamics occur in both Republican and Democratic Party with speakers of the House and state legislators like my own and right here in Washington D.C. She's trying to appease them. She's trying to herd them into a coalition. But just today look - look, look at the names that have been called, studio gangster, dictator, corruption, misled Congress, pay-to-play, obstruction of justice, so-called attorney general. This is not good for our country.
CHUCK TODD:
Doris, I want to read you something Michelle Goldberg wrote this week about this issue. She said, ""It's true that were Trump to be reelected after such a reckoning,"" meaning a -- basically surviving a trial after impeachment, ""He might be even further unleashed. But were Trump to be reelected in the absence of impeachment it would still be seen as a vindication for him and would leave Democrats humiliated by their excess of caution.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
I think that the real challenge right now for the Democrats, whether they do investigations or whether they move to an impeachment inquiry, is they have to present a story, a narrative to the American people that they understand what behavior is and how it reflects upon the constitution. One of the things Lincoln always said is that with public sentiment nothing can fail, without it nothing can succeed. What we don't have yet, we have a scatter shot, partly what you were talking about, of things against Mr. Trump. Unless we understand how did this all begin, where -- what were the origins, not just the origins that he's asking for. But what is Mueller going to say about why this happened? Why were these people indicted? Why were people so sensitive about Russia? Where's the beginning, the middle and the end? People understand the story. They're not going to understand scatter shots. And that if you can create public sentiment then you're going to be moving the country along with you.
CHUCK TODD:
Who should do that?
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Well I think --
CHUCK TODD:
Who's in charge --
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
I think --
CHUCK TODD:
-- of leading that conversation?
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
It’s not just the Congress. It's what the candidates on the 2020 campaign have to be doing.
CHUCK TODD:
You think they should be talking about it?
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
They're going to have to talk about it. They've already been asked about it. But it's not just a question of saying I'm for or against impeachment. They have to argue. And we need Mueller there. We need the story to be told from Mueller, not from Attorney General Barr. And until the American people understand, this is what FDR did so great. He explained complicated issues in fireside chats so you understood them. So it's up to the political class right now if they're going to forward with impeachment, or even if they're not, to be able to understand what has happened, where's the beginning, the middle and the end of this story.
DAVID MARANISS:
But it's a lot easier for one person to tell that story than 24.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
And the internet-- no, I agree totally. But that's what leadership is.
DAVID MARANISS:
Yup.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
And that's the most important part of leadership right now, wherever it comes from. And whoever can do that best, they're going to be --
FMR. GOV. PAT McCRORY:
I don't disagree with you on Mueller needing to speak. But I also say we almost need a church commission, as many Republicans think, on really reviewing what are the guidelines now for investigations. Listen, I've been a governor whose administration's been investigated before. And it literally makes you temperamental. It brings down your staff. It dilutes any work that you can do on the side. You're nervous about, especially if you feel like nothing’s -- everything you've done is right, not wrong. And we've got to make sure that we really review what guidelines are used, especially if we investigate candidates in the future.
YAMICHE ALCINDOR:
But Doris is talking about a narrative. And why you see Hakeem Jeffries saying, “the so-called attorney general” is because Democrats are in some ways very furious because Attorney General Barr was pretty good at setting a narrative for the president. The president's very happy with Attorney General Barr. And all the people that I've talked to both on the Trump campaign and the Trump White House feel as though they have a coherent narrative: “Democrats are mad about the 2016 election. They're going to go harass me, now they want to impeach me. It's all about keeping me out of this office.” So the Republicans have kind of lined up their narrative.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Absolutely.
YAMICHE ALCINDOR:
And Democrats, as you see them now, I think fighting over this issue of impeachment, they're going to have to decide whether they have a narrative as well.
CHUCK TODD:
And it goes back to the person best able to make the case is a person that I don't think wants to make the case which is Speaker Pelosi.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Well, I think--
CHUCK TODD:
That goes--
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
--she's beginning to though. I think by talking about obstruction of justice and by saying we're moving methodically, we're going step by step, she's in charge right now. But she needs to make the narrative too. No one's made it yet on the Democratic side. And you're absolutely--
CHUCK TODD:
No, she--
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
-- right. The attorney general has made the narrative and the president is now carrying it forward. They've won the messaging right now.
CHUCK TODD:
She may simply be buying time in order to say, ""Wait for 2020."" But we'll see. When we come back it's White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, she joins us from Tokyo where President Trump is on a state visit. We'll ask her whether President Trump trusts his own C.I.A. And again, as we go to break, the names of more American service members who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving their country over this past year.
CHUCK TODD:
Welcome back. This week President Trump made good on his promise to investigate his investigators. Mr. Trump gave Attorney General William Barr the authority to unilaterally declassify documents from the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies. Both the president and Barr have said the Trump campaign was spied on. And this latest move raises concerns in the intel community about politicizing intelligence. Joining me now from Tokyo where President Trump is on a state visit is White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. Sarah Sanders, welcome to Meet the Press.
SARAH SANDERS:
Thank you. It's great to be with you.
CHUCK TODD:
Before I begin with some of that domestic political back and forth I want to start with something that's on the minds I think of a lot of Japanese and that is the ballistic missile tests of the North Koreans. Does the president agree with the prime minister of Japan and his own national security advisor that North Korea has violated a UN resolution with these tests?
SARAH SANDERS:
Look, the president's focus in all of this process is on continuing the very good relationship that he has with Chairman Kim. And he feels good that the chairman will stay firm with the commitment that he made to the president and move towards denuclearization.That's our focus. That's going to continue to be our focus. Some of the activity that's taken place, as you can see from the president's Twitter isn't something that's bothering the president. He still feels good about the relationship that he has and about Chairman Kim's commitment that he made to the president.
CHUCK TODD:
So the president has no qualms about not enforcing a U.N. resolution? If you don't enforce it what's the point of it?
SARAH SANDERS:
Once again, Chuck, though, the president's focus in this process is on continuing to move towards total denuclearization of the peninsula. We know that the activities at no point that took place over the last several weeks have been a threat to the United States or our allies. And we're going to continue pushing forward to the ultimate goal and that's denuclearization --
CHUCK TODD:
And, and --
SARAH SANDERS:
-- of the peninsula. And the president still feels comfortable and confident in the relationship that he has with Chairman Kim and that he's going to stay true to the commitment that he made to the president.
CHUCK TODD:
Well I, you referred to his Twitter feed. I do want to put it up. And you, and he did downplay it. ""North Korea fired off some small weapons which disturbed some of my people and others. But not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me. And then also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual and, worse, perhaps that's sending me a signal."" Can you explain why Americans should not be concerned that the president of United States is essentially siding with a murderous authoritarian dictator over a former vice president of the United States?
SARAH SANDERS:
Chuck, the president's not siding with that. But I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden. Again, the president's focus in this process is the relationship he has and making sure we continue on the path towards denuclearization. That's what he wants to see and that's certainly what the people in this region want to see. And are hopeful that the president is right and that that relationship will be what helps move us further down that path.
CHUCK TODD:
The president of the United States takes Chair -- the North Korean dictator's word about Joe Biden? What, what’s happened to speaking with one voice in American foreign policy? Is the president not setting up trying to have world leaders sort of pick which political party they should side with? I don't understand what message the president is sending here.
SARAH SANDERS:
The president doesn't need somebody else to give him an assessment of Joe Biden. He's given his own assessment a number of times. I think you've seen it. I'm sure you've covered it on your program. The president watched him and his administration with President Obama fail for eight years. He's come in in two and a half, he's cleaned up a lot of the messes that were left behind. We shouldn't even be in the position that we're in to have to deal with North Korea at the level we are if they had done their job in the first place. And that we're seeing in moment after moment, in relationship after relationship that the previous administration did nothing. They failed with Iran, they failed with North Korea, they failed on trade. And we finally have a president that's being tough with these countries. We've put tougher sanctions on North Korea than the Obama administration ever did. But at the same time the president wants to develop that relationship. And he wants to actually get something done. He doesn't want to just talk in pretty rhetoric. He's been tough on China. For the very first time ever China is sitting down at the table and negotiating for better deals on trade. For the very first time we're seeing Iran's economy crumbling. Nobody's been tougher on Russia than this president. I think if anybody needs help with an assessment it's Joe Biden and whether or not he should be trying to get an upgrade when he failed to do the job in the number two slot.
CHUCK TODD:
I'm trying to understand how your North Korea policy is a success if he's still launching missiles. I mean I understand that you guys have had summits. But nothing's come of it. If anything, he's now doing missile tests again. So we're right back where we began.
SARAH SANDERS:
It's not true to say nothing's come of it. There have been steps that have moved us towards for a strong, a significant period of time there was no missile testing. We got hostages back home to the United States and remains of American war heroes. I don't know how you can say that that's nothing. But to me that is certainly something. And I know it's something --
CHUCK TODD:
Okay.
SARAH SANDERS:
-- to the families of those individuals who those people came back home. And this is a president who's actually made those things happen. Once again, he should never have been in this position in the first place. This is because of the --
CHUCK TODD:
Okay.
SARAH SANDERS:
-- failure of the administrations that came before him that never dealt with it to begin with.
CHUCK TODD:
I want to ask you about the decision to give the attorney general this unilateral authority to declassify intelligence. The order says the attorney general should consult with relevant agency heads but not that he has to. Why did the president not force the attorney general to consult with the, with the DNI and the head of the CIA? Here he's giving him unilateral authority not to do it. Only saying he should do it but he doesn't have to. Why?
SARAH SANDERS:
The president has total confidence in the attorney general and his ability --
CHUCK TODD:
But not the intelligence community?
SARAH SANDERS:
-- to make those decisions. We expect -- certainly. That's why we expect that the attorney general will consult with them on matters that he needs that guidance and advice from them. Certainly they work in lock step on a number of things. I don't see this to be any different. The bottom line here is there was a lot of corruption at the FBI and the DOJ. We see constantly more and more things that have come out of that. And the president wants transparency and he's given the attorney general the ability to put that transparency in place, make those decisions. And we're not like at all concerned that the attorney general is not going to do everything that is necessary to make sure we're protecting important intelligence that is vital to our national security.
CHUCK TODD:
I'm trying to understand what outcome the president expects. He’s, he tweeted the following: ""My campaign for president was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American politics. A really bad situation. Treason means long jail sentences and this was treason."" Why did the president ask the attorney general to do an investigation if he's already come to a conclusion, already decided what the penalty should be? And I think has already determined what the jail sentences should be? Isn't this the president already playing judge and jury and putting his thumb on the scale here for whatever investigation he claims he wants Mr. Barr to do?
SARAH SANDERS:
That's pretty rich coming from the media who relentlessly covered and accused the president for over two years of being part of this massive election interference, something that never took place. The idea that anybody now says that the president doesn't have the right and not only that Americans deserve the truth to push back and find out where all of this started is absurd. Literally for day after day after day the media and Democrats in Congress called the president a traitor to his own country and said that he cheated to become president. I mean the idea of that is absolutely outrageous that he had to endure that for two years. And now he wants to know where and why it started. And all of a sudden that's a big deal? That is insane.
CHUCK TODD:
Sarah, I didn't ask about him --
SARAH SANDERS:
I think the president is doing exactly what --
CHUCK TODD:
No, no, no, no, Sarah I did not ask --
SARAH SANDERS:
-- he should be. And I think America is glad that --
CHUCK TODD:
Sarah --
SARAH SANDERS:
-- he's asking for that transparency.
CHUCK TODD:
I didn't ask whether he should ask those questions. He's not asking questions anymore. He's already made a judgment. That is much different. He’s already -- will he accept a result of the attorney general saying, you know what, ""Everything was done legally and on the up and up, Mr. President."" Will he accept that result from Bill Barr?
SARAH SANDERS:
We already know that there was an outrageous amount of corruption that took place at the FBI. They leaked information. They lied. They were specifically working trying to take down the president, trying to hurt the president. We'll leave the, the final call up to the attorney general and he'll get to the bottom of it. But we think Americans deserve the truth.
CHUCK TODD:
So he doesn't --
SARAH SANDERS:
The president's asked for that. And we should expect nothing less.
CHUCK TODD:
So the president is not going to accept exoneration if that's what Bill Barr finds?
SARAH SANDERS:
Look, I'm not going to get ahead of what the final conclusion is. But we already know that there was a high level of corruption that was taking place. We've seen that in the --
CHUCK TODD:
There, there --
SARAH SANDERS:
-- IG investigation --
CHUCK TODD:
-- which is --
SARAH SANDERS:
-- that has already happened.
CHUCK TODD:
-- not out yet.
SARAH SANDERS:
There's a lot more there that we still need to know. And we're going to let the attorney general do his job.
CHUCK TODD:
Well it sounds like you’re not -- that's my point. It doesn't sound like you want him to do his job. It sounds like you, the president has already determined the outcome.
SARAH SANDERS:
Chuck, that's the reason that he's granted the attorney general the authority to declassify that information, to look at all the documents necessary is so that we can get to the very bottom of what happened. Once again, we already know about some wrongdoing. The president's not wrong in that. But he wants to know everything that happened and how far and how wide it went.
CHUCK TODD:
Does he expect --
SARAH SANDERS:
We know that there was corruption. Let's see --
CHUCK TODD:
-- does he expect criminal charges? Does he expect -- he's accused James Comey of treason. Does he expect Jim Comey to be arrested?
SARAH SANDERS:
Again, we're going to let the attorney general make that determination as he gets to the conclusion of this investigation.
CHUCK TODD:
So the president, he's not going to accept --
SARAH SANDERS:
But we certainly expect the people that were responsible --
CHUCK TODD:
He’s, he’s --
SARAH SANDERS:
-- and that were part of this unprecedented obstruction and corruption at the FBI, those people should certainly be held responsible and be held accountable and the president expects that to take place.
CHUCK TODD:
So he expects an outcome that he wants, not an outcome that the facts lead to.
SARAH SANDERS:
Chuck, I think you're trying to muddy the waters too much here. We already know, once again --
CHUCK TODD:
I think we --
SARAH SANDERS:
-- that there was wrongdoing.
CHUCK TODD:
I think what’s rich is who’s muddying waters.
SARAH SANDERS:
Now we want to know how much there was. I don't think it's -- well, I don’t think it’s crazy to want to know how far and how wide the corruption at the FBI was. And that's what the president has asked the attorney general to find.
CHUCK TODD:
Okay.
SARAH SANDERS:
And we'll what happens.
CHUCK TODD:
Sarah Sanders, White House press secretary in Tokyo for us today. Thanks for coming on and sharing your views. I appreciate it.
SARAH SANDERS:
You bet. Thanks, Chuck.
CHUCK TODD:
When we come back the 2020 election and the comparison Joe Biden would probably prefer not to hear about.
CHUCK TODD:
We are back. Data download time. It has been a month since Joe Biden officially entered the 2020 race. And he's been at the top of the Democratic pack ever since, climbing to an 18 point lead over Bernie Sanders in one poll this week. Who should that remind you of? Well, in 2011 Mitt Romney also held a comfortable lead over his next closest competitor in a crowded race. And that's not their only similarity. In both cases, we have parties coming off of huge midterm successes and an incumbent president with approval ratings under 50%. In 2011, 90% of Republican primary voters disapproved of President Obama's job performance much like the 88% of Democratic voters who dislike President Trump right now. So, at this moment Biden actually looks more like Mitt Romney in 2012 than he does like Donald Trump in 2016. And that might be a similarity Biden wants to actually kind of avoid. 'Cause Romney, being Mr. Electable on the right, wound up losing that general election. When we come back, End Game and the major event that happened overseas that could tell us something of the politics in our own divided country.
CHUCK TODD:
Back now with End Game and we can't end a Meet the Press without talking a little bit of 2020. Small pattern developing here, Yamiche, in the Democratic primary polling. We've had a couple of recent polls. And there's one undeniable trend. Bernie Sanders seems to be getting squeezed from two sides.
Joe Biden's got in, his numbers grew. Bernie Sanders' got lower. And Elizabeth Warren has been growing. And in some ways, Yamiche, what was interesting, I think it was in the Monmouth Poll, the less you were paying attention the more likely you were a Bernie Sanders supporter. The point being Biden took a bunch of soft supporters. Warren with, ""I have a plan for that,"" is starting to get traction. Bernie seems to be a candidate all of a sudden trying to figure out how to get traction again.
YAMICHE ALCINDOR:
Well, this is the dilemma of 2020 because Bernie Sanders in 2016 was the flagship progressive candidate. If you liked Warren, if you liked other people you really found your candidate in Bernie Sanders. Now you have Elizabeth Warren and other people talking about the same kind of legislation, same policies. I was talking to someone from the Warren campaign today. They wouldn't comment on polls, but they made a point to say, first of all, she's been to 18 states plus Puerto Rico. She's also someone who's held 81 town halls. That person was basically making the case, look, she's doing just as much as him. And I was thinking about how Senator Warren has been setting herself apart. Apart from being the first candidate to talk about impeaching the president she also decided not to go on Fox News and hold that town hall. And I asked that campaign person, ""Well, tell me a little bit more about that decision."" They pointed me to the thread and said, look, she was not, she didn't mince any words with Fox News. She said, ""They're a hate-filled, propaganda network."" As a result she's basically saying, ""This is the camp that I'm going to be in."" Obviously Bernie Sanders said, ""I want to go after those voters.""
CHUCK TODD:
He was the first one to give a Fox town hall.
YAMICHE ALCINDOR:
Yeah. And then, of course, you have Joe Biden who is, who is already trying to claim that he's the most progressive candidate. That's, of course, going to be pushed back, pushed backed on. But there's this idea that Bernie Sanders isn't the hot, new kid anymore. And I know that that's interesting to say about Bernie Sanders but that really--
CHUCK TODD:
I know. But Doris, you know, you can't be an insurgent twice. It's tough to be an insurgent twice. And there is part of this where you look at Sanders and you think, ""Maybe it's nothing he can do about it."" It's just that Hillary Clinton's not on the ballot again. I say this sometimes to Donald Trump supporters who think you know Hillary Clinton's not going to be on the ballot again.
DAVID MARANISS:
No.
CHUCK TODD:
Sanders, and that Sanders without her as a galvanizing force, he didn't have as big of a following as perhaps we all thought.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
Well, I think it was just inevitable. As these other candidates, just like you say, get on the ground. It's in the early states actually where those polls are even more likely to show Warren and Harris. But I think the real worry I have is that we do polls week after week. We have 19 more weeks of this thing left. Over a year and a half. And sometimes I dream of going back to the old system where do you realize if we had the parties choosing the candidates it wouldn't be until the summer of 2020 that we would begin to have the conventions? And then Labor Day it would start. And we'd be living a life. You know, it’s these polls --
CHUCK TODD:
Well now we get to be the gatekeepers and say, ""Pst pst this whisper campaign is happening, and this whisper"" and this is what everybody hated is that we journalists were the gatekeepers.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
I know you can't go backwards. In 1912 when they introduced the first primary and it was such a mess because TR was calling Taft a fathead with the brain of a guinea pig. And they said, ""How can we argue like this? It's such a blush to all of Americans that we're seeing arguing like this.” We've got to go back to the old system which was rational, not a mob. But the good thing is, a lot of ideas are coming out right now. However many candidates we have, we're coming up with good ideas. Each one of them. And we can -- they have task forces who are studying them. And at least it's a respite from the obsession with the presidency, to talk about ideas.
CHUCK TODD:
Pat McCrory, I know the Trump campaign -- Donald Trump's a terrible poker player. He's made it clear he fears Biden. Okay, he talks about him all the time. He never, he never hides what he fears.
FMR. GOV. PAT McCRORY:
He cannot hide.
CHUCK TODD:
Are you concerned that, that Biden's not getting sucked into the liberal debate or the progressive debate--
FMR. GOV. PAT McCRORY:
Yeah, I think--
CHUCK TODD:
--like a bunch of you thought he would.
FMR. GOV. PAT McCRORY:
I think what Joe Biden is doing is what a lot of Congressional Democrats did in red states during the last election and that is say as little as possible about details of issues which the other 30 candidates have already done. And it's got them in trouble. Harris, for example, got in trouble with insurance and health care and getting rid of private insurance. Biden is saying nothing at this point in time. He's talking macro. The question is how much longer can he get away with that? A lot of Congressional Democrats got away with that in the last election. It'll be interesting if Biden can stall for that period of time.
CHUCK TODD:
David, I keep pinning you back into Wisconsin. But I think about the Madison activists.
DAVID MARANISS:
Yes.
CHUCK TODD:
And I think about them because that, to me, can Joe Biden win them over? Right? If you win over the Madison activists on the, hey, my number one plank in a climate change proposal is beat Trump, and the Madison folks buy into that, that's real trouble if you're Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.
DAVID MARANISS:
I don't think he can win them over in the primary. I think if he wins the nomination he can win them over. And particularly depending on who he picks as his vice president. But I think there’s, I would -- there's a practicality to it where people are saying, ""We just want to beat Trump."" But I think there's plenty of alternatives besides Joe Biden for that among those activists.
CHUCK TODD:
All right. Before we go, everything in the U.K. seems to preview American politics by six months, right? Brexit, Trump, et cetera. Doris, this is a western democracy thing, larger thing here. Put it in some quick perspective.
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:
I mean I think what's happening is that western democracies have not answered the needs of people, the prosperity of their countries has not been shared by a lot of people who feel out of the system. People in the country feel split up from people in the cities. Then they're blaming them on people. Immigrants become a scapegoat in all of these countries. It's a huge problem if a democracy doesn't share its prosperity and allow people to have mobility to rise to the level of their discipline and talent. And it's being felt in all these democracies right now. They haven't worked. And they have to work at that before we are going to see this everywhere.
CHUCK TODD:
A great way to end that. Thank you very much. That's all we have for today. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoy the rest of your Memorial Day weekend. We'll be back next week because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press."

Dr. Fernstrom: Self-esteem vs. self-confidence — and how to boost both!,www.nbcnews.com,"Madelyn Fernstrom, PhD",05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/know-your-value/feature/dr-fernstrom-self-esteem-vs-self-confidence-how-boost-both-ncna1008986,"All of us go on an emotional health journey throughout life. And two behavioral health concepts are a big part of this: self-confidence and self-esteem. While these terms are often lumped together as the same thing, they’re not. For example, say you are in a brainstorming meeting at work, and your boss is distributing future tasks. A self-confident person with low self-esteem will typically volunteer for every part of the project, offering to help, and taking whatever assignments are needed to get the job done. She doesn’t feel sure of herself as a person, but knows she can deliver what is needed.
In contrast, the person with high self-esteem and low-confidence will work on aligning herself with the most exciting parts of the project, as part of a strong team, so she shines, but doesn’t feel personally accountable about her ability to deliver.
Understanding this difference can go a long way toward boosting a positive mental attitude.
Self-confidence is outward facing, the ability to interact successfully with the world around you. It’s built over time, with a defined set of skills and achievements you can rely on. It’s typically easier to build self-confidence than self-esteem, but the two are intertwined in different ways. For example, many people are very self-confident, but have low self-esteem.
Some signs of self-confidence:
-Appreciating and trusting your own abilities
-Not being afraid to be wrong
-Avoiding judging other people
-Confidence to deliver on commitments
-Asking for help when needed
-Adaptability and flexibility
Stacey Abrams to women: Don't let others disqualify your ambition April 4, 2019 08:02 Self-esteem is inward facing, an emotional and cognitive assessment of your own “worth,” of self-respect and how you value yourself. “I don’t feel good about myself” is often a phrase used by people struggling with self-esteem. Self-esteem issues shouldn’t be ignored, because it’s the filter through which your everyday life is lived, and the basis for how you interact with the world in both personal and work relationships. And not valuing yourself leads to negative behaviors, like the constant need to please, or always being submissive.
Some signs of positive self-esteem:
-Good grooming and lifestyle habits
-Avoiding negative self-talk
-Appreciating the skills of others
-Being able to say “yes” and “no” when you choose
-Accepting your shortcomings and limitations
-Resilience (ability to bounce back from disappointments or changes)
Building your self-confidence and/or self-esteem takes time. Think about the qualities you’d like to work on, and look for some practical solutions. Remember that it’s a process you refine and continue to develop throughout life.
Starting tip to boost self-esteem : Be accepting of yourself, and avoid comparing yourself to others.
Starting tip to boost self-confidence : Develop an “all of us are equal” mentality. Others are not better or more deserving than you.
Whether you open a discussion with a trusted family member or friend, or reach out for professional help with a therapist, counselor or support group – it can be a big step toward a happier life.

Yasmin Vossoughian: How I learned to stop worrying and love my giant purple birthmark,www.nbcnews.com,Yasmin Vossoughian,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/know-your-value/feature/yasmin-vossoughian-how-i-learned-stop-worrying-love-my-giant-ncna1009631,"I have a birthmark, a big purple one. And it takes up my entire left leg. If I am wearing sandals you see it. A dress, you see it. A long or short skirt, you see it. Basically, if I ever tried to rob a bank with shorts on, I would be identified immediately. “Wanted: Woman with Purple Leg Who Walked out with $5 Million” (I have big ambitions). For the last 40 years, I’ve been learning to accept myself, appreciate what I have and honor what makes me different. But some days are harder than others, especially now that summer is almost here and we start to shed clothing.
I am a journalist and news anchor and I have spent the majority of my adult professional life in front of the camera. As a woman, you already have an intense amount of scrutiny when it comes to the way you look, particularly on TV. The comments on your clothing, hair, makeup and weight are relentless.
MSNBC anchor Yasmin Vossoughian. Anthony Scutro I get more feedback on how I look than on what I say. I spend hours every day reading, calling sources, analyzing, reporting, writing and interviewing. And yet, at times I am reduced to the wrong color dress, an extra five pounds or showing too much cleavage.
The idea of adding scrutiny over my birthmark has often felt too much. Imagine turning your TV on tomorrow morning and seeing me sitting there with a dress and a purple leg. I can’t help but wonder: “What would you think? What would the executives that pay my salary think? Would it distract even more from the incredibly important news we’re trying to deliver? Would your opinion of me change? Would you think I was ugly or pretty? Would you wonder what exactly happened to me?”
Those are the thoughts that run through my head everyday when I get dressed for work. Instead of dealing with all those unknowns, I have previously chosen to cover up with pants, tights, whatever. But as the days get longer and warmer, those decisions get harder. And guess what? It hurts.
Worrying thoughts have encapsulated my life in some way for as long as I can remember — from teenage angst in dating, to starting college and meeting new people, to entering the work force and choosing a career that thrust me into the spotlight, to finding my husband and meeting everybody in his life.
Yasmin Vossoughian, right, says she has learned to embrace her birthmark. But as a child, she didn't always feel that way. Courtesty of Yasmin Vossoughian Once when I was 13 years old, I had just began to think about boys and their opinions. As I was getting dressed for school on a hot, early June day, my mom and I had discovered a cream to use to cover up my leg and create the illusion I had two “normal” legs. Well, this morning the color just wasn’t right. Despite our best efforts it looked wrong and fake. As hard as I tried, it just wasn’t working. I got so upset, crying to my mom, wondering “why me?” That was a bad day.
But not all days were like that. In college, I embraced my birthmark, showed it confidently and proudly — some would say too proudly. I wore shorts that may have been too short or a dress that looked more like a T-shirt. In both of those instances, there was one theme: questions of acceptance. Will he accept me? Will the world accept me?
Vossoughian, second from right, singing karaoke with friends in college. Courtesy of Yasmin Vossoughian. Yet I never asked the most important question. Do I accept myself? Instead, I found different ways to cope, including a decade-long eating disorder, chronic anxiety, overachieving and trying to be everything to everybody so they couldn’t see what I was hiding: a lack of self- acceptance and self-worth.
So often, as women, we base our self-worth on others. But, to be most comfortable in your own skin is to accept yourself, to like yourself. To me, this has been the hardest thing to do. With time, I am beginning to realize that I can choose to elevate my self-confidence and self- acceptance or knock it down. For me, seeing it as a choice is crucial and it’s a choice I have to consciously make every day. How do I do it? How do I not constantly allow myself to only be a reflection of others? I am working on that. I owe it to myself.
I am beginning to try and notice when I say horrible things to myself in my head that I would never say to myself. The next time you wonder if other people think you are smart or pretty enough, pause. Ask yourself, like I have been doing “Does it even matter?” When I go home and hug my kids at night, do they care? No, they think I am the smartest, kindest, most able-bodied person they know. And I’ve found that helps me put things in perspective. Remind yourself, as I try to do: This is who you are, and everyone else just needs to accept it.
Yasmin Vossoughian with her sons Azur and Noor Clifford. Courtsey of Yasmin Vossoughian. I’ve also found mantras help. When you look in the mirror, come up with a mantra, and repeat it throughout the day. I have a reminder in my phone that my husband put there. It pops up every day, and it says, “Believe in yourself…God, family and friends love you very much.” While it’s just a sentence, I need it.
And, take care of yourself. We spend our lives taking care of others, making sure everybody else is doing well. But what about taking care of you? Go for a walk or a run, eat good food, drink water and most importantly find a way to reflect or meditate. Your meditation may come in the form of exercise, walking the dog, or yoga (my preferred method.) All of this contributes to getting one step closer to self-acceptance. After all, we have only one body and one mind with one chance to use them.
Finally, root for yourself but remember it is OK to have hard days. I still have them, particularly when the air turns warmer and I worry about my different body and how the world will judge it. But, the struggle just makes us stronger. We are only given what we can handle.
I will leave you with this, you just read my coming out story. I have never publicly revealed that I have a long, purple leg. While I hope you accept it, if you don’t, know that I can handle it.
Today is a good day."

Breaking News Emails May 26, 2019, 8:37 PM UTC By Tim Stelloh San Francisco’s police union called on the city’s police chief to resign on Saturday over his handling of a widely criticized raid on a local reporter’s home earlier this month . In a letter to members, union president Tony Montoya called on Chief Bill Scott to step down one day after Scott apologized for the May 10 raid on the home of freelance reporter Bryan Carmody. According to NBC Bay Area , Scott said he was concerned about how department investigators dealt with Carmody’s status a journalist, adding: “This has raised important questions about our handling of this case and whether the California shield law was violated,” Scott said, referring to a state law that protects journalists. San Francisco Police Chief William Scott answers questions during a news conference, May 21, 2019, in San Francisco. Eric Risberg / AP file The department was admonished by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, the Washington Post Editorial Board , press freedom groups and others, though police officials initially defended it, saying the move represented “a step in the process of investigating a potential case of obstruction of justice along with the illegal distribution of confidential police material.” The raid occurred after a confidential source leaked to Carmody a police report with details about the death of San Francisco’s public defender, Jeff Adachi. The city’s medical examiner found that trace amounts of cocaine and alcohol found in Adachi’s system contributed to his death. Carmody sold a story about the report to some local news outlets. The story — which included photos of the apartment where Adachi was found unresponsive — was condemned by Adachi’s family and local officials, and police officials promised to hold the leaker accountable.

Carmody (@bryanccarmody) May 11, 2019 During the raid, Carmody said that officers knocked down the gate of his home with a sledgehammer and seized thousands of dollars in electronics after he refused to identify his source. In Saturday’s letter, Montoya said that the investigation into the leak “is a righteous one” but said Scott appeared to be trying to dodge responsibility by blaming investigators. “Chief Scott not only followed every twist and turn of the investigation but he knew every element of the investigation, directed the investigation and has clearly either come down with the most debilitating case of amnesia or is flat out not telling the truth about his direct involvement and the horribly flawed direction he gave to find the leak of the police report,” Montoya said. “In either case, it is time for Chief Scott to go.” In a statement Sunday, a police department spokesman did not directly address the union's demand but said its handling of the raid would be investigated ""on all levels"" by the Department of Police Accountability. ""Chief Scott has made it abundantly clear that transparency and accountability are paramount in this criminal investigation,"" the statement said. Carmody did not respond to a request for a comment, though a statement attributed to his lawyer, Ben Berkowitz, said there needs to be “real reform” to ensure that “the SFPD respects the First Amendment and the independence of a free press.” Tim Stelloh"

Daniel Smith / Disney Breaking News Emails May 27, 2019, 1:56 AM UTC By Associated Press LOS ANGELES — Moviegoers voted with their dollars and chose the familiar over the new this Memorial Day weekend. The Walt Disney Co.'s live-action remake of ""Aladdin"" crushed the competition at the box office, which included two new original R-rated films that opened as counterprogramming to the family pic: The critically acclaimed teen comedy ""Booksmart"" and the horror movie ""Brightburn."" But the strategy didn't quite work. ""Aladdin"" did better than expected, grossing an estimated $86.1 million to take the top spot at the North American box office, according to studio estimates on Sunday. It'll likely pass $100 million by Monday. The others didn't even break $10 million. ""Aladdin,"" a musical-adventure directed by Guy Ritchie, stars Will Smith, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott and draws heavily on the music and story of the 1992 animated film (the top earner of that year) that it's based on. ""We're delighted,"" said Cathleen Taff, Disney's president of theatrical distribution. ""Between the fun action-adventure and spectacular music combined with the cast, which is so charming and has such great chemistry together, we've hit something that fans are embracing and walking out of wanting to share with others."" Audiences, who were 54% women and 51% families, gave the remake an A CinemaScore, which is much more promising for its continued success than the tepid critical reviews. The studio also got another metric with the newly launched verified Rotten Tomatoes audience rating. Over 7,000 people rated the film to give it a 93%. ""I'm so pleased that Rotten Tomatoes launched this, it means people bought the ticket. You can trust that people giving you the score actually sat through the movie,"" Taff said. ""We couldn't ask for a better barometer of fan reception."" With an international gross of $121 million, ""Aladdin"" has already earned over $207 million globally. It cost a reported $183 million to produce. The top few spots at the holiday box office were populated by known brands and sequels. ""John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum,"" now in its second weekend, placed second with $24.4 million. ""Avengers: Endgame"" took third with $16.8 million, and ""Pokémon Detective Pikachu"" landed in fourth with $13.3 million. Original films are struggling to attract significant audiences at the moment. Sony's modestly budgeted horror movie ""Brightburn"" opened in fifth with $7.5 million. The James Gunn-produced film starring Elizabeth Banks puts a sinister spin on the Superman myth and has received mediocre reviews from critics. A surprise for many, however, was ""Booksmart,"" an Annapurna film distributed by United Artists Releasing, which debuted in sixth with only $6.5 million, despite excellent reviews and steady buzz from its SXSW film festival debut. Although in line with studio expectations going into the weekend, some had thought that this would be a summer breakout hit.

Many compared it to ""Superbad,"" which opened in August 2007 to $33 million. But despite all the hype, including a lot of celebrity endorsements on social media from the likes of Natalie Portman and Ryan Reynolds, audiences just didn't turn out for ""Booksmart"" in noteworthy numbers. Wilde saw the writing on the wall Saturday and tried to change the course with a Twitter plea. ""Anyone out there saving @Booksmart for another day, consider making that day TODAY,"" Wilde wrote. ""We are getting creamed by the big dogs out there and need your support. Don't give studios an excuse not to green-light movies made by and about women."" Those who did make it to ""Booksmart"" were mostly women (61 and under the age of 35 (74%). And the target 17-34 age group gave a more favorable exit score (an A) than audiences overall, who gave it a B+. ""People are in a popcorn mood,"" Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. ""Films trying to be more introspective and fresh are having a tougher time getting their head above water."" Still, he noted, to have three R-rated films in the top 6 (""Brightburn,"" ''Booksmart"" and ""John Wick: Chapter 3"") is impressive. And one limited release that did manage to connect was the Laurel Canyon music documentary ""Echo in the Canyon,"" which earned an impressive $103,716 from two locations in Los Angeles. It expands to New York next week. The deficit is still running around 9% for the year, but next weekend could chip away at that with a diverse set of new offerings including the Elton John biopic ""Rocketman,"" ''Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" and the Octavia Spencer thriller ""Ma.""

Trump says he backs Japan's efforts to talk with Iran,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-says-he-backs-japan-s-efforts-talk-iran-n1010466,"TOKYO — President Donald Trump said Monday that he is not ""personally"" bothered by recent short-range missile tests that North Korea conducted this month, breaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is hosting the president on a four-day state visit full of pageantry. Standing beside Trump at a news conference after hours of talks, Abe disagreed with the U.S. president, saying the missile tests violated U.N. Security Council resolutions and were ""of great regret."" Abe, who has forged a strong friendship with Trump and agrees with him on many issues, is concerned because the short-range missiles pose a threat to Japan's security.
Trump was invited to Japan to be the first world leader to meet with its new emperor. Despite being far from Washington, he didn't miss the chance to lob another broadside against former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democrats seeking to challenge Trump in next year's presidential election. North Korea's Kim Jong Un recently criticized Biden as having a low I.Q. and Trump told the world he agreed with the authoritarian leader's assessment.
Trump meets with the prime minister of Japan on Memorial Day May 27, 2019 01:59 Abe is hosting Trump on a state visit designed to highlight the U.S.-Japan alliance and showcase the warm relations between the leaders. During hours of talks at Japan's Akasaka Palace, Trump and Abe also deliberated over economic issues, including trade and Iran, but North Korea's recent firing of short-range missiles emerged as an area of disagreement.
When asked if he was bothered by Pyongyang's short-range missile tests, Trump said: ""No, I'm not. I am personally not.""
The president has sought to downplay the significance of the missile tests, despite the fact that his own national security adviser, John Bolton, said over the weekend that they violated U.N. resolutions.
Trump continues to hold out hope of eventually getting Kim to agree to give up his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, despite two summits he's had with the North Korean leader that produced no concrete pledge to denuclearize the peninsula.
Trump praised Kim, calling him a ""smart man"" who might have launched the missiles earlier this month to ""get attention.""

KCNA VIA KNS / AFP - Getty Images ""All I know is there have been no nuclear tests, no ballistic missiles going out, no long-range missiles going out and I think that someday we'll have a deal,"" Trump said, adding that he is in ""no rush.""
Trump is correct when he said North Korea has not recently tested a long-range missile that could reach the U.S. But earlier this month, North Korea fired off a series of short-range missiles that alarmed U.S. allies in closer proximity to North Korea, including Japan. The tests broke a pause in North Korea's ballistic missile launches that began in late 2017.

""This is violating the Security Council resolution,"" Abe said, adding that, as North Korea's neighbor, Japan feels threatened. ""It is of great regret. But at the same time between Kim Jong Un and President Trump a certain new approach was taken and that is something that I pay tribute to.""
Inside a Japanese missile attack drill, as the North Korea threat looms Aug. 29, 2017 02:55 Earlier Monday, Trump said he backed Abe's interest in leveraging his country's good relations with Iran to help broker a possible dialogue between the U.S. and its nemesis in the Middle East. Abe said he is willing to do whatever he can to help to reduce escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
Trump and Abe discussed the issue earlier Monday. Abe could visit Iran next month.
""Peace and stability of (the) Middle East is very important for Japan and the United States and also for the international community as a whole,"" Abe said.
The leaders held hours of talks after the U.S. president — at Abe's invitation — became the first world leader to meet Japan's new emperor, Naruhito, who ascended to the throne May 1.

Trump's official visit also included golf with Abe, presenting a trophy to a sumo wrestling champion and dinner in Tokyo with their wives. The visit came with hours of one-on-one time for Trump and Abe, who has been trying to remain on Trump's good side despite disagreements between them on trade and other issues.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019 Trump didn't hold back at the news conference when he was asked about Biden, declaring himself ""not a fan.""
""Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-I.Q individual,"" Trump said, adding that Kim probably based his assessment on Biden's record and ""I probably agree with him on that.""
U.S. officeholders usually avoid engaging in politics while on foreign soil, hewing to the adage that politics stops at the water's edge. But Trump's sharp attack on Biden, though his declaration of agreement with Kim, set aside that long-standing norm.

CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP - Getty Images Trump and Abe largely glossed over their difference on trade, despite the potentially crippling tariffs on foreign autos that Trump is threatening to impose on Japan and the European Union. Trump declined to say what Japan would have to do to avoid those tariffs, but complained of an ""unbelievably large"" trade imbalance with the nation.
Still, he said he expects to reach trade deals at some point with both Japan and China, but wouldn't rush it.
""I think we will have a deal with Japan. Likewise, I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future,"" he said. Trump has tried to pressure China by slapping tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.
""I don't believe that China can continue to pay these really hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,"" he said.

Piles of trash that were dumped on the Brocket Hall Estate. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News Breaking News Emails May 27, 2019, 7:07 AM UTC By Yuliya Talmazan NEAR WELWYN GARDEN CITY, England — An old toilet and a rusty kitchen sink sit amid a massive heap of junk covering the floor of an ancient beech forest. Mattresses, old fridges, asbestos, office chairs and even a pink children's slide are mixed in with household and construction waste — with a mansion on the historic Brocket Hall Estate just a short walk away. An estimated 485 tons of trash were dumped in the greenery here over a five-day period last summer. Dating to 1760, Brocket Hall has been home to two British prime ministers and describes itself as a ""favorite country retreat of royalty."" Susannah Ireland / for NBC News Michael Longshaw, the estate’s managing director, says ""an enormous, almost like a military operation"" was required to get so much garbage there in such a short time. He is now bracing for a cleanup bill expected to reach £200,000 ($258,000). There is big money to be made in illegal dumping, and it can be made fast. And England's Environment Agency says ""networks of career criminals"" are increasingly getting involved in illegal dumping. ""They are not specialized waste crime criminals,"" North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Julia Mulligan told NBC News. ""They are largely organized criminals looking at ways in which they can make and launder money. This is another string to their bow, if you like.” Bluebells grow near piles of trash dumped near the Brocket Hall Estate, which is located around 22 miles north of central London. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News The Environment Agency says criminals resort to intimidation and even violence to gain access to potential dumping sites. Many victims are reluctant to go on the record about how they were targeted due to fear of reprisals. But some like Stuart Roberts, vice president of the National Farmers' Union for England and Wales, recounted the steps being taken to protect their land from the gangs. Trenches have been built around some properties, while others resort to installing reinforced gates and surveillance cameras or blocking access routes with slabs of concrete. “We have to take defending ourselves into our own hands,” Roberts said. At Brocket Hall, bluebells have bloomed around the garbage. A moat will be dug around the area once the waste is cleared. “It’s almost like going back to the Middle Ages,” Longshaw added. Michael Longshaw is the managing director of the Brocket Hall Estate. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News Because of the huge profits and light penalties, the head of the Environment Agency has called waste crime the ""new narcotics."" Sir James Bevan compared the current situation to how Britain once struggled to tackle that illegal trade. “It feels to me like drugs felt in the 1980s,"" Bevan added. ""The system hadn’t quite woken up to the enormity of what was going on and was racing to catch up.” While those convicted can go to jail, fines are often low in comparison to large profits that can be reaped. Few cases result in serious sentences, making the crime extremely lucrative and relatively low-risk. The money-making model criminals use is relatively simple. Legitimate waste carriers charge their customers a fee of several hundred pounds for the removal of each ton of waste. Almost half of that fee is paid to a licensed transfer station that then sorts and disposes of the waste. But criminals are offering to take waste at lower prices and then dump it at farms, industrial sites or on estates, such as at Brocket Hall. Brocket Hall Estate employee Andrew Scott surveys the junk he discovered last year. ""It's disgusting,"" he said. ""I still have no idea if it happens again, how we are going to stop it. It’s a nightmare."" Susannah Ireland / for NBC News They pocket the entire fee and leave landowners with hefty bills to remove the junk. Based on anecdotal information about the rates typically charged by criminal operators, it's estimated the culprits who dumped hundreds of tons of waste at the Brocket Hall Estate made at least £20,000 (nearly $26,000) from that location alone. ""And we are just one of the sites selected on that particular day,"" Longshaw said. The Environment Agency estimates illegal waste and the criminals behind such crimes divert as much as £1 billion ($1.3 billion) every year from legitimate businesses and Britain's Treasury. An independent review into serious and organized waste crime commissioned by the U.K. government last year found that some criminals go further. The U.K.’s environment minister has warned that some involved in waste crime use it as a cover for human trafficking, drug running and money laundering. Farmers are often the easiest prey. When security measures such as moats fail, Roberts says there is not much that can be done to protect themselves and their land. “You don’t go near those people,” he said. “You basically just report it to the police and look the other way because you can’t confront them."" Roberts said even if someone is caught and prosecuted, the fines they face are often laughable. “So actually, for them it’s almost a commercial cost,” he said. Lizzie Noel, who chaired the government's independent review into waste crime, said tracing criminals back to the waste they dump can be tricky for Environment Agency investigators. ""Part of the problem is that it’s not the police’s principle responsibility — the responsibility for investigating is spread across multiple agencies,"" Mulligan, who assisted Noel with the review, added. ""That complexity causes problems."" A pink children's slide is among the piles of waste left on the Brocket Hall Estate. Susannah Ireland / for NBC News The review also found it can cost anywhere from £10,000 to £500,000 ($13,000 to $660,000) to clear a single dump of waste. And the criminals often return with more junk once a site has been cleared, repeating the cycle. At Brocket Hall Estate, the area where the waste was dumped has now been fenced off and signs on trees advise that the site is being monitored. Longshaw wants the culprits to be held responsible for the costs incurred to return the land to idyllic English countryside, but no one has been arrested in the case. “I think there should be a mechanism put in place whereby the perpetrators of the crime pay for the cleanup. Simple as that,” he said. Yuliya Talmazan "

The eclipse that proved Einstein right and changed our understanding of the universe,www.nbcnews.com,Dan Falk,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/eclipse-proved-einstein-right-changed-our-understanding-universe-ncna1010151,"One hundred years ago this week, a total solar eclipse briefly blotted out the sun and gave humanity a new understanding of the universe. It was May 29, 1919, and English scientists were set to use the eclipse to test a revolutionary new theory of gravity known as general relativity — the brainchild of the not-yet-famous Albert Einstein. Relativity is now known as “one of the greatest achievements in human thought,” as Nobel-winning physicist J.J. Thompson called it later that year. But until the 1919 eclipse, relativity — which Einstein had presented in 1915 — was still unproven.
After months of preparation, Arthur Eddington, director of the Cambridge Observatory, had his telescopes and photographic equipment set up on the island of Principe, off the west coast of Africa. Another astronomer, Andrew Crommelin of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, had his gear in place in the Brazilian town of Sobral.
It wasn’t at all clear that the astronomers would succeed. Bad luck had stymied two earlier attempts to test Einstein’s theory . Weather got in the way of a test during a 1912 eclipse; two years later, plans for another test were scuttled by the outbreak of the First World War . But in May of 1919, the war was over and astronomers were hopeful that at last they would be able to see if Einstein was right.
A new conception of space, time and gravity For more than two centuries, gravity had been viewed the way Isaac Newton viewed it — as an attractive force between objects. But in 1915 Einstein had offered a new explanation for gravity, describing it not as a force but as a curvature of space caused by the presence of massive objects, including stars and planets.
That’s a bit hard to picture, but Einstein and his colleagues realized that if the theory was correct, it would have a simple, measurable effect: Gravity would shift the path of a beam of light by a tiny amount.
Albert Einstein in his study in Berlin in 1919 at the age of 40. AP We tend to think of light as perfectly weightless, but it’s not quite that simple. Light is a form of energy, and Einstein showed in his famous equation E=mc2 of 1905 that energy can behave like mass. That new understanding, plus Einstein’s discovery of curved space, meant that a beam of light should bend — that is, follow a curved rather than straight path — in response to gravity.
Any mass — a bowling ball, a mountain, the Earth — will bend a beam of light . But the astronomers knew that the deflection of light is proportional to the the mass of the object causing the deflection. To measure the tiny deflection, they needed something truly, colossally massive — something like our sun.
Imagine a beam of light speeding our way from a distant star, passing the sun on its path to Earth. As the light zooms past the sun, the sun’s gravity ought to bend the beam’s path, causing the star’s apparent position to be shifted by a small amount.
Related Space Space Space aliens are breeding with humans, university instructor says. Scientists say otherwise. “Einstein made this very insightful observation — that light ought to be affected by gravity,” says Daniel Kennefick, an astrophysicist and historian of science at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. That means that a beam of light will be deflected by a small amount, “and we ought to be able to measure this deflection.”
Making such a measurement is tricky. Most of the time the sun is so bright that it’s impossible to observe stars that lie near it in the sky. But for a few minutes during a solar eclipse, the moon blots out the sun’s light , the background stars can be photographed and their positions can be pinpointed.
Of course, total solar eclipses are rare, happening only about once a year and visible only along a narrow band on Earth’s surface. Complicating things is the fact that Einstein’s theory predicts only a tiny shift of starlight — comparable to the width of a nickel viewed from a mile away. Telescopes and photographic plates of the era were just barely capable of detecting such a small shift.
“Through cloud. Hopeful.” Simply getting to the sites to view the 1919 eclipse was no easy matter, says Kennefick, whose new book, ""No Shadow of a Doubt,"" tells the story of this crucial test of Einstein’s theory. Back then, it took at least a year to organize an eclipse expedition, and no one knew how long the war would drag on. In November of 1918 — six months before the eclipse — Eddigton and Crommelin ""were on the verge of calling it off,” Kennefick says. “Had the war not ended a week later, they probably would have given up.”
In the end, the weather was mixed. Skies at Sobral were clear. But Principe was covered by clouds, which cleared just long enough for Eddington’s team to obtain a few photographs before the eclipse ended.
Eddington sent a three-word telegram to his colleagues back in London: “Through cloud. Hopeful.”
During the eclipse, two heliostats with movable mirrors were used to direct images of the eclipsed sun into a pair of horizontal telescopes. Measurement of photographs taken through these instruments was checked for any deflection of star positions adjacent to the sun. SSPL via Getty Images After the eclipse was over and the astronomers had returned home, it took them months to measure the precise positions of the stars visible on the photographic plates. In the end, they concluded that the starlight was indeed shifted — and by an amount consistent with Einstein’s theory.
England’s Astronomer Royal, Frank Dyson, presented the results at a joint meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Royal Society held on November 6, 1919 in London. Dyson said “there can be no doubt” that the eclipse measurements “confirm Einstein’s prediction.”
Einstein becomes a celebrity The London Times reported the news the next day and the New York Times a couple of days later — and Einstein shot to worldwide fame. And despite the head-scratching complexity of general relativity, the confirmation of Einstein’s theory resonated with millions around the world.
“Here was this remarkable news, that all of a sudden Newton’s theory was being overthrown, to be replaced by a theory from this guy [Einstein] that they’ve never heard of,” Kennefick says. “And the theory was said to be so brilliant that few people could understand it. That was, I think, very dramatic for people.”
Indeed, people seemed to latch on to the theory despite — or perhaps because of — its complexity.
“General relativity was the poster child for being a crazy, new, hard-to-understand theory, with dramatic implications for the nature of reality,” says Caltech physicist Sean Carroll. “And yet you could see [the results]; you could photograph it. So people got caught up in that excitement.”
Over the years, historians have questioned whether the results of the 1919 test had been reported accurately. Some have argued that Eddington, in particular, was so eager to prove Einstein correct that he cleaned up the data — or perhaps even omitted data points that didn’t seem to fit. But Kennefick says subsequent analysis of the observational data obtained in 1919 confirmed the original finding — and that Einstein’s theory did, in fact, pass its great test.
Relativity has been confirmed dozens of times in the ensuing decades, with much greater accuracy — and has led to the discovery of other mind-bending wonders, including black holes and gravitational waves .

Richardson / Denver Post via Getty Images Breaking News Emails May 27, 2019, 8:37 AM UTC By Phil McCausland The Trump administration's ban on goods produced by a Chinese tech giant would seem to have little to do with rural America. But rural cell service providers across the U.S. are almost entirely dependent on the company, Huawei, which produces inexpensive wireless communications equipment. These small telecom companies now face billions of dollars in costs or the end of their businesses entirely after the Trump administration effectively banned the Chinese company last week over spying accusations. It is a prospect that could leave vast swaths of rural America with no cell service. In response, a bipartisan group of senators proposed legislation that would create a pool of $700 million to help local carriers replace their technology. Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., during a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee executive session on Jan. 16, 2019. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call / AP This legislation ""offers relief to those providers that need to replace foreign equipment within their networks while augmenting the availability of secure 5G networks for all Americans,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. The problem is that $700 million is not nearly enough cash. ""We estimated that we needed $800 million to $1 billion for our carriers, but that only covers about a dozen companies,"" Carrie Bennet, general counsel for the Rural Wireless Association, told NBC News. ""I don't want to insult the bill they've introduced,"" she added. ""It's great that someone has focused on what this is going to cost, but this is not enough money."" High price of rural wireless The Huawei ban will force many wireless providers to turn to expensive European technology, as there are few American alternatives. Companies will have to rip out and replace everything they have already installed and hire highly-trained professionals to work on and install their network hardware. That doesn't come cheap. SI Wireless, a rural Kentucky and Tennessee provider with about 20,000 customers, would have to spend $40 to $60 million replacing its Huawei equipment, the company said in a FCC filing. FCC announces $20B fund to help wireless companies transition to 5G April 12, 2019 01:02 Viaero Wireless, with 110,000 customers in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming and South Dakota, said 80 percent of its core equipment was produced by Huawei, according to the FCC filing. Replacing it could cost as much as $410 million. Union Wireless has 40,000 customers across Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Idaho. With 75 percent of its network equipment from Huawei, it would have to spend $300 million to comply. Those are only a few of the dozens of companies that are affected by the ban. Gigi Sohn, a former counselor to the FCC chairman in the Obama administration and currently a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law and Policy, said lawmakers should be taking a wider view. ""If they can't use Huawei equipment, it's going to cost even more without a significant infusion — and $700 million ain't the answer,"" Sohn said. ""These rural areas are going to not get served, and it puzzles me why these senators, many of whom are from states that are almost entirely rural, don't see the problem here."" What is Huawei, and is it dangerous to America? May 24, 2019 06:29 Besides Wicker from Mississippi, the bill's Senate sponsors include Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Mark Warner, D-Va., Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska. That this could potentially derail dozens of small American companies — disrupting service to millions of Americans — is no secret. Almost exactly a year ago, several rural telecom companies warned in written testimony to the Federal Communications Commission that a ban on Huawei could effectively bankrupt them and force their customers to lose access to a consistent cellular network. ""The relative cost of both replacement and next-generation equipment will rise as a result of the proposed rule, as will the cost of borrowing,"" the Competitive Carriers Association wrote in an 86-page comment to the FCC in June 2018. ""Lower-cost providers will be pushed out of the market, which will reduce overall supply and increase demand for the higher-cost providers."" Could major telecoms ensure rural access? Major providers — companies like Verizon and AT&T — don't have a lot of incentive to cover rural areas, as it is expensive to serve a small number of people. In that market vacuum, local telecom companies have taken up the mantle to connect these rural communities. That could change. T-Mobile and Sprint, the third and fourth largest wireless providers respectively, have proposed a merger. To push the deal through and receive the FCC's blessing, the companies promised to provide a 5G network to 90 percent of the U.S. rural population ""within six years of the merger's close,"" according to an FCC filing they submitted on Monday . Bennet of the Rural Wireless Association said her organization ""vehemently opposes the merger"" largely because she thinks that they won't be able to deliver to rural customers, especially with that optimistic of a timeline and without the cheap Huawei technology. ""That they're going to be able to deliver any of that is so bogus,"" she said. ""I don't know what they're smoking, but get me some of that."" Bennet isn't the only one unconvinced. Sohn said T-Mobile and Sprint will tell the FCC nearly anything to get permission to proceed with the deal, especially since doubts have arisen about whether it will ever go through. Reuters reported last week that the Justice Department recommended blocking the deal. ""They're so desperate to get the merger they're making these wildly optimistic promises on build out,"" Sohn said. ""But honestly, who is going to hold them to those promises?"" Unfortunately, it is going to be rural people who suffer if small providers disappear, Sohn said. ""If they go away, who is really, honestly going to be left to serve these communities?"" she said.

The merged company would reshape the global industry: it would make some 8.7 million vehicles a year, leapfrogging General Motors and trailing only Volkswagen and Toyota. Shares of both companies jumped over 10 percent on the news of the offer, which would see each side's shareholders split ownership in the new manufacturer. Renault welcomed the idea. The company's board met Monday at its headquarters outside Paris to discuss the proposal and said afterward that Renault will study it ""with interest."" A merger would save 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) for the two companies each year by sharing research, purchasing costs and other activities, Fiat Chrysler said in a statement. It said the deal would involve no plant closures, but didn't address potential job cuts. The companies are somewhat complementary: Fiat Chrysler is stronger in the U.S. and SUV markets, while Renault is stronger in Europe and on electric vehicle developments.

""If you lose an election, if you lose seats, you have to be modest,"" the former Dutch foreign minister said. ""We have lost seats and this means that we have to be humble.""
Spanish caretaker Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was a notable exception, as his victorious Socialists looked set to win 20 of the country's 54 seats in the European Parliament.
Although still trickling in, results show that the EPP is set to secure 179 seats, down from 217 five years ago. The Socialists are slated to win 150, down from 187.
The two parties have dominated the parliament with a combined majority since elections were first held in 1979. Senior figures from the EPP hold the top posts in the E.U.'s three main institutions: parliament president, head of the E.U.'s powerful executive commission and European Council president, who chairs summits of European presidents and prime ministers.
While real power in Europe remains in the hands of the 28 member states, the assembly's influence has grown. It's helped improve air flight safety in Europe, cut down on plastics use, end mobile telephone roaming charges inside the bloc, boost data privacy, and cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars.
The parliament also has an important say in international treaties ranging from trade talks to Brexit.

The pro-business liberals, or ALDE, backed by French President Emmanuel Macron — whose Republic on the Move party is set to win 23 seats, the same number as Le Pen's National Rally — insist that Europe's traditional political certainties are a thing of the past.

Party group leaders begin their horse-trading Monday to see what kind of stable alliance can be established and who might secure the E.U.'s top jobs. Their decisions will set the stage for E.U. leaders, who meet over dinner Tuesday to see where the political pieces lie and discuss potential candidates.

"On Memorial Day, honor the service members who gave their lives by helping those who made it home",www.nbcnews.com,Dr. Katherine Mitchell,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/memorial-day-honor-service-members-who-gave-their-lives-helping-ncna1006931,"On Memorial Day, the best way to honor those who gave their lives in service to our country is by giving the best possible care, compassion and support to those who lived to come home. A veteran in my community — who I watched move from a struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder and head trauma to being a college graduate and future history teacher — taught me that. Men and women like him teach me — the mother of a Navy veteran and a civilian social worker who serves returning veterans — what it means to be dedicated to a mission, to care for their brother and sister veterans, and to overcome and adapt to the challenges of returning to civilian life after military service.
Returning veterans are leaving a culture in which they are trained for war, and in which every aspect of their daily lives is regulated, to return to a civilian society in which most people have not served and have no idea what the troops have experienced.
 Trump's proposed Memorial Day pardons dishonor veterans — and pervert justice Many veterans are able to navigate the transition with minimal support; they find new missions and purpose and make valuable contributions to their communities. However, a significant percentage of veterans struggle with physical and psychological challenges that call for services and support from both the Department of Veterans Affairs and the many dedicated civilian providers working in communities across the nation.
For example, veterans have between four and 10 times the risk for PTSD symptoms than t he general population in a given year, and about 10-12 percent suffer with major depression . As many as 22 percent of recent veterans suffer with symptoms of traumatic brain injury and have twice the risk of suicidal ideation . Studies show that many veterans are also at increased risk for suicide, substance use disorders and homelessness. Approximately 20 veterans or active duty service members take their own lives every day .
Clearly, there is much work to be done. But what can civilians do to help?
 Why do so many U.S. service members return home to unemployment? In my own experience as a community-based mental health provider, I’ve seen that a veteran’s transition process can last for months and even years. There is much that can be done to support them in this process.
First, we must recognize that veterans know how to ""adapt and overcome."" Given the opportunity, they can take the self-discipline, camaraderie and service they used while on active duty and put them to good use in any area of their lives. They may be struggling with a variety of physical or mental health challenges, but they are far from broken.
Veterans have been trained to stay focused on the mission and not acknowledge pain or the perceived weakness of asking for help. While a necessity in war, this mindset can be a persistent obstacle when transitioning to civilian life. Civilians close to them can remind them that it's not a weakness to ask for help.
Over time, with a combination of support from peers and professional mental health counseling, veterans may become open to the possibility of accessing support services — both community-based and at the VA — to help them with housing, education, substance abuse treatment, vocational training, couple and relationship support, as well as a wide variety of peer support activities.
Next, our government must provide veterans with better and easier access to care. The implementation in June of the 2018 Mission Act , which expands veterans’ ability to access health care in their communities instead of waiting for openings at a VA health services center, is a good start. The VA, in combination with qualified community-based providers, is taking a big step toward making health care and counseling services more easily accessible.
We must also work to expand nonclinical peer support programs, like the Joseph Dwyer Veteran Peer Support Project in Suffolk County, New York, with which I work. Peer mentor relationships can be a soft way to help any reluctant veteran access the multitude of services and programs available to them.
 Women in the military deserve more than thank-yous. They deserve to be safe from sexual assault. By expanding access to community-based providers trained to work with military personnel, adding more VA satellite locations in rural areas, and developing community-based peer support programs, we can create an accessible, community-based approach that brings needed care to both veterans and their families.
Finally, it is vitally important to train civilian medical and mental health professionals to be effective, culturally competent service providers aware of the distinct challenges that veterans face. As the VA gears up to roll out the Mission Act programs, social workers and other community-based providers must become culturally competent partners in order to extend effective, accessible care to those who’ve given so much.
Social workers such as myself can lead the way in workforce training and delivering high quality care to support veterans’ adjustment processes, as well as honor the service members who never got that opportunity.

"Israel lurches toward unprecedented political crisis, Netanyahu faces possible 2nd election",www.nbcnews.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/israel-lurches-toward-unprecedented-political-crisis-netanyahu-faces-possible-2nd-n1010536,"Elections Israel lurches toward unprecedented political crisis, Netanyahu faces possible 2nd election Trumped weighed in on the events and said he hopes ""Bibi"" will prevail. The prime minister said there's a 48-hour deadline. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem on May 5, 2019. Abir Sultan / Pool via AP file Breaking News Emails May 27, 2019, 2:45 PM UTC / Updated May 27, 2019, 7:12 PM UTC By Associated Press JERUSALEM — Israel's parliament on Monday passed a preliminary motion to dissolve itself. The move further pushed the country toward an unprecedented political impasse, less than two months after elections seemed to promise Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a new mandate. If the bill receives final passage in a vote scheduled Wednesday, Israel would be forced to hold new elections — sending the political system into disarray. Netanyahu appeared to have a clear path to victory, and a fourth consecutive term, after the April 9 elections. His Likud party emerged tied as the largest party in the 120-seat parliament, and with his traditional allies, he appeared to control a solid 65-55 majority. But he has struggled to form a government ahead of a looming deadline to do so. His prospective coalition has been thrown into crisis in recent days by former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, an ally and sometimes rival of Netanyahu's. Netanyahu delivered a primetime statement on Monday calling on his potential partners to put ""the good of the nation above every other interest"" in order to avoid sending the country once again to ""expensive, wasteful"" elections. He placed the blame on Lieberman for creating the crisis, but said he was hopeful his efforts to salvage a compromise in the next 48 hours would succeed. Netanyahu: Finds site for new 'community named after President Trump' May 12, 2019 00:47 Lieberman has insisted on passing a new law mandating that young ultra-Orthodox men be drafted into the military, like most other Jewish males. Netanyahu's ultra-Orthodox allies demand that the draft exemptions remain in place. Without the five seats of Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party, Netanyahu cannot muster a majority. ""The draft law has become a symbol and we will not capitulate on our symbols,"" Lieberman defiantly said, vowing to press for new elections if his demands are not met. Netanyahu and Lieberman met Monday evening in a last-ditch effort to find a compromise. Israeli media said the meeting ended without any progress, and quoted Likud officials as saying Netanyahu would soon order new elections. Netanyahu's ruling Likud has traditionally had an alliance with ultra-Orthodox and nationalist parties. But Lieberman, a former top Netanyahu aide, is a wild card. Though stanchly nationalist, he also champions a secular agenda aimed toward his political base of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Likud insists Lieberman is motivated by his personal spite for Netanyahu and has launched a vicious campaign against him in recent days. But Lieberman says he is driven by ideology and will not be a hand to religious coercion. ""I will not be a partner to a Halachic state,"" he said, using the word for Jewish law. Ultra-Orthodox parties consider conscription a taboo, fearing that military service will lead to immersion in secularism. But years of exemptions have generated widespread resentment among the rest of Jewish Israelis. A stalemate on the issue was one of the factors that shortened the term of the previous coalition government, which Lieberman resigned from months before elections were called because he disagreed with its policy toward the Gaza Strip. Dissolving parliament would be a shocking turn of events for Netanyahu, who has led the country for the past decade. ""We invite Lieberman to join us today and not contribute to the toppling of a right-wing government,"" a statement by Likud read. President Donald Trump waded into Israeli politics and tweeted support for Netanyahu, saying he was ""hoping things will work out with Israel's coalition formation and Bibi and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever."" Hoping things will work out with Israel's coalition formation and Bibi and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever. A lot more to do! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2019 Trump's bolstering of Netanyahu came under attack from Israeli critics who called it an intervention in their electoral matters, while the prime minister himself acknowledged Trump's backing in a live TV broadcast on Monday evening. With the 42-day timeline allotted to Netanyahu to sign agreements with his partners and present his new government set to expire late Wednesday, his Likud party presented the paperwork to dissolve the parliament. The Knesset passed the bill on Monday with 65 members of parliament voting in favor. But the motion could still be pulled at any moment before Wednesday's vote if a compromise is found. The main opposition party, Blue and White, which also controls 35 seats, appealed for a chance to form a coalition. But a parliamentary vote for dissolution would automatically trigger new elections. Blue and White has ruled out any alliance with Netanyahu. If Wednesday's final vote passes, it would mark the first time the scenario had played out in Israel and set the stage for an unprecedented second election in the same calendar year. Polls indicate the results of a new election would not be much different from the last one. Associated Press"
She's got a plan for that. Warren tries to breakout with flurry of policy proposals.,www.nbcnews.com,Ali Vitali,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/she-s-got-plan-warren-tries-breakout-flurry-policy-proposals-n1010301,"SALEM, Iowa — When voters ask Sen. Elizabeth Warren about her plan for universal child care, she's likely to launch into a story about her Aunt Bee — a woman who, as the candidate tells it, came to help, arriving ""with seven suitcases and a Pekingese named Buddy"" — and stayed for 16 years. It's a story to tell voters more about Warren herself, but it also serves to highlight one of her many policy prescriptions for the country.
The Massachusetts Democrat has churned out a consistent stream of policy proposals since getting in the president race , with more than a dozen in-depth plans ranging from leveraging public lands in the fight against climate change to student loan debt forgiveness . While other candidates have worked to increase their name ID, Warren is pushing to make her name synonymous with having ""a plan for that"" — the thing that could differentiate her from the Democratic field of more than 20 contenders.
But while the consistent flurry of policy papers puts meat on the bone for reporters, as well as puts the pressure on fellow candidates, are voters clamoring for specifics?
For Warren, perhaps nowhere does the answer to that question matter more than in Iowa — where she’s banking on consolidating support to springboard her into the top tier of candidates in the state's first-in-the-nation caucuses early next year.
Elizabeth Warren speaks with a voter in Ottumwa, Iowa, on May 26, 2019. Rachel Mummey / Reuters She has a sizable presence on the ground in the Hawkeye State: Over 50 staffers — more than almost any of her competitors — who are hosting events, spreading Warren's message and signing Iowans up to caucus. The operation is costing her financially, but it may also be paying off.
In more than a dozen conversations over three days recently at events for multiple candidates, including Warren, voters told NBC News they wanted to hear specifics before making their choice — and that Warren was cementing herself as ""the policy candidate"" in the field.
""(Warren)'s the plan girl right now, isn't she?"" Keith Kuper of Ackley told NBC News Saturday in Iowa Falls. ""She really has specifics, plans on almost everything."" Kuper is leaning toward supporting Warren — and said other candidates on his radar, like South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, will need to be more specific if they want to peel off his support.
""I think Buttigieg has an amazing charisma and appeal, he's so smart, he handles himself so well,” Kuper said. But ""he is light on specifics."" If Buttigieg ""comes forward with progressive ideas and continues to show himself really strong in debates and so forth — and really strong against conservatism and Trumpism — you know, I could see myself switching over to him even though he's slight on specifics.”
Emma Dinneen, meanwhile, said she's already decided to caucus for Warren — “because of how she talks to us"" and ""the fact that she has definitive ideas,"" she said after a meet-and-greet event on Sunday with the candidate in Ottumwa, Iowa.
In the basement of a coffee shop in Iowa Falls on Saturday, Warren's was the first name that came to Kristi Harris' mind as someone in the Democratic field talking about policy.
""I want someone who knows how to solve problems,"" Harris said after an event for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Harris remains undecided, allowing that the choice will be ""difficult"" given the size of the field, but whoever she ultimately supports needs to ""understand the issues deeply.""
Warren has seen a polling surge in recent weeks , rising as high as third place nationally as voters tune in and learn more about the field.
""I talk about plans because its got to be not just that we go to Washington in order to talk about change, but we go to Washington to make change. That's the idea here,"" she told a crowd at sunset in Salem on Sunday.
And playing into her ""policy wonk"" reputation could be helping, Democratic strategist Joel Payne told NBC News, noting that Warren is ""using the 'plan' piece to engage more people"" in a way where other candidates have struggled.
Elizabeth Warren speaks during one of a series of local visits in Fairfield, Iowa, on May 26, 2019. Rachel Mummey / Reuters But the parsing of the Democratic field on policy stands in stark contrast with the incumbent that the eventual nominee will face in November of next year, who is known more for campaigning on catch phrases (""build the wall"") than policy white papers.
Democratic voters care deeply about beating Trump in 2020, listing it regularly as their top priority , but they want policy answers, too.
""I think America is ready for more than a personality,"" Carolyn Jones said on Sunday in Oskaloosa, while she waited in line for a selfie with Warren. ""We need policy right now, we need a backlash, a policy over what we've got right now, which is a personality and a character.""

Julian Assange's legal team prepares for a lengthy free speech battle,www.nbcnews.com,Linda Givetash,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/julian-assange-s-legal-team-prepares-lengthy-free-speech-battle-n1010281,"Julian Assange's legal team prepares for a lengthy free speech battle ""This precedent will be used against other media organizations,"" Assange's London-based counsel said. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange leaves Southwark Crown Court in London on May 1, 2019. Daniel Leal-Olivas / AFP - Getty Images Breaking News Emails May 27, 2019, 12:43 PM UTC By Linda Givetash LONDON — WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange is unlikely to land on American soil any time soon as his legal team gears up for a drawn-out battle that centers on his freedom of speech. The United States is seeking the extradition of Assange from Britain to face numerous charges for computer hacking and publishing classified material. The initial charge accused Assange of conspiring with former Army intelligence officer Chelsea Manning to crack a Department of Defense password, while another 17 charges under the Espionage Act were tacked on by the Department of Justice on Thursday . Assange's lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, told NBC News she's preparing for ""a big extradition fight"" and argued, along with advocates in the U.S., that the latest indictment threatens the First Amendment . ""We are concerned about the free speech implications,"" she said. ""This precedent will be used against other media organizations."" However, an extradition request related to a re-opened rape investigation in Sweden threatens to take priority. Assange is being held in a London jail after being taken out of the Ecuadorian embassy in April and arrested for jumping bail after originally being accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden in 2010. Although there is a clear process for extradition from the U.K., experts say Assange's case is unique on a number of grounds and could pose a lengthy legal battle. Assange lawyer on spying charges: 'A grave threat to freedom of speech' May 24, 2019 02:19 Assange's defense is likely to claim the charges are politically-motivated and violate his freedom of expression, protected by Article 10 in the European Convention on Human Rights, according to Michael Drury, a lawyer specializing in extradition cases for the London-based firm BCL Solicitors. It stands to be a ""highly unusual"" argument in an extradition case, Drury told NBC News. Extradition cases more often see claims that a defendant would be treated inhumanely or harmed. The U.S., Britain and European states also have a shared interest in the handling of state secrets since an agreement prompted by American officials to go after leakers was reached more than a decade ago, said Richard Aldrich, professor of international security at the University of Warwick. Countries are anxious about the possibility of journalists and groups like Wikileaks attaining and publishing secrets and intelligence online. ""This is all about trying to recover state secrecy,"" Aldrich explained. ""The U.S. said we can’t do anything about the journalists, but we will go after the sources and the leakers vigorously."" In the past 10 years, more sources and whistleblowers have been prosecuted in the U.S. than previously through history, he said. ""There's a major campaign, people are being put away under the espionage act for potentially decades and the United States is determined to make an example of these people,"" he said. Assange will likely find himself on trial in the U.S. where it will be up to the courts to decide whether he becomes one of those examples, Aldrich said, adding, ""but exactly how that happens is difficult to predict."" The U.S. is almost always successful in extradition cases from Britain, Drury said. British law requires the first hearing in an extradition case to be heard within 21 days of the order being filed. But given the complexity of the arguments, Drury said it could likely take up to a year for the case to be presented and delivered a verdict. If either side appeals the decision, it could extend the process another six to 12 months. In the meantime, it's unlikely Assange will be granted bail because of the previous breach, said Drury. With Swedish prosecutors announcing they have requested a detention order against Assange last week after reopening a sexual assault case against him, the entire U.S. extradition case could be further put on hold. Extradition is not normally a political decision, but Britain's home secretary has the power to suggest the courts prioritize one request over another. Last month, dozens of British lawmakers signed a letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid demanding he prioritize any extradition order made by Sweden. British politicians wanting ""to avoid being caught in the crossfire"" of the American legal showdown would be enticed to hand Assange over to the Scandinavian nation, said Aldrich. ""It’s more politically acceptable to extradite on the sorts of charges that the Swedes have raised."" But the political leadership in Britain is facing upheaval after Prime Minister Theresa May announced her resignation on Friday, adding to the uncertainty of which case would take priority. ""We could have any one of 10 candidates in Downing Street in very short order and each person would take a different view on this,"" Aldrich said. Even if Assange faces trial or is convicted in Sweden, Drury said he would eventually find his way back to British court to face the U.S. extradition order. ""Putting it entirely cynically, you can't get rid of the problem by sending him to Sweden,"" he said. Linda Givetash Linda Givetash is a reporter based in London.
