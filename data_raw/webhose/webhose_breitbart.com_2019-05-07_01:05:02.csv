She was foisted on them by the men in grey suits who run the party.
The Prime Minister has made speech after speech claiming to fulfil the wishes of the electorate. It was not therefore unreasonable, without the benefit of hindsight, to expect that she would do so. If a party is unwilling to deliver on its manifesto commitments (and both main parties fall into that category) what is the point of voting for any of them.
The responsibility is down to no-one else but the Prime Minister herself and the extent of her betrayal became evident at Chequers last year."

I saw it coming but I didn't think it would last. When Varry Insane Odumbass was elected the first time, I realized that the lethargy and lack of attention was real and that it might be too late. Throughout the eight years of Odumbass, I felt hopeless as he methodically dismantled the US Constitution and weaponized government agencies. I had felt the same way during the Carter Administration but the people awakened and elected Reagan. By midsummer of 2016, I knew Trump would be elected and that once again God had sent us a savior. But Trump has MUCH left to do if our constitutional republic is to be restored. I truly hope you're right in some of your observations and that Trump is slowly putting things right. He needs to pick up speed during his second term. I believe that, like Reagan, he will be elected in a massive landslide taking both the electoral collage and the popular vote. And we will need another equally dedicated patriot and non-politician to follow Trump if we are to sustain what he has done. Reagan's work fell by the wayside when the Republicans put up George H.W. ( globalist) Bush to follow him. H.W. had the charisma to sustain the constitutional republic after Reagan but he chose NWO instead then, by lying to the people about taxes he cut his NWO plans short...thank GOD. That ushered in a new run by the demo-communists who are exceedingly patient and willing to accept miniscule gains as long as they are permanent. And they're willing to accept losses, sometimes big ones, so long as they are temporary. Eventually, they have managed to pack government with their leftist colleagues creating the deep state that Trump is slowly dismantling. Like many, I will not be happy until the arrests are made and the hangings begin. I don't think I've got enough time left to see that."

You will never be able to approach such people with logic as their abusers in the EU have created a fear of change mentality that results in them being conditioned to normalize and accept the abuse that has been happening for decades.
The UK struggle to deliver the Brexit the people voted for illustrates exactly why the UK must leave the EU. It illustrates that the UK is a sovereign nation in name only as a charade to collect money for the throne in Brussels.
Without the money from the UK, the EU collapses and France and Germany are left responsible for the unsustainable EU bag they created. They cannot make up the difference by increasing taxes on the countries left in the EU as France is already showing it has been taxed enough."
