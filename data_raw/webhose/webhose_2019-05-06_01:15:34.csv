IN 2014, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SET THE RECORD FOR DENYING THE MOST FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS OF ANY ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY!!
IN 2015, IT TOPPED THIS FEAT!!!
Obama's corrupt DOJ spied on and collected personal information on Jim Rosen and AP reporters--AND EVEN WIRETAPPED JIM ROSEN'S MOTHER'S PHONE ON STATEN ISLAND, NY!!!!
The pandering press gave the limp-wristed, twisted narcissist Obama a garden party while they are putting President Trump through the flames of hell and yet Obama was such a petulant prick that he spied on the press, excluded Fox reporters and the ""transparent"" administration of Obama became the most secretive and paranoid of any in history!
Are you stupid-- or simply ignorant of the facts-- or both?"

I mentor a number of young men from West Africa who came to America - legally - and who are building their lives here. They left behind their cultures, their families and all they were comfortable and accustomed to to seek a better life and realize their dreams.
They made serious, adult, life changing decisions at a time in their lives where the average American boy's only concern is can I get mom and dad to pay for four years of college so I can party?
All of them are working hard, studying English and learning the culture and assimilating, which is where I come in - think Professor Higgins. All of them will succeed. I am white, less than young and fourth generation American.
They also all had parents who truly cared about them and kept them on the right track.
On the other hand, with African Americans caught in the web you described so ably above, the core problem I see is a lack of family cohesion. Kids being raised by mothers who had children while still basically children fathered by boys who didn't stick around.
The welfare system - designed by the Democrats - deliberately encouraged that syndrome and was devised to keep blacks down - though touted ostensibly, supposedly, to raise them up.
I live in a section of NYC where nary a white face is ever seen and have had the opportunity to see this effect first hand.
Until there is a true effort to get to the root of the problem by undoing the habit patterns that corrupted the progress blacks were making after WWII, there will be no real improvement."

So everything preceding that wasnâ€™t America of today or under our control, so 600,000 lives wasnâ€™t enough for 80 years of American slavery? Most of the country all colors immigrated here post civil war or close enough to it they were never part of the problem. Reparations are a practical impossibility and open up so many other social injustice claims, Chinese and the railroads, Japanese internmentâ€™s for starters. What immigrant is given a silver spoon?"

Different reparations rates for your race. If you are 1/16th, 1/8th, 1/4, you know just like they used to do.
Of course, it might get a little complicated with some being a mix of Native American and black. And of course there needs to be reparations from Native Americans too. Some of them were slave holders too."

1. Children raising children
2. No father around or if present abusive.
3. Growing up surrounded by boys and girls who similarly have no one to either set a good example or kick their butts to keep them in line
4. Coupled with In NYC, an abysmal, essentially useless ""school"" system that doesn't teach but indoctrinates.
5. And, as a consequence, means all the skills needed to get a job are never learned, which leaves only the paths of least resistance."
