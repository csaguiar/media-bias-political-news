Poway Unified School District , a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit rules that the First Amendment permits schools to impose viewpoint-discriminatory restrictions on student speech. The case arose when Tyler Harper wore an anti-homosexuality T-shirt to his high school in response to the school’s sponsorship of a gay-rights event. The school ordered Harper not to wear the T-shirt. Judge Stephen Reinhardt’s majority opinion rules that schools may bar “derogatory and injurious remarks directed at students’ minority status such as race, religion, and sexual orientation.” As Judge Alex Kozinski argues in his dissent, the school district “may have been justified in banning the subject [of homosexuality] altogether by denying both sides permission to express their views during the school day.” But having permitted the pro-gay speech, the school can’t be allowed to gag other viewpoints.
Harper’s complaint will be rendered moot when he graduates from high school. In March 2007, the Supreme Court will grant Harper’s petition for certiorari and vacate (i.e., wipe from existence) the Ninth Circuit’s ruling.

Easter & Good Friday Meditation | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,D. Keith Mano,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/easter-meditation/,"April 20, 2019 12:00 PM Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters)
Editor’s Note: This article was first published in the April 24, 1987, issue of National Review . * * *
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. Advertisement Advertisement
—Luke 22: 10–12
T here is a strange agency at work here. The Scripture might be haunted. That pitcher-bearer. This goodman. They spook me. Who are they, what special order of grace do they belong to? And, elsewhere, those men who surrender the colt “whereon yet never man sat.” Nameless, equivocal shapes. “Hey,” they shout, “why loose ye the colt?” The Lord has need of it, His disciples explain. Oh, well. In that case. Why didn’t you say so? Take our expensive animal. And has their free will been taken also? It is as if a casual, weird cast of accomplices inhabited Jerusalem. Men or suchlike who know, often better than fumbling Peter or over-literal Thomas, just how to ornament the Passion.
Were they perhaps made of some angelic stuff? I don’t think so: it is the Lord’s habit, thank God, to enlist men wherever convenient. He has an economical disposition. And Man was, after all, what this grand enterprise had been about from the first. But how then did Jesus, so to speak, make His room reservation in advance? Were these men sensitized by dreams? Did the Holy Spirit, foraging like a quartermaster sergeant, requisition their possessions through sign and vision? It is possible. The Lord had been known to trouble sleep. “And being warned of God in a dream . . . ” Was there fitfulness before the Passover? Advertisement Advertisement
Again, I think not. God prefers, when He can, to conserve terrestrial order. He has a dramatic instinct. And His own peculiar unities. The Passion is as naturalistic as frail wrist tissue shredded by a spike. Jesus could ferment water. He could infinitely divide the loaf and the fish. But here He had need of a furnished apartment. His colt might have come about providentially, as Abraham’s ram came about, caught in some thicket. But God wanted a known colt: one that had memorable references in Jerusalem. It was His purpose to leave a clear and historical track behind — evidence that might stand up in court. The presence of transcendent power among modest instruments is more persuasive than any bullying miracle could be.
I suppose it this way, then. That these — pitcher-bearer and goodman and colt-owner, these first acolytes of the Eucharist — were men given sudden and heightened perception. An abrupt seeing Into. Spirit came upon them as Jesus came upon Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom: “Follow me. And he arose, and followed Him.” Simply that. Next Window Please . We are so habituated to reason and a precious carefulness that Christ’s people seem, well, irresponsible. But grace is first the law-breaker. It can be brutal: “Let the dead bury their dead.” Brutal and rash and unfair. Because there is no ground whatever for believing that these were righteous men. They didn’t earn their cameo roles in the Passion through good work. I suspect they were chosen rather for an openness to potential. They were, above all, ready men. Advertisement
Simon of Cyrene, recruited by grace and some Roman to lug Jesus’ cross, is my paradigm in this. He had, it would seem, no previous experience for the work. No moral credentials that we hear about. Just a man “who passed by, coming out of the country.” To trade, to sightsee, to window-shop: another tourist in the Big Fig. And, all at once, he is absorbed by that rubbernecking mob. Elbow to the front — what have we here? And it’s you, yes you. Bozo, pack that wood. We know nothing about Simon, except that his children, Rufus and Alexander, became Christians. On Good Friday, Simon was what we all are, a passerby. And shanghaied by the Holy Spirit. I take comfort in this thought, whose life otherwise does not much recommend itself to God. That I may be granted, through His fierce randomness and my mere availability, a walk-on moment of redemption. Advertisement
Return to the Passion now. Imagine, say, a man in his workshop room alone. For best effect, I’d fancy him preoccupied: revising some device of his craft, in thought, whatever. Suppose it hot and ordinary out. Then, all of one rush, as weather can change, there should be an importance in the air. Let that cheap pitcher interpose itself across his attention here. For this instant it should have more pitcherness . The way common objects astound and please when we are full of joy. This is, you know, not his regular time to fetch water in. But the thought of “pitcher,” the very surprising idea that it can hold water , contains aptness and fascination for him. It has been infused by grace. And he rises at a call — not from God as such, nor from any impending event — but to honor the perfect nature of one created thing. There is elevation all around. Advertisement"
Easter Sunday: They Fled from the Tomb | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/they-fled-from-the-tomb/," People gather at Notre Dame Cathedral two days after the fire in Paris, France, April 17, 2019. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters) The church will be rebuilt. It is always being rebuilt.
‘E verything burns.” The Joker heard it from Heraclitus.
There are worse things that can happen to a church — to a church building ; the building is not the church — than a fire. Notre-Dame de Paris will be repaired, and the French will do a splendid job of it. They are still the people who built that colossal statue that stands in New York Harbor, which combined the heroic aesthetic of Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi with the engineering genius of Gustave Eiffel. As a wise friend wrote after the fire: The French are proud, and they have a great deal to be proud of — just give them time.
Other church structures will not be as lucky as Notre Dame. With buildings as with people, it is happier and more easeful to be rich, beautiful, and famous. Many other churches — in Paris, in Maastricht, in Rome — have become what Notre Dame almost ( almost ) became: tourist attractions, and nothing else. Or museums or bookstores or cafés. A spire can be rebuilt, pews replaced, a roof restored. But when a church in San Francisco is converted into a $7.5 million, three-bedroom private residence, what resurrection then is possible? The advertising copy is the gospel of our time: “The lower level can serve as an art gallery, a recording studio, a gym, or a wine cellar.”
From the chalice of benediction to cabernet sauvignon — from one wine cult to another. Like Walter Donovan, we have chosen poorly. Advertisement
Our new viticultural faith is a good deal less demanding than the old one. Give it that. Do you remember the movie poster for Chocolat ? (IMDB, 2000: “A woman and her daughter open a chocolate shop in a small French village that shakes up the rigid morality of the community,” the rigid morality of the French being the great theme of European civilization in our time.) Juliette Binoche offers Johnny Depp a mock Eucharist, feeding him a piece of candy (decorated with a pagan fertility symbol) against the background of a quaint little church. “Sinfully delicious,” the advertising copy reads. For turn-of-the-century filmgoers entirely lacking subtlety, the film is set during Lent. Translate “ Laissez les bons temps rouler! ” into Latin and carve it on the lintels. Advertisement
Ours is a comfortable little world, snug and well-fed and risk-averse.
Why bother to repair Notre Dame? Because it is a very beautiful building? Because it is part of our “Judeo-Christian heritage,” whatever it is we mean by that? To flip Mohammed & Co. the bird? “ Oh, dear, well, we’re all French Catholics today. Have some baguette .” Advertisement
Why run into a burning building, as Father Jean-Marc Fournier of the Paris Fire Brigade did, to rescue the consecrated host? Cultural symbolism? “If it’s a symbol, to hell with it,” as Flannery O’Connor famously put it. Advertisement
And what if it’s not?
“Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.”
“ Oh, you must find your faith very comforting .” They were not comforted. They were afraid, too terrified to speak. It begins with fear. Everything begins with fear.
“He is not here,” the angel said. Of course they were trembling and bewildered. Everything they had known, had thought they knew, was wrong. It was false, possibly a lie and, at the very least, an enormous misunderstanding. The world suddenly became as mysterious to them as if they were strangers in it — which, they must have begun to understand, is exactly what they were, and what we are. The execution they had witnessed was not the death of a criminal or a heretic, or even a mere man: A man, yes, but not only that, because there was more to man than they had known or thought possible. They were not what they thought they were, because He was not what they assumed He was, because the tomb was — is — empty, because He Is Not Here.
As Father Richard John Neuhaus put it in his Good Friday meditation, Death on a Friday Afternoon , “If what Christians say about Good Friday is true, then it is, quite simply, the truth about everything.” Between the blood and misery of Good Friday and the trembling and bewilderment of the Resurrection lies a silence longer than its hours. In those hours, we are alone. And then the discovery: Heraclitus had it all wrong. As Father Gerard Manly Hopkins puts it directly in his sonnet of joyful rejoinder, “That Nature Is a Heraclitean Fire and of the Comfort of the Resurrection”:
I am all at once what Christ is,
since he was what I am, and
This Jack, joke, poor potsherd,
patch, matchwood, immortal diamond,
Is immortal diamond.
When the fire reached the altar at Notre Dame, the tabernacle was empty, because the chaplain of the fire brigade had seen to it that it was so: He is not here. It is not the case that everything burns. Buildings burn, and sometimes they are repurposed — bookstores, museums, San Francisco mansions. He is not here — not here : not confined in this burning building, not contained in this home gym and wine cellar on the lower level, not on display in this museum, not decaying in this tomb.
Yes, the church will be rebuilt. It is always being rebuilt, as T. S. Eliot knew:
The Church must be forever building, for it is forever decaying within and attacked from without;
For this is the law of life; and you must remember that while there is time of prosperity"
Supreme Court Considers Citizenship Question on Census | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/census-citizenship-question-supreme-court-case/," U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testifies on Capitol Hill, June 20, 2018. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) This is another case in which Trump administration behavior is provoking plaintiffs to ask the judiciary to police the blurry boundaries of executive discretion.
Washington — The oral arguments the Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday will be more decorous than the gusts of judicial testiness that blew the case up to the nation’s highest tribunal. The case, which raises arcane questions of administrative law but could have widely radiating political and policy consequences, comes from the Enlightenment mentality of the nation’s Founders, and involves this question: Does it matter that a conspicuously unenlightened member of the president’s cabinet lied in sworn testimony about why he made a decision that he arguably has the statutory power to make?
Because America’s 18th-century Founders were rational, empirical, inquisitive pursuers of evidence-based improvement, they placed in the Constitution’s second section after the preamble a requirement for a census. And the 14th Amendment stipulates the required actual enumeration, every ten years, of “the whole number” of persons residing in the country. From 1820 (when Congress wanted “foreigners not naturalized” to be counted) through 1950, the census almost always included a citizenship question, and in 2018, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross decided that the 2020 “short-form” questionnaire, the one that goes to every household, should include one. Ross has testified that he was “responding solely” to a Justice Department request for the question to provide data helpful to enforcement of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965.
A federal district judge called this Ross rationale “pretextual” because Ross was justifying a decision “already made for other reasons.” This was a polite but still stinging way of saying Ross lied, which he almost certainly did: Justice officials initially rejected Commerce’s request that it ask for a citizenship question, and said such data was unnecessary for VRA enforcement. The district judge said Commerce sought the Justice letter to “launder” the request for the citizenship question “through another agency,” this being just one of “a veritable smorgasbord” of rules violations by Ross and his aides. Advertisement
Ross also testified that he was “not aware” of any discussions of the citizenship questions between Commerce and the White House. But after 18 states, 15 municipalities, and various immigration advocacy groups sued, he acknowledged meeting early in 2017 with then–presidential adviser Stephen Bannon, an anti-immigration zealot. The district judge also said Ross “materially mischaracterized” — translation: lied about — a conversation with a polling expert in order to obfuscate the expert’s objections to the citizenship question.
Because more information is preferable to less, the citizenship question might seem sensible. However, the question might result in less information because the Census Bureau’s own experts believe that the citizenship question would cause 6.5 million people — almost one in ten households includes one or more noncitizens — to not respond to the questionnaire for fear of law-enforcement consequences. The 6.5 million are approximately as many people as live in Indiana. Of the estimated 24 million noncitizens (about 7 percent of America’s population of almost 329 million), almost eleven million are here illegally.
The citizenship question is, the Trump administration insists, “a wholly unremarkable demographic question.” But why, then, was Ross so dishonest concerning its genesis? This is probably why: A substantial undercount would affect the formulas by which hundreds of billions of dollars of federal spending are dispersed, to the disadvantage of blue states and cities with large immigrant populations. Furthermore, because the 14th Amendment stipulates that seats in the House of Representatives shall be apportioned on the basis of “the whole number of persons in each state” regardless of citizenship, an undercount could cost some states, particularly blue states, congressional seats, and hence electoral votes.
The district-court judge was scalding about the “egregious” behavior of Ross, who “in a startling number of ways” either “ignored, cherry-picked, or badly misconstrued” evidence and “acted irrationally . . . in light of that evidence.” Yet the judge professed himself “unable to determine — based on the existing record, at least — what Secretary Ross’s real reasons for adding the citizenship question were.” Perhaps the judge was precluded from coming to a conclusion about Ross’s motives; the public is not.

Notre Dame Cathedral Will Rise Again | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,J.C. Comeau,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-will-rise-again/," A crane works at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, April 19, 2019. (Philippe Wojazer/Pool via Reuters) April 15th will not be the final chapter in Notre Dame’s long and storied history. Out of the ashes, we have hope that she will rise again.
I t was not long after the spire of Notre Dame collapsed when I found myself in the basement rummaging through my grandfather’s old books. I was looking for Victor Hugo’s ode to the great cathedral. And although I was unable to find it, I remain convinced that there must be a copy stowed away somewhere among the dusty shelves. I’ll look again tomorrow, or perhaps I’ll make my way downtown to see if the library has a copy of its own in circulation. After the events of this week, I imagine I will not be the only one wandering the stacks, searching for that famous novel.
I had hoped to find The Hunchback of Notre Dame so that I might, if only for a moment, be granted a vision of the place that has been lost. Yet however beautiful Hugo’s prose might be, I also knew that words would never be able to do her justice. Words may paint a picture in the mind’s eye, they may even inspire us to wondrous acts of restoration (as Hugo’s novel did), but they cannot compete with the poetry of woodwork and stone that was Notre Dame. So much of this poetry was lost on Monday. That is why we weep.
A cathedral as great as Notre Dame is more than a backdrop for the City of Lights. In many ways, it managed to integrate itself into the heart and soul of its people. So too did the people leave a part of themselves with it. The story it shares with us is passed down from generation to generation, each making its own contribution to her construction, upkeep, and restoration. It is one told through the work of the hands, a story hewn from stone and carved in wood. That is what made her remarkable. Where many of us struggle to express ourselves in words, the makers of Notre Dame managed to express the fluid notions of the mind in a medium as solid and unforgiving as stone. Advertisement
At Notre Dame, we were confronted by that which we may have otherwise believed to be ineffable. In walking among the pews, in gazing up at the cross above the altar, we were given the chance to encounter expressions of beauty, wonder, majesty, and solace that could be found nowhere else. Here was a poetry we could reach out and touch. Here the thoughts and images that flow through our minds were given form. For the doubting Thomases among us, Notre Dame extended a hand, she helped us to know that these things were real. In such a way the cathedral served to remind us that the Christian faith is not placed in some ethereal being, but in God Incarnate. Notre Dame served to reinforce the fact that God, in all His splendor, dwelt among us. This particular house of God stood as a testament to His beauty, majesty, and awe-inspiring presence, just as the lowly manger once stood as a testament to his humility and compassion.
But with the loss of Notre Dame, even if it be but a partial loss, there comes a fear that this beauty has gone out of the world forever. In an age in which what is economical seems to take precedence, we often struggle to justify the cost of the beautiful and the true. It becomes easy to forget that man does not live on bread alone. Notre Dame, while she stood, helped to remind us of that teaching. Through her many virtues the cathedral sought to edify the whole of man. In so doing she was a much-needed light in our time of trouble. Advertisement"
Remembering Father James V. Schall: An Old-School Jesuit | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Weigel,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/remembering-father-james-schall/,"April 21, 2019 6:30 AM Father James Schall in 2012 The faith of the longtime Georgetown professor informed his intellectual work, as his intellect refined his faith.
T he most distinguished son of Pocahontas, Iowa, Father James V. Schall, S.J., died at age 91 on April 17, just as Lent 2019 was drawing to a close and Easter was visible on the horizon.
Father Schall was what’s usually referred to as an “old-school Jesuit” — meaning (to my mind) that he was the kind of Jesuit St. Ignatius Loyola imagined when he founded the Society of Jesus in the 16th century. Jim Schall was both a man of rock-solid Catholic faith and a first-rate intellectual, a distinguished political philosopher at home with political theory from Plato through the moderns. His faith informed his intellectual work, as his intellect refined his faith. He was an exceptionally gifted teacher; before he was put out to pasture by Jesuit superiors who didn’t seem to grasp what a magnet he was for the students they ought to be recruiting, his last lecture at Georgetown University was attended by hundreds, who spilled out of venerable Gaston Hall into the surrounding corridors. He was a devoted priest, a masterful spiritual director, and a counselor who encouraged his students to think vocationally, whether about the priesthood or consecrated religious life, marriage, or their professional careers.
He was also an ascetic, whom self-denial, religious disciplines, and — in his last decade, illness — had whittled down, so that in his eighties he looked something like a lean, mean pirate in a Roman collar (which he always wore). But there was no meanness in the man, only a sweetness of temperament wed to a bracing, unblinking honesty about the state of the Church, the world, and the Society to which he had given his life. His suffering from cancer and his being blinded in one eye did make his legion of friends and protégés wonder about God’s ways with his most devoted servants; Father Schall would have said that suffering is good for you, because if you conform your sufferings to those of Christ in his Passion, then God’s grace helps you grow through suffering into the imitation of Christ that every Christian should be. Advertisement
Father Schall’s life and holy death invite a reflection on the gamble that the Catholic Church took in approving Saint Ignatius’s proposal, during the cultural tsunami of the Reformation, to create an elite corps of priestly guerrillas, formed by his Spiritual Exercises , whom Ignatius would deploy to “set the world ablaze” (as the inscription on the base of his statue at the Jesuit GHQ in Rome reminds us). As my friend Russell Hittinger once put it, the Exercises were a spirituality invented for European intellectuals paddling canoes up rivers in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by what were then known as “savages.” The Exercises were thus very much a me-and-God affair; the gamble was that they would not lead to a radical, delusory subjectivism, because a well-formed Jesuit would also be unshakeable in his commitment to the truth of Catholic faith and to the teaching authority of the Church. Cut that tether to truth and ecclesiastical authority, and trouble would begin.
And then there was that quite deliberate Ignatian elitism. Self-defined and self-constructed elites are almost always trouble within a complex institution. They risk becoming what C. S. Lewis called an “Inner Ring,” which imagines itself composed of superior types to whom others must defer, and who are, because of their superiority, absolved from some of the myriad loyalties that bind others to the institution. The Jesuits’ stern, unbending fidelity – embodied in their famous fourth vow and its promise of radical obedience to the pope and radical availability for any mission the pope decreed – would, it was hoped, prevent this elite corps from decomposing into something akin to its own church, marching to the beat of its own, self-consciously superior drummers.
The Church’s gamble paid off in the life of men such as Father Jim Schall, for whom radical commitment to the full symphony of Catholic truth was liberating rather than confining — especially when that commitment was intellectually refined by a lifelong immersion in the great books of Western civilization. Whether that gamble has paid off in respect of the entire Society of Jesus as the Catholic Church experiences it today is a question that caused Father Schall more than a little anxiety over the course of his long life."

1969 —In his majority opinion in Shapiro v. Thompson , Justice Brennan rules that state and D.C. laws that deny welfare assistance to residents of less than a year violate a constitutional right to travel interstate. Brennan’s usual ally, Chief Justice Warren, dissents on the ground that Congress had authorized the one-year residency requirement. In a separate dissent, Justice Harlan objects that he “know[s] of nothing which entitles this Court to pick out particular human activities, characterize them as ‘fundamental,’ and give them added protection under an unusually stringent equal protection test.” More broadly, Harlan observes:
“Today’s decision, it seems to me, reflects to an unusual degree the current notion that this Court possesses a peculiar wisdom all its own whose capacity to lead this Nation out of its present troubles is contained only by the limits of judicial ingenuity in contriving new constitutional principles to meet each problem as it arises.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "
Mueller Report: Trump and the Firing of James Comey | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/mueller-report-trump-aides-james-comey-firing/,"April 21, 2019 10:01 PM President Trump speaks during a meeting of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, April 4, 2019.

Many, many people have observed that the Mueller report offers example after example of Trump’s aides saving him from bad decisions by ignoring them. It’s an accurate generalization, and I’ve made it myself . But it seems to me that the report also offers details about one big exception to this rule.
The report suggests that Trump wanted to fire James Comey because he kept refusing to say in public what he was telling Trump in private: that Trump wasn’t the subject of an investigation. (See, e.g., Volume II, p. 75, of the Mueller report.) Trump wanted to say so, but multiple underlings including White House counsel Don McGahn and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus repeatedly objected (see Volume II, pp. 65-9 of the Mueller report for details).
Instead the official story was that Trump had fired Comey on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s recommendation, and that recommendation was based on Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton, including his unfairness to her. That story was false: Trump wanted Comey gone before, and for different reasons than those mentioned in, Rosenstein’s memo. The president quickly contradicted it."

(Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters)
Sri Lankan authorities believe a local Islamist militant group, assisted by an “international network” of sympathizers, carried out the string of church and hotel bombings that left 290 people dead and at least 500 injured on Sunday morning.
While they have not yet announced the responsible party, the authorities believe members of a local group known as National Thowheed Jamath carried out a total of eight bombings across the country on Sunday.
All of the suicide bombers were Sri Lankan citizens, but they were assisted by foreign sympathizers, officials announced Monday.
“We do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country,” cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said. “There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded.”
Suicide bombers detonated improvised explosive devices filled with small metal projectiles inside of three Catholic churches during Easter services. They also detonated bombs in three hotels in the nation’s capital, Colombo. Two additional explosions occurred during police raids on addresses in the capital.
Twenty-four people have been arrested in connection with the attacks and 87 detonator devices have been recovered from a local bus stop. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that several Americans were killed in the bombings.
“Attacks on innocent people gathering in a place of worship or enjoying a holiday meal are affronts to the universal values and freedoms that we hold dear, and demonstrate yet again the brutal nature of radical terrorists whose sole aim is to threaten peace and security,” Pompeo said.
“We can confirm that several U.S. citizens were among those killed,” he added. “The U.S. Embassy is working tirelessly to provide all possible assistance to the American citizens affected by the attacks and their families.”"
Notre Dame and Saint Patrick’s: Cathedrals That Are Our Lives | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-saint-patricks-cathedrals/,"April 22, 2019 6:30 AM People outside Notre Dame Cathedral two days after the fire in Paris, France, April 17, 2019. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters) A fire burns in more than the beloved cathedral.
T he Wi-Fi on my flight from Rome to Newark wasn’t working, so phones were buzzing about Notre Dame in France as soon as we hit the runway. After the initial shock and sadness, gratitude was expressed. There are upsides to being disconnected: At least we didn’t have to watch, on live television, something we couldn’t control. That seemed to be an instant lesson, before we knew much of anything, including the cause or the damage. Advertisement Advertisement
I’ve never been to Paris, so I’ve never been to the cathedral there. But on Monday I did the closest I could after I cleared customs: I went to the cathedral in Newark, N.J. The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart is, as it happens, an under-appreciated treasure. It’s safe to say that most people do not travel to New York City only to hop on the train to Newark to pray. More should. As it happens, the Mass schedule was changed up for Holy Week, so my visit was short that day. But had I stayed on, I might have run into the man who would be arrested later that week in my home cathedral of Saint Patrick’s on Fifth Avenue. On Monday, he had been removed by police at Sacred Heart Cathedral, for refusing to leave. On Wednesday, he was caught trying to set fire to “America’s Parish Church” over the Hudson.
I mention all this not only because it hits a little close to home but because the reactions people have had to Notre Dame in flames is a sign of hope in the world, isn’t it? We live at a time when so many of us seem to be living lives as partial spectators, upset about things we can have no control over, letting our moods and even health be affected for the worse by politics, primarily. Not only is there more to life than the Mueller report. There’s even more to life than people’s takes on it. Advertisement
I got into Saint Peter’s Basilica only once on this trip to Rome. Security has been stepped up in recent years, and my old ways of going in as often as I can have become a thing of the past, given the line to get in. I was immersed in prayer and thanksgiving this time and didn’t really have the thought I did on a previous visit: This could be my last time here. Rewind a bit and the so-called Islamic State was openly calling for attacks on the pope and the Vatican and I had very much considered the possibility. When a priest friend from the U.S. was called to assignment there, the terrorist-attack concern was one of my first thoughts, which became prayers for protection. But I do think about it now and again at Saint Patrick’s, as a counterterrorism police officer seems to be patrolling by the confessional as I wait in line. I sometimes think: This is not a normal church experience.
But then it is, isn’t it, living in these times? It seemed all the more part of the fabric of our lives when on Tuesday, about 24 hours before the gas-can incident that would lead to the scare and the arrest at Saint Patrick’s, I watched a counterterrorism cop holding one of his children by the hand, showing his family one of the side chapels during his break. Churches are full of stories. People who gave from their earnings to help pay for them, the skill by which others created a gift to God, and to man, to help us reach Heaven. They continue to be full of stories, even Notre Dame. People can’t seem to get enough of the story of the fire chaplain who, in the days after the fire, was talking about the the Blessed Sacrament, the Eucharist, which Catholics believes is the Real Presence of Christ. It seemed to me a miracle of God that during Holy Week — which would become Mueller Report Week by mid Wednesday — so many on both sides of the Atlantic were talking about “Our Lady” and were transfixed by a church.

The questions remain not about whether or how France will rebuild, because money is clearly being raised, and I assume the pressure will be high to not mess with something so seemingly close to perfection. What I wonder — and pray about — is whether this shared experience that people had of watching the burning of Notre Dame will keep us from the false security and complacency that can be our lives.

It is striking to me that at the churches in Rome you always run into someone looking for money. This happens in urban areas, especially in the U.S., but in Rome the churches, sad to say, are tourist attractions even more than they are places of worship these days. That person sitting outside is not a nuisance. It’s easier here, where we probably speak the same language, but you’d be surprised how far you can get with hand gestures and a little bad Italian and how many people know just a little English. We can build great cathedrals with the way we live our lives, by how we love. Next time you are in a church with even an inch of beauty — maybe it can be today — don’t miss the opportunity to remember that this could be your last chance to begin really to live by the measure of love, reaching, with virtue, high above the mud and muck and news frenzies. So many people seemed to have their selfies to show from Notre Dame, but what about the stories of conversion? Advertisement"
Trump Administration Tightens Sanctions ‘To Bring Iran's Oil Exports to Zero’ | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-administration-tightens-sanctions-to-bring-irans-oil-exports-to-zero/,"April 22, 2019 9:50 AM An Iranian flag flies at the Sorough oil field in 2005.

The Trump administration has stepped up efforts to completely eliminate Iran’s oil export market, announcing Monday the elimination of sanctions exemptions that allowed the rogue nation to continue exporting oil to a select group of nations.
The Trump administration last year granted six-month waivers to eight countries, exempting them from the wide-ranging sanctions implemented as part of the unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The elimination of those exemptions, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will officially announce Monday afternoon, will likely devastate the already struggling Iranian economy.
“President Donald J. Trump has decided not to reissue Significant Reduction Exceptions (SREs) when they expire in early May,” the White House said in a statement. “This decision is intended to bring Iran’s oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue.”
Crude futures spiked to six-month highs on news of the move, which is expected to eliminate 1 million barrels per day from the global market beginning May 2. Stay Updated with NR Daily

In response, Iranian officials have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway through which one fifth of the world’s traded oil supply travels.
“If we are prevented from using it, we will close it,”Alireza Tangsiri, head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps navy force, told the state-run Fars news agency. “In the event of any threats, we will not have the slightest hesitation to protect and defend Iran’s waterway.”"
Impeach Donald Trump? Democrats are In for a Wild Ride if They Try | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/democrats-if-you-try-to-impeach-trump-dont-say-you-werent-warned/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 22, 2019 9:36 AM President Donald Trump attends the National African American History Month Reception at the White House in Washington, D.C., February 21, 2019. (Jim Young/REUTERS) Hey, did anything big happen last week while I was on vacation? Thanks to Alexandra DeSanctis for filling in last week. I received several messages about how great her writing was in my absence, so thinking of Wally Pipp . . . Alexandra, knock it off. Stop being so good at this. Go Ahead, Democrats. Try to Impeach the President. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report paints a picture of a president who wanted to obstruct justice through acts such as firing Mueller and shutting down the investigation, but never quite managed to obstruct anything. “The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.” The strongest evidence that Trump never successfully obstructed justice is that Mueller completed his report with no interruptions, impediments, denied resources, or other hindrance from the White House. We’ve never removed a president from office, and an intent to obstruct with no actual obstruction is a thin reed for the first removal of a sitting president of the United States. But many Democrats no doubt believe the behavior and actions described in the Mueller report deserve impeachment. Some Republicans may agree that a president who tries to obstruct justice ought to be impeached, even if he doesn’t succeed. So go for it, Congressional Democrats. Yes, the most likely outcome is two mostly party-line votes in the House and Senate. It would eat up six months or so of the nation’s time and, I suspect, increase the odds of President Trump’s reelection. If it started soon, it would probably conclude at the end of 2019 and then the country would begin the 2020 presidential campaign in earnest with the first primaries. The country would probably be exhausted from the arguments, and probably grow increasingly irritated with a Democratic party that has denied Trump’s legitimacy as president from day one. Some Congressional Democratic leaders will argue that this is a matter better resolved to the 2020 election. Impeachment is an inherently political process, and perhaps it is simpler and easier to just leave this to the voters. But a presidential election is not a trial; the opposing party’s nominee is not a prosecutor and the electorate is not a jury. Our Constitution includes a mechanism for resolving allegations of presidential lawbreaking, and that’s impeachment. Imagine that everything in the Starr report about Bill Clinton’s actions had come out in his first term. Would Republicans in April 1995 have said, “We’ll let the voters decide the appropriate consequence for perjury and suborning perjury in November 1996?” I doubt it. The attitude of Republicans then was that presidential lawbreaking demanded consequence, whether enforcing that consequence is popular or not. Democrats are free to embrace that philosophy today. If Democrats do not pursue impeachment, we will be hearing “Trump could have and should have been impeached over what’s in the Mueller report” for the next 18 months or five-and-a-half years. If you think there’s grounds for impeachment, then do it. If you don’t, then drop the claim. Keep in mind, there’s no statute of limitations on any of this. If Democrats choose to not impeach Trump this year, they can keep it in their back pocket and, at any time during his presidency if he’s elected to a second term, take it up later. It’s unlikely that we’ll ever see 67 Democrats in the Senate, but this represents a stink-bomb that the Democrats can throw at the president at any time, as long as they hold a majority in the House. Politically, impeachment would probably be a disaster for Democrats. All of those newly elected House Democrats, who pledged to work in a bipartisan fashion to focus on the country’s real problems, will have accomplished nothing in their first term. They would face the choice of voting for impeachment and fueling the motivation of the Republicans in their purple districts or voting against impeachment and enraging the progressives in their districts. But the Democratic base needs to experience a hard lesson that a president is not illegitimate because they feel like he ought to be. Many Democrats have convinced themselves that the public will support them. But in electorate that is often displeased with Trump’s behavior, rhetoric and antics does not want him removed from office . On Saturday, the Washington Post reported , “Democratic leaders have been in touch with lawmakers hosting town halls throughout the two-week congressional recess, and voters are rarely expressing a desire to impeach the president, according to one leadership official.” But parties are free to exercise their power in a counterproductive and self-destructive manner. An unsuccessful effort to impeach Trump may be the only way the Democratic party finally comes to terms with the results of the 2016 election. Go ahead, Democrats. Just don’t say no one warned you. An Uncharitable Assessment of the 2020 Democratic Field’s Giving In the first “ Twenty Things ” piece about Bernie Sanders , I noted that shortly after being elected mayor of Burlington, Sanders was invited to give remarks at an event kicking off a United Way fundraising drive, and shocked attendees by declaring, “ I don’t believe in charities .” Sanders went on to argue that government, rather than charity organizations, should take over responsibility for social programs. That is a terrible ethos, but it is a consistent one. If you believe that it is the duty of the government to help the poor, the sick, the disabled, those going through hard times, and that only the government should handle those duties, then you see private charities as competitors and impediments to your vision of society. Consciously or not, you’re rooting against those charities; you would prefer to see the United Way and Habitat for Humanity, the Salvation Army and everything else wither away and go out of business — so that everyone would become dependent upon government for that needed aid. The more those charities thrive and help solve society’s problems, the less people will see a need for the government to step in. This philosophy is morally hideous, of course; most of us would conclude that we should help out how we can and where we can. Most of us also believe there’s room for both government efforts and private charities. The problems are big enough to require the best of both. There is a long and pretty bipartisan tradition of wealthy presidential candidates revealing, via their tax returns, that they make only small charitable donations — at least the ones itemized and listed on their tax returns. Jonah points out that because most aspiring presidents know they will be asked to release their tax returns, and that the amount of charitable contributions is usually the biggest news story to come out of those documents, it’s bewildering that the likes of Sanders and Beto O’Rourke wouldn’t contribute more. O’Rourke offered the lamest explanation last week : “I’ve served in public office since 2005. I do my best to contribute to the success of my community, my state and now, of my country. There are ways that I do this that are measurable. And there are ways that I do this that are immeasurable.” This is the sort of statement that ought to be greeted by audible boos from anyone within earshot. Elected officials love to describe their work as “public service” or describe themselves as “public servant,” but how many servants get all the perks that House members do? That’s $174,000 per year, workplace gym, a $40,000 budget to furnish home state offices, a subsidy covering roughly 70 percent of their health insurance costs, a pension and a separate 401(k), a staff allowance of nearly one million dollars; a separate $250,000 for mail to constituents, and taxpayer-covered travel costs between their district and Washington? O’Rourke and his wife reported $366,455 adjusted gross income in 2017; “they paid $81,019 in federal income tax that year and donated $1,166 to charity — a giving rate of just 0.3%, which is well below the national average.” The O’Rourkes gave 4.3 percent of their income in 2013, but most years from 2008 to 2017 gave .2 percent to .9 percent, on joint income ranging from What Will the Mood Be at This Year’s NRA Convention? Later this week, I’ll be covering the National Rifle Association’s Annual Meeting in Indianapolis. There are years the event is mostly rah-rah triumphalism about victories in the fight to preserve and defend the Second Amendment, and years where there’s a mood of rushing to the ramparts . (There are also plenty of attendees who are interested in the firearms on display and not all that interested in what’s going on in the political realm.) At the 2017 convention , attendees could cheer presidential and vice-presidential addresses and largely pro-gun majorities in the House and Senate, as well as the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch. This year’s annual meeting will be the first meeting since Democrats took over the House, after a midterm-election period where the NRA was less active than usual, and the NRA’s board finds itself in the odd position of suing its major advertising agency over access to documents . Like many political organizations, one of the biggest impediments can be success: If you win some high-profile fights, your members feel like the job is done and they can turn their attention and energy to other endeavors. Complacency is almost inevitable; no organization or movement can operate at 100 percent enthusiasm all the time. But that complacency almost inevitably generates defeats, which generates a sudden fear that ground is being lost. The alarm is sounded, those who tuned out tune back in. The question is, does 2020 have the NRA’s membership stirred again? Or does the next presidential election or Supreme Court nominee fight seem too far off?

The Tax Reform Did Not Discriminate against Blue State Voters | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-tax-reform-did-not-discriminate-against-blue-state-voters/,"Follow Robert VerBruggen on Twitter April 22, 2019 10:14 AM
There’s a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research out today called “ Did the 2017 Tax Reform Discriminate against Blue State Voters ? ” It’s a fairly interesting exercise, looking at how much extra money individuals will have to spend and calculating that, if the law is made permanent,
the average percentage increase in remaining lifetime spending under the TCJA is 1.6 percent in red states versus 1.3 percent in blue states. Among the richest 10 percent of households, this differential is larger. Rich households in red states enjoyed a 2.0 percent increase compared to a 1.2 percent increase among the rich in blue-state households. This gap is driven almost entirely by the limitation on the SALT deduction. Excluding the SALT limitation from the TCJA results in a spending gain of 2.6 percent for rich red-state households compared to 2.7 percent for rich blue-state households.
Good to know. But this is not proof of discrimination. Rather, it shines a light on the discrimination that took place in the old system.
The SALT deduction, as you may know, allows taxpayers to deduct their state and local tax payments from their federal returns. So when a state chooses to hikes its own taxes, it also secures its residents a tax break from the federal government, which in turn eventually has to either raise taxes or cut spending nationwide to make up for the lost revenue. This spreads the burden around to states that didn’t choose to hike their own taxes."

The Democrats Have Hurt Themselves by Lying about the Tax Cuts | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Charles C. W. Cooke,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-democrats-have-hurt-themselves-by-lying-about-the-tax-cuts/,"April 22, 2019 9:59 AM House Speaker Nancy Pelosi leads Democrats in introducing the “For the People Act” legislation, January 4, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
Pretty much every major outlet has now noted that the Democrats have been successful in their attempt to cast the 2017 Trump-led tax cuts as a tax increase . Here’s the New York Times on the topic :
To a large degree, the gap between perception and reality on the tax cuts appears to flow from a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.
Per the Times ,
The messaging stuck. In December 2017 , polling for The Times by SurveyMonkey showed that nearly two-thirds of Americans — and three-quarters of Democrats — did not believe they would get a tax cut from the new law. In this month’s poll, three-quarters of Democrats again said they did not think they got a tax cut from the law, and the overall share of Americans who said they had benefited rose only slightly from the 2017 expectations.
This, of course, does not comport with reality:
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 65 percent of people paid less under the law and that just 6 percent paid more. (The rest saw little change to their taxes.)
This is a problem for the Democrats.
Electorally, there is perhaps some short-term advantage to be gained from neutralizing — or even reversing — one of Trump’s reelection talking points. But, in the long run, the approach the Democratic party has taken here will be a lot less useful, because, in the long run, the Democratic party’s long-term aim is not to stick it to Donald Trump but to advance its political agenda. By attacking the tax cuts from the right , it has made that aim much, much more difficult to achieve.
In addition to their ever-present complaints about “the rich!” the Democrats’ attack on the 2017 tax cuts had three major prongs: Taxes on the middle class were increased, and this is bad; Some wealthier Americans in higher-taxed states saw tax increases, and this is bad; Some of Trump’s tax cuts will expire in 2027, and this is bad
The first of these attacks is an explicit, deliberate, outright lie. The second and third are essentially correct. What all of them have in common, however, is that they are all anti-tax arguments. This is a big problem for a Democratic party that cannot achieve its vision for America without raising taxes and spending — not just on “the rich,” but on the middle class, too. Advertisement Advertisement
Structurally, Trump’s cuts present an obstacle to the Democratic agenda — an obstacle that, eventually, will need to be removed. Quite how the Democrats intend to go about that from their present position is unclear. If, as seems to have happened, Congress can broadly lower taxes and voters can still be convinced that they were raised , there will presumably be hell to pay if Congress actually raises them."

Campus Free Speech or No Higher Ed Act Reauthorization | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Stanley Kurtz,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/fix-free-speech-or-no-higher-ed-act-reauthorization/,"April 22, 2019 10:17 AM (Carlos Barria/Reuters)
Today, the National Association of Scholars released a statement signed by over 100 prominent educators and public figures concerned with higher education. That statement calls on Congress to include protections for campus free speech in the next reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Only by doing so, says the statement, can Congress “cease subsidizing unlawful behavior by public colleges and universities.” In other words, Congress needs to stop funneling money to colleges and universities that promulgate unconstitutional speech codes and so-called free-speech zones. Advertisement Advertisement
The Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965 must periodically be reauthorized and updated by Congress. This is important because Title IV of the Act sets the ground rules by which institutions become eligible for federal student loans and grants. You can’t get a Pell Grant or a federal student loan unless you attend a Title IV eligible school. Today, many or most Title IV eligible schools fail to protect, and even flagrantly violate, the free-speech rights of their students. HEA must not be reauthorized without fixing this. Public universities that stifle free speech should lose their eligibility for federal financial assistance, while private colleges must at minimum make their free-speech policies clear and open (with the implication that they will thereby become contractually obligated to stick by them).
The NAS statement calling on Congress to include free-speech protections in its coming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act has been signed by prominent educators and writers such as Emory’s Mark Bauerlein, the University of Chicago’s Rachel Fulton Brown, George Mason’s F. H. Buckley, Chapman Law School’s John Eastman, Claremont McKenna’s Charles Kesler, UT Austin’s Robert Koons, the University of Oklahoma’s Wilfred McClay, Hillsdale’s Paul Rahe, and Ohio University’s Richard Vedder. Figures such as president of the Leadership Institute Morton Blackwell, president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute Charlie Copeland, president of the Independent Women’s Voice Heather Higgens, and president of the Independent Women’s Forum Carrie Lukas have signed as well. Think-tankers with education expertise such as the Hudson Institute’s John Fonte and the Texas Public Policy Foundation’s Tom Lindsay have also signed on. (I was a signatory as well. And note that organizational affiliations are included for identification purposes only.) Advertisement
But didn’t President Trump already do all this just a month ago? Not quite. The president’s executive order on campus free-speech conditions a different pot of federal money — research grants — on speech protections at public and private universities. Although the research cookie jar is massive, it pales by comparison with the many hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in federal student loans and grants. Federal student loans also reach schools that undertake little or no federally sponsored research. And of course an executive order can be peeled back by a new president, whereas a law has staying power. Advertisement
If you think Congress must already be headed in this direction, you are seriously mistaken. All indications are that Congressional Republicans have decided against including free-speech protections in the coming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, in significant part because House Democrats are refusing to go along. That has got to change. Congressional Republicans shouldn’t be running from this fight, they ought to be running on it instead. Advertisement
Campus free speech enjoys widespread bipartisan support. A recent McLaughlin & Associates poll showed 73 percent approval for a presidential order to protect campus free speech. So Democrats and Republicans can and should join together to include free speech protections in the new HEA. Sadly, national Democrats now seem so beholden to their radical base that even this sensible step has become impossible for them. If so, the correct response on the part of congressional Republicans isn’t capitulation. Instead, the GOP ought to make protections for campus free speech one of its 2020 campaign promises. If that means HEA has to wait for reauthorization until after the next election, so be it. By then the president’s EO will have road tested the mechanics of such an effort. Advertisement
President Trump understands the importance of this issue, but congressional Republicans still do not. Traditional liberal education is in meltdown. Campus conservatives are under siege; and even many campus liberals are afraid of the mob. Free speech in the academy is fading fast. The condition of our colleges and universities is becoming a serious concern for a great many Americans, certainly including conservatives. Yet GOP politicians have forgotten that Ronald Reagan won and held the governorship of California on this issue, which is every bit as prominent today as it was in the late sixties and early seventies when Reagan ran. The public overwhelmingly favors action to protect free speech on campus, yet congressional Republicans have been AWOL on the issue right through the height of the crisis. Yes, they’ve held hearings, but to no legislative effect.
This reflects a deeper problem in the conservative movement. The Reagan and H.W. Bush administrations energetically fought the campus culture wars, while conservatives remained fully engaged in that battle from about 1987 through 1997. As the radical left’s hold on K-12 and higher education solidified, however, conservative reactions split. Many bowed out of the fight, rolling their eyes at preposterous postmodern jargon and the wildly politicized “studies” programs, yet convinced it was all largely silly and harmless stuff. Let folks graduate, make a living, and start paying taxes and they’ll smarten up, these conservatives thought. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The sort of folks who signed today’s NAS statement were thereby reduced to rearguard voices warning that losing the education system to the Howard Zinn-left was bound to undermine the culture as a whole, the principles of constitutional government, and the political position of conservatives as well. With campus-style socialism and identity politics now in the cultural driver’s seat, conservatives under siege both on campus and off, and the country polarized between sixties-descended radicalism and a bunch of stubborn “deplorables,” it’s easy to see that campus political correctness has seeped into society and split the country in two. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
So we’re already two decades late, but the GOP’s congressional leaders are still wearing blinders. Having run away from cultural issues for twenty years, Republican politicians are finding it tough to change their ways, even as the political winds regarding campus speech have shifted heavily in their favor. The mess on campus is so bad that the public has finally woken up. The NAS’s statement today is an attempt to get it through to our representatives in Congress that they had better wake up too. Advertisement
Some conservatives still oppose federal moves to protect campus free speech. I disagree. I’ve argued at length that when it comes to deregulation, the academy is anything but a typical case. Campuses are insulated from market forces by tenure and massive federal subsidies. Abuse of the tenure system has created an unbreakable intellectual monopoly on campus, and this has cemented the speech police in place. In the absence of outside intervention, nothing is going to change.
Some say that federal free-speech protections would be abused by future Democratic administrations to undercut campus conservatives. Unfortunately, President Obama’s wild campus overreach on Title IX shows that the Democrats are going to do that anyway. And what’s the worst that could happen? Would a president Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris try to turn our college campuses into leftist ideological training camps? Too late! It’s already happened. Democratic presidential abuses on campus would only make the higher ed disaster more obvious, perhaps waking up semi-somnolent conservatives to the need for alternative institutions. In the near-to-medium term, Democratic attacks on campus freedoms would be the surest route to a political and cultural backlash. So go ahead Kamala, make my day.
But we are fast running out of time. In a generation or less, graduates of the ideological training camps once known as universities will end constitutionalism and conservatism in this country. Can you feel it happening already? How can you not? Then will come the weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. “Why oh why didn’t we do more to save the education system when we had the chance? Why did we surrender the culture? Is it really all over? Is it really too late?” Well it will be, and soon."
Bernie Sanders's Fox News Town Hall & Democrat Copy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/bernie-sanders-prime-time-town-hall/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 22, 2019 10:08 AM Senator Bernie Sanders (I, Vt.) speaks at a news conference to introduce the “Medicare for All Act of 2019” on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)
Over at Fox News Channel’s MediaBuzz , Howard Kurtz notices that Bernie Sanders got big ratings from his town hall on FNC, and now other Democratic presidential candidates are considering doing the same. The broadcast prompted President Trump to complain on Twitter that the Fox News team was “so smiley and nice” with Sanders and wonder why Donna Brazile is joining the network. (Someone has to give the interview subjects the questions ahead of time, right?) Advertisement Advertisement
Five observations . . .
One: The anchors and interviewers of the Fox News team are fairer and better at their jobs than their critics like to admit, and the Democratic National Committee’s ban on Fox News hosting a primary debate looks ridiculous after the fair treatment of Sanders. Despite the strong opinions expressed during Fox’s prime-time hours, the news crew — Bret Baier, Martha McCallum, and the rest of the team — want to ask tough but fair questions and won’t stack the audience with hostile questioners.
Two: Other Democratic candidates might not have the same resonance with the Fox News audience that Sanders did. There’s a lot of overlap between the Vermont senator and Trump’s messages in the vein of “You’ve gotten a raw deal from powerful elites, and the problems in your life are their fault.” A candidate like Kirsten Gillibrand isn’t going to have the same applause lines. Advertisement
Three: President Trump is better known than almost all of his critics, and most of them yearn to be denounced by the president by name — because this elevates the critic. If Trump watches Fox town halls, then a Democratic presidential candidate knows that with enough furious denunciation with the president watching is likely to bring a direct response on Twitter — suddenly putting a little-known candidate into the middle of the news cycle. Right now, for almost any Democratic candidate, doing a town hall with Fox is all upside. Advertisement"

Woodward told Fox News’s Chris Wallace that he was disturbed to learn that the CIA cited information included in the Clinton-funded dossier in a rough draft of their January 2017 intelligence-community assessment detailing Russian election-interference efforts.
“What I found out recently, which was really quite surprising, the dossier, which really has got a lot of garbage in it and Mueller found that to be the case, early in building the intelligence-community assessment on Russian interference, in an early draft, they actually put the dossier on page two in kind of a breakout box,” Woodward said.
“I think it was the CIA pushing this. Real intelligence experts looked at this and said ‘No, this is not intelligence, this is garbage,’ and they took it out,” he continued. “But in this process, the idea that they would include something like that in one of the great stellar intelligence assessments, as Mueller also found out, is highly questionable. Needs to be investigated.”
Congressional Republicans have long demanded answers from the Department of Justice regarding how heavily the CIA and FBI relied on the Steele dossier when deciding to launch a counter-intelligence investigation into Russian interference in the election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Those lawmakers, led by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are now focused on determining to what degree information from the dossier was used to justify the FBI’s application for a FISA warrant to surveil former Trump national-security adviser Carter Page.
Republicans have escalated their demands for transparency in the wake of the release of the Mueller report, which disproved a number of key claims included in the dossier, including the allegation that Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with Russian hackers.
Attorney General William Barr told Congress earlier this month that he has formed a team within the Department of Justice to look into the origins of the counter-intelligence investigation, and mentioned the dossier specifically as a point of inquiry.

Game of Thrones Episode Two Review: Speed Things Up | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/game-of-thrones-episode-two-pace-problems/,"April 22, 2019 1:30 PM Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones (HBO) Spoilers below! I generally agree with much of what David has written about the first two installments of the final season of Game of Thrones. But I want to throw in a criticism I’ve been mulling. For a long time there were rumors that the final episodes of Game of Thrones would be extra long, perhaps even “movie-length.” After watching last night’s episode, I think that would have been better. The pacing of both episodes has been off. In the first, the reunions were almost all way too short. The conversation between Arya and the Hound should have been allowed to breathe, instead it butted-up against the reunion with Gendry which also seemed stunted. All of the interactions we’ve been waiting for were clipped. Sanda and Dany should have done a couple rounds. The romantic stuff between Jon Snow and Dany was visually cool (Dragons!), but felt like box-checking. Gotta show they’re still a couple! There are exceptions. For example, the interaction in episode one between Dany and Sam, as David has written, was really well done. And I did think the teaser shot of Jamie seeing Bran at the end of episode one was great and their conversation last night was just right. But in last night’s episode we had a bit of the reverse problem. I take David’s point about crafting the “deep breath before the plunge” but at times it felt like padding. And some of it came at the expense of some scenes that should have been drawn out. I, for one, would have loved to hear a lot more of Tyrion’s conversation with Bran. I’m of mixed minds about how they handled the most important conversation so far, between Jon and Dany about his real identity. This, after all, is the heart of the coming intrigue. Cutting it short for understandable reasons, while teasing her fearful contemplation of losing her claim to the throne might have been the right call. But there was another problem with last night’s installment. Because viewers have been trained to look for cues and clues who is next to die, much of the episode seemed like an effort for people to get their “Who’s about to buy the farm?” bingo cards filled out. It’s like that scene in Hardhome when the wilding mom tells her daughters she’ll be joining them soon on another boat — you knew she was about to become an ice zombie. The stuff with Grey Worm last night seemed like a textbook example of the how the gods — old, new, many-faced, and fire — laugh when man plans. The Knighting of Brienne, combined with her battle assignment, was indeed poignant. But it also felt like she was getting her metaphorical gold watch before her retirement as a character. I’m particularly worried that all of the talk about the crypt being the safest place is a huge setup for some close-quarter tragic carnage. I think if they had combined these two episodes into a single 90-minute-plus movie, they would have worked out a lot of these issues better, leaving episode two for the Mother of all Battles and the Final Four for the more interesting stuff. Of course, I could be wrong. We won’t know until we see the whole thing play out. But that’s how I felt as they unfolded."

Mexican Police Detain Hundreds of Central American Migrants | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/mexican-police-detain-central-american-migrants/,"Follow Mairead McArdle on Twitter April 22, 2019 7:19 PM Central American migrants walk during their journey towards the United States in Villa Comaltitlan, Mexico, April 18, 2019. (Jose Cabezas/Reuters)
Mexican authorities on Monday detained hundreds of Central American migrants in groups straggling at the end of a caravan of thousands moving towards the U.S. border.
As many as 500 migrants traveling with the caravan of about 3,000 were detained in the town of Pijijiapan in Chiapas, a Mexican state that borders Guatemala, according to the Associated Press.
Federal police and agents in patrol trucks and vans encouraged the groups to rest and later arrested men, women, and children as they paused in patches of shade. The migrants were driven to buses, likely for transport to immigration stations to begin the deportation process.
Several caravans have made their way to the U.S. border since last year, the first right before the U.S. midterm congressional elections. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The crackdown, reportedly the largest single raid on a migrant caravan since the first one started moving last year, comes just after the Trump administration called on Mexico to take more action to stem the flow of migrants heading to the border.
As ports of entry and immigration stations in the U.S. have become more clogged with asylum seekers and other migrants, Trump threatened to shut down the southern border, saying the economic cost of doing so may be worth it."
Sri Lanka Bombings -- Do the Terror Attacks Only Resonate with the Far Right? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/do-the-sri-lanka-terror-attacks-only-resonate-with-the-far-right/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 22, 2019 4:14 PM Blood stains appear on a statue of Jesus Christ after a bomb blast inside a church in Negombo, Sri Lanka, April 21, 2019. (Stringer/Reuters)
I notice how quickly the story of the Sri Lankan church bombings turned into a story about what people were saying about the bombings — whether “Easter worshippers” was some sort of politically correct euphemism to avoid saying Christians, and now the Washington Post tells us that “the attacks, which targeted a religious minority in a predominantly Buddhist country, also resonated abroad — especially in Europe. To some, it was further proof that Christians in many parts of the world are under attack.” The “some” in that vague sentence are apparently “far right” figures around the world.

Remember when the news was about things happening, instead of what people were saying about the things that were happening?
You know what else is going on in the world today? A general in Libya has turned against the government and is trying to overthrow the current rulers right now. Ukraine just elected a comedian as president. Egypt is voting on a referendum that would allow President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to stay in office until 2030. This weekend ISIS terrorists attacked the Afghanistan Interior Ministry, and were killed after a three-hour gun battle with soldiers and police. Iran is threatening to blockade the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for the latest U.S. restrictions on Iranian oil exports."

I arrive at the airport in Mexico City a little before 8 p.m. I say to the official who will examine my passport, “Buenas tardes? Buenas noches?” He looks at his watch and says, “We usually start ‘noches’ at about 8. You’re right on the cusp. You can say either.” Later, someone else will tell me, “At 7. Definitely about 7 o’clock.” But mainly, a person goes by feel … Advertisement Advertisement
• Last year, I came to do a piece on a very grim subject: the murder of Mexican journalists (which happens a lot). Mexico City, I was told, was La Burbuja — The Bubble. People here are insulated from the violence that afflicts the rest of Mexico. Of course, this is true only to a degree — bubbles can be pierced.
Anyway, I don’t mind life in La Burbuja , not a bit. Mexico City, in its finer neighborhoods, is very pleasant to be in.
(For the piece I wrote last year, go here .) Advertisement
• Thanks to the Oslo Freedom Forum, which is holding a special session in Mexico City — focused mainly, but not exclusively, on Latin America — I meet Griselda Triana. She is the widow of Javier Valdez, one of the many Mexican journalists who have been murdered. I tell her I admire her for being out and about. She says, “There’s no choice.” I say, “Yes, there is: You could always stay in and hide. But you set an example for the rest of us.” Advertisement
She seems a warm, impressive person, Griselda Triana — lovable, too.
• I am very pleased to see Jan-Albert Hootsen, an old friend of mine: a Dutch journalist who is the Mexico representative for CPJ — the Committee to Protect Journalists. His career is two-fold (at least): He does his own reporting, his own journalism; and he works like hell to keep his colleagues alive.
• Hang on, what’s this? A statue of FDR, yes — a good likeness too, capturing the president’s jauntiness. But is he on his feet? At that age? Yes, he is. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a monument to Roosevelt that shows him on his feet. Want to see it?
N.B. FDR was the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee in 1920, with James M. Cox. In that period, he campaigned on his feet. But not when he began running for president, in 1932.
• The session of the Oslo Freedom Forum will be held in Mexico’s grandest, best museum (or so I understand): the National Museum of Anthropology. I will show you a hunk o’ something historic near the entrance:
• On a busy street, I see a young man with a newspaper rolled up in his hand. Does this still happen? Newspapers rolled up, in the hands of young people? You can still witness this, yes. But probably for not much longer …
• Something else you can see on the streets of Mexico City — something modern, not old-fashioned: men in business suits, going to and from work on Segways.
• I thought this building was attractive — the Edificio Raúl Jorge. (No, I don’t know what goes on in there.) See if you agree:
• Asma Khalifa is an extraordinarily inspiring person. She is a young woman from Libya, who served as a nurse during that country’s civil war. One of her messages is: Hard as it may be, try not to demonize or de-humanize your enemies, or putative enemies. I’ve recorded a podcast with her. Again, an extraordinary person.
She made me think: “I have some shaping up to do my own bad self.” Advertisement Advertisement
• Asma’s husband, Bjørn Ihler, is also an extraordinary person. He is a Norwegian, one who survived that massacre in 2011. To read about him — and to hear him, too — go to a page from the Oslo Freedom Forum: here .
• “Ah, Rubén Darío!” exclaims Edipcia Dubón. We are passing the avenue named after him. Edipcia is a democracy leader from Nicaragua — a former congresswoman who had to flee the country, in the face of a merciless crackdown by the Nicaraguan dictator, Daniel Ortega. Darío was a Nicaraguan poet, who lived from 1867 to 1916. Like others who participate in the Freedom Forum, Edipcia is a joy and an inspiration. I will have a piece on her — and Nicaragua’s current horror — in the next issue of National Review .
Still, I wish you could meet her live and in the flesh. Advertisement
• In her opinion, who is the most famous Nicaraguan in the world? Bianca Jagger, right? (I see this lady pretty much every summer when I work at the Salzburg Festival in Austria.) Edipcia thinks about it: either her or Sergio Ramírez, she says. (He is a literary and political figure.) I vote Bianca. Advertisement
• Throughout the neighborhood called “Polanco” — one of the city’s finest — there are men with guns guarding things: not just glassy corporate buildings but fairly humble shops, too.
• I duck into a barbershop (not guarded). It is very old-fashioned, gloriously old-fashioned! The chairs, the techniques, the smells. How old-school is it? The magazine rack is mainly porn mags …
• The session of the Oslo Freedom Forum opens with a press conference. First to speak is my old friend Javier El-Hage, a Bolivian lawyer, an official of OFF, and a champion of liberty. He speaks about the dictatorships of Latin America: Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua (with Honduras ever more worrisome). He also speaks of liberal democracy. And he says something fundamental: Supporters of liberal democracy — left, right, or center — are allies. They should be allied with one another against dictatorship and other (less extreme) forms of illiberalism.
Let me give you a memory: Years ago, I was on an AIPAC junket to Israel (one of the most satisfying, and moving, trips I have ever taken). In our group were some left-of-center journalists. They wanted to debate policy: U.S. policy on Israel, Israeli policy on national security. My attitude basically was: You and I support the right of Israel to exist. Therefore, we are on the same side. We believe in the core thing: the right of Israel to exist. All the rest is detail — important detail, maybe, but detail nonetheless. When so many in the world do not support the right of Israel to exist, our shared support trumps all. Advertisement
Do you know what I mean? I should flush this out in a proper essay …
• An affable, urbane democrat at the conference is “Tuto” Quiroga, a one-time president of Bolivia (in the early 2000s). (He must have been a boy wonder, because he looks quite young now.) He cites an old bit of wisdom: If you are neutral between persecutor and victim, you are effectively siding with the persecutor.
• Inside the auditorium in the Museum of Anthropology, before the speeches begin, there is music playing: a jazzy Pachelbel canon. Not bad (and not good). Advertisement
• Thor Halvorssen greets the attendees. He is the president and CEO of the Human Rights Foundation, which is the parent organization of the Oslo Freedom Forum. The human-rights biz, he says, is a politicized one. HRF — and, by extension, OFF — is different. In the view of HRF/OFF, there are not good dictatorships and bad dictatorships. There are simply dictatorships, which stink.
• Giving the keynote address is Enrique Krauze, the Mexican historian, essayist, etc. He is — dread phrase — a public intellectual, and one of the foremost anywhere. In this talk, he emphasizes the importance, and the utility, of understanding all sides. Not agreeing with all sides, of course. But understanding them (as in Venezuela). He also speaks of freedom — which cannot be learned in books, he says, but rather is learned by hard experience.
• Bonil is a delight. He is a cartoonist from Ecuador. (Formal name, Xavier Bonilla.) No offense to him, but he looks sort of like a cartoon: with an animated, lively, extra-expressive face. For years, he tangled with Rafael Correa, the ex-strongman of Ecuador. (Correa has now been succeeded by a man named Lenin: Lenín Moreno.) Correa invited his followers to kill Bonil. None managed to do it, although many threatened it. Sometimes, they would cloak themselves in the mantle of Christ. Which is annoying.
As you would expect, Bonil is a humorous guy — cartoonists are bound to be. “He threatened to break my face. I told him, ‘How can you make it look worse than it already does?’” But his humor does not mask his bravery.
• In the museum’s collection is a big coin — well, not really: It’s a fantastic Aztec sun stone. (See it here .) But it’s on a coin: Mexico’s ten-peso one. Fascinating object, this stone, which, fortunately, a learned young Mexican explains to me.
• Outside the museum, there are the usual protesters — the protesters who always gather outside Freedom Forum events: commies, in short. I snap a picture from the lobby — not a good picture, but you can see the red flags:
I’m all for their right to protest. But, if they took power, would they allow me to protest? (Don’t bet the farm.)
• It is good to see Rosa María Payá — daughter of the heroic Oswaldo Payá, who was killed in an accident in 2012 (a suspicious accident). Oswaldo Payá was a Cuban democracy leader; his daughter is carrying on his work. Two years ago, I did a podcast with her: If you don’t know her, you will like her a lot ( here ). Advertisement
• It is good to see Chito Gascon, too. He is the chairman of the Human Rights Commission of the Philippines. He has a lot of work to do, as you can imagine. Governmental murder is in vogue over there …
• Leyla Hussein is an Anglo-Somalian — who tries to wake the world up about a grisly issue: female genital mutilation. It is not an exotic cultural or religious practice, she says. It is not something done by the Other, which the West should tolerantly accept. It is a brutal practice — an act of violence — with long-term harmful effects. Leyla is a crusader, but a crusader with abundant charm and flair, which aids the crusade, as I see it. I have podcasted with her a couple of times: in 2017, for example .
• At the museum, I podcast with Felix Maradiaga. He is a Nicaraguan political scientist, entrepreneur, and human-rights defender. Like Edipcia Dubón, he has had to flee his country. I talk with him about his life, and his country. A man both good-natured and formidable: Go here .
• It is so easy to take democracy for granted — when you live in a democracy. It’s easy to pick at it too — when you live in a democracy. But those without democracy don’t take it for granted — quite the opposite. And they can’t afford to pick.
• There is a young man behind a hotel desk. He is a keen student of literature, and a keen student of English. He gives me the names of some Mexican writers: Have I ever read them? No, and I haven’t heard of them either, I’m afraid. He wants the names of some American writers to read — writers of fiction. And in fairly straightforward English. I suggest Hemingway. He has never heard of him. Neither has he heard of Fitzgerald. But he is eager to explore Hemingway, and to give The Great Gatsby a shot.
The world is wide, so wide. You can never hear of everyone. What’s a big deal to one person is a blank to another — and something to discover.
• In a park, I happen upon a monument to Paul Harris — the founder of Rotary International. Harris lived from 1868 to 1947; he founded Rotary in 1905. This is one of my favorite organizations. It has done mountains of good in the world. As I recall, a writer in The New Yorker once sneered at John Dos Passos, long ago. Dos Passos had been a brilliant figure on the left — and now, said the writer, Dos Passos had embraced the worldview of a Rotarian. “Rotarian” was a great putdown. Well, they can put me down, too.
Here is that monument:
• I like benches of this type — do you? I would never sit on one — uncomfortable as hell. But nice to look at:
• Behold, Blessing Corset, for all your corset needs:
• Mexico City — and Mexico at large — is famous for color. Have a little color:
• A little more color? Well, an orange Bug never hurts:
• I meet a man who speaks pretty good English. He has traveled in America a bit. He has been to New York, Miami, Chicago, L.A., Montana …
Whoa, Montana? I myself haven’t been to Montana. How did that happen?
Years ago, he studied English, briefly, at Gonzaga University, in Spokane, Wash. His roommate was from Montana. And this roommate took him home for Thanksgiving. The young Mexican had a proper turkey dinner. He also made a Mexican meal for the family — though the ingredients were hard to obtain.
We all love Thanksgiving, of course. I also love the tradition of taking foreign classmates home for it.
• Having lunch with David Luhnow, the Latin America bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal , and José de Córdoba, a correspondent in the same bureau, is at least two things: an education and a ball.
• Here is a tall, tall statue — of Francisco I. Madero, “Apostle of Democracy.” What a difference a letter makes: “Madero” vs. “Maduro.”
• Lots of young mothers in Mexico City — and not of babies either, but of elementary-school kids.
• I hear someone cry out, “Ándale, ándale, ándale!” Makes me smile. Advertisement
• As throughout the world, parks in Mexico City are chiefly for two classes of beings: dogs and lovers (and dog lovers, I guess) …
• I have to adapt from Dr. Johnson: He who is tired of bougainvillea is tired of life."
Elizabeth Warren's Student-Loan Plan: Weighing the Costs | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/the-cost-of-elizabeth-warrens-student-loan-plan/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 23, 2019 9:42 AM Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks to reporters after announcing an exploratory committee to run for president in 2020 in Cambridge, Mass., December 31, 2018. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: In the aftermath of Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to have the government pay for everyone’s student-loan debt, there’s an even bigger and bolder proposal to cover something else; Joe Biden is still close to jumping in but not quite there and some questions about suburban Democrats and Bernie Sanders. You Think Government Paying Off All Student Loans Is a Big Idea? Try This One . . . My fellow Americans, Yesterday my rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Elizabeth Warren, recently proposed wiping out all of the student-loan debt for 75 percent of borrowers, at cost to taxpayers of $640 billion. As a candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination, I can only say that Warren is a miserly cheapskate. Because today I am calling for something truly bold: wiping out all mortgage debt for all borrowers. Because what good is a taxpayer-funded college education if you have a hard time affording a home at the end of the day? My plan would cover all $10.3 trillion in mortgage debt that Americans currently owe. The arguments in favor of having the government pay for your student-loan debt are every bit as applicable to having the government pay for your mortgage debt. For example, Warren contends her student-loan debt plan would “provide an enormous middle-class stimulus that will boost economic growth, increase home purchases, and fuel a new wave of small-business formation.” If you think covering student-loan debt would do this, just imagine how much bigger the middle-class stimulus if no one ever had to scramble for funds to pay a mortgage ever again! Warren argues “a public-college education is like a public K-12 education — a basic public good that should be available to everyone for free with zero debt.” Good heavens, how can she say that college education should be a basic public good, but not a home? Perhaps not everyone wants or needs to go to college, but everyone needs a home. How could Warren possibly be so cold and heartless that she is deaf to the cries of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their mortgages? In many communities, mortgages cost even more than a higher education — and many homeowners spend 30 years paying off this debt! Is it really fair to see so many American families having to scrimp and save and put off other purchases just because they want to live in a home and took out a six-figure sum to purchase a house and signed a contract promising to pay it off, with interest, over a period of three decades? How on earth is it fair to tell people who freely entered agreements to keep their promises and honor their obligations, even if it’s difficult? Warren says her plan would “substantially increase wealth for Black and Latinx families and reduce both the Black-White and Latinx-White wealth gaps.” By having the government pay for everyone’s mortgage, Black, White, and “Latinx” families that purchased homes will instantly all have the same debt: zero. True equality and fairness for all, with the snap of our fingers, as a bold and driven leader once said . If the federal government is going to pay off the student loan debt of 42 million Americans who owe up to $50,000, there’s no reason it shouldn’t also pay off the mortgage debt for everyone. Now, we know this plan will encounter skeptics and haters and wrongthink. As Warren said, “Some people will say we can’t afford this plan. That’s nonsense.” Like her, I’ll echo that used-car-salesman technique of arguing we can’t afford not to spend this money. Some will say, “The entire federal budget including all spending of every kind is $3.8 trillion, and your plan will cost almost three times that.” I say that these people just don’t care about the poor and downtrodden. Warren has proposed an “Ultra Millionaire Tax” on families with more than $50 million in wealth. We know this is a more serious proposal than a mere millionaire’s tax because it has the word “ultra” in it. Even better than Warren, I have proposed a “Super-Duper Millionaire Tax” that will surely only hit people richer than you and could never ever have any bad effects on the economy or unforeseen consequences. If there’s anything history has taught us, it’s that rich people never alter their economic activity or shift their assets in response to changes in tax law. My initial idea was that this tax would only affect the richest man in America, but my staff told me that could cost me the endorsement of the Washington Post . I wanted to hit Jeff Bezos with an income tax, but apparently that lunatic’s base salary at Amazon is about $81,000. So under the “Pillage Like a Viking” provision of the Super-Duper Millionaire’s Tax, the IRS would simply seize everything he has, and that would pay for about $132 billion. Only $8.7 trillion to go! Oh, and I guess we can eliminate the home-mortgage interest deduction from the tax code, since no one will have any mortgages anymore. Like Warren, I decry the fact that states are spending less per-student on public institutions of higher education than before. Unlike Warren, I read a little deeper into the studies and found that the main reason for the decline in higher-education funding is “state Medicaid spending is the single biggest contributor to the decline in higher-education funding at the state and local level” as well as “K–12 education; public welfare (which includes most Medicaid spending, Supplemental Security Income, food stamps, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families); health and hospitals; police and fire protection; and corrections.” In other words, one of the reasons state universities aren’t getting as much money as they used to is because politicians like me chose to increase spending on all the other stuff we like to promise on the campaign trail. Whoops. Studies like this make it sound like we have to prioritize and compromise, and that taxpayers are not an endless fountain of money that can always be squeezed further. I reject arguments like this, because the foundation of my worldview is that we can always spend more money, and I fear telling anyone, particularly voters, that they cannot have something they want. As a progressive Democrat, I’ve been accused of being hostile to business, but my plan to shift mortgage debt from home purchasers to the federal government has already been endorsed by lots of big companies: Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Quicken, PennyMac. I figured my reputation for supporting higher taxes and more regulations would scare away big business from this idea, but when I announced my intentions for this plan, the representatives of these big lenders leaped up from the table and started dancing, and started singing about “no more worrying about borrowers defaults on mortgages, ever,” or something. They then suggested that my plan could end foreclosures, forever. This idea is even better than I thought! Then the National Association of Home Builders said they could endorse the plan if it extended to new potential homebuyers, as well as existing ones. See, Americans? I’m a uniter, not a divider. If the mortgage lenders and homebuilders like my plan to pay off the debts, university administrators must have reacted to Warren’s plan like Meg Ryan in the diner in When Harry Met Sally. Like Warren’s student-debt plan, I’m calling my mortgage-debt plan “an investment in our future.” Paying for her investment would cost almost 20 percent of our current tax revenue. But under my plan, a better America, free from worry about affording a home, is within our grasp, and all it will take is . . . between $10 trillion and $11 trillion in the first year. That’s only three times our current federal tax revenue and just half of our current annual gross domestic product ! For What Feels Like the Millionth Time, Here Comes Biden Joe Biden was originally going to announce his presidential campaign tomorrow, but he’s now pushing it back, according to Edward-Isaac Dovere of The Atlantic. Biden vs. Trump would be a fascinating matchup. Because as we’ve seen in recent weeks, Biden by himself is something of a liability. Too old, gaffe-prone, more or less at odds with the loudest corners of the Democratic party’s grassroots . . . and for better and worse, he’s nothing new. On paper he’s “a return to normalcy,” but he’s not all that “normal.” If Biden wins the nomination, he would probably have Barack Obama out on the campaign trail a lot . But you figure Biden would put every state Obama won at least in play, and if you’re a Democrat, that looks pretty good. I’ve been thinking about Bernie Sanders and how the Democratic elites react if he’s the nominee. America’s suburbs are full of soccer moms in households making six figures who are appalled by Trump but who don’t particularly want a socialist revolution. They don’t fume about the big banks, because they have accounts in those banks, and perhaps work there. They’ve got a good health-insurance plan through their employer and would worry about their quality of care under Medicare for All. They’re concerned about climate change but still bought a Lexis LUV (luxury utility vehicle). These voters want something like the Obama status quo — lots of symbolic progressivism, but policies that allow them to continue enjoying the good life — and maybe getting a big tax deduction for buying a Tesla or putting solar panels on their roof. In a Trump-Sanders matchup, do these voters start looking at . . . Howard Schultz?

During last night’s CNN town halls, Bernie Sanders endorsed reinstating the voting rights of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber, and Kamala Harris indicated that she was open to the idea. Anne Carlstein, a junior at Harvard, asked Sanders, “Y ou have said that you believe that people with felony records should be allowed to vote while in prison. Does this mean that you would support enfranchising people like the Boston Marathon bomber, a convicted terrorist and murderer? Do you think that those convicted of sexual assault should have the opportunity to vote for politicians who could have a direct impact on women’s rights? ”
Sanders responded:
SANDERS: So here is — Anne, to answer your question, as it happens, in my own state of Vermont, from the very first days of our state’s history, what our Constitution says is that everybody can vote. That is true. So people in jail can vote. Now, here is my view. If somebody commits a serious crime, sexual assault, murder, they’re going to be punished. They may be in jail for 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, their whole lives. That’s what happens when you commit a serious crime. But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy, yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say, well, that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote. Oh, that person did that, not going to let that person vote. You’re running down a slippery slope. So I believe that people commit crimes, they paid the price. When they get out of jail, I believe they certainly should have the right to vote. But I do believe that even if they are in jail they’re paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.
Harris said “W e should have that conversation. ”
LEMON: Another issue that I want to talk to you about — this is really important — I’m not sure if you were watching earlier, but Senator Bernie Sanders said that he is in favor of felons being able to vote while serving in prison. He was asked specifically about people like the Boston Marathon bomber, also people who are convicted of sexual assault. And he said, this is a quote, “The right to vote is inherent to our democracy, yes, even for terrible people.” Do you agree with that, Senator?
HARRIS: I agree that the right to vote is one of the very important components of citizenship and it is something that people should not be stripped of needlessly, which is why I have been long an advocate of making sure that the formally incarcerated are not denied a right to vote, which is the case in so many states in our country, in some states permanently deprived of the right to vote.
And these are policies that go back to Jim Crow. These are policies that go back to the heart of policies that have been about disenfranchisement, policies that continue until today, and we need to take it seriously. Advertisement Advertisement

(Brian Snyder/Reuters)
Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) distanced himself Monday from his past endorsement of government ownership of the means of production, telling the audience at CNN’s town hall in New Hampshire that he’s moderated his views since his time serving as the mayor of Burlington in the 1970’s.
Asked by an audience member whether he plans to implement the kinds of policies that caused her parents to flee the Soviet Union in 1979, Sanders sought to distinguish between “authoritarian communism” and the “democratic socialism” he now promotes. “Is it your assumption that I supported or believe in authoritarian communism that existed in the Soviet Union? I don’t. I never have, and I opposed it. I believe in a vigorous democracy,” he said, before adding that he believes government should play a significant role in reducing wealth inequality and providing health care and education.
CNN’s Chris Cuomo then confronted Sanders with an interview he gave to the Burlington Free Press in 1976, in which he advocated “the public ownership of utilities, banks and major industries.”
Sanders emphasized the date of his remarks and said that he has never moved to nationalize industry during his political career. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“I was a mayor of a city for eight years. Did I nationalize any of the industry in the city of Burlington, Vermont? I don’t think so.

(Yuri Gripas/Reuters) It’s time for a conversation about the senator’s equivocations.
I f you want to know which way the wind is blowing in the Democratic primary, just watch Kamala Harris.
Asked about impeaching President Trump on Saturday, the California senator and presidential candidate said : “I believe that there is room for that conversation, but right now what I want is, I want Mueller to come before Congress to testify. I want to be able to see the full unredacted report, and specifically also the underlying evidence.” But by the time Harris appeared on CNN Monday night for a town-hall meeting in New Hampshire, she had apparently heard enough of the conversation going on inside the Democratic party to make up her mind. “I believe that Congress should take steps towards impeachment,” Harris said, following the lead of Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who had called for impeachment last Friday. Advertisement Advertisement
Harris and Warren were joined by South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg in pushing the party towards impeachment during Monday night’s CNN town halls. “I think he’s made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment. I’m also going to leave the House and Senate to figure that out,” Buttigieg said. Of the five Democratic presidential candidates who appeared on CNN Monday night, only two stopped short of calling for impeachment. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said she wouldn’t prejudge the matter because, as a senator, she would effectively serve as a juror in any impeachment case against Trump. And Vermont senator Bernie Sanders called for a “thorough investigation” but expressed concern that if the House moves toward impeachment, the political debate will be focused on “Trump, Trump, Trump and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller” — not the progressive/socialist domestic-policy agenda.
Sanders may be lagging behind his colleagues in his enthusiasm for impeachment, but make no mistake: He is driving the conversation inside the Democratic party on matters of policy. When asked about Elizabeth Warren’s proposed federal program to forgive up to $50,000 per person in student-loan debt, Sanders pointed out that he is the intellectual godfather of such plans. Sanders said that four years ago, everybody was saying: “Bernie is a little bit crazy, talking about making public colleges and universities tuition-free.” Advertisement
“Ain’t such a crazy idea today,” Sanders added. Advertisement
Indeed. And on Monday night, Sanders did more to display his power to make previously extreme ideas seem mainstream in his party. When asked specifically if the Boston Marathon bomber and those convicted of sexual assault should be able to vote while they’re incarcerated, he answered in the affirmative. Pete Buttigieg answered the same question with a simple “No.” But Kamala Harris equivocated: “I think we should have that conversation.”
Asked later about lowering the voting age to 16, Harris said: “I’m really interested in having that conversation.” Some Democratic bigwigs now think it’s time to have a conversation about Kamala Harris’s interest in “having that conversation.” Advertisement
“At some point this could end up being a problem,” David Axelrod, a former Obama adviser, said last night on CNN. “She is an incredibly compelling personality; a very bright and accomplished person. But she’s very cautious — and that caution was pretty apparent in a lot of her answers.”"
Few Students Gripe So Duke Cans a Popular Professor After 20 Years | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Leef,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/a-few-students-gripe-so-duke-cans-a-popular-professor-after-20-years/,"About George Leef April 23, 2019 11:05 AM
A few years ago, a leftist prof wrote a piece in which he admitted that he was “ terrified “” of his students. I’d say that most professors should feel that way, particularly if they teach at a school with an administration dominated by “ progressives. ” Comments
Today’s Martin Center article provides support for that view. It’s by Evan Charney, who taught at Duke for 20 years and was a very popular professor. But all it took to end his career was complaints from a few hypersensitive leftist students who said his teaching style made them uncomfortable. Even though many students came to Charney’s defense, that meant nothing at a school where “ woke ” students must be appeased."

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said Tuesday that border authorities are not considering resuming the separation of migrant families, a practice that was ended by the Trump administration last year after it drew outrage from both sides of the aisle.
“We’re not pursuing that approach,” McAleenan said . “Prosecuting violations of the law does have a consequence and it does deter behavior but it [does] not work if you lose the public trust.”
The DHS secretary added that the separation policy was “not worth it” from an enforcement perspective.
DHS’s “zero tolerance” immigration-enforcement policy was spearheaded by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The family-separation component of the policy continued for at least a year until President Trump signed an executive order last June ending it. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“We’re going to have strong, very strong borders, but we’re going to keep the families together,” Trump said at the time. “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.”
The government never had a concrete plan to reunite separated families, according to documents that emerged as part of a court battle over the policy. And while the precise number of separated families is unknown, it is believed to be in the thousands."

(Steve Marcus/Reuters)
Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that President Trump would have been indicted over the actions described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report had he not been a sitting president.
“I think there’s enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted,” Clinton said during her remarks at the Time 100 Summit. “The whole matter of obstruction was very directly sent to the Congress. And if you read that part of the report, it could not be clearer.”
Mueller concluded in the report that Trump and his associates had not engaged in collusion with Russia but declined to weigh in on whether a number of Trump’s actions during the investigation — including his decision to fire FBI director James Comey and his attempts to have Mueller fired — constituted obstruction of justice. The report instead left that determination up to Congress. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Elizabeth Warren's Student-Debt Proposal: 'Broadly Progressive'? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/elizabeth-warrens-student-debt-proposal-broadly-progressive/,"April 24, 2019 10:20 AM Sen. Elizabeth Warren
I had to chuckle at this from Jared Bernstein :
The Warren plan expends resources on student debtors from upper-income families, but it is still broadly progressive. Analysis from experts at Brandeis University, the University of Tennessee, and Arizona State University shows that among low and moderate-income families — those in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution — close to 90 percent of borrowing households would have their student debt wiped out compared to just under 30 percent of those in the top 10 percent. Similarly, the proposal provides total cancellation for about 90 percent of those with an associate degree or less but provides total cancellation for about only 25 percent of those with a professional degree or doctorate. (Because student debt rises with household income , the plan could be made more progressive and less expensive by lowering the $50K cancellation amount).
It’s funny because this calculates the progressivity of student-loan relief the way conservatives calculate the progressivity of tax cuts.
As I spelled out in this post , there are a lot of different ways to do the math on “progressivity,” and they led to very different conclusions about the 2017 GOP tax law. If you just look at raw dollar amounts, the rich got a lot more (simply because they pay the most in taxes to begin with) — making the policy look ridiculously regressive. If you look at percentage changes to after-tax income, things look quite a bit better. If you look at percentage changes to federal taxes paid, things look better still. And if you ignore payroll taxes and just look at changes to income taxes paid, the policy is actually ridiculously progressive, with some people at the bottom getting a 100 percent tax cut (though they paid very little in income taxes to begin with and saw no change to their much higher payroll-tax burden)."
Donald Trump's 2020 Election Victory Chances are Very Real | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/realistically-trump-could-win-in-2020/,"April 24, 2019 9:48 AM President Donald Trump declares a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border in Washington, D.C., February 15, 2019. (Carlos Barria/REUTERS) Making the click-through worthwhile: A deep dive into how President Trump’s outlook for 2020 is brightening, and how Democrats are giving him an exceptionally easy target; the Florida supreme court backs firing America’s least-favorite sheriff; and the Democratic donor class shifts from Beto O’Rourke to Pete Buttigieg. Sabato Is Right. It Is Easy to See How Trump Can Win in 2020. Larry Sabato greets Washington Post readers with a headline that many of them probably didn’t expect to see or want to see: “It’s easy to see how Trump can win reelection.” Sabato : Credit the powers of incumbency and a strong economy, the state of which may matter more to Trump’s odds than nearly anything else. Incumbency and the economy, among other matters, ended up being more than enough for Nixon, Reagan and Bush. Despite Trump’s unprecedented outlandishness, that same combination might work for him, too. Let’s get our “to be sure” paragraph out of the way. To be sure, Trump’s approval rating in Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin is in the low to mid-40s, and his disapproval is above 50 percent, which is ominous. ( Apparently Pennsylvania Republicans are particularly nervous about 2020 .) He’s narrowly underwater in Arizona and Florida. His approval rating in Georgia, Indiana, and North Carolina is barely ahead of his disapproval rating. In Minnesota, a state Trump lost by only two percentage points in 2016, Trump’s approval is just 37 percent. If Trump’s share of the vote is equal to the percentage of Americans who currently approve of him, he’s toast. But elections are not just referendum on whether voters approve of the incumbent; they’re a contrast between two or more options. Democrats were completely convinced that not only did Hillary Clinton have the more likable persona in 2016, but that she had the more appealing set of proposals: “comprehensive immigration reform,” a public option for health care, gun control, overturn Citizens United and allow the government to limit spending on political speech and messaging, tax increases on income of more than $5 million and $275 billion on new infrastructure spending. As conservatives, we may disagree with all of that or almost all of that, but we can acknowledge that those are, at least when described generically, reasonably popular proposals — particularly with voters who don’t bother to look at the details. And then . . . she lost, to a guy who kept going on about building a big beautiful wall and making Mexico pay for it. The 2020 crop of Democrats are running on an extremely different set of proposals: Reparations for slavery . Decriminalizing entering the country illegally . Tearing down existing border barriers . Abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency . Expanding the size of the Supreme Court to change the balance of the current justices . Eliminating the filibuster in the Senate (even though that’s not something the president controls). Eliminate private health insurance entirely . Eliminate the Electoral College . Have the federal government guarantee a job for every citizen . And, as Bernie Sanders suggested earlier this week , restoring the right to vote to everyone, including felons serving life sentences for violent and heinous crimes. Those are much more controversial proposals than Hillary’s agenda in 2016. These are the sorts of ideas that Republican candidates dream of running against, and the sorts of issues that make attack-ad makers giddy with anticipation. We’ve heard a lot about how Donald Trump alienates once-Republican-leaning soccer moms in the suburbs — and he does. There are a bunch of soft Republicans out there who just want their taxes low, their streets safe, and their terrorists dead. They’re not all that worried about illegal immigration, they think health care is too expensive but are wary about any changes to the insurance and doctor they currently have, they’re unnerved by gun violence and mass shootings and they recoil in horror from anything that even vaguely resembles white nationalism. But these kinds of voters are not itching for a socialist revolution, or a complicated scheme of wealth redistribution that studies your genealogy for connections to slavery, or open borders, or rewriting the Constitution. You hear a phrase from Never-Trumpers, the Trump-skeptical, and the Trump-weary with increasing regularity: “All the Democrats have to do is not be crazy, and they can’t even do that.” Some of these folks are looking for a Democrat to support, some want “a return to normalcy,” and some just want to feel the hope that the United States could have a new president on 2021 who is less flawed than the current one. The status quo with Trump has some serious flaws. Only two things really get Trump motivated: the opportunity to boast and repeat praise of himself from other people, and the opportunity to lash out at critics. You see it in his pro forma first tweet of the day about some current event or serious issue, and then the following half-dozen tweets about “PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!” and “ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE!” and furious denunciations of something some pundit said on television about him. He can’t recruit good staff, abuses and publicly humiliates the people who are willing to work for him, and has a dysfunctional level of staff turnover. This White House is perpetually disorganized and unprepared; remember how there was supposed to be this formal written response to the Mueller report? Apparently, we’re not going to get one. The president keeps describing dictators in unnervingly kind terms and seems wildly naïve about Kim Jong Un. But . . . we haven’t had a military conflict in North Korea. The Islamic State has been smashed. When Trump’s proposals go beyond what is permitted under U.S. law or the Constitution, the federal judiciary and Supreme Court step in and limit him. Despite the claim that Trump is an authoritarian or an aspiring dictator, his party lost the House of Representatives. The economy is largely thriving and unemployment is low. We’re an energy-exporting powerhouse. The federal judiciary is filling up with originalist judges who will provide a check on government excesses for a generation. Trump signed bipartisan criminal-justice reform into law. “Right to try” has given new hope to thousands facing serious diseases. Iran’s economy is getting hit hard by the reinstated sanctions. The individual mandate in Obamacare is repealed. The Food and Drug Administration is setting records for the number and speed of its generic drug approvals . As a status quo, this is pretty good! Many of Trump’s more emotionally charged critics warned us his presidency would be a dystopia, a combination of The Handmaid’s Tale , The Day After Tomorrow , 1984 , and maybe throw in bit of the ABC miniseries Amerika for the notion of a government controlled by Moscow. Look out your window. You probably don’t see a dystopia; you may not see a country all that dramatically different from 2016.

NRPLUS Conference Call with Rich Lowry and Victor David Hanson | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Philip Devoe,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/nrplus-conference-call-with-rich-lowry-and-victor-david-hanson/,"April 24, 2019 12:34 PM (NRO Illustration: Elijah Smith)
Yesterday morning, NR editor in chief Rich Lowry spoke with author and historian Victor Davis Hanson to members of the NRPLUS group on a private conference call. The pair discussed the Mueller report, Victor’s decision to support Trump, and Victor’s life on a farm in Fresno, Calif.
Rich and Victor started the call by discussing the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Donald Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. Victor described the report as a reflection of Mueller’s team, who he says were all non-Republicans tasked with the job of finding evidence of collusion regardless of whether collusion was present. Indeed, the first volume didn’t suggest any evidence was found. But by packing everything damning of Trump into Volume II, the team managed to accomplish the job the Left wanted them to accomplish. Advertisement Advertisement
Victor says that impeachment isn’t likely, as long as the economy remains strong and the United States doesn’t enter another war, but the progressive Left will continue to pursue it regardless of the presence of these triggers, which makes stopping the impeachment train harder. Arguing on their terms won’t work, Victor explained, and only a counter-offensive will. This counter-offensive would bring to light improper behavior by those on the Left, including Andrew McCabe or James Comey. For example, how did Comey and the FBI find their contacts if it wasn’t through John Brennan or people talking through Congress? There’s a lot of legal exposure, Victor says. Once the Right begins to pursue that, the push for impeachment will lessen.
Next, Victor explained why he made his decision to support Trump for president, as he wasn’t a supporter until near the end of the campaign. He offered three reasons. First, he was witnessing his neighborhood, which used to be a very safe, multi-ethnic community of farmers, becoming dangerous. Just a quarter of a mile away from his farm, several illegal activities began popping up. Second, he was seeing what happens when progressivism takes over. California was passing new taxes and new laws designed to make the state better, but Victor didn’t see many positive changes. Third, on his trips to Stanford University, he would witness cultural progressivism, in the form of unanimous support for sanctuary cities, safe spaces, trigger warnings, and more. Victor added that he believes many other people in the country grew tired of Marquess of Queensbury Republicans, who would call victory even with a narrow electoral loss and then go out for drinks with their opponent like divorce lawyers after a case. Advertisement
The hosts then turned to questions from NRPLUS users, who were participating via the Facebook page and the plus@nationalreview.com email. One user asked whether the toxicity in American culture is unprecedented and how we can move forward to unite the country. Victor explained that we have had many eras during which the U.S. was unstable, but the things that people were protesting against was something even the other side had sympathy for. The issues now are issues without consensus. The force multiplier of all of these dissensions have created two cultures: The East and West coasts and middle America. Victor’s colleagues have been all over the world, and yet never to Fresno, Visalia, or Bakersfield, which are between four and five hours away from San Francisco. That’s scary, Victor said. And if Trump gets elected to a second term, Victor says he believes that California is going to ramp up the aggressive defiance of the president’s. Advertisement"
Professor Mark Kleiman of NYU's Critique | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/new-york-university-mark-kleiman-critique/,"April 24, 2019 2:01 PM Professor Mark Kleiman (Wikimedia)
I’m going to pick on Professor Mark Kleiman of NYU’s Marron Institute of Urban Management for a bit, and not just because I’m cheesed about his suggesting, wrongly and dishonestly, that an easily checked fact in a piece of mine is a “flat-out lie.”
(To be clear: Professor Kleiman wrote that the claim was false and then rhetorically asked whether it was a “flat-out lie,” which is a tediously familiar form of passive-aggressive intellectual cowardice .) Advertisement Advertisement
The times being what they are, I am fairly used to misrepresentations of my writing and my views; I am asked on a fairly regular basis about things I’m alleged to have written (and tweeted) that are pure invention—by which I do not mean taken out of context, distorted, etc., but simply made up out of whole cloth, pure fabrication. This is pretty common stuff on social media, usually from anonymous trolls or sad Media Matters types.
But it matters a great deal more when it’s an NYU professor, even on Twitter. If we are to have a functional democratic discourse, then we need functional and reliable institutions. Another way of saying that is that NYU is not the only loser when NYU professors develop a reputation for intellectual dishonesty: The rest of us need NYU professors to be reasonably honest, too. We need the news pages of the New York Times to be more or less non-fiction, irrespective of their point of view. We need public-radio journalists to forgo reporting as fact fictions about “ exploding bullets .” We need conservative commentators who can tell the difference between a Jewish child in Nazi-occupied territory and an agent of the Third Reich .
A lie from a putatively authoritative source such as Professor Kleiman takes on a life of its own. One response to him on Twitter reads:
They [meaning National Review ] don’t care if they publish lies as long as it means they “win”, i.e., means they get their agenda fulfilled. It’s all about winning, not truth, when it comes to these right-wing tools. In short, @NRO doesn’t care that he lied, because his lie fits their agenda.
So there’s a made-up “fact”– that I lied to my readers about teachers’ compensation — and then a morally satisfying story that partisans tell themselves about that fiction. The prestige of an institution such as NYU is an intellectual tool and, like any tool, it can be used in a responsible way or in an irresponsible way. Professors have a particular professional duty to use their tools responsibly. Sometimes, they need a little help in that. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Bias is a problem, but this isn’t really a question about bias. I know what Mother Jones ’s biases are, but if I read a news story in that magazine that says x , y , or z happened, I am reasonably confident that the facts of the case are things that actually happened, however loopy the point of view Mother Jones might bring to those facts. Journalists make errors, of course, as do professors, and the better ones correct them. But they generally do not make things up. Advertisement
The problem for professors such as Mark Kleiman is two-fold. One is the basic structure of social media, especially Twitter, which rewards and encourages outrage and expressions of tribal affiliation. The other (distinct but not entirely unrelated) problem is the hysterical political tenor of our times, which justifies intellectual dishonesty and pig-brained partisanship as expressions of moral urgency and markers of moral seriousness. Hatred is taken as a warrant for dishonesty—and nothing comes more naturally to the inferior kind of mind than hatred and dishonesty. Advertisement
My forthcoming book, The Smallest Minority , is in large part about this kind of thing and the way it undermines our democratic discourse. Advertisement
It’s an unhealthy thing for Republicans and conservatives to hear something unwelcome from an NYU professor or the New York Times and dismiss it out of hand with a sneering admonition to “consider the source.” But it’s an even more unhealthy thing for rage-addled mediocrities such as Professor Kleiman to give them reasons to do so.
For the record, I emailed Professor Kleiman about his error to give him a chance to correct himself. He refuses to do so. He did write to claim that “no reader is going to think salary-plus-benefits.” The piece in question plainly states that the number cited refers to salary and benefits — twice , in fact. I suppose it’s possible that he did not actually read my column. Likely, even, I suppose: He also wanted to know why I’m not more critical of President Trump and military spending, so he’s pretty clearly operating in the dark. Advertisement "

President Trump said Wednesday that he plans to fight all subpoenas issued by congressional Democrats in their investigation of his administration, including requests for his financial records and for the full, unredacted Mueller report.
“We’re fighting all the subpoenas,” the president told reporters outside the White House before heading to a summit on the opioid crisis in Atlanta. “The subpoena is ridiculous. We have been, I have been the most transparent president and administration in the history of our country by far.”
Since retaking the House in January, Democrats in the lower chamber have opened numerous investigations of Trump’s administration and personal finances. They have subpoenaed the president’s financial records, including his tax returns, and have asked former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify to his claims, laid out in the Mueller report, that Trump asked him to have Mueller fired."
Abortion & Washington Post: Editorial Misrepresents Polling & Pro-Life Law | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/washington-post-editorial-misrepresents-abortion-polling/,"April 24, 2019 2:26 PM The Washington Post Company building in Washington, D.C., 2012 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
A Washington Post editorial on abortion regulations published yesterday evening begins with one misdirection, ends with another, and fills its middle with so many obfuscations it would take a great deal of time and space to unpack them all. Let’s focus on just a couple.
The editorial begins with the claim that “public support for abortion rights is at its highest since . . . Roe v. Wade ,” citing just one poll that shows 67 percent of voters believe abortion should be legal in “all” or “most” cases. This cherry-picking of data entirely ignores a variety of studies that show the trend on Americans’ views of abortion moving in precisely the opposite direction. Advertisement Advertisement
A majority of Americans still describe themselves as “pro-choice,” but according to recent Marist polling, more than three-quarters say they support restricting abortion to, at most, the first trimester. That statistic includes a majority of Democrats and a majority of those who call themselves pro-choice, an incredibly under-reported reality. Last summer, meanwhile, Gallup found that fewer than one-third of Americans support allowing abortion after the first trimester — and that just 13 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in the third trimester.

That last figure matters, of course, because Democratic lawmakers in New York, and Virginia, and Rhode Island, and Illinois, and New Mexico, and Vermont have spent the first few months of 2019 pushing policies to allow abortion, for any reason whatsoever, until the moment of birth. We witnessed a fight in the U.S. Senate over the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would have required doctors to provide medical care to newborn infants who survive attempted abortion procedures. Forty-four Democratic senators voted against that bill, and it failed to pass."
Climate Change & Progressives’ Environment Hypocrisy -- Conservatives Should Step In | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Todd Myers,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/environmental-hypocrites-of-the-left/,"April 24, 2019 2:34 PM (Heinz-Peter Bader/Reuters ) Why progressives refuse to live by their own Earth Day bluster
G eorge Monbiot recently expressed a carefully calibrated environmental message that allows people on the environmental left to feel self-righteous without making any real sacrifice. In a video that was shared widely, including by celebrities such as James Corden, the British writer argues that the only way to help the environment is to change the “big, structural, political economic stuff.” Monbiot concludes that we need to “go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it.” At the same time, he dismisses “pathetic, micro-consumerist bollocks which just isn’t going to get us anywhere.” Advertisement
This is absolution for those who want to feel green but can’t be bothered with going to the effort and expense of actually living their own values. Publicly advocating the “do as I say, not as I do” approach reinforces the reality that conservatives tend to live out the environmental ethic that the Left only preaches.
As a conservative who has worked in environmental policy for two decades, I have been frustrated watching as ideological fellow travelers avoid environmental topics, even as they privately express their commitment to environmental stewardship. As the Left becomes more detached from responsible and effective environmental solutions, conservatives should confidently fill the void.
One reason conservatives do not engage is that environmentalism has become synonymous with horrible government policy. Every Earth Day, we are treated to theatrical images of marches featuring unhinged activists demanding action on a range of environmental issues. Clever hashtags are generated. Alarmist slogans are flaunted. Naked people glue themselves to park benches. And all who disagree with the demands for more government power are denigrated as “deniers.” Advertisement
The other 364 days of the year, however, people on the left do little in their daily lives to justify all that environmental browbeating. A study by researchers at the University of Michigan and Cornell University found that those who are “highly concerned” about climate change are “least likely to report individual-level actions” to reduce their environmental impact. Those who considered themselves “skeptical” of climate change “were most likely to report engaging in individual-level pro-environmental behaviors.” To be sure, not all conservatives are skeptical of climate change, but generally, we aren’t nearly as alarmist about climate change or other environmental issues, even when we recognize the risk. Advertisement
That gap between the Left’s loud talk and their unwillingness to make personal sacrifices is not an accident. It is now part of their dogma. Individual actions are mere “bollocks,” useless gestures. Only the sacrifices made by others will make a difference. Advertisement
This dichotomy is evident in my home state of Washington, where politicians pride themselves on showing “leadership” in the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This year, our legislature enacted a law requiring the state to meet a 100 percent renewable-energy target by 2045. Environmental activists tweeted their support, saying they “demand action now” and worrying about the climate crisis.
Ironically, though, many who demand action do little of it themselves. For only a few dollars a month, anyone who supports renewable energy can already buy renewable-energy credits (RECs), ensuring that there is enough renewable energy on the grid to cover their personal use. I asked one politician pushing for the 100 percent–renewable requirement if she buys RECs to cover her environmental impact. She admitted that she does not and has no plans to do so. Advertisement
This is consistent with the message of Monbiot and political leaders pushing the Green New Deal. Personal sacrifice is of little consequence, so why even try? Even as they call for an end to air travel, politicians who demand we impose lifestyle change have not curtailed their own carbon-producing travel, despite living in the era of HD video conferencing. Advertisement
The most effective environmental efforts are often small, personal actions in which people have skin in the game. Farmers find ways to conserve water because waste costs money. Aluminum cans are lighter today because it saves resources and they cost less to ship. Homeowners and businesses conserve energy because they pay the price for every kilowatt-hour. When they don’t save, they change course, unlike politicians who fear public embarrassment and throw good money after bad.
This isn’t just a theory. The amount of energy per unit of GDP in the United States has fallen steadily for several decades. There are no sharp drops. Instead, the improvement is gradual and constant, as individuals and businesses find ways to squeeze a bit more out of their energy use. Politicians can lecture all they want, but these are truly the front lines of environmental stewardship."
Christopher DeMuth & American Interest -- From Balanced Budgets to Borrowed Benefits | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Matthew Continetti,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/from-balanced-budgets-to-borrowed-benefits/,"April 24, 2019 2:20 PM (Marcos Brindicci/Reuters)
Christopher DeMuth has written another extraordinary essay. This one appears in The American Interest under the headline “ Welfare and Debt: A Moynihan Assessment . ” His starting point is a speech on public finance delivered by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the winter of 1986. Moynihan used the occasion to contrast federal budgets before and after the Reagan tax cuts. It was an unfavorable comparison. Reagan, he said, had purposely deprived the federal government of revenue in order to constrain spending. The upshot was an explosion in the national debt. “ The largest debtor nation with a declining defense program, ” Moynihan said, “ is not likely to remain for long the symbol of successful government. ” Advertisement Advertisement
Moynihan wasn’t entirely right in his assessment. The tax cuts, DeMuth observes, were not intended to limit spending. They were meant to promote growth. “ Deficits ballooned in the mid-1980s mainly because Paul Volker’s Federal Reserve reduced inflation faster than anyone had anticipated. ” Reagan’s defense buildup was necessary to deter the Soviet Union. But Moynihan did have a “ big, singular insight. ” The “ political economy of the federal government ” underwent a dramatic change in the last quarter of the twentieth century that has persisted into the 21st. The government once provided public goods. Now it finances private consumption. “ Altogether, through good times and bad, deficit spending and payments for individuals have grown in tandem for nearly fifty years. ”"

The practices under this president, the practices under the last president, where families were broken up . . . we don’t need those internal roundups and deportations and enforcement.”
“We were taking children from their mothers and fathers after having completed a more than 2,000-mile journey fleeing the deadliest places on the planet today, trying to follow our own asylum laws, and I would argue being illegally blocked and rejected and arrested and separated and caged by this president and this administration,” he added."

The redacted version of Mueller’s report, which sent shockwaves through Washington when it was released Thursday, concluded that “the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges” related to the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia but left up to Congress the decision of whether to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.

'The White Crow' Review: Unsentimental Tale of Rudolf Nureyev’s Defection | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/the-white-crow-movie-rudolf-nureyev-unsentimental-tale/,"April 24, 2019 7:36 PM Oleg Ivenko in The White Crow (Sony Pictures Classics) Ralph Fiennes avoids patronizing platitudes about poor immigrants.
I n The White Crow , young Rudolf Nureyev (played by Oleg Ivenko) first arrives in Paris to perform with St. Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre ballet troupe, but his immediate desire is to visit the Louvre. “I want The Raft to myself,” he says, referring to Géricault’s 1818 large-scale masterpiece The Raft of the Medusa . Nureyev’s yearning is significant to his character and his striver’s experience in the Soviet working class. Art is the raft that carries Nureyev from strict Russian conformity to the freedom his individual egotistic personality needs and that he finds in the West. Advertisement Advertisement
There is so much patronizing in contemporary immigration film — usually about Africans, as in Grianfranco Rosi’s Fire at Sea , or about Central Americans, as in Cary Joji Fukunaga’s Sin Nombre — that we have lost sight of the most important principles. The White Crow observes immigration experience through the idiosyncrasy of a famous artist rather than in “humanitarian crisis” platitudes, the meanings of which shift according to whoever is mouthing them.
Because Nureyev’s citizen-of-the-world identity is not a political issue, The White Crow avoids the usual sanctimony associated with Western attitudes toward immigration. (Think of those maudlin Statue of Liberty tales that politicians exploit and movies rarely get right – only Jim Sheridan’s In America and the first half of Paul Mazursky’s Moscow on the Hudson came close to justifying “beautiful mosaic” corniness, and it eventually succumbed to piety.) Advertisement
As The White Crow ’s title suggests, its perspective derives from the Russian folk metaphor of “the white crow,” which describes an unusual person, an outsider. The film is clear-eyed about immigration because it focuses on a privileged artist’s selfishness, the part of his humanity that is inseparable from his ambition and probably inherent to his talent.
Ivenko actually resembles Mikhail Baryshnikov, but he can certainly dance the Rudolf role, and he plays it with youthful zest. Nureyev’s first emotional connection in the West comes when he breaches KGB protocol at an official meet-and-greet by daring to approach French dancer Pierre Lacotte (Raphaël Personnaz). Lacotte looks at the brash Russian with intense interest — two pairs of wide eyes flash. Advertisement
In their commiseration on the roof of the Paris Opera, Lacotte tells Nureyev, “Art is to learn from.” This turns out to be the guiding principle of director Ralph Fiennes (who also plays the role of Nureyev’s ballet instructor, Pushkin) and screenwriter David Hare. Key scenes of Nureyev in isolated rehearsal sessions are intercut with scenes of the infatuated dance protégé and tourist enraptured at the Louvre; his close examinations of large, sensual, smooth-muscled sculptures serve almost as fantasy allegories for his sexual privacy. Advertisement
Fiennes and Hare steer clear of banalities — including the subplot of Pushkin’s insistence that Nureyev live with him and his wife, which leads to fairly restrained infidelity and hints of deviance (although some Ken Russell brazenness might have gone deeper). Fiennes and Hare’s discretion emphasize cultural appreciation over politics, which ultimately unbalances the narrative: When Nureyev makes his 1961 defection, the meaning of the event — confirming memories of The Raft — doesn’t have the dramatic impact they should.
Nureyev’s stubbornness is well established in scenes where he haughtily joins the Parisian elite, especially a restaurant scene with socialite Clara Saint (Adèle Exarchopoulos) that raises class fears from his background. It will figure in the famous moment at Le Bourget airport when he is poised between KGB officials and French police and fearfully contemplates his steps toward asylum. Advertisement Advertisement
The individual’s sense of freedom characterized his artistic reputation. “Your technique is clumsy, but your spirit is perfect. You take the stage!” Lacotte says with admiration. Clara Saint, a helpful intimate of André Malraux’s, France’s minister of culture, encourages boldness when insisting that Nureyev fight his fears and ask for what he wants. Either Hare fumbles this decisive incident or Fiennes stages it poorly."
Politics in ‘Game of Thrones’ and ‘The Walking Dead’: A Conservative Interpretation | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/game-of-thrones-walking-dead-politics-conservative-interpretations/,"April 25, 2019 6:30 AM Game of Thrones (HBO) Both Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead are obliged by the nature of their dramatic structures to consider the fundamental questions of politics, and both invite deeply conservative interpretations.
C onservatives are acutely aware of our pop-cultural deficit, and sometimes argue that we need more conservative stories on film, on television, on stage, in books, etc. But we do not need more stories that are conservative — we need more stories that are true.
The great works of art that appeal to the conservative sensibility rarely if ever are constructed as self-consciously conservative stories — propagandistic literature lends itself more readily to progressive causes, in any case. What Coriolanus tells us about populism and mass politics is not true because it is conservative but conservative because it is true. The relationship between the beautiful and the true helps to explain how it is that so many actual Communists in Hollywood’s golden age produced works that were moving, true, often patriotic, often speaking to religious faith, and in many cases profoundly conservative. They weren’t out to make something right-wing, but something great. Advertisement Advertisement
I doubt very much that either Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead is the product of an overwhelmingly conservative group of storytellers. (From what I can learn of the politics of the writers, that does not seem to be the case.) But both shows are obliged by the nature of their dramatic structures to consider the fundamental questions of politics, and both invite deeply conservative interpretations.
The Walking Dead is, at this point, a show that is only incidentally about zombies. It is mainly a story about the origins of political order, one that has taken several different approaches to Mancur Olson’s idea of the state as a “stationary bandit.” Olson argues that political order has its origins in ordinary rapine and pillaging — at some point, his theory goes, the bandit begins to understand that his own interests are better served not by razing the villages, massacring the farmers, and burning the fields, but by leaving his victims with just enough to survive and to continue producing — so that there is something for him to loot next season. (Murray Rothbard and others made similar arguments describing the origins of the state as organized crime.) As the bandit begins to identify his own long-term well-being with that of his victims, he discovers incentives to stay in one place rather than roam hither and yon in search of new victims — a dangerous undertaking even for the most ruthless of bandits. He takes a proprietary interest in his victims’ property, which he begins to protect from rival bandits. The spoils of pillage become tribute, feudal duties, and, ultimately, taxation. Advertisement
But reality is not much like “Whig history,” in which mankind and its polities move inevitably and invariably in the direction of progress and prosperity. Nations move backward and forward: Part of the shock and horror of the Holocaust is the result of the fact that it was undertaken not by a tribe of illiterate cannibals but by what had been Europe’s most culturally advanced nation. Venezuela has not always been what it is today. Neither has the United States. Advertisement Advertisement
The first part of The Walking Dead ’s broad political arc has to do with the attempts of former sheriff Rick Grimes, a partisan of the law in a totemic lawman’s hat, to establish something like the rule of law in the post-apocalyptic chaos. He tries a bit of democracy and finds that wanting, but he continues to work toward a settlement based on rules and procedure rather than ad hoc savagery. And he fails . Much of the plot is the story of Grimes devolving into just another wasteland warlord, albeit one with some conscience and sense of decency. As the survivors begin to coalesce into semi-permanent settlements, they deputize one of their members to draw up a constitution — but a series of crises turns her into one of the coldest warlords of all. She is not a bad person, but the opposite: loving, loyal, fair-minded, deeply humane. She becomes a kind of left-handed military dictator not because of her vices but because of her virtues. She ends up being a kind of mirror image of the nefarious Negan , another warlord who sought not violence and domination for its own sake but order and security.
Many of the characters from The Walking Dead would quickly understand the facts on the ground in Westeros, the troubled kingdom(s) in which Game of Thrones ’s titular contest takes place. Game of Thrones is, at its core, a Shakespearean succession drama: Something is out of place in the state, and the gears of the social machine must grind until a new stable settlement is reached. ( Game of Thrones ’s opening sequence, which presents Westeros as a series of complex machines, is well-conceived.) To Shakespeare’s political sensibility it adds a Dickensian scope, considering the life of the kingdom from many different vantage points: kings and courtiers, yes, but also slaves and prostitutes, religious leaders, children, common people, and literal outsiders, the “wildlings” who live beyond the wall that demarks the northern limits of civilization. Advertisement
The unhappy reality at the center of the political economy of Game of Thrones is one of particular interest in the Western world just now: that, as the proverb has it, great men seldom are good men, that the characteristics that make one an effective leader — a leader who is genuinely of use to his people — often are the characteristics that make one a god-awful human being. And the converse: that many of the virtues of good men make them poor leaders in difficult times. Jon Snow, who recently (and at the most inconvenient of times) has learned that he is presumably the legal heir to the Iron Throne, is a decent, fair-minded, liberal man — and an almost completely incompetent leader of men. His first real command (of the border patrol, essentially) ends with him being murdered by mutineers. (He is resurrected.) In trying to unite the kingdoms against the same threat that Sheriff Grimes et al. faced – zombies — he ends up getting romantically involved with the conquering Daenerys Targaryen, who believes herself to be entitled to sit on the throne. (She is also his aunt, but he did not know that when he first went to bed with her.) That romantic entanglement leads enemies and allies both to question his motives and calculations — and not without good reason. Advertisement Advertisement
Daenerys, on the other hand, is a power-mad megalomaniac — and, so far, a much more effective leader. She may be traveling the world freeing slaves, handing down rough justice, and building multinational coalitions for her own selfish reasons, but she understands her own reasons. She knows what she wants, and that she has to give the people she rules what they need if she is to achieve her own ambitions. This is not a matter of mere calculation: Like most successful megalomaniacs, she sincerely believes that her own destiny is fundamentally identified with the good of the people she rules and those she means to rule. She can be transactional when necessary, and will take good advice when she recognizes it, but she is a true believer, too: in herself. Advertisement
The Walking Dead offers its survivors a couple of clear choices: They can have peace, trade, security, material prosperity, the rule of law, and cooperation, or they can have slaughter and brigandage. The choice would be obvious to almost everyone — if not for the presence of the external threat and the trauma of social collapse. Game of Thrones offers a less clear choice, but does make an implicit case for things like federalism and the separation of powers, inasmuch as most of the Seven Kingdoms’ domestic troubles come from the fact that whoever sits on the Iron Throne expects not only to reign but to rule, and that the very different peoples of the kingdoms are, corporately, ungovernable — not even by terror, as the assassination of the Mad King makes clear. Again, it is possible to imagine how a modus vivendi might have evolved, if not for the external threat of the White Walkers and the privations of the long winter.
That these stories should resonate so strongly in our own political moment is a little strange. Unlike, say, at the height of the Cold War, there is no existential foreign threat to the United States and our way of life. Unlike, say, 1968 or 1861, there isn’t very much in the way of political violence at home, either. These are reasonably peaceful and prosperous times. Advertisement
But our mood is not the mood of peaceful and prosperous times. That is, I think, the result of a series of earlier crises, minor and major, that were stacked on top of one another in a particularly destructive way: the convulsion of the 2000 presidential election, in which many Democrats believed (with varying degrees of good faith) that they were robbed by the Supreme Court; the events of September 11, 2001, shortly thereafter; the sense of paranoia and crisis on both sides of the political aisle that followed; the confusion about the Iraq War and its casus belli ; the 2008–09 financial crisis; that extraconstitutional abuses of the Obama administration and the criminal misdeeds of the IRS and other agencies during those years; the emergence of procedural maximalism as a congressional political norm. Even with the Soviet menace, Vietnam, stagflation, etc., the majority of Americans spent most of the postwar era feeling relatively safe and secure in a way that no longer really holds. There is a sense that our constitutional order has fallen into disorder, that the system — as figures as different as Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren insist — is rigged."
Jeff Sessions: Mueller Report Results Should be Accepted | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/jeff-sessions-urges-congress-to-accept-the-results-of-mueller-report-and-move-on/,"April 25, 2019 8:40 AM Former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses a news conference in Washington, D.C., October 26, 2018. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS)
Former attorney general Sessions urged Congress, and the country at large, to “accept the results” of special counsel Robert Mueller’s recently-released report and move on to other matters of governance during a speech at Amherst College on Wednesday. “I think it’s about time to accept the results, and let’s get on with the business of America,” Sessions said during a speech to the college Republicans, according to the New York Times.
While Mueller failed to prove the underlying crime of coordination with the Kremllin, he did detail a number of instances in which Trump tried to curtail or otherwise affect the probe. Sessions cautioned Congress against pursuing their current agenda of further investigating whether the behavior attributed to President Trump in the Mueller report constitutes obstruction of justice. “The process was followed and a decision has now been rendered,” he said, adding that he had “the greatest confidence in the integrity of our system.”
Sessions recused himself from the Mueller probe after it was revealed that he failed to report his meeting with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, a decision that soured his relationship with President Trump, who repeatedly castigated him in public and private for failing to “protect” him from the investigation."
Trump Trade Deal with Mexico & Canada: What Congress Should Insist On | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mattie Duppler,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/trump-trade-deal-mexico-canada/,"About Mattie Duppler April 25, 2019 6:30 AM President Trump with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto (left) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the USMCA signing ceremony in Buenos Aires, Argentina November 30, 2018. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Consumers and businesses alike want the threshold for taxes and duties on imports to be high, not low.
W ith a divided government and another presidential-election cycle already in full swing, it’s tempting to think that any priorities of the Trump administration are dead on arrival in Congress. However, do-nothing gridlock is not inevitable: The renegotiated NAFTA deal (the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement, or USMCA) offers an opportunity for progress on important trade policies even in a heated and divided political environment. Advertisement Advertisement
The White House has launched a legislative-affairs offensive to get House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and recalcitrant Democrats on board with the agreement. This has raised the suspicions of some Republicans, who are concerned that Democrats will be granted too much latitude in negotiations and that the agreement will be soiled by left-leaning priorities. There are several reasons that Republicans should worry less about Democrats’ public posturing on the trade deal and instead focus their efforts on preserving consequential trade policies that could be affected by the agreement.
First, it is important to remember that the USMCA negotiations are closely governed by the mechanisms set up by Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA. Passed by a Republican-held Congress and signed into law by President Obama in 2015, TPA requires Congress to pass “implementing” legislation for any trade agreement to take effect. This bill may include only language that is “strictly necessary and appropriate” to conform U.S. laws to the agreement. This effectively limits what can be added to the agreement by Congress.
This is perhaps why some Democrats have called for reopening negotiations with Canada and Mexico, acknowledging they will be unable to write far-reaching changes into implementing legislation. The Trump administration has already said that is a non-starter, and, because a new administration has taken the reins in Mexico since the deal was inked, the Democrats’ demands would likely be unacceptable to the other partners to the treaty.

TPA also requires the administration to submit to Congress a list of changes that are required to bring U.S. law into accordance with the trade agreement. Unfortunately, changes to tax-free and duty-free treatment of imports under the “de minimis” threshold were included on list the Trump administration sent earlier this year. The de minimis level is the dollar threshold for imports at which duties, taxes, and other import barriers are enacted. Congress in 2016 agreed to raise this threshold from $200 to $800, acknowledging that the reduction of import restrictions on lower-value goods benefits American consumers and businesses. In fact, this position was so widely accepted, the 2016 bill to increase the de minimis threshold passed easily, with overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate. Advertisement
While an outright reduction of the threshold would likely be prevented by the restrictions imposed by TPA, it is important that Congress protect the current standard in any implementing legislation to USMCA. Advertisement"
"FBI Raids Baltimore MayorCatherine Pugh 's City Hall Offices, Home Amid Corruption Probe | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/fbi-raids-baltimore-mayors-city-hall-offices-home-amid-corruption-probe/,"April 25, 2019 9:02 AM Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh (Wikimedia)
FBI and IRS agents on Thursday raided the home and city hall offices of Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh as part of an investigation into possible public corruption, the Baltimore Sun reported.
Pugh took a leave of absence from her position earlier this month after it was revealed that she made $500,000 selling copies of her Healthy Holly children’s-health book to the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) while sitting on the system’s board.
It was later revealed that health insurance provider Kaiser Permanente paid Pugh $100,000 for 20,000 copies of the book while the company was seeking a lucrative contract to insure the city’s employees.
In total, Pugh made $800,000 selling copies of her book to local entities since 2011, according to the Sun .
Agents also raided the Maryland Center for Adult Education, a local non-profit that Pugh used to run, as well as her attorney’s offices.
Maryland governor Larry Hogan responded to the news of the raids by calling on Pugh to resign in a Thursday morning statement. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“On April 1, I directed the state prosecutor to investigate the disturbing allegations surrounding Mayor Catherine Pugh’s questionable financial dealings with the University of Maryland Medical System…Now more than ever, Baltimore City needs strong and responsible leadership,” the statement read. “Mayor Pugh has lost the public trust. She is clearly not fit to lead. For the good of the city, Mayor Pugh must resign.”
Pugh apologized in March for having “done something to upset the people” and returned $100,000 to the UMMS. She has maintained, however, that she did not exploit her position for personal financial gain."

National Debt: Republican Politicians Borrow from the Future | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/national-debt-federal-budget-republicans/,"April 25, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) Under a Republican president and, until four months ago, Republican control of both houses of Congress, the nation is about to run trillion-dollar budget deficits.
Washington — Pursed lips and clucked tongues signaled disapproval among the wise and responsible when, at a recent televised event, Senator Bernie Sanders, the “democratic socialist” from Vermont, did not plausibly explain how he would pay for Medicare for All. The remarkable thing, however, is the quaint expectation that any political person should explain how he or she would align proposed expenditures and actual revenues. For decades, the implicit answer has always been the same: They won’t even pretend to align them. Advertisement Advertisement
Under a Republican president and, until four months ago, Republican control of both houses of Congress, the nation is about to run trillion-dollar budget deficits with the economy expanding and employment more than full: The unemployment rate is 3.8 percent and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 7.1 million jobs unfilled. As the birth rate declines, the population ages (approximately 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day) and the country is told to be alarmed because too many would-be immigrants are trying to enter the country and its workforce.
Yet Sanders is supposed to hew to some archaic standards of fiscal probity? Why should an avowed socialist be held to standards of fiscal candor and prudence that have no discernible adherents in the avowedly conservative party? Advertisement
Congressional Republicans are led on a short leash by a president who, as a candidate, vowed to not touch entitlement programs that are significant drivers of the deficit, and who breezily promised to eliminate the national debt (currently $22 trillion) in eight years. (Today, that would mean eight reductions of $2.75 trillion, a sum equal to 63 percent of the fiscal 2019 budget.) Republicans, now thoroughly disarmed concerning the issue of fiscal probity, struggle to frighten the 2020 electorate with the specter of spendthrift socialists threatening the Republic.
The Manhattan Institute’s Brian Riedl notes that this year, as the national debt, which was $10 trillion in 2008, heads toward $38 trillion in 2029, the federal government will spend $35,148 per household and collect $26,677 per household in taxes. Householders are understandably content with this arithmetic.
For guidance on how to think about what the political class does not think about (and wishes you would not think about), read “Welfare and Debt: A Moynihanian Assessment” by Chris DeMuth of the Hudson Institute. In 1986, when the national debt was a mere stripling, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.) delivered an address titled “The Moral Dimensions of a Two Trillion Dollar Debt,” in which he pondered the virtue, for nations as well as individuals, of self-denial — forgoing present pleasures for future benefits. Even 33 years ago he saw that our public debt is morally “problematic”:
The people who do the borrowing, which is to say elected officials, are not the ones who will do the repaying. The temptation is real to use debt not as a form of investment, but a means of consumption. Far from the denial of gratification, it can, and frequently does, reflect just the opposite.
DeMuth says that in 1986 Moynihan was “stunningly perspicacious” about “one big thing,” which DeMuth calls “a transformation of the political economy of federal government.” From the Founding until the fourth quarter of the 20th century, the political economy — the government’s taxing and spending — had been used primarily to provide “public goods” such as defense, diplomacy, courts, infrastructure, schools, basic research. Suddenly, however, the political economy became “primarily a provider of private consumption by individuals.” Yes, primarily. DeMuth:
In 1960, public goods had accounted for about 75% of federal outlays net of interest payments on the debt, while ‘payments for individuals’ were the other 25%. By 1970, payments for individuals had grown to 35%. In 1986 when Pat spoke, payments for individuals had become dominant at 55%. Today they are 75% and still growing; public goods are now the residual 25% of our national government and shrinking.
What DeMuth calls the new “borrowed-benefits” budget norm is financed to a significant extent by borrowing from nonconsenting future generations. The benefits are current consumption “and are not going to generate returns to pay off the borrowed funds.” This, says DeMuth, is just one facet of “our comprehensive rejection of constraint — not only in public finance but in politics, in constitutional structure, in rhetoric, and in culture.”"
"Relativism, Nihilism Threaten 21st Century West | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Michael Novak,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/awakening-from-nihilism/,"April 25, 2019 6:30 AM Michael Novak In Preparation for the 21st Century, Four Lessons from the 20th
Editor’s Note: This essay is adapted from a speech given by Michael Novak at Westminster Abbey upon receiving the Templeton Prize in 1994. It is reprinted with permission of the Novak family.
A s we draw near the close of the 20th century, we owe ourselves a reckoning. This century was history’s bloodiest. At a time they didn’t choose, and in a way they didn’t foresee, more than a hundred million persons in Europe found their lives brutally taken from them. Beyond the war dead, 66 million prisoners perished in the Soviet labor camps. Add the scores of millions dead in Asia, Africa, and the other continents since 1900. Nor is there any guarantee that the 21st century will not be bloodier. Advertisement Advertisement
And yet the world has drawn four painful lessons from the ashes of our century. First, even under conditions of nihilism, better than cowardice is fidelity to truth. From fidelity to truth, inner liberty is wrested.
Second, the boast of Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler that dictatorship is more vigorous than “decadent democracy” was empty. It led to concentration camps.
Third, the claim that socialism is morally superior to capitalism, and better for the poor, was also empty. It paved the road to serfdom. Advertisement
Fourth, vulgar relativism so undermines the culture of liberty that free institutions may not survive the 21st century. Advertisement
The First Lesson: Truth Matters
For three centuries, modernity has been supremely fruitful in its practical discoveries — in its magnificent institutions of political and economic liberty, for example. But it has been spectacularly wrong in its underlying philosophy of life. An age that is wrong about God is almost certain to be wrong about man.
History, Hegel once remarked, is a butcher’s bench. Homo homini lupus. “Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Many sober inquirers, who saw how prodigally in this century the bodies of individuals have been thrown around like sacks of bones, understandably asserted that God is dead. Since this foul century began, how many terrorized children have spent long nights, uncomprehendingly, in tears?
And yet, in this night of a century, a first fundamental lesson was drawn from the bowels of nihilism itself: Truth matters. Even for those unsure whether there is a God, truth is different from a lie. Torturers can twist your mind, even reduce you to a vegetable, but as long as you retain the ability to say “yes” or “no” as truth alone commands, they cannot own you. Advertisement
Further, as the prison literature of the 20th century (a very large literature, alas) testifies abundantly, truth is not simply a pragmatic compromise, although torturers present it so. “It is such a little thing,” they say. “All you have to do is say ‘yes,’ sign here, and this will all be over. Then you can forget about it. What harm will come of it? We have been in power for seventy years. We will always be in power. It is such a little thing, like swatting a fly. Who will ever know?” Advertisement
Yet millions have known in such circumstances that their identity as free women and free men was at stake; more exactly, their salvation. Irina Ratushinskaya, Raoul Wallenberg, Andrei Sakharov, Maximilian Kolbe, Vladimir Bukovsky, Vaclav Havel, Anatole Scharansky, Pavel Bratinka, Tomas Halik, Mikhailo Mikhailov, Armando Valladares — let us summon up the witnesses, the endless scroll of honor of our century.
To obey truth is to be free, and in extreme circumstances nothing is more clear to the tormented mind, nothing more vital to the survival of self-respect, nothing so important to one’s sense of remaining a worthy human being — of being no one’s cog, part of no one’s machine, and resister to death against the kingdom of lies — nothing is so dear as to hold to truth. In fidelity to truth lies human dignity. Advertisement
There is nothing recondite in this. Simple people have often seen it more clearly than have clerks. This is the plain insight that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn expressed when he wrote in his Nobel address (1970) that one single truth is more powerful than all the weapons in the world; that, dark as that hour then seemed in the world, with Communism everywhere advancing, truth would prevail against the lie; and that those who clung to truth would overturn tyranny. He was correct in his predictions. Truth did prevail over arms — we are witnesses to history; it is our obligation to teach this to our children.
What those learned who suffered in prison in our time — what Dostoevsky learned in prison in the Tsar’s time — is that we human beings do not own the truth. Truth is not “merely subjective,” not something we make up, or choose, or cut to today’s fashions or the morrow’s pragmatism — we obey the truth. We do not “have” the truth. Truth owns us. Truth is far larger and deeper than we are. Truth leads us where it will. It is not ours for mastering. Advertisement Advertisement
And yet, even in prison, truth is a master before whom a free man stands erect. In obeying the evidence of truth, no human being is humiliated — rather, in that way alone ennobled. In obeying truth, the way of liberty is marked out “as a lamp unto our feet.” In obeying truth, a man becomes aware of his participation in something greater than himself.
Truth is the light of God within us. For us its humble mode is inquiry, seeking, restlessness. Innermost at the core of us, even as children, is an irrepressible drive to ask questions. That unlimited drive is God’s dynamic presence in us, the seed of our dissatisfaction with everything less than infinite. Advertisement
The grand refusal of the modern age to say “yes” to God is a failure both of intellect and of imagination. Modernity’s mistake is to have imagined God as if He were different from truth, alien to ourselves, “out there” like a ghostly object far in space, to serve Whom is to lose our own autonomy. Modernity has imagined God to be a ghostly version of the tyrants we have actually seen in the 20th century.
It took the real tyrants of our time, jackbooted, oily-haired, self-confident, enjoying the torture of innocents, to shatter that false identity. The tyrants may have thought they were like God; it was idiotic to flatter them that God was like them.
In the 20th century, prisons and torture chambers have been better places to encounter God than universities. Many who resisted the tyrants of our era turned nihilism inside out. In the nothingness they found inner light. Many came to call the light they found “God.” The relation some gradually assumed toward this inner light, whose Source, they knew, was not themselves, was that of wordless conversation or communion. They addressed their God in conversation, under the name of Truth.
Two Great Practical Lessons
Until recently, modernity was mistaken in its relation to truth, and thus to God and humankind. But even so modernity has, to its great credit, by grant of Providence, made three great institutional discoveries. Modern thinkers first worked out, as neither the ancients nor the medievals did, the practical principles of the free society: free in its polity, free in its economy, and free in the realm of conscience and inquiry. The great modern achievements in these matters have been supremely practical: how to make free institutions work at least tolerably well, and better in most ways than earlier regimes.
However, despite these happy practical gains, modernity tore down the only philosophical foundations which can sustain the free society. The Enlightenment was supposed to do away with sectarian bickering, but it did not. If you stay within your own school of thought, the foundations of the free society may seem secure. Peek outside, however, and you will hear raucous voices shouting. The age of Enlightenment has failed to secure an intelligent mode of public moral argument that gets beyond the language of the playpen.
Lest we forget: The 20th century was not only the bloodiest, but also the most ideological century. Ideology is the atheist’s substitute for faith; lacking faith, our age did not want for warring ideologies. For nine decades of this century, armies not exactly ignorant clashed by night. Beneath the fearful din, two great practical principles of the free society were mortally contested: first, the political principle; second, the economic principle.
Despite the books and songs of the 1930s — “The End of an Era,” “The Lights are Going Out All Over the World,” “The Decline of the West” — and despite the boast of dictators that “In three weeks England will have her neck wrung like a chicken” — decadent democracies proved they had the will, the audacity, and the stamina to defeat the principle of dictatorship. They defeated it so decisively that today hardly a dictator anywhere in the world, although many (alas) remain, dares to argue that dictatorship is an ideal form of government. Most are left to argue limply that, in the particular case of their own countries, dictatorship is expedient. They lie.
For poor people, the principles of democracy (the rule of law, limited government, checks and balances) are better than dictatorship. Only thus can people enjoy the zone of civil liberty necessary to ensure their dignity and self-command. Political democracy is the world’s first great practical lesson of our time, learned at fearful cost. Advertisement
The second great practical lesson of our century is the futility of socialism as an economic principle. For 150 years, the intellectual battle over fundamental economic principles was conducted asymmetrically. Hundreds of books detailed the wonders of socialism as an ideology, passionately dissected the flaws of capitalist practice, and boastfully mapped out the coming transition from capitalism to socialism. Not one single book existed — when the time finally came — to map out the necessary transition from socialism to capitalism. I doubt whether ever in history so many intellectuals were wrong on a matter to which they themselves assigned highest moment, while considering themselves “scientific.” The story of how this happened must one day be recounted.
As Pope John Paul II recently pointed out in Centesimus Annus, this story is connected to the intellectuals’ devaluation of the human person. No system that devalues the initiative and creativity of every woman and every man, made in the image of their Creator, is fit for human habitation. On the first day that the flag of Russia snapped against the blue sky over the city hall of St. Petersburg, where for seven decades the red flag had flown, a Russian artist told me: “The next time you want to try an experiment like socialism, try it out on animals first — men it hurts too much.”
Indeed, once the Iron Curtain was joyfully torn down, and the great lie thoroughly unmasked, it became clear that in the heartland of “real existing socialism” the poor were living in third-world conditions; that a large majority of the population was in misery; that both the will to work and economic creativity had been suffocated in the crib; that economic intelligence had been blinded by the absurd necessity to set arbitrarily the prices of some 22 million commodities and services; that the omnivorous State had almost wholly swallowed civil society; that the society of “comrades” had in fact driven millions of individuals into thoroughly privatized, untrusting, and alienated inner isolation; that this culture of the lie had been hated by scores of millions; and that the soils of vast stretches of the land and the waters of rivers and lakes had been despoiled.
Three great lessons have been learned from our century, then, even if the cost of learning them was fearful beyond measure. First, truth matters. Second, for all its manifest faults, even absurdities, democracy is better for the protection of individuals and minorities than dictatorship. Third, for all its deficiencies, even gaping inadequacies, capitalism is better for the poor than either of its two great rivals, socialism and the third-world traditional state. Just watch in which direction the poor of the world invariably migrate. The poor — among whom my family in living memory could be counted — know better than the intellectuals. They seek opportunity and liberty. They seek systems that allow them to be economically creative, as God made them to be.
From these three lessons, one might derive reasons for hope: Quite possibly — if along that great plain that runs like an arrow eastward from Germany through Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Russian steppes, the new experiments in democracy and capitalism succeed — the 21st century could be the most prosperous and free in the history of the world.
Perhaps China, too, if it becomes a democracy under the rule of law as it is already becoming capitalist, will bring to its more than 1 billion citizens unprecedented liberty. Throughout Latin America, there is a chance that the fertile soil of liberty will yield new fruits of education, creative energy, and prosperity for all.
The 21st century could be the single most creative century in history, bringing virtually all the peoples of the world under the cool and healthful shade of liberty. It could be lovely.
Far likelier, alas, is the prospect that the 21st century will be like the 20th: tormented, sanguinary, barbarous. For there is still a fourth lesson.

The Ecology of Liberty
During the 20th century, the free society was fighting for its life. The urgent need to secure the free polity and the free economy blinded most to the cultural peril into which liberty has rapidly been falling.
Many sophisticated people love to say that they are cynical, that ours is a cynical age. They flatter themselves. They do not believe nothing; they believe anything. Ours is not an age of unbelief, but of arrogant gullibility. Think how many actually believed the romance of fascism. Think how many plighted their troth to socialism. Think how many, now today, believe in global warming; think how many believe in a coming Ice Age — and think how many believe in both! One thing our intellectual betters never lack is passionate belief.
One principle that many ardent souls of our time most passionately disseminate, for example, is vulgar relativism, “nihilism with a happy face.” For them, it is certain that there is no truth, only opinion: my opinion, your opinion. They abandon the defense of intellect and retreat to the romance of will. There being no purchase of intellect upon reality, nothing else is left but preference, and will becomes everything.
But this is to give to Mussolini and Hitler posthumously, and casually, what they could not vindicate by the most willful force of arms. It is to miss the first great lesson rescued from the ashes of World War II: Those who surrender the domain of intellect make straight the road of fascism. Totalitarianism, as Mussolini defined it, is la feroce volontá. It is the will-to-power, unchecked by any regard for truth. To surrender the claims of truth upon humans is to surrender the earth to thugs. It is to make a mockery of those who endured agonies for truth at the hands of torturers.
This most perilous threat to the free society is neither political nor economic. It is the poisonous, corrupting culture of relativism. Vulgar relativism is an invisible gas, odorless, deadly, that is now polluting every free society on earth. It is a gas that attacks the central nervous system of moral striving. The people know this, while the intellectuals do not. If our intellectual betters knew this, they would be sounding the alarm.
Freedom cannot grow — it cannot even survive — in every atmosphere or clime. In the wearying journey of human history, free societies have been astonishingly rare. The ecology of liberty is more fragile than the biosphere of Earth. Freedom needs clean and healthful habits, sound families, common decencies, and the unafraid respect of one human for another. Freedom needs entire rain forests of little acts of virtue, tangled loyalties, fierce loves, undying commitments. Freedom needs particular institutions and these, in turn, need peoples of particular habits of the heart.
There are two types of liberty: one pre-critical, emotive, whimsical, proper to children; the other critical, sober, deliberate, responsible, and proper to adults. Alexis de Tocqueville called attention to this difference early in Democracy in America, and at Cambridge Lord Acton put it this way: Liberty is not the freedom to do what you wish; it is the freedom to do what you ought. Human beings are the only creatures on earth that do not blindly obey the laws of their nature, by instinct, but are free to choose to obey them with a loving will. Only humans enjoy the liberty to do what we ought to do — or, alas, not to do it.
It is this second kind of liberty — critical, adult liberty — that lies at the living core of the free society. It is the liberty of self-command, a tolerable mastery over one’s own passions, bigotry, ignorance, and self-deceit. It is the liberty of self-government in one’s own personal life. For how, James Madison once asked, can a people incapable of self-government in private life prove capable of it in public? If they cannot practice self-government over their private passions, how will they practice it over the institutions of the republic?
Can there be a free society among citizens who habitually lie, who malinger, who constantly cheat, who do not meet their responsibilities, who cannot be counted on, who shirk difficulties, who flout the law — or who prefer to live as serfs or slaves, content in their dependency, so long as they are fed and entertained?
Freedom requires the exercise of conscience; it requires the practice of those virtues that, as Winston Churchill noted in his wartime speeches to the House of Commons, have long been practiced in the British Isles: dutiful stout arms, ready hearts, courage, courtesy, ingenuity, respect for individual choice, a patient regard for hearing evidence on both sides of the story. Advertisement
During the past 100 years, the question for those who loved liberty was whether, relying on the virtues of our peoples, we could survive the most powerful assaults from without. During the next 100 years, the question for those who love liberty will be whether we can survive the most insidious and duplicitous attacks from within, from those who undermine the virtues of our people, doing in advance the work of the Father of Lies. “There is no such thing as truth,” they teach even the little ones. “Truth is bondage. Believe what seems right to you. There are as many truths as there are individuals. Get in touch with yourself. Do what feels comfortable.”
This is how they speak, those who prepare the jails of the 21st century. Those who undermine the idea of truth do the work of tyrants.
No doubt, you have heard objection to this warning. It goes like this: “To accept the idea of moral truth is to accept authoritarian control.” Pity those who say this! Between moral relativism and political control, there is a third alternative, well known to the common sense of the English-speaking peoples. It is called self-control. We do not want a government that coerces the free consciences of individuals; on the contrary, we want self-governing individuals to restrain immoral government. We want self -government, self -command, self- control.
If a people composed of 100 million citizens is guarded by 100 million inner policemen — that is, by 100 million self-governing consciences — then the number of policemen on its streets may be few. For a society without inner policemen, on the contrary, there aren’t enough policemen in the world to make society civil. Self-control is not authoritarianism; it is the alternative to it.
What Must We Do?
“The Revolution,” Charles Peguy once wrote, “is moral; or not at all.” This is also the law for the free society. It will deepen its moral culture — or it will die. As human lungs need air, so does liberty need virtue. As does this blue-green planet Earth, so has liberty its own ecology. The deepest and most vital struggles of the 21st century will be cultural arguments over the sorts of habits necessary to the preservation of liberty. What are the habits we must teach our young? Which are the habits we must encourage in ourselves, and which discourage? To allow liberty to survive — and, more than that, to make it worth all the blood and tears expended to achieve it –how do we need to live?
With the ample wealth produced by a free economy, with private liberties bestowed abundantly by free polities, are we not now ashamed of the culture we have wrought, of its shocking crimes, its loss of virtue, its loss of courtesy, the decline of common decency?
Can all the sufferings of our ancestors on behalf of liberty have been endured for this — that we might be as we now are? Nihilism builds no cities. Great cultures are built by vaulting aspiration — by the eros of truth and love and justice and realism.
We must learn again how to teach the virtues of the noble Greeks and Romans; the commandments God entrusted to the Hebrews; the virtues that Jesus introduced into the world — even into secular consciences — such as gentleness, kindness, compassion, and the equality of all in our Father’s love. We must celebrate again the heroes, great and humble, who have for centuries exemplified the virtues proper to our individual peoples. We must learn again how to speak of virtue, character, and nobility of soul.
Liberty itself requires unprecedented virtues, rarely seen in simpler and more simply led societies. Special virtues are needed by self-governing peoples: calm, deliberate, dispassionate reflection ; careful, responsible, consequence-accepting choice. In self-government, citizens are sovereigns, and must learn to exercise the virtues of sovereigns.
The free economy, too, demands more virtues than the socialist or third-world traditional economies: It demands active persons, self-starters, women and men of enterprise and risk. It requires the willingness to sacrifice present pleasures for rewards that will be enjoyed primarily by future generations. It requires vision, discovery, invention. Its dynamism is human creativity endowed in us by our Creator, Who made us in His image. Advertisement
And so, too, the pluralist society calls for higher levels of civility, tolerance, and reasoned public argument than citizens in simpler times ever needed."
Mueller Investigation: Pious Hypocrisy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Victor Davis Hanson,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-investigation-pious-hypocrisy/,"April 25, 2019 6:30 AM Robert Mueller on Capitol Hill in 2013. (Larry Downing/Reuters) Mueller’s team went down every blind alley relating to its investigation -- except where Obama-era officials were likely culpable for relevant unethical or illegal behavior.
S pecial counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year, $30 million, 448-page report did not find collusion between Donald Trump and Russia.
Despite compiling private allegations of loud and obnoxious Trump behavior, Mueller also concluded that there was not any actionable case of obstruction of justice by the president. It would have been hard in any case to find that Trump obstructed Mueller’s investigation of an alleged crime. Advertisement Advertisement
One, there was never a crime of collusion. Mueller early on in his endeavors must have realized that truth, but he pressed ahead anyway. It is almost impossible to prove obstruction of nothing.
Two, Trump cooperated with the investigation. He waived executive privilege. He turned over more than 1 million pages of administrative documents. He allowed then–White House counsel Don McGahn to submit to over 30 hours of questioning by Mueller’s lawyers.
Three, anyone targeted by a massive investigation who knows he is innocent of an alleged crime is bound to become frustrated over a seemingly never-ending inquisition. Advertisement
Trump’s reported periodic rages at the Mueller investigation are regrettable but not unnatural, given that Mueller expended a huge amount of government resources to confirm what many knew at the outset: that there was never any collusion with the Russian government to warp the 2016 election.
Yet Mueller’s team went down every blind alley relating to its investigation — except where Obama-era officials were likely culpable for relevant unethical or illegal behavior. Advertisement
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants were integral to Mueller’s investigations. But there is no mention of how the FISA court was deceived by not being told that the chief evidence used to obtain the warrants was an unverified dossier paid for in part by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
Some of the collusion narrative Mueller examined was based on FBI informants’ unverified stories. Yet strangely, the Mueller team did not investigate whether it was legal in the first place for the FBI, possibly with CIA help, to use informants to spy on a presidential campaign. Advertisement
Former FBI director James Comey figures into the Mueller report. But there is no curiosity about whether he broke the law in leaking what may well have been four classified memos of private presidential conversations to the press for the purpose of forcing an appointment of a special counsel.
The Christopher Steele dossier likewise makes an appearance in the Mueller report. But for a team investigating the alleged collusion of foreigners in a U.S. election, there is silence about the salient fact that Steele, a foreign national, enlisted other foreign nationals to dig up dirt on Trump to weaken his election chances — with part of the funding for this research provided by the Clinton campaign and the DNC.

What bothers many Americans about the collusion hoax is the accompanying sanctimony of the so-called investigators. The Mueller team could have helped itself had it just noted that much of the evidence it looked at was a product of Obama-era officials’ unethical or illegal behavior.
Comey wrote a memoir, A Higher Loyalty . Its eponymous themes are Comey’s own ethics and principles. But Comey may well have misled the FISA court and possibly lied under oath to a House committee. He was not candid with federal investigators and leaked confidential and classified government memos.
Former FBI director Andrew McCabe also wrote a memoir, The Threat . Its argument is that FBI kingpins such as McCabe protect America from dangers such as Donald Trump. But McCabe himself is under criminal referral for lying to federal investigators. His sworn congressional testimony cannot be reconciled with Comey’s. McCabe also likely misled the FISA court. And he apparently contemplated staging a near-coup to remove an elected president through the deliberate misuse of the 25th Amendment. Advertisement
Former CIA director John Brennan is a paid analyst for MSNBC who often railed about Trump’s “treason” and predicted his indictment. Yet Brennan himself has lied under oath to Congress on two occasions. He likely misled Congress about his role in trafficking in the Steele dossiers. And Brennan’s CIA may well have helped the FBI use informants abroad to entrap Trump campaign aides in efforts to find dirt on Trump.
Former director of National Intelligence James Clapper is a CNN analyst who often predicted that a supposedly treasonous Trump would be indicted. Clapper, too, has lied to Congress under oath. He once denied and then admitted to leaking confidential documents.
The problem with the Mueller investigation, and with former intelligence officials such as Brennan, Clapper, Comey, and McCabe, is pious hypocrisy. Those who have lectured America on Trump’s unproven crimes have written books and appeared on TV to publicize their own superior virtue. Yet they themselves have engaged in all sorts of unethical and illegal behavior. Advertisement"
California's State of the Air Report: Regulation Has Limits | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/californias-skies-and-the-limits-of-regulation/,"April 25, 2019 10:13 AM Century City and downtown Los Angeles, Calif. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)
The American Lung Association’s annual “ State of the Air ” report offers a valuable lesson about the limits of regulation to solve problems.
California has the toughest air-quality regulations of any state in the country. In 1967, the state passed sweeping new regulations in response to Los Angeles’ smog, and under the Clean Air Act, the state was allowed to keep it stricter standards. All of its recent governors considered themselves environmentalists, and no doubt the state’s legislators consider themselves to be defenders of clean air. California New Car Dealers Association says 4.7 percent of the cars sold in the state in the past year are now all-electric and plug-in hybrids are another 3.1 percent. Advertisement Advertisement
Yet the State of the Air report finds that by every measure — ozone, year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution — California cities are at the top of the list and often dominate the top ten. Los Angeles, Visalia, Bakersfield, Fresno, Sacramento, and San Diego are the top six for worst in ozone; Fresno and Bakersfield rank one and two for worst in year-round particle pollution and three California cities in the top six; and the same two are the two worst in short-term particle pollution, with four California cities in the top seven.
This is not some sort of Trump administration-driven change; the report covers air quality from 2015 to 2017. Advertisement
If California has such strict regulation, why is the air quality so bad? Blame it on geography and population density — two factors that are exceptionally difficult to change. The American Lung Association has done 20 State of the Air reports and Los Angeles ranked as the worst in 19 of those years. California’s cities have a lot of people, a lot of cars and traffic, and a lot of sunny days. When you live in a valley surrounded by high mountains, the smog doesn’t disperse easily. And there are other factors that are not easily mitigated through regulations: “Twenty of the 26 most polluted cities had more days on average in the 2019 report. Many of these are due to wildfires.” Advertisement"

It’s usually the Social Justice Warrior students who hound professors for saying politically incorrect things, but sometimes faculty colleagues play that role. In today’s Martin Center article , I write about a really nasty case at the University of Louisville where that occurred.
Dr. Allan Josephson has been in medical practice since 1976 and after two other university medical-school appointments, he was tabbed in 2003 to become chief of Louisville Medical School’s Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology. He performed exceptionally well in that role. Advertisement Advertisement
But Dr. Josephson is not in agreement with the current “ progressive ” thinking about dealing with gender dysphoria and said so on a panel at a Heritage Foundation event in 2017. For his deviationism, the medical school came down on him like a ton of bricks. He was demoted, his budget slashed, and he was assigned as much work as a junior faculty member. His efforts at calming the waters were unavailing. For saying wrong things about gender dysphoria, he’d become persona non grata."

As he threw his hat into the ring for the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday, former vice president Joe Biden was asked whether President Barack Obama, his former running mate, would endorse his candidacy.
“I asked President Obama not to endorse and he doesn’t want to,” Biden explained to reporters in Delaware. “Whoever wins this nomination should win this on their own merits.”
Nevertheless, Obama issued a glowing statement in the wake of Biden’s campaign launch.
“President Obama has long said that selecting Joe Biden as his running mate in 2008 was one of the best decisions he ever made,” said Obama spokeswoman Katie Hill. “He relied on the vice president’s knowledge, insight, and judgment throughout both campaigns and the entire presidency. The two forged a special bond over the last ten years and remain close today.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

Of course, the former vice president has a much less cozy relationship with President Trump, whom he attacked by name in his announcement video.
“If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen,” Biden said. “The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America’s at stake.”"

Once a thriving regional university with a strong reputation for the liberal arts, the University of Tulsa is in deep trouble these days. Professor Jacob Howland explains the school’s sad decline in this City Journal essay .
Part of the difficulty is the money the university’s previous administration squandered on athletics, but the real malignancy is the new president’s vision, which Howland describes as turning Tulsa “ into a glorified trade school with a social justice agenda. ” Advertisement Advertisement
The liberal arts are being pushed aside in favor of recruiting first-generation students and offering them occupational training programs — but as Howland observes, few such students could possibly afford the tuition. Leftist ideology is seeping into every corner of the university: a Diversity Action Plan, mandatory training to combat “ unconscious bias, ” and other progressive goodies. A revealing instance of the mindset in control of Tulsa is that during the Kavanaugh hearings, President Gerard Clancy felt the need to send around a campus-wide letter to comfort students, telling them that they need not worry about their “ safety and acceptance ” at the university."
Franklin Graham & Lost Evangelical Witness: Transactional Approach to Politics Hurts Church | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/franklin-graham-and-the-high-cost-of-the-lost-evangelical-witness/,"Follow David French on Twitter April 25, 2019 2:25 PM President Trump listens to Franklin Graham during a ceremony for the late Rev. Billy Graham in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C., February 28, 2018. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Graham’s willingness to abandon Christian principles when it’s politically expedient has cost the church dearly.
I t’s hard to think of a single prominent American Christian who better illustrates the collapsing Evangelical public witness than Franklin Graham, Billy Graham’s son. His commitment to the Christian character of American public officials seems to depend largely on their partisan political identity.
Let’s look at the record. In 1998, at the height of Bill Clinton’s sex scandals, the younger Graham wrote a powerful op-ed in the Wall Street Journal combating Clinton’s assertion that his affair was a “private” matter. Clinton argued that his misdeeds were “between me, the two people I love the most — my wife and our daughter — and our God.” Graham noted that even the most private of sins can have very public, devastating consequences, and he asked a simple question: “If [Clinton] will lie to or mislead his wife and daughter, those with whom he is most intimate, what will prevent him from doing the same to the American public?” Advertisement Advertisement
Graham was right: Clinton, it turned out, wouldn’t just lie to mislead his family. He’d lie to influence courts, Congress, and the American people.
Fast-forward 20 years. By 2018, Donald Trump was president — and helping to win important policy victories for religious conservatives — and Graham’s tune had changed dramatically. He actively repudiated his condemnations of Clinton , calling the Republican pursuit of the then-president “a great mistake that should never have happened,” and argued that “this thing with Stormy Daniels and so forth is nobody’s business.”
Graham was wrong: Trump, it turns out, doesn’t just lie to mislead his family. He lies all the time to influence courts, Congress, and the American people. Advertisement Advertisement
So is this the “new normal” for Evangelicals? Is politics entirely transactional now? Do we evaluate politicians only on their policies and leave the sex discussions to the privacy of their own bedrooms?
Apparently not, according to . . . Franklin Graham. Now that the Democratic primary is gaining steam and a gay candidate is surging forward, Graham has rediscovered his moral voice. Yesterday he tweeted this: Mayor Buttigieg says he’s a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women. 2/3
— Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) April 24, 2019
Yes, marriage is the union between a man and a woman, but Trump married a woman, then married his mistress, then married a third woman, then had an affair with a porn star while that third wife was pregnant with his child. Yet Graham says, “God put him” in the presidency and we need to “get behind him and support him.”
The proper Evangelical position toward any president is not hard to articulate, though it is exceedingly difficult to hold to, especially in polarized times when one party seems set on limiting religious liberty and zealously defending abortion: We should pray for presidents, critique them when they’re wrong, praise them when they’re right, and never, ever impose partisan double standards. We can’t ever forget the importance of character, the necessity of our own integrity, and the power of the prophetic witness. Advertisement
In other words, Evangelicals can never take a purely transactional approach to politics. We are never divorced from our transcendent purpose, which always trumps political expediency. In scripture, prophets confronted leaders about their sin. They understood a core truth, one clearly articulated in the Southern Baptist Convention’s 1998 Resolution on Moral Character of Public Officials : “Tolerance of serious wrong by leaders sears the conscience of the culture, spawns unrestrained immorality and lawlessness in the society, and surely results in God’s judgment.” Advertisement
All too many of our nation’s Evangelical leaders haven’t just “tolerated” serious wrongdoing by Trump, they’ve rationalized and minimized it. Some have even given the “thumbs up” in front of a Playboy cover . (What would Nathan, who dramatically confronted David over his infidelity and murder, say?) In so doing, they’ve seared the consciences of the culture and the church, and granted their secular opponents all the ammunition necessary to question our sincerity as believers. Advertisement"
Joe Biden Presidential Campaign: Progressive Support May Not Materialize | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Brendan Dougherty,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/joe-bidens-presidential-prospects/,"April 25, 2019 12:29 PM Former Vice President Joe Biden announces his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination (Biden Campaign Handout via Reuters) The Biden premise is to go back. But progressives want progress
J oe Biden has been ahead in the early polling for a long time. But, I wonder: Why?
The argument for Joe Biden’s nomination seems to be the one least likely to excite Democratic voters: he’s old and white, and his nomination is a decent enough accommodation to Republican political enemies who are backward looking. That is a problem because two different large cohorts of Democrats want to move forward in different ways. An upwardly mobile section of “woke” white progressives wants to triumph in the cultural arena, not accommodate. And a more socialist-influenced core wants to move on from the Clinton and Obama policies they detest as half measures. Advertisement Advertisement
Biden is now so aged in politics that he partially belongs to history. And of course, having been around long enough, he was frequently on the wrong side of it. At least by progressive sensibilities. He sponsored the 1994 crime bill, which is deplored as a sop to racist suburbanites and cops rather than a reaction to horrific crime rates. Earlier than that he opposed mandated school busing to create racially integrated schools. Some progressives are thrilled to see Mayor Pete Buttigieg fight the supposedly homophobic Vice President Mike Pence (Pence’s great offense is that he previously called Buttigieg a “patriot”). But back in 1973, Biden was asked by gay-rights activists about security clearances for homosexuals. Biden responded that his “gut reaction” was that homosexuals were “security risks.” All of these things could be excused in the way Obama’s opposition to gay marriage was, as mere concessions to the regnant taboos and politics of the day. But Democrats want to vote for a leader who inspires them, not one who requires contextualization.
The Biden campaign’s implicit promise is a return to normalcy. But that is a rebuke to the liberal imagination of history, in which Obama was a welcome rupture with the tradition of 42 white men as U.S. president. And in which the arc of history destines Democrats to make another startling break from the norm. There are qualified women in the Democratic race, aren’t there? And women of color. And a gay man. Wouldn’t electing one of them do more, symbolically, than electing another handsy old man on the premise that he is adept at coddling a politically fickle white working class? Biden’s candidacy is an attempt by Democrats to bargain with Trump’s America. Other candidates are promising to cleanse America from what Democrats see as the disgrace or even the sacrilege of Trump’s presidency. Democrats don’t want to bargain with the devil, they want an exorcist. Advertisement
If anything, recent presidential elections have taught the two major parties not to settle for someone who seems electable and unthreatening to swing voters, but to go with the candidate who excites them in the hope that excitement itself will be contagious. John Kerry as war veteran flopped. So did Romney. It was the candidates who drew impassioned crowds, Obama and Trump, who prevailed. Advertisement
But what about his accomplishments? Biden has historically positioned himself as a foreign-policy expert. But his record of judgment includes the very thing that disqualified Hillary Clinton for Democratic voters in 2008: a vote in support of the Iraq War. And despite Biden’s experience and insight on foreign policy, his proposed solution for Iraq was in some ways the one later attempted by ISIS, cleaving it into pieces along religious lines. What this would have meant for Syria, for Saudi Arabia, and for the resultant states, which would not all have equal access to Iraq’s resource wealth, he never quite speculated at the time. Advertisement
Some say that Biden is a reminder of the Obama years, and a counter-conventional wisdom is developing that nostalgia for the Obama years is precisely what the left wing of the party discounts at their peril. Biden’s campaign logo, as a design proposition, tries to steal Obama’s halo and place it on ol’ Joe himself. But, Obama was a history-making candidate, allowing voters to be aspirational about their country and themselves by voting for him. And Biden isn’t. Biden is the white guy who got in trouble for calling Obama “clean” and “articulate.”"

A quick follow-up to my post : It looks as though Linda Greenhouse and I aren’t quite in agreement on these cases. Greenhouse writes :
[I]f the court is true both to the direction of its sex-discrimination precedents and to ordinary uses of the English language, all three cases ought to be easy wins for the plaintiffs. No need to rely on me; ask Judge José A. Cabranes of the Second Circuit. He is one of the judiciary’s more prominent conservatives and a judge whose opinions get the attention of conservatives on the Supreme Court. In the Second Circuit sexual orientation case, he concurred with the majority in finding that the plaintiff, Donald Zarda, had a valid Title VII claim. “This is a straightforward case of statutory construction,” Judge Cabranes wrote. “Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination ‘because of sex.’ Zarda’s sexual orientation is a function of his sex. Discrimination against Zarda because of his sexual orientation therefore is discrimination because of his sex, and is prohibited by Title VII.” Judge Cabranes concluded: “That should be the end of the analysis.”
I have a great deal of admiration for Judge Cabranes. His entire analysis in his very brief opinion in Zarda , though, consists of the three sentences that Greenhouse quotes. Those sentences don’t acknowledge, much less begin to grapple with, the points that Judge Lynch develops at length. (How is it, for example, that sex-segregated restrooms would be permissible under Cabranes’s analysis?) So I don’t think that his opinion will persuade anyone.
A minor note: President Carter appointed Cabranes to the district court, and President Clinton elevated him to the Second Circuit. While he is indeed much more conservative than most other Carter or Clinton appointees, I would not have put him on a list of “the judiciary’s more prominent conservatives,” as I think that list would consist entirely of appointees of Republican presidents.
More broadly, Judge Lynch’s opinion, which Greenhouse doesn’t mention, devastates her claim that the “direction of [the Court’s] sex-discrimination precedents” and “ordinary uses of the English language” somehow dictate “easy wins for the plaintiffs.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "

Tobin,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/donald-trumps-middle-east-policies-are-not-irreversible/,"Follow Jonathan S. Tobin on Twitter April 25, 2019 11:46 AM President Trump shakes hands with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in Washington, D.C., March 25, 2019. (Leah Millis/Reuters) Don’t worry, Democrats, you can still reinstate Obama’s failed approach to the region.
L iberals’ basic narrative about the Trump administration is that the president is an idiot who has no idea what he is doing. That evergreen storyline enables Democrats to fantasize that the last 27 months have been merely a bad dream and can be quickly reversed once the rightful heirs to the White House oust the usurper. Advertisement Advertisement
But some in the foreign-policy establishment have not succumbed to this fantasy. As a recent Politico Magazine article by two longstanding purveyors of conventional wisdom about the Middle East — Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky — makes clear, some of Trump’s opponents understand that his policies are a serious attempt to implement genuine change.
Miller was a State Department functionary for 24 years, and has long advocated putting pressure on Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians. Sokolsky is another longtime State Department staffer who — like Miller, who now heads the Wilson Center — has retired to a comfortable perch in the think-tank world at the Carnegie Endowment. The pair are sounding the alarm that Trump’s successor won’t be able to reverse his approach to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
They’re right about the seismic nature of these changes. But as much as Trump has altered the landscape on both issues, it is not beyond the power of his opponents to send us back to the situation he inherited from Barack Obama — at a disastrous cost to U.S. interests. That sets up the 2020 presidential election as one that will have enormous consequences in the Middle East. Advertisement
Trump’s approach to the Israel–Palestinian conflict is indeed unprecedented. Dating back to Israel’s War of Independence, the United States had never recognized Israel’s sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem or the city’s status as the capital of the Jewish state, believing this was essential to preserving America’s status as an honest broker in the conflict as well as to force the Israelis to be more accommodating in negotiations. Advertisement
The same assumptions have been the foundation of U.S. policy toward Israeli–Palestinian negotiations since the 1993 Oslo peace accords. The administrations that Miller and Sokolsky served pressured Israel to make concessions while turning a blind eye to the Palestinian Authority’s efforts to undermine peace.
Trump has turned all that on its head. Miller and Sokolsky think recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and adopting an aggressive stance toward the Palestinian Authority — focused on forcing it to stop funding terrorism — have ended any hope of diplomatic progress. These changes, as well as Trump’s more recent recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, have in their view aligned the U.S. with Israel and signaled to the Palestinians that their hopes for statehood are finished. Advertisement
Miller and Sokolsky are probably right that the peace plan crafted by presidential adviser/son-in-law Jared Kushner isn’t going to succeed. But the policies they backed in the past not only failed miserably but also made peace less likely. Advertisement
The Palestinians have always assumed that they didn’t need to make concessions because, sooner or later, the West would abandon Israel. That dangerous delusion was reinforced by President Obama’s belief that only by creating more “daylight” between the U.S. and Israel could peace be achieved. But the Palestinians never took advantage of Obama’s efforts to tilt the diplomatic playing field in their direction and his open antagonism for Benjamin Netanyahu. The P.A. continued to believe that the international community would eventually bring Israel to its knees and fearful of appearing weak in comparison with the Islamists of Hamas that ran Gaza as an independent state in all but name, so it never budged off of its maximal territorial demands, its funding for terrorists, or its reluctance to agree to language that would clarify that the conflict was concluded for all time.
Despite the predictions of the experts, Trump’s Jerusalem move and his more realistic approach to peace talks haven’t undermined U.S. influence in the region. To the contrary, Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt have urged the P.A. to negotiate rather than reject Kushner’s plan out of hand — though the P.A. has thus far defied this advice. By strengthening the U.S.–Israel relationship, Trump has also shown the Palestinians what they have to lose from further intransigence. If they refuse his offer, they will find themselves even more isolated. Advertisement
Trump’s willingness to trash Obama’s Iran deal is another example of how he has substituted rational analysis for wishful thinking in the Middle East. Miller and Sokolsky describe Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s list of objectives with regard to Iran as “extreme” and “unnecessarily provocative.” But ending Iran’s support of terrorism, its quest for regional hegemony (advanced by foreign adventures such as its intervention in Syria and its support for rebels in Yemen), and its illegal missile production were the same goals Obama started out with before he abandoned a policy of tough sanctions in favor of appeasement. Moreover, the Iran deal left Tehran with its nuclear infrastructure intact and had an expiration date that would have allowed Iran to eventually construct a bomb anyway. Advertisement
Contrary to Miller and Sokolsky, the goal of U.S. diplomacy with Iran never should have been to achieve more cordial relations with the Islamist regime; the goal must be to change Iran’s behavior. By reimposing sanctions and seeking to shut off Iran’s oil exports, Trump isn’t — despite Iran’s transparent bluffs — setting the stage for a military conflict. Instead, he has returned us to the point in 2013 when Obama abandoned the West’s economic leverage in exchange for only a temporary pause in Iran’s quest for a nuclear weapon. By enriching and empowering Iran, Obama made it more dangerous. Trump’s policies are already showing signs of success in weakening it. Advertisement
If Iran and the Palestinians are still holding on to hope that these setbacks can be reversed, it is because they are being told by Western interlocutors, including former secretary of state John Kerry, that they should sit tight until 2021, when a Democratic successor to Trump will reinstate Obama’s policies.
This is possible, pace Miller and Sokolsky, though they are right that it won’t won’t be easy. Despite the contempt in which Miller and Sokolsky hold the president, they understand that measures like moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and sanctioning Iran are broadly popular. Any Democrat who seeks to reverse these moves will face opposition. Yet Trump’s measures have not blown up the region, very much leaving open the possibility of returning to a policy of more “daylight” or reinstating the Iran deal. Advertisement"
Elizabeth Warren Student-Debt Plan Gives Two-Thirds of Its Benefits to Top 40 Percent | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/elizabeth-warren-student-debt-plan-gives-two-thirds-of-its-benefits-to-the-top-40-percent/,"Follow Robert VerBruggen on Twitter April 25, 2019 3:05 PM
As I noted yesterday , while Warren’s student-loan-relief plan makes some efforts to be “ progressive ” — such as capping relief at $50,000 and phasing out benefits for households with six-figure incomes — any plan to cancel student debt is almost by definition targeted at the wealthier segments of American society, simply because richer people are more likely to have gone to college. Warren’s economic analysis, echoed by some liberal commentary, evaded this fact by calculating the percentage of student debt that would be forgiven for each income group.
Adam Looney with some less flattering numbers :
The top 20 percent of households receive about 27 percent of all annual savings, and the top 40 percent about 66 percent. The bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings. Borrowers with advanced degrees represent 27 percent of borrowers, but would claim 37 percent of the annual benefit.
Roughly the top 5 percent of households won’t get any relief at all, per Warren’s analysis, but those a bit below that will get quite the windfall, with little going to those at the bottom.
Looney adds:
Debt relief for student loan borrowers, of course, only benefits those who have gone to college, and those who have gone to college generally fare much better in our economy than those who don’t. So any student-loan debt relief proposal needs first to confront a simple question: Why are those who went to college more deserving of aid than those who didn’t? More than 90 percent of children from the highest-income families have attended college by age 22 versus 35 percent from the lowest-income families. Workers with bachelor’s degrees earn about $500,000 more over the course of their careers than individuals with high school diplomas. That’s why about 50 percent of all student debt is owed by borrowers in the top quartile of the income distribution and only 10 percent owed by the bottom 25 percent. Indeed, the majority of all student debt is owed by borrowers with graduate degrees.
Update : Matthew Chingos and Kristin Blagg of the Urban Institute report fairly similar results (emphases mine):
We estimate that 66 percent of federal student loan dollars would be forgiven under Warren’s plan. Applying this estimate to the most recent total debt in the federal student loan portfolio ($1.447 trillion) yields a cost estimate of $955 billion dollars. This estimate is higher than the one in the economic analysis (PDF) provided by Warren’s campaign, which used a different methodology."

Indianapolis, Ind. — As mentioned in today’s Morning Jolt , this year’s annual meeting of the National Rifle Association arrives with internal disputes and controversies, with some board members unhappy with the programming on NRATV and the organization filing a lawsuit over access to documents involving spending decisions at the NRA’s public-relations firm Ackerman McQueen.

The elections for positions on the NRA’s board of directors usually only interests diehard members, but the NRA’s board is under greater scrutiny with the ongoing concerns about how the organization spends its money.
Earlier this month, the NRA announced the preliminary results of its 2019 mail-ballot elections for the NRA Board of Directors — a mix of familiar names such as Oliver North, Ted Nugent, Allen West, Bob Barr, and former NBA star Karl Malone, as well as lesser-known activists and figures in the movement. Two of the reelected members — Marion Hammer and Willes Lee — expressed exasperation with Ackerman McQueen’s NRATV earlier this year in the pages of the New York Times , contending the programming had drifted away from its intended focus on Second Amendment issues.

The official results, including final vote totals, will be announced Saturday. In addition to the 75 board members elected by mail, members in attendance in Indianapolis have the opportunity to elect a 76th board member, for a one-year term, from among the candidates who were not elected on the mail ballot. Some members are pushing for an “outsider,” contending that the organization has grown too complacent about how its spends its money and getting sufficient bang for the buck. Advertisement"

A round Hong Kong, the noose is tightening. This was probably inevitable. In 1997, when Britain handed Hong Kong over to the Chinese government — i.e., the Chinese Communist Party — Beijing promised “one country, two systems.” In other words, Hong Kong could remain free while the rest of China was Communist. Advertisement Advertisement
That was always a crock.
In 2014, democratic protests broke out, and these protests were termed “the umbrella movement.” Reason: Protesters used their umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray. Of course, participants have been tried and locked up. Most recently, eight leaders have been sentenced .
One of those is Chan Kin-man, a retired sociology professor. “In the verdict,” he said, “the judge commented that we are naive” — naive to believe that a protest movement could attain democracy. “But what is more naive than believing in one country, two systems?”
Well said. Advertisement
You will note, in the article I’ve linked to, that people in Taiwan have protested the sentencings in Hong Kong. The Taiwanese know that they could well be next. This is all very moving, as well as alarming.
• When I was a freshman in college, I made mention of the little plaque on the plaza outside Notre-Dame de Paris. It marks “le centre de Paris,” I said. My (French) professor responded, “De l’univers, mon ami. De l’univers.” Advertisement
The pictures of the cathedral, burned and disfigured, are practically unbearable. But I know it will be rebuilt. I also know that nothing material lasts. I once visited the Temple of Diana, in Ephesus. It was a Wonder of the World. People came from great distances, to gaze at it, incredulous and rapt. When I got to it, it was an unsightly heap, a joke.
I further know that temples and cathedrals will rise and fall, rise and fall, inspired by ideas that are unkillable, unburnable, and immune to ruination.

• “All politicians lie,” we are told. “All presidents lie. Everyone in D.C. lies.” This is often said with an air of sophistication. Often, it is just an excuse — nothing more than an excuse. “Everyone does it, so relax. Don’t get your panties in a twist. Don’t be so square, daddy-o.” Advertisement
To hell with that.
People will tell you that moral behavior — decent character — is too much to expect. Again, an excuse. Don’t fall for it. I think of a phrase: “defining deviancy down.” They can do it only when you let them.
• Harvey Mansfield, the legendary Harvard professor, was invited to speak to a little college in Canada. They were lucky to get him. He was to speak on the Great Books. Then, the college disinvited him, unable to take the heat — because Mansfield is a conservative.

Disinviting Harvey Mansfield from speaking on the Great Books is like … disinviting Dr. Feynman from speaking on physics, or John Wooden from speaking on basketball, or me from speaking on milkshakes and Web-surfing. Advertisement
Insanity, and mean, too. (The greatest injury done is to the students who would have heard Mansfield.)
• I have never watched Game of Thrones , and I have never read a Stephen King novel. Regardless, I was impressed by a tweet — from King: “GoT: As a long-time storyteller, I’m in awe of how perfectly the minds behind this show brought all the major characters together at Winterfell. They made it look easy. Constant Readers, it is not.”
That is high praise. I think King was right to invoke his authority as “a long-time storyteller” — he did it, not in service to self, but in service to the GoT people. Also, don’t you like that old-style rendering of “long-time,” with the hyphen? (For years, the word has been “longtime.”) I do.
(And yet, he went “storyteller,” right?) Advertisement
• One of my friends, when he was in college, or maybe before, read a Stephen King novel twice. That was The Stand . A very long novel, too. I remember thinking, “What high praise, for a book — to have read it twice, when there is so much else to read.” Since that time, I have thought about reading The Stand . Maybe I will.
• In an Evelyn Waugh novel, Brideshead Revisited , a character peruses the newspaper and sighs, “Another naughty Scoutmaster.” I thought of this when seeing a headline: “Boy Scouts could be hit with more sex abuse claims.” (Article here .) Will it ever end? Apparently not. Advertisement

• I was talking with a friend last week who went to Penn Law School, some years ago. One of his teachers was Elizabeth Warren. She was superb, he said, admired by everybody. She was also attractive, admired by many a male student. Further, she was conservative — a defender of free markets, for example.
She has had an interesting journey, I would say. Advertisement
• It wasn’t very long ago that Tiger Woods thought he might never play golf again. Forget competitive golf, professional golf: What about playing nine holes with his children and grandchildren? He was not sure that this would come to pass.
Earlier this month, he won the Masters. Was it the greatest comeback in the history of golf? Of sports ? Last September, he won the Tour Championship. Some said that this was the greatest comeback in history — in the history of sports.
Let me do a little reviewing.
Tiger Woods was the greatest junior golfer and the greatest amateur golfer of the modern era, by a long shot. Second place is nowhere to be seen. He won three U.S. Juniors in a row and three U.S. Amateurs in a row. (Then he won the NCAA tournament.) It’s possible that nothing he has done as a pro is more impressive. Tiger Woods himself is of this view.
He turned pro in 1996 — and, in what seemed like a flash, won 71 tournaments. Including 14 majors. Including four majors in a row (though not in the same season). The crash came in 2009, when he was 33: a moral, mental, and physical crash.
He had a comeback in 2012 and ’13, winning eight tournaments. Consequently, his win total stood at 79, bettered only by Sam Snead, whose number is 82. (Jack Nicklaus is third, with 73. Nicklaus leads in majors, with 18.) But Woods went south again, with injury after injury, and surgery after surgery.
At times, he couldn’t walk. Couldn’t even practice his putting, to say nothing of his swing.
And then, a comeback, another one. In 2018, he led the British Open on Sunday, before falling back to sixth place. At the next major, the PGA, he finished second. Then, in September, he won the Tour Championship.
The next major to be played was the 2019 Masters — which he won.
He did not do it with histrionics or heroics. He did it with dull (frankly), competent, solid golf. He “plodded around” the course, as he later said. He hit greens in regulation and two-putted — except when he sneaked in a birdie here or there. For years, he was a human highlights reel. There were really no highlights at Augusta from him this time. Sure, the tee shot on 16 on Sunday was great, but — Woods was no highlights reel. You don’t need to be.
At some level, the game takes place between the ears. (This is why golf is so hard to depict in movies. There has practically never been a good golf movie.) Tiger won the Masters, as he has other tournaments, with his mental game.
His putting was amazing. When you get older, your putting is supposed to falter, even if you remain good between tee and green. Tiger is putting like a confident, unflappable, devil-may-care 20-year-old. (An old, grizzled pro once told me, “All young people have good short games.”)
Woods was playing with relative youngsters — in their 20s and 30s — who had grown up watching him and imitating him. He was playing with his own progeny, so to speak — and schooling them, on this occasion.
The course was benign, virtually defenseless. The old Tiger would have blown away the field at 20 under or something. (He once won the Masters by twelve shots; he won the U.S. Open by fifteen shots.) The new Tiger, “playing within himself,” to borrow the cliché — using the resources he had, including the mental — won by a stroke, at 13 under.
What a day, what a week, what a thing to witness. Advertisement
Woods is now 43. Nicklaus won his last tournament — the Masters — at 46. Snead won his last tournament at 52. These next few years for Woods should be interesting. This very summer should.
Allow me a trip down Memory Lane (not to be confused with Magnolia Lane, although, for me, they sometimes blend). I watched the Sunday round of the 1986 Masters in my dorm room. That was a victory for all of us — for all mankind. It defied the odds. It rebuked mortality. The very next Sunday — same dorm room — I watched Horowitz return to Moscow. This was exhilarating in a similar way.
And now, Woods’s latest. People can do fantastic things, you know?
• Let me give you a picture from Dallas — where Christmas lingers, at least for some:

• Paul Hollander did a lot of good in his life. He tried to tell sleepy people in the Free World about Communism — with which he had had some experience. He had some experience with Nazism, too.
He was born in 1932, in Hungary. In 1944, his family (Jewish) went into hiding. Twelve-year-old Paul, anticipating his death, wondered what it was like to be shot. He discussed it with his father, who had been wounded in World War I.
When the Soviets came in, Paul welcomed them as liberators and allied himself with Communism. As for many, that did not last long. When the Soviets and other Communists crushed the rebellion of 1956, Hollander escaped to America.
He earned his Ph.D., in sociology, at Princeton. For most of his career, he taught at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He wrote many books, including Political Pilgrims (1981), which tells about the travels of Western intellectuals to the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba.
He was authoritative on a range of subjects, which can be seen in a collection called “Discontents: Postmodern and Postcommunist,” published in 2002. I reviewed it — taking the occasion to write about Paul — here .
He died a couple of weeks ago, having made excellent use of his experience, both good and bad, and of his exceptional intellect.
• Hollander, I knew. Mona Lee Brock, I did not — but I wish I had. I read her obit in the New York Times . What a woman.
She was a farmwoman, and she helped people — many people — during the farm crisis of the 1980s. A lot of family farms went under, and there was a rash of suicides. Mrs. Brock manned a suicide hotline, day after day, night after night. Sometimes, she had to hear the gunshots over the phone."
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders Face Intersectional Primary | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D.

Williamson April 26, 2019 6:30 AM Former vice president Joe Biden arrives at a rally with striking Stop & Shop workers in Boston, Mass., April 18, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) If that’s the game, then neither Biden nor Sanders has much to offer.
J oe Biden is being talked up as not only the man who can beat Donald Trump but also the one who can beat Bernie Sanders, which many Democrats see as the first order of business.
There’s one problem with that: Biden is Bernie Sanders.
Old white guy? Joe Biden has hair plugs that are older than the median Democratic primary voter. Sanders and Biden are a year apart — and both of them are older than Trump. Creaky? Creepy stuff in his history? Dusty northeastern union-hall politics? Check all those boxes. Worst: Sanders and Biden, though they are miles apart in rhetoric, are in many ways a couple of outmoded Teddy Kennedy liberals in a party that wants nothing to do with dinosaurs of that particular species. Advertisement Advertisement
Don’t bet the farm on either one of them.
Biden is a weird, handsy phony who has been in political office since before I was born, a mediocrity who topped out as vice president to the most insipid nonentity to occupy the Oval Office since Warren G. Harding — and made him look good by comparison. The first time Biden ran for president, I was in junior high. (Go, Rangers!) He’s a hack, a hapless, feckless lifer whose “ Regular Joe on the Amtrak” shtick is a ridiculous joke . He’s shameless, once telling a black audience that Republicans plan to “put y’all back in chains,” affecting a quasi-southern black-ish accent. (Do white people say “y’all” a lot in Scranton?) He apparently had considered launching his presidential campaign in Charlottesville, Va., but someone thought better of it. He cited the violence there as his main reason for running for president — as though he hadn’t been running for decades. He didn’t even have the decency to make a pro forma phone call to the family of Heather Heyer, who was killed on that horrible day in Charlottesville, before cynically instrumentalizing her death. “They capitalize on whatever situation is handy,” said Susan Bro, Heyer’s mother. At least Robert Francis O’Rourke mounts restaurant counters and not tombs. Advertisement
Is Biden the anti-Sanders? Not really. Sanders, for all his notional radicalism, seems like something new mainly because he is so retro: one part SNCC doofus, one part milquetoast Norman Mailer imitator, which is what all that weird rape-fantasy political porn on his résumé is about — that stuff was fashionable back in the days when the author of The Naked and the Dead was running for office. A cultural creature of the 1970s, Sanders is very much of a piece with the post-LBJ Democratic party: He’s what Howard Dean would be if Howard Dean had grown up on East 26th Street in Brooklyn instead of on Park Avenue. Advertisement
The old-white-guy thing isn’t working out too well for Sanders. In Houston earlier this week for a cracked festival of progressive inanity called “She the People,” Sanders got read the old-white-guy riot act: Pressed about racial issues, Comrade Muppet started to launch into yet another retelling of the fact that he marched with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 — but the crowd shut him down, hooting and laughing at him. “We know!” someone shouted. They’d heard it all before. Sanders, visibly flummoxed, went on to talk up the fact that he’d supported Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign, and the room responded with, approximately, “Jesse Who ?”
The Reverend Jackson’s is a name to conjure with no more. Advertisement Advertisement
The Democratic party has reached a generational cleavage. Sanders doesn’t seem like the kind of rascal who would have joined Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd in whipping up a “waitress sandwich” at La Brasserie — he is a rascal of a different sort — but he’s part of the same generation. He is old and white in a party whose future isn’t. He’s part of the cohort of aging liberals who are still trying to figure out whether they’re supposed to say “transsexual” or “transgender,” not trailblazing in search of that elusive 7 2nd gender identity.
The politics here should be familiar.
Republicans settled on Donald Trump in 2016 because they wanted a national repudiation of Barack Obama and all he stood for, and Trump was — and is — the social and cultural antithesis of the Obama type. Republicans did not want Democrats to suffer a mere political defeat in 2016 but to suffer a humiliating rejection, and Democrats helped things along by giving the public a very easy candidate to reject. Democrats going into 2020 are where Republicans were going into 2016: They don’t just want Trump out of office — they’re pretty sure (maybe too sure) that they’re going to get that in any case. They want him shamed, they want those around him shamed, and they want the country to make an executive gesture that says, in essence, “Never again.” And replacing Trump with another rich old white guy would not pack the symbolic punch that Democrats want, even if one of them calls himself a socialist from time to time."
Elizabeth Warren’s Student Debt Forgiveness Proposal Not So Generous | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jason Delisle,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-student-debt-forgiveness-proposal/,"April 26, 2019 6:30 AM Sen. Elizabeth Warren participates in the She the People Presidential Forum in Houston, Texas, April 24, 2019. (Loren Elliott/Reuters) The senator's plan would forgive fewer graduates' debt than existing programs.
W ith her new proposal to forgive almost $1 trillion in student debt, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has made an excellent case to immediately cut benefits from their existing levels under Obama-era student-loan programs, even if her plan is never enacted.
Despite her plan’s apparent generosity, it would impose limits on who can qualify for debt forgiveness based on income. It would also limit how much each borrower can be forgiven. Yet under the existing Income-Based Repayment (IBR) program, which Democrats in Congress and the Obama administration redesigned in 2010, borrowers can stand to have more forgiven than under Warren’s proposal. And while IBR forgives borrowers only after a repayment period, even borrowers who have high incomes are eligible for college-debt forgiveness. Advertisement Advertisement
Specifically, Warren’s plan would cap the amount of debt that can be forgiven at $50,000, an amount that is reduced on a sliding scale for borrowers earning over $100,000, offering no college-debt forgiveness for anyone earning above $250,000. It sure looks like Warren believes that no one should have more than $50,000 in federal student loans forgiven, and that higher-income borrowers should qualify for even less, or none at all if their incomes reach $250,000.
The existing IBR program, by contrast, places no limit on the amount borrowers can be forgiven, and there is no absolute income limit on who can receive loan forgiveness. Here is how the program works — and how borrowers earning over $100,000 can easily qualify for loan forgiveness well in excess of the limits that Warren recommends. Advertisement
Under current law, anyone who takes out a federal student loan today can enroll in IBR and have his payments fixed at 10 percent of his income, less an exemption of $18,700 (which increases with household size). It does not matter if those payments are less than what is needed to repay the debt; that’s the point. Payments are based solely on income. Then, after 20 years of payments (or only ten years for those working in any government or non-profit job), all of the remaining balance is forgiven, no matter how high it is. Advertisement
The U.S. Department of Education provides a handy calculator to show how borrowers can easily have more forgiven under current rules than what the Warren proposal would allow. Advertisement
Consider someone with $80,000 in debt and a starting income of $60,000. According to the calculator, this borrower would have $62,000 forgiven under the current IBR program if he holds a government or non-profit job. That’s well above what Warren thinks is reasonable.
Or consider a borrower with a starting income of $75,000 and $150,000 in debt. The department’s calculator says he would have $88,500 forgiven after 20 years of payments under IBR. Again, that is well outside the limits of Warren’s proposal. And by the time this borrower receives debt forgiveness, his income would exceed $100,000 (the calculator assumes income increases by 5 percent annually), the income level at which Warren says borrowers should qualify for reduced loan forgiveness.

‘Avengers: Endgame’ Review: Nostalgia for Arrested Adolescents | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/avengers-endgame-review-nostalgia-arrested-adolescents/,"April 26, 2019 6:30 AM Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) in Avengers: Endgame (Marvel Studios) Superheroes punch the clock in this hollow, predictable, overly long mess.
A dults no longer outgrow comic books. Hollywood prefers that they hang on to the adolescent illusion of carefree, escapist pleasure by pretending that the form’s juvenile cynicism is a sign of sophistication — replacing the traditional sources of imaginative thinking. The cultural monopoly represented by the Marvel Cinematic Universe in its latest release, Avengers: Endgame , depends on geeked-up viewers telling themselves that they are having a major cultural experience. Advertisement Advertisement
By now the various MCU franchises have expanded so unmanageably that this overcrowded, supposedly final convocation offers no storyline in which distinctive conflicts are resolved. Instead, we get just a laughably familiar (but lucrative) pretext: Endgame ’s several surviving Avenger superheroes huddle in a scrum and devise a time-travel do-over.
Last year’s Infinity Wars had worked itself into a narrative corner: killing off most of the major characters for a cliffhanger. The morbidity suggested apocalypse — a comic-book parallel to the Rapture. But nothing so profoundly Christian happens in this anti-mythological jamboree. Infinity Wars triggered faux-tragic fascination. Less urgent than Han Solo’s carbon freeze in The Empire Strikes Back, it was more like the “Who Killed J. R.?” narrative cheat on the TV series Dallas. However, been-there-done-that doesn’t matter to the Star Wars – Lord of the Rings generation still caught up in toddler enthusiasm: “Do it again, Daddy!”
Arrested adolescence is evident throughout Endgame ’s parent-child motifs: Assorted superheroes from Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.) to Gamora (Zoe Saldana) confront their progenitors. The film’s one good scene has Thor (Chris Hemsworth) traveling back to the day his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) dies; he’s unable to change fate but gets a last chance to re-experience womblike love. It rips off Spielberg’s A.I ., and Marvel fans probably won’t recognize that it also rips off Thornton Wilder’s Our Town — that’s part of the MCU cultural cheat. Spielberg’s and Wilder’s larger issues are eclipsed by Frigga’s flattery: “Everyone fails at who they’re supposed to be. The measure of a hero is how they succeed at being who they are.” She rings the Millennial psychobabble bell. Fans are permitted to go forward and pre-order their Toy Story 4 tickets with no other sense of responsibility. Advertisement
Infantilization is the MCU game plan. A serious publication is obligated to point out similarity to the free-college, no-student-loans, socialized-medicine political promises that stoke immaturity. Also note how Endgame secularizes religious allegories. The end-times premise is hollow, just an excuse for the usual sci-fi, CGI destruction. Even Thor’s junked-up Norse myth and Black Panther’s purely cosmetic Afrocentricity join the trend of ignoring spiritual faith and trivializing national heritage. Advertisement
Endgame ’s three-hour length suggests profundity, but each bout of knuckle-busting between the specially gifted vigilantes and the demonic Thanos (Josh Brolin) either panders (the last-minute arrival of pre-technology Wakanda warriors is a risible reversal of the cavalry bit in Westerns) or, at best, is merely redundant (Marvel’s distaff troops line up behind Brie Larsen’s Captain Marvel, the mean-girl superheroine).

Donald Trump Is Ready To Fight Possible Impeachment | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/trump-ready-fight-possible-impeachment/,"April 26, 2019 6:30 AM President Trump greets supporters at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Fla., April 18, 2019. (Al Drago/Reuters) Impeachment would be a helluva plot twist.
N o one enjoys getting impeached, and if it happens to him, Donald J. Trump will be no exception.
On the other hand, it’s hard to imagine any potential target of impeachment in Anglo-American history relishing the fight more than Trump. He’d rather be done with the Mueller investigation in all its permutations, but there’s no one better suited to being at the center of a harshly partisan, deeply personal political and legal donnybrook that will ultimately be just for show. Advertisement Advertisement
Trump famously told top aides at the beginning of his administration that he wanted them to view each day as a TV episode. Impeachment would be a helluva season, matching a momentous process of American government with low political melodrama.
This may feel like a devolution from the buttoned-up Mueller probe, but the House should have been the locus of the Trump investigation in the first place.
Because Justice Department policy says a president can’t be indicted, Robert Mueller was never going to reach a legal conclusion about alleged obstruction. The question was whether the president’s conduct constituted an abuse of power that Congress would deem impeachable; in other words, it was a political question. Advertisement
Congress, then, was always the most appropriate venue for the investigation and disposition of this matter, not the office of the special counsel. Advertisement
But our habit of transmuting broad political questions into narrow legal ones and Rod Rosenstein’s panicked appointment of Mueller — after the firing of FBI director James Comey that he participated in — ensconced the probe within the Department of Justice.
Instead of being out in the open, it was behind closed doors. Instead of being nakedly political, it was clothed in thick legal analysis. Instead of being a struggle between the branches, it was a struggle within the executive branch.
Trump was deeply conflicted. He hated the investigation and came up with schemes to crimp it, all of which came to nothing. At the same time, the White House cooperated with Mueller. It was a twilight struggle between the president and the special counsel, with Trump not able to fully fight what was, in effect, an impeachment inquiry because any wrong move would be interpreted as yet another alleged act of obstruction. Advertisement
Now, the battle is truly joined. The body that is going to make the ultimate decision of what to do about Trump’s conduct, if anything, is on the hook. It has to decide what goes too far and not far enough. Should it subpoena Trump’s children? How much time should it devote to investigations, as opposed to its policy agenda? And, of course, should it impeach? Advertisement
For his part, Trump is liberated to fight like a caged animal, asserting executive prerogatives vis-à-vis the legislature and engaging in flat-out partisan combat.
Trump would prefer a world in which he’s universally praised, but short of that, this is his element. Despite all the press coverage over the past two years saying he’s on the verge of some sort of breakdown, he’s handled every controversy or fight — no matter how personal or treacherous — with the same straight-ahead aggression.
Trump is almost certainly better prepared and temperamentally suited for thermonuclear war with a Democratic House than he was to get substantive achievements out of a Republican House. He obviously hadn’t thought through an actionable populist-conservative policy synthesis, but he has a lifetime’s experience resisting and belittling enemies and extemporizing his way from one crisis to the next.
It may be impossible for him to stop impeachment, certainly not if Nancy Pelosi supports it. But he’ll be the focus of a historic drama that will rate — or at least be remembered and analyzed — for a very long time. He will have succeeded in making the Democratic House majority all about him, and, if not getting convicted by the Senate counts as a victory, he will win in the end. Advertisement"
Russian Election Interference: Will Conservatives Give Them a Pass? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mona Charen,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/russian-interference-us-elections-conservative-response/,"April 26, 2019 6:30 AM Russian President Vladimir Putin (Sputnik/Kremlin/Alexei Druzhinin/via Reuters) So far, too many have.
T he conservative media world, along with all but a few Republican members of Congress, are in the process of handing Vladimir Putin his greatest victory yet. They are ignoring the copious evidence in the Mueller report that Russia interfered in our election and continues to do so. Pace Jared Kushner, it was a whole lot more sinister than a “couple of Facebook ads.” Advertisement Advertisement
The narrative has now taken hold that the Mueller investigation originated with the Steele dossier. On Fox News, Ed Henry said that the FBI relied on the dossier to “get this whole thing going.” Breitbart referred to the “debunked Russia hoax,” and a Wall Street Journal editorial demanded to know how “the partisan propaganda known as the Steele dossier become the basis for an unprecedented FBI probe of a presidential campaign . . .”
As the Mueller report makes clear, and as even the controversial “Nunes memo” of 2018 conceded, the investigation did not begin with the dossier. It began when a foreign government (believed to be Australia) “informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with [George] Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign.”
Sixteen members of the Trump campaign had direct ties with Russians or Russian agents, including President Trump. Some of these were benign. Some were not. Paul Manafort was sharing polling information and plans for winning midwestern states with Konstantin Kilimnik, who has ties to Russian intelligence. Is it the received Republican wisdom now that this was not, at the very least, eyebrow raising? Advertisement
As for Trump’s connections to Russia, we now know that throughout most of the campaign, even as he was issuing tweets like this one on July 26, 2016 —“For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia”— and saying it was “crazy” to suggest that Russia was dealing with Trump, in fact he had been negotiating one of his largest real-estate projects ever, for a Trump Tower Moscow, until just the previous month. Advertisement
But even if the investigation had begun with the Steele dossier, so what? As they say in legal circles: res ipsa loquitur — “the thing speaks for itself.” The Mueller report is sober and meticulous. The dossier is hardly mentioned. If Republican partisans skip over the documentation of Russian meddling because they’ve internalized Donald Trump’s sense of grievance, they are disserving the nation.
The Russian interference was and is far more extensive than a few Facebook and Twitter posts, though those were noxious enough. The IRA (Internet Research Agency), an arm of the Russian intelligence services, along with the GRU (Russia’s foreign intelligence service), also organized “dozens” of actual rallies, hacked into the computers of the Democratic party, maliciously spread falsehoods, stoked already existing divisions between Americans of different races and ethnicities, and planted malware. More worrying, the report notes that the Russians aimed at actual voting infrastructure:
Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. The GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.
In August 2016, GRU officers targeted employees of [redacted], a voting technology company that developed software used by numerous U.S. counties to manage voter rolls . . .
The independent counsel did not further investigate these attempts to subvert elections because “the Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity.” Advertisement
Or perhaps not. According to the New York Times , former homeland-security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wanted to make blocking Russian interference in the 2020 election a top priority. She was warned off by Trump’s chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who made it clear that the president still regards any mention of Russia as a personal slight. Advertisement
In a continuation of patterns established under Communism, Russia has exerted malign influence on elections in many nations. Throughout the democratic world, they seek to sow the kind of division and distrust they enjoy in mother Russia. Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Hungary, and other former Soviet captives have been particularly hard hit, but the Russians have also stirred the pot of Catalan succession in Spain, boosted Marine Le Pen in France, and helped Brexit in Great Britain. In 2017, the Netherlands switched to all paper ballots to prevent Russian hacking of its election."
Iron Man 2: Marvel’s Most Underrated Movie | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/iron-man-2-most-underrated-marvel-movie-is/,"April 26, 2019 11:38 AM Robert Downy Jr. as Tony Stark in Iron Man 2 (Marvel) . . . a libertarian flick that makes a case for a great-man theory of history.
I ron Man 2 is the Marvel movie that gets no love. It has less comic-book fantasy than most Marvel Cinematic Universe entries, but that’s another way of saying it’s more tethered in reality. Which in turn makes it more interesting than the average. It’s the most libertarian movie of the lot.
“I don’t care about the liberal agenda anymore. It’s boring,” Tony Stark complains near the outset of the 2010 movie (which is streaming on Hulu and Amazon Prime Video). Written by Justin Theroux and directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man 2 makes a rousing case for a great-man theory of history. Tony may be a shameless rascal and unapologetic materialist who surrounds himself with dancing girls in bikinis at event launches, but he does far more for America than all of the regulators and rent-seekers ever will. The film has a witty script, a hilarious villain turn by Sam Rockwell as a D.C. swamp creature, and a wicked parody of Arlen Specter courtesy of Garry Shandling. It brings us some of Nick Fury’s funniest lines (“Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to exit the doughnut”), as well as Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow and the first kiss between Tony and Pepper Potts. Its plot is driven by ideas, notably a defense of property rights and warnings about crony capitalism and nationalizing industry. (Spoilers follow.)
As “Senator Stern,” from Pennsylvania, who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Shandling does a spot-on impression of Specter’s oily sanctimoniousness. “My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America,” Stern says, but that isn’t his priority at all. He simply wants to do what politicians love doing, which is picking winners and losers in industry, with the chosen winner in this case being his golfing partner, Justin Hammer (Rockwell), the CEO of the Senate’s favorite defense contractor. Hammer, as Tony Stark reminds us, is so incompetent a weapons manufacturer he nearly got himself killed trying to make an imitation Iron Man suit.
After the events of Iron Man , the world has been rendered tranquil by Stark’s relentless vigilance about crushing evil. For all of his party-boy antics, he is as serious as Superman about protecting America. In effect, he’s the new nuclear deterrent: He no longer needs to be deployed because all potential enemies understand it would be folly to take him on. The only earthly institution that appears powerful enough to represent a threat to Tony, and therefore a threat to order, is the United States government. Yet Iron Man 2 isn’t a paranoid conspiracy thriller. It doesn’t have to be. The threat isn’t a sci-fi concoction like Hydra, it’s Washington behaving as usual.
Like any other leader proclaiming he merely has the people’s best interests at heart, Senator Stern oozes with worry about Stark having too much power and orders him to turn over his tech to the government, which in turn will share it with Hammer’s firm. Tony refuses. “We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it,” he says, pounding the table. “I did you a big favor. I have successfully privatized world peace.” The rival defense contractor, Hammer (who calls Tony “Anthony” to troll him), says, “Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities and yet he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it.”
But Hammer’s real motive is to line his pockets and win his rivalry with Tony, not to make Americans more secure. He’s so determined that he contrives to break out of prison the homicidal physics genius Ivan Venko (Mickey Rourke), the vengeful Russian son of a former business partner of Tony’s father, and put him to work making a rival to the Iron Man suit. Not knowing this, Tony’s friend Rhodes (Don Cheadle) turns over a version of the outfit to the government, agreeing with the senator’s view that the technology is too powerful to be entrusted to one unaccountable man. This yields a rollicking scene that understands exactly what would happen if you or I got hold of some Iron Man suits: We’d want to have a fight with a buddy, preferably while drunk, definitely to the beat of “Another One Bites the Dust.”
Like the best villains, Rockwell’s Hammer is seductively appealing, especially in the scene in which he proudly rolls out his favorite firearms. One number has six barrels: “The torso taker, powder maker, our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon,” he boasts. He’s one of the most entertaining arms dealers the movies have ever imagined, and the film avoids the usual claptrap about how weapons makers are the reason we have wars. Meanwhile, Venko’s unusual weapons — the electrified whips that earned his comic-book forebear the name “Whiplash” — prove to be visually engaging as well as challenging for Tony to deal with. To add to his demoralization, Tony finds himself publicly hounded (as any true libertarian would be) by the likes of both Christiane Amanpour and Bill O’Reilly, who appear in cameos. “Tony Stark is done!” O’Reilly proclaims.
Not hardly. Iron Man 2 would be surpassed by some other offerings in the MCU, notably the first two Captain America movies, but it remains one of the smartest and least silly chapters in the 22-film extravaganza. "
DOJ Inspector General Probe of Carter Page Warrants Update | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Eric Felten,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/in-going-after-carter-page-did-the-fbi-and-doj-abuse-the-fisa-process/,"About Eric Felten April 26, 2019 11:50 AM Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz before testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., June 19, 2018 (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) The DOJ inspector general is on the case, and there are signs he’ll be tough on the agencies.
D epartment of Justice inspector general Michael Horowitz announced in March 2018 that his office was reviewing the DOJ’s and FBI’s “compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.” In other words, he was asking whether the agencies abused their power in getting warrants to surveil (by then, former) Trump-campaign foreign-policy adviser Carter Page. Advertisement Advertisement
More than a year later, we still don’t know much about the course of the IG’s investigation. But that may finally be changing.
Horowitz has one of the best-caulked tubs in town: His team doesn’t leak. But that’s not the only reason info on the Horowitz investigation has been so hard to come by. In addition, his job doesn’t entail bringing revealing indictments along the way.
Robert Mueller’s shop wasn’t particularly leaky either, but long before the special counsel filed his final report, we had learned a lot about where that report was headed. We learned it from looking at who got indicted, what they were indicted for, and the many details in each indictment and descriptive “criminal information.” Those who were paying attention to the special counsel’s various prosecutions couldn’t help but notice that Paul Manafort was jailed for sundry financial improprieties and sheer tackiness (don’t forget the ostrich jacket), but not for conspiring with Russia. Similarly, when the special counsel’s office brought a raft of indictments against a group of Russian-military-intelligence hackers, missing was any knowing connection between team Trump and the accused. Indeed, so professional were the hacking operations described in Mueller’s indictment of the Russians that it is hard to imagine what the hackers could possibly have needed from the amateurs in Trump’s orbit. Such details led many to surmise that Mueller had yet to find collusion, deductions that proved correct.
No such intermediate actions have been taken by IG Horowitz, which has left us in the dark about what sort of report he is preparing. The IG is trying to establish how the counter-intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign got started. That much we know. What we haven’t had any idea about is just how tough Horowitz is willing to be with DOJ and FBI officials should he discover they abused their power. Advertisement Advertisement
There have been reasons to doubt he would be very tough. Recall how the IG’s report on the Hillary Clinton email investigation went out of its way to avoid damaging conclusions. Horowitz catalogued the compendious anti-Trump texts sent between FBI agent Peter Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page, but he determined he could not prove their attitudes and opinions biased their official actions. Though “these messages cast a cloud” over the email investigation, Horowitz wrote, “we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions we reviewed.” In other words, short of a memo from Strzok admitting his aversion to Trump was the reason for particular actions, Horowitz was not willing to declare there had been political bias in play.
It may be different this time around. Natasha Bertrand is a reporter with extensive sources among the cadres of senior DOJ and FBI elites who have been fired, been demoted, or retired in the last couple of years. These are the very people who are the objects of the IG’s efforts, and they don’t like where things are headed. Advertisement
“Former U.S. officials interviewed by the inspector general were skeptical about the quality of his probe,” Bertrand wrote in Politico last week. “They emphasized to Horowitz that information in a warrant application need not be wholly verified, as long as the reliability of the source of the information is disclosed to the court.” Democrats have insisted that the FISA court was given fair warning that Christopher Steele’s dossier was opposition research; Republicans have scoffed at the way Steele working for the Clinton campaign was described: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person [Steele] was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s [Donald Trump’s] campaign.” Horowitz seems to have been unpersuaded that weasel words such as “speculates” and “likely looking” fulfilled the Justice Department’s obligations to the FISA court. Or as the unhappy former officials put it, “the inspector general seemed neither well-versed in the FISA process nor receptive to the explanations.” Advertisement
Not only is the IG misinformed, according to Bertrand’s sources, he’s prickly. Consider this description of Horowitz’s frame of mind regarding demoted DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr: “The Inspector General is apparently irked by Ohr’s decision to maintain contact with Steele after the bureau temporarily cut ties with the British operative in October 2016.” Bertrand wrote. Not “concerned.” Not “disturbed.” Not “alarmed.” No, the IG is “ irked ,” a word that conveys an unprofessional personal pique. Advertisement"
"Oscar Hammerstein: Sincerely, Oscar Review | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/oscar-hammersteins-sincerity-broadway-review/,"April 26, 2019 12:57 PM Pictured: Azudi Onyejekwe, Doreen Taylor in Sincerely, Oscar (Derek Brad) Hammerstein’s cockeyed optimism may not have been revolutionary, but it always made the audience smile.
T he musical theater’s greatest genius, Stephen Sondheim, once described his mentor Oscar Hammerstein II as a man of limited talent but infinite soul, whereas Richard Rodgers was the reverse. With one characteristic double-edged quip, Sondheim managed to insult both men, but also to praise them. If Hammerstein could have chosen either description, I think he would have chosen the one Sondheim applied, correctly, to him. Advertisement Advertisement
Hammerstein was not a genius, but he was a mensch, and if his lyrics sometimes strayed into the trite or the banal, they went for the heart and very often got there. He wasn’t a great wit like Sondheim or his predecessor as Rodgers’s lyricist, the brilliant Lorenz Hart, but his earnest, plainspoken sentiments suited mid-century America’s confidence, its optimism, and its love of love songs in the great Rodgers and Hammerstein collaborations Oklahoma! , South Pacific , Carousel , The King and I , and The Sound of Music .
All of those shows and others are sampled in the revue Sincerely, Oscar , a modest, low-budget off-Broadway show (at Theatre Row on West 42nd Street through May 12). More like a show you’d see at Disney World than a typical New York City stage offering, it has virtually no scenery or props. It’s built around a holographic image of Hammerstein (1895–1960) who is seen and heard reflecting on various songs, his approach to writing them, and his relentlessly cheery outlook. Mostly he is seen sitting at a desk introducing the songs, words from which are projected on screens behind him as they are sung by a cast of two. Doreen Taylor, who conceived and wrote the show, sings most of the numbers, sometimes in duets with Azudi Onyejekwe, who also sings a few offerings solo. Both actors sing adequately but don’t do a great job of acting, especially when it comes to expressing romance, and the arrangements are aggressively odd, with bossa nova beats and electric-guitar solos. Most songs are performed by a jazz trio, sometimes supplemented with a woodwind or a guitar or canned strings. Advertisement
For longtime fans, hearing unexpected twists on classics like “My Favorite Things” and “Getting to Know You” may hold some appeal, and for younger audience members, the show (which runs 90 minutes with no intermission) could serve as a sweet introduction to some of the greatest songs in Broadway history — “If I Loved You” (from Carousel ), “Surrey with the Fringe on Top” and “People Will Say We’re in Love” ( Oklahoma! ), “Some Enchanted Evening” ( South Pacific ), “Edelweiss” ( The Sound of Music ). It would be ideal to hear the tunes with a full orchestra, but these numbers are iron-bottomed, unsinkable. Advertisement
The infinitude of Hammerstein’s soul is evident in his hologram monologues, delivered with the promised sincerity and then some. Unlike Sondheim, he wasn’t a man to get tricksy, but he wasn’t trying to be. This is the raindrops-on-roses-and-whiskers-on-kittens man, the perpetrator of “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” When he wrote the words “I’m as corny as Kansas in August,” it was his “Silly Love Songs” confession. Hologram-Oscar reminds us that “Out of my dreams and into your arms/I long to fly” is an actual line of his, apparently a favorite one. He tells us he has faith that “good triumphs over evil. If that’s religion then I’m religious.” Facing mortality, he says, “The world is quite a wonderful place.” Advertisement"
President Trump Should Issue the Jones Act Waiver | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael R. Strain,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/jones-act-waiver-shipping-law-crony-capitalism/,"April 26, 2019 6:41 PM Container ships off the port of Los Angeles in 2012. (Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters)
President Trump is reportedly considering issuing a Jones Act waiver. He should do so.
The Jones Act is a 1920 law that requires goods transported by water between U.S. ports to be carried on ships constructed in the United States and operated under the U.S. flag. It is dripping in crony capitalism. Advertisement Advertisement
As is typical with cronyism, the law creates diffuse costs and concentrated benefits. In this case, consumers bear the costs through artificially high prices. Prices are higher than they would otherwise be because the Jones Act makes it more expensive to transport consumer goods from point A to point B in the U.S.
Part of this expense is driven by bizarre situations created by the law. For example, a foreign-flagged ship can’t deliver part of the same cargo loaded onto the ship in, say, Kyoto to Newark, and then the rest to Philadelphia, because shipments viewed as originating in Newark and arriving in Philadelphia must be carried on U.S. flagged vessels. The ship must instead unload all its cargo in one U.S. city, and land-based transportation picks it up from there. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
So the Jones Act also increases traffic congestion, and wear and tear on U.S. roads. Goods that would be transported over water in the absence of the cronyist regulation are instead transported over land. The next time you’re stuck in traffic, thank crony capitalism. Advertisement Advertisement
The benefits of the Jones Act accrue, naturally, to U.S. shipbuilders.
The waiver being debated inside the White House would ease the flow of U.S. natural gas to the northeast, which isn’t served by enough pipelines, and would lower energy costs in Puerto Rico, which is seeking a ten-year reprieve from artificially high energy prices cause by the Act. Puerto Rico would like to receive deliveries of liquefied natural gas from non-U.S.-flagged ships."

Abigail Disney: Virtue-Signaling Left-Wing Heiress | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Matthew Continetti,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/my-least-favorite-disney-princess/,"April 27, 2019 5:30 AM Abigail Disney on CNBC’s Squawk Box in March. (CNBC/via YouTube) She's an entitled, virtue-signaling, left-wing heiress.
I f it were not for her last name, Abigail Disney would be just another alumna of Yale (B.A.), Stanford (M.A.), and Columbia (PhD) living in Manhattan. No one would pay much attention to her opinions, none of them especially unique or different from others shared by her class. But she is a Disney, dammit, and in America in the 21st century we must heed the rich and privileged, especially if they parrot the left wing of the Democratic party. Abigail Disney’s father was Roy E. Disney, who instigated an animation renaissance in the 1980s; her grandfather was Roy O. Disney, the co-founder of the Walt Disney Company; her great-uncle was that company’s namesake, one of the most important cultural and business figures in American, maybe world, history. Abigail is not a fan. Advertisement Advertisement
Uncle Walt was “hella good at making films and his work has made billions of people happy,” Disney conceded in a 2014 Facebook post, but, c’mon, he was born in 1901 and died more than a half century ago and didn’t have the enlightened views of whenever I happen to tweet this so Meryl Streep was right to call him racist and sexist. Granddad Roy was somewhat better, Abigail told The Cut last month, because he “gave us money directly, which was great because I never had to go to my parents and ask for anything.” Which would have been awful, since dad “lost his way in life” when he, Michael Eisner, and Jeffrey Katzenberg revolutionized Hollywood and made Abigail and a lot of other people incredibly rich, and mom “was somebody who really liked having nice things,” for Heaven’s sakes, “like Chanel suits.” Nowadays it’s Robert Iger, Disney’s chairman and CEO, who’s gotten under Abigail’s skin.
“I like Bob Iger,” she wrote in a Twitter rant this week. “I do NOT speak for my family but only for myself.” And she has nothing to do with the company other than holding shares “(not that many).” But Iger’s compensation in 2018 of $65.6 million is “insane.” Someone has to “speak out about the naked indecency” of it all, she wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post , a newspaper owned by the richest man on Earth. The Trump tax cuts are to blame. Yes, Disney is raising its minimum wage, and gave more than half of its 200,000 employees a $1,000 bonus last year. But it has spent billions more on stock buybacks to — ohmigod — “enrich its shareholders.” And among those shareholders are such undeserving folk as Vanguard and the New York State Common Retirement Fund and CALPERS. Did the retired teacher in Bakersville produce the Emmy award–winning documentary Pray the Devil Back to Hell ? I didn’t think so. Abigail did, so talk to the hand, Mr. Mutual Fund Investor. Advertisement
Abigail Disney’s stand for the proletariat is absurd and self-righteous. There is, for starters, the fact that everyone involved in this psychodrama — from Disney to Iger to the owner of the Washington Post — is a super-affluent liberal. Everyone, that is, but many Disney employees, who are not an undifferentiated mass of drones but men and women with a diversity of political views, economic circumstances, work schedules, skill sets, and personal ambitions. Some of them probably liked their tax cut and bonus — and profited from the buybacks as individual shareholders. Advertisement
Iger is a great chief executive. He has brought Marvel, Star Wars, and 20th Century Fox into the Disney fold, while maintaining quality and preparing a streaming service that will compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime. He’s just about doubled the global revenues of the company, from $34 billion in 2006 to $59 billion in 2018. Disney had more than a quarter of the total domestic box office in 2018, almost twice as much as its closest competitor. Abigail admits that Iger and his lieutenants “have led the company brilliantly.” So what’s her problem? It’s that the world doesn’t conform to her subjective vision of social justice. And since she’s a Disney heiress known only for criticizing her family’s company — sorry, Fork Films is not yet a household name — the media can’t resist giving her publicity. It’s the ultimate man-bites-mouse story. Advertisement
Here’s where things get complicated. In all likelihood — it’s hard because we don’t have precise data — Abigail Disney is wealthier than Bob Iger. His net worth is estimated at $350 million, but Disney may very well be worth much more. She’s kicking down. “I could be a billionaire if I wanted to be a billionaire,” she told The Cut , “and I’m not because I don’t want to be a billionaire.” And this is supposed us to make us feel . . . what, exactly? Sorry for her? Proud? Even if she were $250 million away from the nine-zero club, she’d still be twice as rich as the man she’s being celebrated for spitting on in print. It wasn’t the board that compensated Abigail. Why would it, she didn’t do anything. It was luck. And yet she isn’t using her platform to call for an inheritance tax. Odd.
According to Inside Philanthropy, the Robert Iger and Willow Bay Foundation has assets of $100 million and recently provided $1 million in grants. Presumably the foundation will ramp up its activity after Iger retires. He’s already closing in on Disney’s rate of giving. “I’ve given away in the range of $70 million in the last 30 years,” Disney told The Cut , for an average of a little more than $2 million a year. Which doesn’t strike me as all that much for someone as woke as she. That’s why it’s called virtue signaling.
What sacrifices has Abigail Disney made, other than denying herself billionaire status? About 20 years ago:
I had to fly out to California for a meeting but I had to get back to New York by the next morning for a conference. And the guy who ran our family’s company put me on the 737 alone. I flew across the country overnight, by myself on that giant plane, and I was sitting there thinking about the carbon footprint and the number of flight attendants and the other pilot on-call and what it was costing, and I just wanted to be sick.
No more private jets for Abby!
Around the same time, she joined the board of the New York Women’s Foundation.
I remember this wonderful Korean lady came over for a meeting at my house, and the next day she called me and she said, ‘You didn’t offer me a glass of water.’ And that never crossed my mind, but I have to be conscious of the fact that people who come into my home are coming into a place that feels daunting and intimidating [where does she live, Arendelle Castle? Ed.], and I need to go the extra mile to make them feel welcome. . . . Just like I watched my father increasingly surround himself with yes men, I started to deliberately surround myself with no ladies.
Sorry, Bob, but you’re going to have give up your bonus because 27 years ago a “wonderful Korean lady” made Abigail feel bad.
Reading the interview with The Cut , her op-ed in the Post , and her over-the-top Twitter feed makes you understand why Disney insists she doesn’t speak for the rest of her family. I wouldn’t want her to speak for mine. Advertisement"

2015 —Federal district judge Jon S. Tigar denies the state of California’s request for a stay, pending appeal, of his preliminary injunction ordering the state (supposedly pursuant to the Eighth Amendment) to provide prisoner Jeffrey Norsworthy “sex reassignment surgery as promptly as possible.”
Tigar agrees that the state’s appeal raises a serious legal question but he concludes that the state can’t show irreparable injury from denial of the stay. Never mind that, if the mutilation-as-surgery goes forward, the state will never be able to recover the costs of surgery that it incurs. Tigar’s denial of the stay is evidently designed to render the matter moot—what relief could the state obtain post-surgery?—and thus immunize his own ruling from appellate review. Advertisement
A Ninth Circuit panel will promptly issue an order staying Tigar’s injunction pending appeal. But one day before oral argument on the Ninth Circuit appeal, the state will release Norsworthy on parole. Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "
Understanding the News: Lessons from Literature | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Graham Hillard,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/what-literature-can-teach-us-about-the-news/,"About Graham Hillard April 27, 2019 5:30 AM A visitor looks at a model of the RMS Titanic during an exhibition at Belfast’s City Hall in 2002. (Paul McErlane/Reuters) Between us and the truth lie layers of interpretation based on ‘preformed images.’
I n David Mitchell’s enthralling 2004 novel Cloud Atlas , the author considers how quickly “an event well known to collective history, such as the sinking of the Titanic ,” can become shrouded in an impenetrable fog of mythology. The reason? “The disaster as it actually occurred descends into obscurity as its eyewitnesses die off, documents perish,” and “the wreck of the ship dissolves in its Atlantic grave.” Soon enough, Mitchell contends, all that remains is “a virtual sinking of the Titanic , created from reworked memories, papers, hearsay, fiction.” As a consequence of this evolution, history in any real sense is undiscoverable, abstruse, hovering always just beyond the reach of the present. And thus is the reader introduced to one of the central assertions of postmodernism. Advertisement
Or should I say re introduced? Dotting contemporary literature like archipelagos on a nautical chart are moments of strikingly similar reflection, all sharing the conclusion that the past’s complexity is too great for the human mind to comprehend — that it can be consumed only in small, easily digestible bites, none of which give the full flavor of the meal. For W. G. Sebald, the German master whose Austerlitz won the 2001 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, such morsels often take the form of cliché, as when epic military engagements are summed up “in the ridiculous phrase, ‘The fortunes of battle swayed this way and that.’” Sebald’s argument, which anticipates Mitchell’s, is that any attempt to “reproduce the reality” of the past inevitably runs up against our tendency to rely on “preformed images”: useful but insufficient mental snapshots (think of the beautiful but static Gettysburg Diorama) that ultimately crowd out any comprehensive understanding.
In part, our impoverished view of the past is due to nothing more complicated than the limitations of our memories, which, as Marilynne Robinson argues in Housekeeping (1980), are “by their nature fragmented, isolated, and arbitrary as glimpses one has at night through lighted windows.” Yet there is something else at work, too, in our failure. “What we . . . refer to confidently as memory,” William Maxwell writes in So Long, See You Tomorrow (1980), “is really a form of storytelling that goes on continually in the mind and often changes with the telling.” As a result, Maxwell wryly suggests, “in talking about the past we lie with every breath we draw.” Advertisement
What these and similar passages in contemporary fiction have in common is the debt that they owe to Roland Barthes, the French philosopher and critic whom English majors have been pretending to read for at least five decades. Barthes is most famous for “The Death of the Author,” of course, but far more compelling today is his 1957 essay “The Brain of Einstein,” in which Barthes asks the reader to recall the famous formula E = mc² and to consider that equation’s rendering in popular imagery. “ Photographs of Einstein,” Barthes writes, “show him standing next to a blackboard covered with mathematical signs of obvious complexity; but cartoons of Einstein . . . show him chalk still in hand, and having just written on an empty blackboard, as if without preparation, the magic formula of the world.”
Why the visual shorthand? Because Einstein cartoons are mythology rather than history, and “through the mythology of Einstein,” one of the greatest intellectual feats ever undertaken by a human being can be “reduced to a formula.” Eventually, Barthes’ readers understand, that equation will be all that remains of Einstein’s three-quarters of a century on this planet. A full rendering of his life will be left to the biographers, and even they will flub it. How could they not? In the end, the past eludes us all. Advertisement Advertisement
That this truism contains lessons for present-day American voters is not, I like to think, a particularly outlandish assertion. What it means for us as consumers of the daily news cycle, for example, is that a great deal of humility is called for. How many of our most confident memories are flawed? Or based on unsubstantiated media assertions that were bias-driven in the first place? How much of the present do we contextualize with a poorly constructed sense of the past? Re-reading Christopher Hitchens’s contributions to The Weekly Standard last weekend (on Easter Sunday, no less), I was startled to find among his essays a full-throated defense of Tony Blair, who is now remembered, at least in this country, as the compliant lapdog of a warmongering president. Yet “so far from being an American ‘poodle,’ as his taunting and ignorant foes like to sneer,” Hitchens writes, “Blair had in fact leaned on [Bill] Clinton over Kosovo and was insisting on the importance of Iraq while George Bush was still an isolationist governor of Texas.” Is there room in the popular imagination for the mitigating facts to which Hitchens points? No, there isn’t. The damage is done, and Blair’s reputation is now preserved in amber.
If the past is ultimately unknowable, then so, too, is the hopelessly complicated present — especially in this age in which the superabundance of information at our disposal is the very enemy of clarity. As an example, readers need only consider the undying saga of the president’s behavior during the Russia probe. We, the average citizens of this nation, are separated from what actually occurred by an uncrossable divide. On one side are events as they really unfolded. On the other is the curious public, able to gaze across only by peering through a series of darkened veils. Between us and the truth lies what the participants told Robert Mueller, what Mueller wrote in his report, what the attorney general said in his summary, how the media covered both documents, and how we as individuals inevitably view that coverage through our respective partisan lenses — a game of Telephone so convoluted that no one even needed to lie to obfuscate the facts. Americans could erase a few of those layers by reading the Mueller report for themselves, of course, but how many of us will actually do so before drawing conclusions? My guess is that the number is low indeed. Advertisement"
Joe Biden Campaign Launch Video: Weaponized Clichés | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/joe-biden-campaign-launch-video-cliches/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter April 27, 2019 12:34 PM
I thought Joe Biden’s announcement video was interesting. Not for anything intrinsically of note in the content. The central theme was that “America is an idea,” one of the most thoughtless tropes in American life. In keeping with this, much of the rest of the brief video was clichéd, lowest-common-denominator American political rhetoric. But in the current environment, this pitch acquires greater political charge than usual. Both because Trump rarely talks in these terms (and Biden was openly targeting him, of course) and because the Left has a much darker view of America as a place of systemic class and racial bias. So Biden wasn’t just explicitly contrasting himself to Trump but implicitly contrasting himself to his own party’s left."

(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)
Indianapolis, Ind. – A long-simmering dispute between NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre and now-departing NRA president Oliver North exploded into the open Friday night, as the NRA’s Board of Directors suddenly forced to confront public accusations and counter-accusations of financial mismanagement, attempts at extortion, and unjustifiable expenditures by their primary public relations firm. By Saturday morning, it was clear who won.
This morning, at the NRA’s public meeting of members, member Richard Childress read a letter from North announcing he would not seek another term as the NRA’s president. His term ends Monday.
The NRA is currently suing their public relations firm, Ackerman McQueen, over access to documents detailing how the firm spent the NRA’s money. In recent years, NRA board members grew increasingly concerned about whether they were getting their money’s worth from their long time advertising and PR firm; according to financial documents cited in The New Yorker , the NRA paid Ackerman McQueen just under $41 million in 2017.
Further complicating the matter is that North has a contract with Ackerman McQueen to produce a television series “Oliver North’s American Heroes.” LaPierre accuses North of attempting to oust him in order to protect Ackerman McQueen. Advertisement
North had sent a letter to the NRA board contending that the NRA had paid for, through a vendor, more than $200,000 of wardrobe purchases by LaPierre, according to the Wall Street Journal . LaPierre responded with his own letter, contending North had threatened to disclose embarrassing information about him and the organization, and that others within the NRA had communicated that the embarrassing information wouldn’t be disclosed if the NRA dropped the lawsuit against Ackerman. Advertisement
North was not at the public NRA member’s meeting this morning ; LaPierre was. Childress read a letter from North, citing recent reports in the New York Times and The New Yorker about financial improprieties and declaring, “if true, the NRA’s nonprofit status is threatened.”
“There’s some housekeeping that needs to be taken care of,” Childress said after reading North’s letter. But then the meeting shifted to the traditional recognition of the youngest and oldest lifetime NRA members in attendance and the usual, noncontroversial business. Advertisement
The NRA board is in Indianapolis for its annual meeting this weekend, and will formally meet in private Monday, although there are rumors that the board may meet behind closed doors before then. As of this writing, few have any clear sense of whether the NRA’s relationship with Ackerman McQueen will continue. Giant posters of LaPierre and North are still hanging all around the Indianapolis Convention Center. Advertisement
The dispute may seem like inside baseball, but the ramifications could be serious. The NRA is incorporated in New York state, and state attorney general Letitia James has “ repeatedly threatened to investigate the tax-exempt status of the organization .” Most states give their attorney generals broad authority to investigate the finances of nonprofit organizations and New York is no exception. James’ predecessor, Barbara Underwood, pursued allegations of financial impropriety at the Trump Foundation and in December, the Trump Foundation agreed to dissolve and distribute its remaining assets to other charities.
Nor does the NRA have a simple option of dissolving its charter in New York and then reopening in another state with a less hostile state attorney general. New York state regulators would have to approve the move, and they are unlikely to simply sign off on an organization under investigation closing up shop and moving to another state. Advertisement
Shortly before getting elected, James argued , “The NRA holds [itself] out as a charitable organization, but in fact, [it] really [is] a terrorist organization.” Under normal circumstances, an accused organization’s best defense may be that the state official seeking to investigate them has already made comments like this, suggesting a political vendetta. But persuasively arguing that the whole investigation is driven by politics is more difficult when the organization’s own leadership is trading letters accusing each other of inappropriate expenditures.
As noted yesterday , the NRA played a key role in driving turnout of pro-Trump women in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa. The Trump team must be hoping that the NRA is operating on all cylinders in 2020 – and not hindered by expensive and embarrassing litigation.
UPDATE: Later in the meeting, Wayne LaPierre discussed the NRA’s lawsuit against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, charging that the governor and top members of his administration abused their authority over banks and financial institutions to discourage the banks from doing business with the NRA. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the NRA’s position , contending “targeting a nonprofit advocacy group and seeking to deny it financial services because it promotes a lawful activity violates the First Amendment.” Advertisement"

Anita Hill wants Joe Biden to apologize. While he’s thinking about it, I hope he considers sending one to Justice Thomas, for what Thomas courageously described as “a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas,” and “a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you.​” And another one to Judge Bork, whose confirmation hearing questions seem even more cartoonish today than they did then. But don’t stop there! Biden should also apologize to Justice Kavanaugh, for planting the seeds for the smear campaign the now-justice would later endure. Advertisement Advertisement
All of this is a reminder of just how important 2020 will be in terms of shaping the future of the judicial branch.
Since Inauguration Day, President Trump has made a major impact on the federal judiciary—arguably the crowning achievement of his administration to date. In addition to appointing two Supreme Court justices in his first two years in office, the President—supported by the extraordinary leadership of Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Chuck Grassley—named a record-setting 30 judges to the federal courts of appeals. And since January, the Senate has confirmed seven additional court of appeals judges, totaling 37 to date. No other president has come close that number so early in an administration.
These 37 judges total approximately 21% of the 179 authorized active court of appeals judges across the country. Currently there are ten circuit court vacancies, five of which have named nominees: Michael Park (Second), Joseph Bianco (Second), Ken Kiyul Lee (Ninth), Dan Collins (Ninth), and Dan Bress (Ninth). The current court of appeals vacancies without named nominees include two on the Second Circuit (New York and Connecticut), one on the Third Circuit (Pennsylvania), one on the Fifth Circuit (Mississippi), and one on the Ninth Circuit (Oregon). Advertisement
Once these ten seats are filled, President Trump will have nominated approximately 26% of the active federal appellate court judges in the country. Two of these circuits, the Second Circuit and the Third Circuit, will have flipped from majority Democratic-appointed to majority Republican-appointed. Advertisement
But there are even more potential vacancies on the horizon. Approximately 61 of the 179 authorized active circuit court judges are currently eligible to take senior status. Of these 61, 27 were appointed by Republican presidents and 34 were appointed by Democratic presidents. As my NRO colleague Ed Whelan recently explained in detail, a new vacancy is created when an active judge takes senior status (a decision, of course, which is entirely discretionary on the part of the judge).
For myriad reasons, these 61 senior status-eligible judges have opted to continue to remain active for the time being. But inevitably at least some of these judges will assume senior status over the next few years. And this figure does not account for other judges who are close to being eligible to take senior status and will do so before the end of President Trump’s first term. For example, last week Judge Christopher Droney, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit appointed by President Obama, announced that he would be taking senior status on June 30, 2019 after he turns 65. (A judge who is both 65 and who has accumulated at least 15 years of federal judicial service satisfies the so-called “Rule of 80” under 28 U.S.C. 371 .) Advertisement
And many of the 61 and counting currently eligible judges could take senior status in the years after the 2020 election. This means that President Trump’s ability to reshape the federal judiciary in a second term could be even greater than his record-shattering first term. Assuming that just half of the currently eligible court of appeals judges were to assume senior status in a second Trump term and that President Trump was able to successfully fill those vacancies, nearly 45% of authorized active judgeships would be filled by Trump appointees. (And that is to say nothing of any additional Supreme Court vacancies that could arise.) Advertisement
Of course on the flip side, were a Democrat to defeat President Trump in 2020, that individual would be filling the swelling number of potential vacancies. To give a sense of the magnitude of the potential impact, if a Democratic president were instead to fill these 61 potential future vacancies, nearly all of the thirteen federal circuits could soon be controlled by majority Democratic-appointed judges. (And again, that is to say nothing of what could happen to the Supreme Court if vacancies occurred there.) Advertisement
Joe Biden’s renewed profile might be causing division on the left. But, on the right, nothing could do more to remind Republicans that the smear campaigns endured by Bork, Thomas, and Kavanaugh have their roots in a liberal legal agenda that Biden knows all too well. The Democratic playbook has not changed. It’s just gotten older. Carrie Severino is chief counsel and policy director to the Judicial Crisis Network. "
Joe Biden 2020 Campaign: Rest for Chaos-Weary Voters? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/joe-biden-campaign-2020-chaos-weary-voters/,"April 28, 2019 5:30 AM Joe Biden speaks at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, February 16, 2019. (Andreas Gebert) If most Americans are tired and embarrassed with the direction of the country more than they’re angry, the former vice president could benefit.
T hree days before Joe Biden dove back into the deep end of the political pool, a rival, Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), said the terrorist who bombed the 2013 Boston Marathon, and everyone else in America’s prisons, should be allowed to vote, lest the “chipping away” of voting rights leave America “running down a slippery slope.” Such running — to be fair to the faux independent (he caucuses with Senate Democrats; he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination) — does sound dangerous. Advertisement Advertisement
Another Biden rival, California senator Kamala Harris, utilized the sort of verbal fudge that many Democratic presidential candidates resort to when they are terrified that they might be neglecting to stroke some obscure erogenous zone on the party’s progressive base. She initially said Sanders’s idea should be part of a “conversation,” which is basically what she (and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren) said about “reparations” for slavery.
One or more of Biden’s rivals have endorsed, or at least deemed conversation-worthy, many ideas not uppermost in most voters’ minds: socialism, the Green New Deal, packing the Supreme Court, abolishing ICE and the Electoral College, free college, votes for 16-year-olds, “Medicare for All” (and private health insurance for no one), etc. Biden’s campaign slogan should be: “How about a president who doesn’t make the current one look less loony than he is?”
The large progressive component of the Democratic nominating electorate, comfortable in its intellectual silo, seems to have convinced itself of this: Because Donald Trump constantly makes sensible people wince, any Democratic nominee, even one from progressivism’s wilder shores, can win, so no nominee should be (in President John Quincy Adams’s 1825 words) “palsied by the will of our constituents.” (Adams lost the 1828 election to the populist Andrew Jackson, whose portrait adorns the current populist president’s Oval Office.) Advertisement
Biden has already begun the requisite apology grovel whereby Democratic aspirants try to make amends for various violations of progressive orthodoxy. For example, in the 1970s, Biden was critical of court-ordered busing of (other people’s) children to schools outside their neighborhoods, supposedly in order to achieve “desegregation” but actually to engineer a court-desired racial balance. It would be fun if Biden would (he won’t) sweetly ask his rivals if they favor reviving this policy that helped Republicans win four of five presidential elections between 1972 and 1988. Advertisement
Some non-delusional Democrats are thinking, not unreasonably, about how their party might carry Arizona, Georgia, and even Texas, which have eleven, 16, and 38 electoral votes, respectively. (Trump’s electoral-vote margin was 77.) Arizona has not voted Democratic since 1996, but in 2016 Trump defeated Hillary Clinton more narrowly there (3.5 percentage points) than in Ohio (8.1 points). Georgia last voted Democratic in 1992, but Trump defeated Clinton much less handily there (5.1 points) than he did in Missouri (18.6 points). Texas last voted Democratic in 1976, but Trump’s margin over Clinton was smaller there (9 points) than in Iowa (9.4 points). So, which Democrat is more likely than Biden to win one or more of those states? Advertisement
However, first things first: Who is most likely to reacquire the decisive real estate lost in 2016 by a total of 77,744 votes — Wisconsin (22,748), Michigan (10,704), and Pennsylvania (44,292) — out of 13,940,912 votes cast in those states, which have ten, 16, and 20 electoral votes, respectively? Biden, who last lived in Pennsylvania more than half a century ago, has almost worn out the “I am Joe from Scranton” pedal on the organ, but his connection — Delaware is contiguous to Pennsylvania — might be enough to win Pennsylvania, where Trump’s victory margin was 0.7 percent.
Speaking of first things, Biden’s previous forays into Iowa have been dismal (he withdrew in September 1987; in 2008 he received 0.9 percent of the caucus vote), but as marketers of financial services say, “Past performance is not an indicator of future results.” And perhaps candidate congestion will save the Democrats from themselves: If a dozen or more are auctioning themselves to the incandescent progressives, and Biden can hold, say, 20 percent, this might suffice to get him down the road and into the final four.

Impeaching Donald Trump Would Be a Redundant Judgment | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D.

(Carlos Barria/Reuters) Democrats want to impeach Trump for being Trump.
T he Mueller investigation was supposed to be a legal process concerned with crimes. Investigators identified no crimes to charge, and so it has, naturally, become something else: no longer a theory about a criminal conspiracy — only an irritable mood.
An ordeal that had been conducted under the procedures of law in accordance with legal criteria is now an ordeal that is being conducted under the procedures of politics in accordance with political criteria — or, if you prefer, with moral criteria related to Donald Trump’s character. For those who want to see President Trump impeached and who think of impeachment as a fundamentally political process in spite of its mock-trial aspect, that’s just fine. They’ll take their pound of flesh, however it is had. Advertisement Advertisement
The problem with this point of view is that the question of Donald Trump’s personal fitness for office already has been adjudicated as a political matter: That is what happened in the 2016 presidential election. Many critics, myself included, argued that Trump was unfit for the office, both morally and intellectually. We made our arguments, the voters consulted their own consciences, and, weighing these things however it is that voters weigh them, chose Trump. There wasn’t some occult intermediary step in there. That’s how things go in politics: The people behave just as if they had minds of their own! And, sometimes, they get to have their own way.
In terms of Donald Trump’s character and habits, there is practically nothing in the Mueller report — or in the public record since 2016 — that voters did not already know when they elected him. And that is really the fundamental argument against impeaching President Trump: The political judgment called for in an impeachment at this point and in this context properly ought to be understood as beside the point, if we take seriously the democratic assumption that the judgment of the people, rendered in the election, is sovereign. Advertisement
There isn’t some shocking new thing, and, of course, some Democrats have been talking impeachment since before Trump was even sworn in. The Democrats do not propose to impeach Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors, but simply for being Donald Trump. One may sympathize with that, but Donald Trump is the man the voters chose. Advertisement
And that goes to the real issue here: The Democrats cannot accept that they lost an election to Donald Trump. One sympathizes with that, too, but that is what actually happened, for several reasons: Trump focused on two issues — immigration and trade — that speak to a substantial bipartisan plurality with nationalistic and protectionist impulses rarely taken seriously by mainstream figures in either party; his opponent ran an inept campaign and has been questing after power for so long that both she and the voters are exhausted by it; the “elites” and Washingtonians against whom Trump & Co. inveigh were judged, not without some reason, to merit a trip to the woodshed; the so-called war on terror and the financial crisis of 2008–09 have destabilized formerly sturdy political coalitions. And, of course, it was Republicans’ turn.
Which is to say: The Democrats’ talk of impeachment is partly about 2020, but it’s mainly about 2016, and their adolescent psychic need to believe that the presidential election that brought Donald Trump to the White House was illegitimate rather than an opportunity they simply blew. The theory that the election was thrown by Russian trolls posting dank memes on Twitter is hard to take seriously. If we had a list of every voter whose mind was changed in 2016 by an anonymous social-media account with a Cyrillic bio, then disenfranchising those voters would be a good start on improving things for 2020. Alas and alack, we don’t do that sort of thing. But the argument that bot-executed shenanigans nullified democracy in 2016 amounts to the Democrats protesting: “These trolls robbed us of the support of our natural base: morons!” Advertisement
There’s no quality control in social media — and less quality control in ordinary news media than there used to be. Lies, distortions, exaggerations, and pure inventions are going to be out there in the intellectual marketplace, whether they originate in Moscow or in Brooklyn. That’s a real problem, but it doesn’t invalidate the outcome of the 2016 election. Advertisement"

NRA Board of Directors Faces High-Stakes Decisions | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-nras-board-of-directors-faces-big-high-stakes-decisions/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 28, 2019 4:25 PM A banner at the NRA’s annual meeting in Indianapolis shows (from left) CEO Wayne LaPierre, legislative director Chris Cox, and president Oliver North, April 27, 2019. (Bryan Woolston/Reuters)
Indianapolis, Ind. — As the most dramatic National Rifle Association annual meeting approaches its conclusion, the organization’s board of directors is now forced to confront several interconnected problems.
Start with the allegations of “sweetheart deals and opaque financial arrangements.” While NRA members may be instinctively suspicious of reporting coming from The New Yorker , it’s obvious the magazine’s sources are former employees of the NRA and its major public relations and advertising firm, Ackerman McQueen. Some sources offered their criticism on the record. (“Most (NRA) staffers think that Ackerman is too expensive,” Aaron Davis, who spent a decade working in the NRA’s fund-raising department, told me. “They think they’re just using the NRA to make a massive profit.”) The NRA’s recent lawsuit against Ackerman McQueen, demanding access to documents about how the firm is spending its money on behalf on the NRA public relations efforts, indicates that at least some people within the organization think the allegations of financial improprieties and mismanagement are a genuine concern. Advertisement Advertisement
Oliver North is departing as NRA president; his farewell letter indicated that he still feels loyal to the membership but offered an ominous warning. He said that in September 2018 NRA board members and donors expressed concern to him about the amount of money paid to Ackerman McQueen. According to North, they told him they wanted a full accounting, and that they had been rebuffed by the firm repeatedly. “A series of articles in The New Yorker, Wall Street Journal and New York Times alleged financial mismanagement by senior NRA officers. If true, the NRA’s nonprofit status is threatened… There is a clear crisis. It needs to be dealt with immediately and responsibly.” No longer formally connected to the organization, and indicating that he’s been pushed out, he may be eager to publicly offer a version of events deeply unflattering to NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre. But the New Yorker article cited two NRA sources who contended North was paid roughly a million dollars a year through Ackerman, to produce a television show that so far has produced only three episodes . Some may ask whether North was benefitting from the costly relationship with Ackerman that now concerns him so much.
Does Wayne LaPierre stay on as executive vice president? The current mess developed on his watch, and North accused LaPierre of charging more than $200,000 of wardrobe expenses to an NRA vendor. (LaPierre said the expenses covered a period going back 15 years – but that still comes out to $13,333 per year on wardrobe expenses.) Advertisement
The 76-member board will debate LaPierre’s fate when it meets Monday. Suspending or ousting LaPierre would require three-quarters of the board to vote for his removal, according to the NRA’s bylaws , a high bar to clear. But according to those same bylaws, “no vote on removal may be taken unless at least fifteen days notice in writing shall have been given to the officer of the proposed removal and of any charges preferred if the proposed removal is for cause.” The bylaws also require the officer threatened with removal to be “accorded a full hearing and may be represented by counsel.” Advertisement
LaPierre fended off a challenge back in 1997 as well . Judging from the reaction to LaPierre’s remarks at the convention, many of the rank-and-file members who attended still enthusiastically support him, and he enjoys a reservoir of goodwill. Advertisement
One big question the board of directors will have to resolve Monday is who will replace North as the organization’s president. One figure to watch is former congressman Allen West, who told the Washington Free Beacon’s Stephen Gutowski that the NRA needs an “internal audit” and that “ it’s very important that the board reassert more of its control and power based upon the bylaws so that we don’t have any of these, you know, surprises that pop up.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

New York state attorney general Letitia James is probably going to make the impending investigation as lengthy, painful and embarrassing as possible for the NRA. As Tim Mak lays out , the NRA can’t simply dissolve its charter and registration from New York to a state with a friendlier attorney general. The NRA’s board of directors may prefer to enter the investigative phase with new leadership, unconnected to the current allegations. Advertisement
Can the relationship between the NRA and Ackerman McQueen recover? (Considering how LaPierre accuses Ackerman McQueen of trying to oust him, probably not if LaPierre remains as executive vice president.) If the NRA cuts ties to Ackerman, does NRATV disappear entirely? Does the NRA go out and hire a new company to produce programming, or decide to produce it in-house? Advertisement"

No, the dog didn’t eat his drafts. Rather, Tribe grandiosely explains, he has “come to the realization that no treatise, in my sense of that term, can be true to this moment in our constitutional history—to its conflicts, innovations, and complexities.” Advertisement
Among other things, Tribe tells the reader, “[t]here is an emerging realization that the very working materials of American constitutional law may be in the process of changing.” For example, “contemporary developments in Islamic constitutional thought, the windows already opening or soon to be opened to us by the work of the supreme courts of Israel, India and South Africa, and our imminent appreciation of Chinese counterparts—all this may well work a great change in the starting points and sensitivities of American constitutional scholars.” Ah, yes, of course.

New York Times' Anti-Semitic Cartoon -- The Paper's Inadequate ’Apology‘ | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J.

The New York Times International published an obviously anti-Semitic cartoon of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — depicted as a dog wearing a Star of David tag — leading a blind Donald Trump, who is wearing a yarmulke.
The paper has issued a mild apology on its Opinion Twitter feed — where it was soon buried by other posts–saying it “ included anti-Semitic tropes ” (the whole cartoon was one big anti-Semitic trope) that were “ offensive, ” stating passively that it “ was error of judgment to print it, ” and that the New York Times News Service and Syndicate has “ deleted it. ” Advertisement Advertisement

I am sorry, this (sort of) apology is utterly insufficient.

Alabama state representative Matt Fridy has just introduced HB498 , the Alabama Campus Free Speech Act, into the Alabama State House. Fridy is a lawyer who specializes in constitutional law, and is a strong and effective conservative voice in the Alabama State Legislature. His bill draws on model campus free-speech legislation published by Arizona’s Goldwater Institute. (Along with Jim Manley and Jonathan Butcher, I co-authored that model.) This means that in addition to barring restrictive speech codes and so-called free-speech zones, Fridy’s bill also covers discipline for shout-downs and establishes an effective oversight system as well.

Donald Trump & Ralph Northam: Media Distorts Governor’s Abortion & Infanticide Comments | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/what-did-ralph-northam-really-say-about-abortion/,"Follow Alexandra DeSanctis on Twitter April 29, 2019 11:10 AM Virginia Governor Ralph Northam speaks during a news conference at the Governori’s Mansion in Richmond, Va., February 2, 2019. (Jay Paul/Reuters)
Thanks to President Trump’s penchant for keeping a story alive if he thinks it’ll be damaging to Democrats, disgraced Virginia governor Ralph Northam is back under the microscope for comments he made at the end of January about abortion late in pregnancy and medical care for infants.
At a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday night, Trump noted that the state’s Democratic governor Tony Evers “shockingly stated that he will veto legislation that protects Wisconsin babies born alive,” referring to a bill that would require doctors to provide medical care to infants born alive in the course of an attempted abortion procedure. Advertisement Advertisement
Trump then referenced Northam’s comments during a late-January radio interview, in support of a Virginia bill that would’ve made it easier for women to obtain an abortion during the last three months of pregnancy. “The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor,” Trump said at the rally, describing Northam’s remarks. “They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully, and then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby. I don’t think so.”
In his typical fashion, Trump was overstating what Northam had said; the governor never mentioned “executing” babies. Media outlets were quick to accuse the president of “offer[ing] incendiary falsehood on abortion” and to put an unbelievably pleasant spin on Northam’s remarks. Representative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.), meanwhile, called Trump “deranged” and suggested that his comment would cause violence.
But what did the Virginia governor actually say about care for newborn infants — and was Trump’s representation really that off the mark? Advertisement
Let’s recall the context of Northam’s radio interview. In late January, Democratic delegate Kathy Tran proposed a bill to expand abortion rights in Virginia during the last three months of pregnancy. Her legislation would have relaxed existing health exceptions, allowing abortion up until birth if the abortionist agreed that not receiving the procedure would harm a woman’s mental health. During a hearing, Tran stated that the bill would permit a mother to obtain an abortion even during labor. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
In an interview with WTOP the day after that hearing, Northam was asked to explain Tran’s comment and his own support for the bill. Here’s what he said:
When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician — more than one physician, by the way — and it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s non-viable.
If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
Northam didn’t say anything about “executing” infants, but he’s clearly condoning allowing at least some infants to die after birth if they were meant to have been aborted a few minutes earlier. His statement is also built on a false premise: that abortions late in pregnancy happen in cases of “severe deformities.” For one thing, this phrase is often used by supporters of abortion rights as a euphemism for non-fatal conditions such as Down syndrome. For another, his claim is contradicted by data suggesting that most women who seek abortions after viability do so for reasons other than fetal-health complications (or maternal-health complications, for that matter). Advertisement
Northam never backtracked from what he had said during the interview, despite facing intense criticism from conservatives — mitigated, of course, by mainstream sources who ran cover for him and distorted what he had said, much like outlets did again this past weekend. The governor’s spokesperson released a statement at the time essentially doubling down on the initial remarks, insisting that the right to abortion includes, at least in some cases, the right to discuss with a doctor whether it is appropriate to deny medical care to a living newborn infant.

At The New Criterion today, I have a little post on an old question: Do you clap between movements of a symphony, concerto, sonata, or what have you? People have done different things in different periods. And the answer, ultimately, is: It depends.
Boring answer, right? But it’s still true. Advertisement Advertisement
After writing my post, I thought of a scene from long ago. I thought some readers would get a kick out of it. (Not all, of course. Never all.)
The inaugural festivities for 1973 included a concert by the Philadelphia Orchestra, under Eugene Ormandy, at the Kennedy Center. Nixon had a particular love for the “Fabulous Philadelphians” and Ormandy.
Say what you will about Nixon — and there is a lot to say — but isn’t it amazing that a president would have a favorite orchestra? Advertisement
The program consisted of popular classics, including Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony and the Grieg Piano Concerto. (The soloist in the concerto was Van Cliburn.) Sixteen members of the orchestra had asked to be excused from the concert, on anti-Nixon grounds. The orchestra had said, “Nothing doing.” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
That is an interesting story, which I might tell sometime, but my purpose at the moment is: applause.
Okay. I will now quote William Safire in his marvelous memoir, Before the Fall :
Concert-goers know that it is improper to applaud between movements of a symphony or concerto; one is supposed to preserve the mood of the music and withhold applause until the conclusion of the work. But many members of that audience were not experienced in concert-going; they bought tickets because it was the thing to do that night of Inaugural weekend and besides, the President would be there.
At the end of the first movement of Grieg’s Piano Concerto, most of the audience burst into applause for soloist Van Cliburn. From my orchestra seat I craned my neck to see who was doing what in the Presidential box.
John Connally was clapping enthusiastically. Regular concert-goers in the audience knew immediately that he did not know the right thing to do.
Earlier, between movements of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, Vice President Agnew had sat stonily, his hands resting in his lap, ostentatiously not applauding. That, too, was a mistake (and of all things, on the elitist side); though the concert-goers would approve, the majority of the audience that looked around wondered why the Vice President did not join in — didn’t he like the performance?

Beto O'Rourke Proposes $5 Trillion Plan: Less Comprehensive Than Green New Deal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Mccormack,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/beto-orourkes-5-trillion-plan-to-accomplish-only-half-of-the-green-new-deals-main-goal/,"April 29, 2019 12:49 PM Beto O’Rourke speaks at a rally in Los Angeles, Calif., April 27, 2019 (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)
On Monday morning, Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke unveiled a plan calling for “a full mobilization of our democracy and economy” to combat climate change. At the heart of O’Rourke’s plan is a $5 trillion bill and an “enforceable standard that guarantees the United States will achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and be halfway there by 2030.” Advertisement Advertisement
The O’Rourke campaign claims that the candidate’s plan is “in line with the 2050 emissions goal of the Green New Deal,” and several media outlets are repeating that claim.
But the text of the Green New Deal resolution introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (and backed by most Democrats running for president) calls for “meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources” within a decade . As Ocasio-Cortez’s office explained in a fact-sheet about the Green New Deal: “[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] Report said global emissions must be cut by 40-60% by 2030. US is 20% of total emissions. We must get to 0 by 2030 and lead the world in a global Green New Deal.” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
So Ocasio-Cortez called for net-zero emissions in the United States by 2030, and O’Rourke is only claiming he can get the United States halfway there by 2030 by spending $5 trillion and taking no fewer than nine executive actions . (The O’Rourke campaign appears to be confusing the Green New Deal’s global emissions goal with the national goal set for the United States, but the campaign has not responded to an email from National Review requesting comment on this large discrepancy between his plan and the Green New Deal.)

At most colleges and universities, promotion and the achieving of tenure depends far more on research output than it does on the quality of classroom instruction. Consequently, undergrads often complain that their teachers “ phone it in, ” treating the class in a perfunctory manner and hardly ever being available for student questions and concerns. Advertisement Advertisement
The University of North Carolina system is trying to do something about that — or at least trying to create the appearance that it is. In today’s Martin Center article , Anthony Hennen writes about its efforts at improving the quality of teaching.
For one thing, each of the system’s constituent institutions selects one faculty member as its best teacher and that individual receives a cash prize of $12,500. But as Hennen notes, exactly how the selection committees make their selections is unknown. Do they just rely on student evaluations, which are of very dubious value since many students give high scores to faculty who are entertaining and give high grades for little effort and low scores for demanding ones. If the way to get yourself in the running for an award is being popular, that would tend to be counter-productive."

Steven Rattner's Defense of the Federal Reserve | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/steven-rattners-excessive-defense-of-the-federal-reserve/,"April 30, 2019 10:12 AM Steven Rattner attends the Bloomberg Global Business Forum in New York City, September 20, 2017. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)
Steven Rattner makes several valid points, or at least points with which I agree, in this defense of the Federal Reserve from critics on the right and the left. It is true that the Federal Reserve’s reputation for independence serves a useful purpose for the economy — as the markets seemed to underscore a few months ago, when they dropped sharply in response to reports that President Trump wanted to fire Fed chairman Jay Powell. I agree, as well, that the case that the Fed’s interest-rate hike in December was a disastrous mistake is a weak one.
But I think Rattner’s perspective is off in several respects. I’ll quote him and add commentary.
Mr. Trump and his aides base their call for the Fed to lower rates on quiescent inflation, a phenomenon that could well be either aberrational or a new normal. Put me down as generally skeptical of pronouncements of a new normal.
And having come of age as a young Times reporter covering economic policy during a period of rampant inflation, I’m particularly skeptical of declaring inflation dead and buried.
So low inflation is “aberrational,” Rattner concludes. Here are a few reasons for thinking otherwise. First, inflation has generally been in decline for several decades, the last period of high inflation having taken place from roughly 1966 through 1981. Second, inflation has been below the Fed’s own target rate for most of the last decade. Third, neither policymakers nor economists, generally speaking, believe that under normal circumstances it makes sense to attempt to boost economic growth and employment by running a looser monetary policy; many economists and policymakers believed it was a reasonable strategy during Rattner’s young adulthood. Fourth, we have better tools for forecasting future inflation than we did back then, making it less likely that galloping inflation will surprise us. Market expectations of inflation continue to register low.
Regardless, few mainstream economists believe that the interest rate increases to date have impeded the recovery, nor would cutting them materially accelerate growth. . . .
I will assume that he means for “materially” to modify both halves of that sentence. But presumably those economists don’t believe that cutting rates would “materially” increase inflation either. If the effects of small interest-rate changes would also be small, that modest magnitude ought to enter both sides of the evaluation. Rattner is using it in a one-sided way.
Remarkably, [progressives] argue that the Fed was insufficiently aggressive in fighting the 2008 downturn.
Too timid? Really? In unprecedented actions, the Fed kept interest rates close to zero for seven years and engaged in an aggressive bond buying program known as quantitative easing.
Earlier, Rattner called the Fed’s critics “about as wrong as imaginable.” His imagination seems straitened. Low interest rates are not necessarily a sign of monetary laxity, as we should have learned from the Great Depression. Nor is a large (or growing) central-bank balance sheet: Look at Australia, which has had a higher inflation rate and nominal-spending growth rate with a smaller one. "
