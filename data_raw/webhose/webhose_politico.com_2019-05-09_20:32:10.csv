Pelosi: Barr is ‘going off the rails’ -,www.politico.com,KYLE CHENEY,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/pelosi-trusts-mueller-not-barr-1266984,"LEESBURG, Va. — Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Attorney General William Barr was “going off the rails,” citing his public testimony over the past two days that appeared to support President Donald Trump’s claims that his campaign was spied on by the intelligence community in 2016. “How very, very dismaying and disappointing that the chief law enforcement officer of our country is going off the rails,” Pelosi said at the start of Democrats’ annual retreat here.
Story Continued Below
Pelosi’s comments, which followed an Associated Press interview featuring similarly harsh criticism of Barr, followed two days of appearances by the attorney general on Capitol Hill in which he said he wouldn’t provide Congress with an unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report and raised concerns that the government was “spying” on the Trump campaign in 2016.
Pelosi characterized Barr’s actions as an “obstruction of giving the truth to the American people.” She said she had seen no information to suggest inappropriate activity by the nation’s intelligence community against the Trump campaign. Pelosi also expressed dismay at what she said was the insufficient focus of the Justice Department on preventing foreign interference in the next election.
“You would think that every resource in our country would say we want to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Pelosi said.

In the AP interview , the California Democrat also expressed confidence that the public would see the full report from Mueller’s inquiry — not simply the redacted version Barr has said he expects to release next week — and concerns about the attorney general’s handling of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
“He is not the attorney general of Donald Trump. He is the attorney general of the United States,” Pelosi told The AP. “I don’t trust Barr. I trust Mueller.”
Earlier Wednesday, during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing about the Justice Department’s budget, Barr suggested to lawmakers that he was gearing up to investigate the origins of the Mueller investigation. Barr sent a four-page memo to Congress last month to notify lawmakers that the special counsel did not find evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia and did not clearly determine whether the president intended to obstruct justice.
“Spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr said. “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”
The attorney general’s statement heightened partisan tensions ahead of the report’s anticipated release, fueling Democrats’ criticism of Barr for dismissing the possibility of filing charges against the president in his memo despite Mueller’s inconclusive investigation into whether obstruction of justice occurred.

Barr: Mueller turned down offer to review Russia probe findings By KYLE CHENEY and ANDREW DESIDERIO
“AG Barr admitted he had no evidence to support his claim that spying on the Trump campaign ‘did occur,‘“ Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote on Twitter . “AG Barr must retract his statement immediately or produce specific evidence to back it up. Perpetuating conspiracy theories is beneath the office of the Attorney General.”
Schumer‘s comment follows similar criticism lodged by Pelosi; Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee; and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The four Democrats make up half of the so-called Gang of Eight, the select group of lawmakers who receive briefings from the FBI, CIA and national intelligence director on the government‘s most sensitive secrets. They all attended a briefing on assertions that the FBI spied on Trump's campaign last year — and all four came away saying there was no substance to the claim.
At the time, then-Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and then-Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who also attended the briefing, similarly said that their concerns were assuaged and that the FBI had acted appropriately.
The new possibility of looking into the probe’s genesis, however, is certain to please Trump, who has repeatedly called the investigation a “witch hunt” that would never satisfy Democrats.
Pelosi told The AP: “I’ll be satisfied when we have a new president of the United States who is a Democrat.”
The speaker stuck to her position on impeachment, urging those calling for it to wait for the release of Mueller’s final report.
Barr has promised to release a redacted version of the full report early next week, when his team will have had sufficient time to remove top-secret grand jury information and details falling into three other categories that he outlined in his letter. Until then, Pelosi said, it is “not worth it” to seriously pursue impeachment proceedings.
“We will see it,” she said, referring to the full results of the investigation.
Barr has also said he would testify before the Senate and House Judiciary committees on May 1 and May 2 for inquiries about the Mueller probe."

"DeVos refused to bar federal money for guns in schools, but internal memo said she could -",www.politico.com,MICHAEL STRATFORD,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/betsy-devos-block-guns-schools-memo-1342592,"Education Department attorneys said last year that the agency could block states from using federal grants to buy guns for schools, even as claimed she was powerless to do so, according to an internal agency memo released by House Democrats on Wednesday.
The 14-page memo was displayed during a tense back-and-forth between DeVos and a freshman lawmaker and former teacher, Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), during an education committee hearing. It was the first time DeVos has appeared before the panel since Democrats took control of the House.
DeVos announced last year that she would not stand in the way of states that wanted to use federal education grants to buy guns after Democrats implored her to prohibit such purchases. She said at the time that “Congress did not authorize me or the Department to make those decisions.” President Donald Trump had touted the idea of training and arming teachers after 17 people were slain at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.
But on Wednesday, Hayes grilled DeVos over the internal department memo that said the secretary did have the power to bar her agency’s funding from being used to buy guns.
DeVos in response said that federal grants to states for student support services under Title IV of the Every Student Succeeds Act require states decide how to use those funds. “We have totally respected that particular setup,” she said. “We have not advocated for or against.”
Hayes pointed to emails from DeVos’ staff that discuss the decision memo on the department’s interpretation of the law. Democrats on the House Education and Labor Committee released a copy of the memo, which they said they obtained from a “third party source.”
“In light of the contents of this memo, you have the ability to make a decision,” Hayes told DeVos. “Your silence is a decision. You have the authority to say that we cannot use federal funds to arm teachers.” She pressed DeVos on whether she would use that authority.
“This is a matter for states and local communities,” DeVos said.
“You have the authority to do it,” Hayes responded, holding up the memo. “Read your memo.”
DeVos responded: “Congress has the authority to make that decision.”
Liz Hill, a department spokesperson, said that the document “was not a decision memo presented to the secretary and we can’t verify the authenticity of the document.”
She added: “The law is very clear that this issue is for states to decide and the secretary has been very clear she is leaving it to the states.”
An aide to Democrats on the committee pushed back on Hill's comments, saying there is ""no question about the authenticity of the memo,"" noting that it ""is referenced in emails between senior department officials and was given to the committee by a reliable source.""
""Either the secretary failed to consult her legal counsel before claiming she has no authority to prohibit the use of taxpayer money to arm teachers, or she ignored her legal counsel’s conclusion,"" the Democratic committee aide said.
The question of whether DeVos should block states from buying guns was thrust into the spotlight last year when The New York Times reported that the Education Department was weighing a decision on the issue. The department had received requests from Oklahoma and Texas on whether they could use federal funds to train and arm “school marshals.”
Democrats at the time accused DeVos of violating the intent of the federal education grant program, which they said was never meant to help arm teachers or school districts.
Democratic lawmakers sought but failed to include language in an Education Department spending bill last year that would prohibit states and schools from using federal dollars to purchase guns. Rep. Rosa DeLauro , (D-Conn.), the chairwoman of the House appropriations subcommittee overseeing education, has said she plans to renew that fight this year.
Trump administration officials last year sought to downplay that they were making any new decision on the issue, saying they were merely restating existing flexibility that states have to use federal education grants.
But the newly disclosed memo reflects an apparently robust discussion and debate within the Trump Education Department on guns. It says that the Education Department had not previously considered whether it could fund the purchase of firearms in schools and that the relevant federal law was silent on the question.
“If the Secretary were to permit the use of Title IV, Part A funds for the purchase of firearms, it appears that it would be the first time a Federal agency has authorized the purchase of weapons for school personnel without specific statutory authorization,” the memo says. “It is reasonable for the Secretary not to allow this use of funds absent specific Congressional authorization, and it is unlikely that this interpretation would be subject to a successful legal challenge.”
The July 16, 2018 memo, written by Jason Botel, a Trump political appointee, ultimately recommended a “compromise” solution under which the Education Department allowed funds to be “used to train school staff on the use of guns” but prohibited funds from being used to actually purchase guns.
Such a middle ground position, Botel wrote, “would support one necessary component of arming school staff but not expose the Department to the political liability were the funds to be allowed to purchase weapons themselves.”
But someone appears to have selected the most permissive option on guns. The version of the memo released by the committee contains a handwritten “x” next to “YES, funds may be used to purchase firearms for teachers and to train teachers on the use of firearms.” It wasn’t clear who made that marking. The memo was addressed to Kent Talbert, a senior adviser to DeVos.
A set of emails back and forth among DeVos’ advisers that discuss the memo and how they should address the issue of funding guns in schools were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by a coalition of groups that favor tightening federal gun laws.
The coalition, led by Democracy Forward, sued the Education Department last year to turn over those documents. They include the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Federation of Teachers.
“Betsy DeVos can’t hide from the truth any longer, and she can’t keep ducking her responsibility to help keep our schools safe,” Adam Skaggs, the chief counsel at the Giffords Law Center, said in a statement. “The gun violence epidemic has made students afraid to go to school and left parents wondering if they’ll see their children at the end of the day, but Secretary DeVos has just thrown up her hands and said ‘Not my job.’”

City lags on affordable senior housing commitment,www.politico.com,jchadha@politico.com (Janaki Chadha),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/04/10/city-lags-on-affordable-senior-housing-commitment-964050,"The funding commitment — which includes only about $100 million of city capital subsidy, with the rest coming from other sources — won’t be allocated until future fiscal years, a city spokesperson said. | AP Photo City lags on affordable senior housing commitment
Nearly a year after the de Blasio administration announced a $500 million commitment to build housing for low-income seniors, the city has advanced development on only one of six planned sites.
The city announced last June that it would build up to 1,000 affordable senior apartments on underutilized city land. The plan was billed as a new city funding commitment in the annual budget to help address the acute housing need among older New Yorkers. But housing advocates say the city has since walked back on its promise.
Six development sites have been identified — two of them on New York City Housing Authority properties at Kingsborough Houses in Brooklyn and Morris Houses in the Bronx, and four on other city-owned lots. But the city has requested proposals from developers for only one of the sites, and plans to do so for the rest of the sites over the course of the next year, according to a city spokesperson.
And the funding commitment — which includes only about $100 million of city capital subsidy, with the rest coming from other sources — won’t be allocated until future fiscal years, the spokesperson said. That money will come from the city’s capital budget for the mayor’s affordable housing plan, and the 1,000-unit total will be part of the 30,000-unit senior housing goal the city committed to in 2017.
That’s all news to housing advocates who had pushed the administration to expand funding for affordable senior apartments beyond what is already underway. The Metro Industrial Area Foundation, an affordable housing advocacy group that has lobbied for more senior housing, said it was under the impression that de Blasio was promising additional housing beyond his prior commitment in last year’s budget.
The group argues that by building housing for low-income senior citizens, the city can free up multi-bedroom apartments that individual seniors occupy in the public housing developments, which have long waiting lists.
“We feel a sense of betrayal,” said Rev. David Brawley, a member of Metro IAF and pastor of the St. Paul Community Baptist Church in East New York. “There was no ambiguity last June, when the mayor shook our hand at a press conference on the steps of City Hall.”
Indeed, at that June 12 rally, Council Speaker Corey Johnson praised Mayor Bill de Blasio for the funding commitment, saying, “There are not many things in the city’s budget, in the capital budget, at $500 million.”
A public schedule for the mayor, who was also in attendance, called the event “a rally celebrating senior affordable housing in the budget.”
City Comptroller Scott Stringer wrote a letter to the mayor last month, requesting budget line items and other details on the status of the funding.
“Development of public land is a key strategy, but one that requires extensive community engagement and public review, which is why we are working on multiple fronts to create as much housing as possible for our city’s seniors,” city spokesperson Jane Meyer said in a statement. She said the administration has financed more than 7,000 low-cost apartments for seniors since de Blasio took office.
Meanwhile, a 2016 study from the advocacy group Live On New York projected more than 200,000 low-income seniors are on waiting lists.
“The construction of senior affordable housing is happening too slow, it’s too little and for a whole generation of New Yorkers who are wanting to keep living in this city, it’s too late,” Brawley said."
Pork group scraps big trade event over African swine fever fears,www.politico.com,RYAN MCCRIMMON,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/world-pork-expo-swine-fever-1266725,"The National Pork Producers Council canceled its 2019 World Pork Expo over fears of African swine fever, a deadly hog disease that's spreading in China.
African swine fever isn't dangerous to humans, but the NPPC said it would cancel its annual trade show in Des Moines, Iowa, to avoid the risk of the disease spreading to the U.S. pig population at a time when the sector is already facing economic challenges as a result of tariffs. The June event hosts around 20,000 visitors over three days, including exhibitors from “ASF-positive regions,” such as China, according to statement from the group.
""While an evaluation by veterinarians and other third-party experts concluded negligible risk associated with holding the event, we have decided to exercise extreme caution,"" NPPC President David Herring said in the statement.
He added that an African swine fever outbreak in the U.S. would ""immediately close our export markets at a time when we are already facing serious trade headwinds.""
Pork producers have gathered in Washington this week to advocate for their legislative priorities, including pushing Congress to provide funding for 600 additional Customs and Border Protection agriculture inspectors to prevent the disease from spreading to the U.S., the group said."
Chrissy Teigen’s message to Dem women: Say ‘f–- you’ more,www.politico.com,SARAH FERRIS,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/democrats-retreat-teigen-legend-1267665,"LEESBURG, Va. — In the first day of their three-day policy retreat, Democrats mostly ignored President Donald Trump. Then John Legend and Chrissy Teigen walked on stage.
Story Continued Below
The celebrity couple spoke bluntly on Wednesday night about confronting the Trump presidency — his taxes, his Twitter habits and even his daughter Ivanka Trump.
“Chrissy was ahead of the curve on making fun of Donald Trump. She knew before a lot of people did that he was a joke and a conman and a clown,” Legend said.
The power couple — an award-winning singer and a model-turned-activist — lent their stardom to the House Democrats on the opening night of the caucus' annual getaway from Washington.
The hourlong session, only part of which was open to the press, touched on some of the tougher aspects of newfound fame that’s relatable to dozens of new Democrats in a hypercharged media climate, such as endless social media trolling.

The panel, moderated by political commentator Melissa Harris-Perry, stayed relatively tame as reporters watched.
Legend and Teigen spoke emotionally about Trump’s policies on family separation for immigrants, noting that Teigen’s mother — who was born in Thailand — just earned a perfect score on her citizenship test.
After most of the media was forced to exit, Harris-Perry brought up a familiar refrain by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who tells women that the one word they should use more often is “no.”
Harris-Perry then turned to Teigen and asked her what women should say more.
“F--- you,” Teigen replied to laughter in the room, and Legend began singing part of his latest single, “Preach.”
The couple also gave a shoutout to their hometown congressman, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.). Teigen started raising the roof, shouting “Ted, Ted, Ted.”
Afterward, both Teigen and Legend were swarmed by members, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas.), as they sought selfies near the stage.

Democrats preen for union honchos: Who's most working class? By IAN KULLGREN
Before the power couple’s headline remarks, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick — who recently ruled out challenging Trump in 2020 — delivered a speech that felt like one given by a presidential candidate.
“America cannot be great without being good,” Patrick said repeatedly in an eloquent address that he said was inspired by what he learned from “church ladies in hats” growing up.
He made countless references to Trump — like his use of fear as a political tool — without mentioning his name once, as he urged Democrats to stand proud and “be Democrats.”
""Just as you don't have to hate Republicans to be a good Democrat, leaders don't have to hate the faceless others to be a good leader,” Patrick said."

EU leaders postponed the U.K.'s Brexit deadline to October 31 — but granted Britain the flexibility to leave earlier | European Council
Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print The United Kingdom will remain in the EU — for now, at least.
EU leaders, acting on a request from Prime Minister Theresa May, once again postponed the deadline by which the U.K. would be ejected from the bloc without the protection of a negotiated Withdrawal Agreement, this time setting the date for October 31.
Crucially, however, they granted Britain the flexibility to leave earlier — essentially as soon as the U.K. government can reach a deal among its own warring factions, and parliament ratifies the Withdrawal Agreement. That's the 585-page treaty securing protections for citizens' rights, a financial settlement, and the insurance policy for the Ireland border known as ""the backstop.""
The delay of this Friday's deadline — itself a postponement from the original date of March 29 — averts a potentially catastrophic no-deal departure that both sides had increasingly feared as a path toward mutual disaster.
The decision was reached after a more arduous, and longer than expected debate among EU27 leaders at a summit in Brussels that began Wednesday evening and stretched until 2 a.m. Thursday. While the leaders had agreed ahead of time that an extension was necessary, French President Emmanuel Macron made a fierce argument for only a short postponement, effectively siding with May who had requested a delay until June 30.
""This means an additional six months for the U.K."" — Donald Tusk, European Council president
Heavily outnumbered by other leaders, including Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Macron eventually relented. But he succeeded in reducing the extension to nearly half of the year-long delay that EU officials had envisioned going into their meeting.
""This means an additional six months for the U.K.,"" European Council President Donald Tusk declared at a closing news conference. ""During this time, the course of action will be entirely in the U.K.'s hands. It can still ratify the Withdrawal Agreement, in which case the extension will be terminated. It can also reconsider the whole Brexit strategy. That might lead to changes in the Political Declaration [setting out the future relationship], but not in the Withdrawal Agreement. Until the end of this period, the U.K, will also have the possibility to revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit altogether.""

The indictment , revealed Thursday by the Justice Department and dated March 6, 2018, alleges Assange aided former U.S. intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning with ""cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers"" that contained classified documents and secrets. He is charged with ""conspiracy to commit computer intrusion."" Story Continued Below
""Manning, who had access to the computers in connection with her duties as an intelligence analyst, was using the computers to download classified records to transmit to WikiLeaks,"" DOJ said. ""Cracking the password would have allowed Manning to log on to the computers under a username that did not belong to her. Such a deceptive measure would have made it more difficult for investigators to determine the source of the illegal disclosures.""
The legal team for Manning, who was jailed last month for contempt of court for refusing to testify on WikiLeaks, demanded her release. Her lawyers said Thursday they would file to have the contempt finding vacated in light of the backdated indictment “since her testimony can no longer contribute to a grand jury investigation,” arguing her “detention can no longer be seriously alleged to constitute an attempt to coerce her testimony.”
“The fact that this indictment has existed for over a year underscores what Chelsea’s legal team and Chelsea herself have been saying since she was first issued a subpoena to appear in front of a Federal Grand Jury in the Eastern District of Virginia — that compelling Chelsea to testify would have been duplicative of evidence already in the possession of the grand jury, and was not needed in order for US Attorneys to obtain an indictment of Mr. Assange,” her lawyers said.
London police said they were invited into the embassy by Ecuador’s ambassador after Ecuador withdrew Assange's asylum. Assange had taken refuge in the embassy in 2012 after he was released on bail while facing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations that have since been dropped.

A judge in Westminster Magistrates’ Court found Assange guilty of breaching bail in that case Thursday, and he faces up to 12 months in jail for those charges in addition to an upcoming battle over his extradition. Jennifer Robinson, an attorney for Assange, said that he would be back in court for that within the next month.
And in a press conference after Assange’s first appearance, she threatened that if the extradition attempts were successful, “any journalist can be extradited for prosecution in the United States for having published truthful information about the United States.”
Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks’ editor in chief, said he was skeptical of the charges DOJ chose to use, suggesting they picked “just one element of what they have been working on for years” and decided what to charge him with with the sole aim of getting him back on U.S. soil.
While he noted that the U.S. had not promised there would be no additional charges filed against Assange, the so-called doctrine of specialty in most extradition treaties would make that difficult.
The charges unveiled by DOJ appear to have no direct connection to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller's indictment of Russians for hacking and releasing Democratic emails in 2016 — emails that were later published by WikiLeaks — alluded to Assange but did not name him.
Assange has been under U.S. Justice Department scrutiny for years for WikiLeaks’ role in publishing thousands of government secrets.
Congress has also signaled an interest in Assange. The House Judiciary Committee sought documents from him as part of its sprawling investigation of potential obstruction of justice and abuse of power by President Donald Trump, but Assange declined to cooperate, claiming he should be treated as a journalist and not forced to reveal his information at the outset of a congressional investigation.

The U.S. intelligence community has identified Assange as an outlet for Russian propaganda , but the nature of the charges against him will be closely scrutinized. Assange and his supporters say he had no role in hacking Democratic documents or harvesting other government secrets but simply acted as a publisher and journalist — and that his prosecution would set a dangerous precedent for other journalists.
The ACLU and other press freedom advocatesechoed this concern in statements warning against charging Assange for simply publishing government secrets.
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee last year criticized Trump's campaign for ""ill-advised"" contacts with WikiLeaks — several senior officials on the campaign, including Trump himself, hailed and promoted WikiLeaks' hacked emails. Several Trump associates also attempted to contact Assange throughout the 2016 election.
Assange has been an omnipresent figure in multiple prongs of Mueller’s investigation. In addition to Assange’s unnamed role in the indictment of Russians, longtime Trump associate Roger Stone was charged with lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation into his efforts to communicate with Assange.
Stone publicly bragged in 2016 about being in contact with Assange but later said it was through an intermediary and has denied any advanced knowledge of the hacked materials Assange intended to publish. Trump’s longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, told investigators and lawmakers that he was present for a phone call in July 2016 in which Stone informed Trump that Assange was imminently preparing to publish tranches of Democratic emails.
Assange has also denied that the hacked emails he published in 2016 were from Russia and fueled unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that the emails may have come from a Democratic insider. Trump touted this claim shortly before taking office in a tweet.
“Julian Assange said 'a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta' - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!” Trump tweeted on Jan. 4, 2017.
But Trump distanced himself from Assange and WikiLeaks on Thursday despite repeatedly dumping praise on Assange in the past, telling reporters in the Oval Office that he didn’t have an opinion on what should happen to Assange and was leaving the issue to Attorney General William Barr.
“I know nothing about Wikileaks. It's not my thing. I know there is something having to do with Julian Assange, I have been seeing what has happened with Assange. That will be a determination, I would imagine, mostly by the attorney general, who is doing an excellent job,” Trump said. By REBECCA MORIN
Assange had not come out of the embassy for almost seven years because he feared arrest and extradition to the United States for publishing thousands of classified military and diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks. Although Sweden has dropped the sexual assault case that first led to Assange’s arrest in Britain, U.K. authorities said he would be rearrested if he ever left the embassy because he skipped bail in the original case.
In a statement Thursday, the U.K.’s Home Office confirmed Assange’s arrest was related to an extradition request from the U.S., noting that “he is accused in the United States of America of computer related offences.”
Barry Pollack, one of Assange’s lawyers, demanded “access to proper health care” for Assange, which he said Assange had been denied for seven years.
“Once his health care needs have been addressed, the UK courts will need to resolve what appears to be an unprecedented effort by the United States seeking to extradite a foreign journalist to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information,” he said in a statement.
Assange’s arrest drew mixed reactions, with some coming to his defense and others decrying his publication of thousands of classified U.S. military and diplomatic cables as well as his frequent alignment with and defense of Russia.
Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and other members of his committee railed against Assange and celebrated his arrest.
“Under the guise of transparency, Julian Assange and Wikileaks have effectively acted as an arm of the Russian intelligence services for years,” Burr said in a statement. “Mr. Assange engaged in a conspiracy to steal classified information, putting millions of lives at risk all over the world. Hopefully, he will now face justice.”
Nebraska GOP Sen. Ben Sasse called Assange’s arrest “good news for freedom-loving people” and in a statement derided WikiLeaks as “an outlet for foreign propaganda” and its frontman as an “enemy of the American people.”
“He deserves to spend the rest of his life in an American prison. Assange is no ally to serious journalists or to defenders of free speech,” Sasse continued. “He’s in bed with Vladimir Putin who murders journalists and dissidents.”
And Tom Cotton, the Arkansas senator who was deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2006 to 2009, added that Assange and Manning “endangered the lives of American troops in a time of war.”
He then took a jab at Assange’s confinement inside the Ecuadorian embassy: “Since Assange is used to living inside, I’m sure he’ll be prepared for federal prison.”
Democrats on committees involved in investigating aspects of Mueller's findings -- from Russian links to the Trump campaign to questions about whether Trump attempted to obstruct the investigation -- indicated they may like to hear from Assange if he lands on U.S. soil and can be convinced or compelled to testify.
""We might try,"" said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. ""I’m really most interested in him as a possible assistance in our counterintelligence efforts.
Himes said it's unlikely Assange would cooperate, calling him an ""ideologue"" who might ""decide to be a martyr.""
Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, similarly said he ""could imagine some circumstances"" in which various congressional committees attempt to get information out of Assange. He added that he expects Assange to face legal consequences for his having ""facilitated the use of stolen emails and other materials to allow others to interfere and attack America's presidential elections.""
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a member of the House Oversight Committee, raised questions about the nature of the charges against Assange, noting that they were considered by the Obama administration but ""turned down because it was seen as beyond the pale in terms of impact on journalism and journalists.""
""I’m concerned by that specific aspect very much so in this situation,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.
Jeh Johnson, former President Barack Obama’s Homeland Security secretary for much of the time Assange spent holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy, asserted Thursday that “I do not regard him as a hero.”
In an interview on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” Johnson alluded to the already-revived debate about whether Assange has any protections under the First Amendment, a thorny issue that — for now — DOJ seems to have avoided with its narrow indictment.
“He apparently aided and assisted in the leak of classified information — at some point there may be a debate whether he was a journalist and that was journalist activity,” he said, arguing that the distinctions for what can be considered “legitimate journalist activity and what constitutes a journalist is a more complex question in the age of the internet.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham echoed Johnson’s rejection of Assange as a whistleblower or a victim.
""I’m glad to see the wheels of justice are finally turning when it comes to Julian Assange,” the South Carolina Republican and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee tweeted. “In my book, he has NEVER been a hero. His actions - releasing classified information - put our troops at risk and jeopardized the lives of those who helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan.”
Christophe Deloire, the executive director of the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders implored the U.K. to “stick to a principled stance” and ensure Assange’s protections under local and European law are “relevant to his contributions to journalism.”
“Targeting Assange because of Wikileaks’ provision of information to journalists that was in the public interest would be a punitive measure and would set a dangerous precedent for journalists or their sources that the US may wish to pursue in future,” Deloire warned.
The ACLU similarly raised the alarm about the precedent prosecuting Assangesolely for publishing would set.
“Any prosecution by the United States of Mr. Assange for Wikileaks’ publishing operations would be unprecedented and unconstitutional, and would open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations,” said Ben Wizner, director of the group’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.
“Moreover, prosecuting a foreign publisher for violating U.S. secrecy laws would set an especially dangerous precedent for U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.""
Assange’s legal team continued to lean into that defense.
Pollack argued that “the factual allegations ... boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source” and said the charges should trouble journalists around the world.
Ecuador’s president, Lenin Moreno, said his government made a “sovereign decision” to revoke Assange’s political asylum due to “repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life.” In a sovereign decision Ecuador withdrew the asylum status to Julian Assange after his repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols. #EcuadorSoberano pic.twitter.com/pZsDsYNI0B — Lenín Moreno (@Lenin) April 11, 2019
“Today I announce that that the discourteous and aggressive behavior of Mr. Julian Assange, the hostile and threatening declarations of its allied organization, against Ecuador, and especially the transgression of international treaties, have led the situation to a point where the asylum of Mr. Assange is unsustainable and no longer viable,” Moreno said in a video released on Twitter.
Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, applauded the Ecuadorian government for yanking Assange’s asylum protection “so that he can finally face justice for his actions.” However, Warner did not refer to the charges unsealed against Assange Thursday, instead condemning WikiLeaks’ actions during the 2016 election.
“Unfortunately, whatever his intentions when he started WikiLeaks, what he’s really become is a direct participant in Russian efforts to undermine the West and a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security,” he said.
Video posted online by Ruptly, a news service of Russia Today, showed several men in suits carrying Assange out of the embassy building and loading him into a police van while uniformed British police officers formed a passageway. Assange sported a full beard and slicked-back grey hair.
Pollack called Ecuador’s treatment of Assange “bitterly disappointing.”
His apprehension also caught the attention of the Kremlin, who weighed in later Thursday on his arrest.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday the way Assange was treated gave “the full impression of an open and rude disregard for the human dignity of the arrested.”
Zakharova added that Moscow hopes “all the rights of Julian Assange will be respected.”
Edward Snowden, who like Assange is a whistleblower and a fugitive and who is holed up in Russia to avoid prosecution in the U.S., also came to Assange's defense.
In a series of tweets, Snowden referred to Assange as a ""publisher of--like it or not--award-winning journalism"" and speculated that images of Assange being “dragged” out of the embassy ""are going to end up in the history books.""
""Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom,"" he wrote.
WikiLeaks quickly drew attention to U.S. interest in Assange.
“Powerful actors, including CIA, are engaged in a sophisticated effort to de-humanise, de-legitimize and imprison him,” the organization said in a tweet over a photo of Assange’s smiling face.
London’s Metropolitan Police Service said Assange was taken into “custody at a central London police station where he will remain, before being presented before Westminster Magistrates’ Court as soon as is possible.”
His arrest came a day after WikiLeaks accused Ecuador’s government of an “extensive spying operation” against Assange.
WikiLeaks claims that meetings with lawyers and a doctor inside the embassy over the past year were secretly filmed.
WikiLeaks said in a tweeted statement that Ecuador illegally terminated Assange’s political asylum “in violation of international law.”
Robinson, the Assange attorney, said her client felt justified in his paranoia. “I have just been with Mr. Assange in the police cells,” she told reporters outside of the court. “He wants to thank all of his supporters for their ongoing support, and he said ‘I told you so.’”

"It’s the Sexism, Stupid Magazine",www.politico.com,Peter Canellos,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/11/its-the-sexism-stupid-226620,"If 2018 was supposed to be the Year of the Woman, when women were elected to Congress in record numbers, what is 2019? So far, at least in politics, it’s proving to be the Year of the White Guy.
Story Continued Below
Two white male presidential candidates—Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders—have led the Democratic field from the start, and two others—Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg—have basked in glowing coverage. Meanwhile, experienced female rivals—Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren—haven’t generated nearly the same media buzz , or led any recent polls .
What’s going on here? The evidence is mounting that these patterns are the work of sexism and misogyny—albeit often unconscious, unwitting and the result of implicit bias.
Even before the 2016 election, when Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, the first female nominee of a major party in American history, amid deafening campaign-trail chants of “Lock Her Up,” there were plenty of signs that female presidential candidates face unique obstacles.
In their 2008 article, “Subtle Sexism? Examining Vote Preferences When Women Run Against Men for the Presidency,” authors David Paul and Jessi L. Smith showed that gender is a powerful force in inducing voters to defect across party lines. Specifically, when men and women were pitted against each other in head-to-head match-ups for the presidency, a substantial proportion of Democratic voters (12.3 percent) defected to a male Republican, John McCain, rather than vote for a female candidate from their own party, Hillary Clinton.
Similarly, and arguably somewhat less surprisingly, a sizeable proportion of Republican voters (15.5 percent) defected to a male Democrat, John Edwards, rather than vote for a female candidate from their own party, Elizabeth Dole. (This tendency was true for both male and, notably, female voters, and was not balanced out by any comparable pattern of defection toward female presidential hopefuls.) Female candidates were also held to be less qualified than male candidates with similar credentials. Moreover, male candidates beat female candidates in every single match-up.
One of the reasons why this study was so suggestive is that it polled likely voters from Ohio about real-life presidential hopefuls, rather than merely hypothetical candidates: John McCain, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani, Elizabeth Dole and Hillary Clinton. It therefore provided an ominous clue as to what fate might befall women who ran for president.
An inevitable limitation of the study, however, was that it looked at only a small range of politicians, which limited the analyses of primary match-ups in particular (to John Edwards vs. Hillary Clinton, and Rudy Giuliani vs. Elizabeth Dole). All of the politicians in the study were also white, it should be noted (at the time the poll was taken, in 2006, future president Barack Obama had no real national following).
There’s also the fraught question of whether Hillary Clinton was an inherently problematic candidate and therefore not the ideal test case for how gender bias affects voters. As she faced surprising losses in the 2008 presidential primary campaign and the 2016 presidential election, reasonable people may disagree about the extent to which this was due to unique features of her profile, policies and history.
With an all-male cast of Democratic candidates soaking up most of the oxygen and posting better polling numbers, there is now more evidence to suggest that gender bias is a real problem for female candidates.
At the same time, other evidence suggests that female candidates may not be at a significant disadvantage in lower-level races. Indeed, Smith and Paul didn’t find significant evidence of gender bias in operation even in primary match-ups (though this result is highly limited, given they compared only the two aforementioned pairings). This finding coheres with the hopeful results we saw in the 2018 election, when an unprecedented number of female members of Congress were elected. But it also leaves open the question of how well women will fare when it comes to the highest profile race of all: the presidential election.
Why might presidential races be different? One plausible theory is that in seeking the Oval Office women are competing less for a service position and more for a position of perceived power and authority—indeed, virtually the most masculine-coded authority position imaginable.
Many voters may implicitly regard the presidency as men’s birthright, something to which they are entitled . That could go doubly for white men—witness Cory Booker’s lackluster polling and fundraising numbers (given the case for thinking of Barack Obama as a uniquely charismatic figure, and something of an anomaly). So a woman might be at a particular disadvantage when running for the presidency as compared with her white male counterparts. And men, at least white men, may gain an illicit boost from running against women.
This hypothesis is borne out by a 2004 study by Madeline Heilman et al, “Penalties for Success: Reactions to Women Who Succeed at Male Gender-Typed Tasks.” The researchers had participants evaluate a hypothetical male versus female employee, who held the same position (Assistant Vice President) at an aircraft company. The participants received exactly the same information about each of the employees, on average, by alternating the names “James” and “Andrea” on each of their two personnel files. The results? When information about their competence was equivocal, Andrea was found to be less competent than James by 86 percent of people—but the two were found to be equally likable, on average. When given unequivocal information that they were equally competent, however, Andrea was held to be less likable than James, by 83 percent of participants. So people (male and female alike) effectively tended to subject the woman to a powerful “double bind”—holding her to be comparatively incompetent, until proven otherwise, and then rejecting a demonstrably competent version of her as unlikable. Researchers described this effect as “dramatic.” We may be seeing a similar pattern borne out, in the wild, when it comes to presidential races.
There’s an apparently rival hypothesis well worth considering: Voters are wary of female candidates because Hillary Clinton lost in two presidential races (first in the primary, then in the general). And indeed, Smith and Paul note evidence in their discussion of what appears to be a common sentiment: “ I’d vote for a woman! I’m just not sure America is ready for one—so I won’t.” In other words, I’m not biased, but they might be, so I ought to vote for a man . (Smith and Paul wrote that, at the time: “Although some polls indicate that 81 percent of Americans would personally vote for a qualified woman candidate from their party, other [2005] polls imply that nearly one‐third of Americans believe their ‘neighbors‘ are unwilling to vote for a woman.”)
This hypothesis assumes the prevalence of a certain kind of voter: Someone convinced that sexism and misogyny play a large role in elections, yet who responds not by doubling down on their efforts to support and bolster female candidates, but by voting for a male rival. Picture someone who responds with pragmatic defeatism to injustice before the race is even well underway. How common is this person, really?
It is difficult to know. But there is a simpler explanation that both explains the patterns we see and coheres with what we know about human psychology: People who might be explicitly committed to egalitarianism still have gender biases in certain contexts, including presidential races. And they are unwitting experts at concocting post hoc rationalizations for foregone, irrational conclusions.
The idea that you aren’t voting for a woman not because you don’t want to, but because America just isn’t ready for a female candidate smacks to me of that kind of thinking. Perhaps America isn’t ready because you’re one of the many who prefers male to female candidates, and who unconsciously reaches for excuses to rationalize your preference. This country will never be ready for a woman president, to our detriment, if this continues."
Assange arrested in London as Mueller report looms,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/04/11/assange-arrested-in-london-as-mueller-report-looms-423575,"Julian Assange's arrest could scramble traditional political fault lines in Washington. | Oli Scarff/Getty Images BREAKING … “WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange Is Arrested in London,” by NYT’s Richard Pérez-Peña: “Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who released reams of secret documents that embarrassed the United States government, was taken into police custody on Thursday after being evicted from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has lived for almost seven years.
“The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that Mr. Assange had been arrested by officers at the embassy on a warrant issued by Westminster Magistrates’ Court in 2012, for failing to surrender to the court.” NYT … Video of his arrest
-- Quick thought: Assange's arrest suggests that the arm of the Russia probe is long indeed. It also could scramble traditional political fault lines in Washington. In the Obama days, it was the left that defended the WikiLeaks enterprise, but many Democrats had soured on Assange by the 2016 campaign -- and then they came to despise him. Meanwhile, some on the right like Fox News host Sean Hannity and candidate Donald Trump became his biggest fans. What will they say now?

You can fire the attorney general. You can hire a new attorney general who talks about how biased he is against the investigation.

BANNON HANDICAPS 2020 -- Our own Ben Schreckinger spent two hours with Steve Bannon on Tuesday night. The former White House chief strategist and Trump campaign CEO had a lot to say about the 2020 presidential race:
On the Democrats: “Every other day I see another person jumping into the race. I think those people are rational and the people around them are rational. They must see something in the field that makes them feel like they can make a run. … I don’t see anybody in that field as of now who can take on Trump one-on-one.”
On beating Trump: “You’re not going to beat Trump with policies, right? … Elizabeth Warren has an incredibly detailed and probably the most well thought-through set of policy prescriptions, and they keep coming every day. She’s at, what, 7%, 8%?”
On Dems drafting Hillary Clinton in 2020: “If they don’t think that they’ve got somebody that can beat him, the vampire is going to be in the bullpen. She did get 63 million votes.”
On what the president will do if he wins: “You’re going to get pure Trump off the chain. Four years of Donald Trump in payback mode.”
On Ted Cruz’s facial hair: “If he had that beard [in 2016], he might have taken Trump all the way to the convention. The beard’s badass.”

TALKER -- “It’s the Sexism, Stupid,” by Kate Manne in POLITICO Magazine : “Two white male presidential candidates — Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders — have led the Democratic field from the start, and two others — Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg — have basked in glowing coverage. Meanwhile, experienced female rivals — Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren — haven’t generated nearly the same media buzz, or led any recent polls.
“What’s going on here? The evidence is mounting that these patterns are the work of sexism and misogyny — albeit often unconscious, unwitting and the result of implicit bias.”
MEDIAWATCH -- “National Enquirer expected to be sold imminently as parent company faces pressure,” by WaPo’s Sarah Ellison and Marc Fisher: “American Media Inc. is actively seeking to sell off the National Enquirer, according to three people familiar with the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The decision to sell came after the hedge fund manager whose firm controls American Media became ‘disgusted’ with the Enquirer’s reporting tactics, according to one of these people. …
“In August, just as AMI and two of its top officers were finalizing a non-prosecution agreement with federal investigators, the company’s board of directors started looking for ways to unload the tabloid business ‘because they didn’t want to deal with hassles like this anymore,’ another person said.” WaPo
-- Amazon.com founder and WaPo owner Jeff Bezos is expected to meet with federal prosecutors about claims that his electronic devices were hacked. CNN’s Erica Orden and Shimon Prokupecz: “The meeting signals that the U.S. attorney’s office is escalating its inquiry connected to Bezos’s suggestion that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was behind a National Enquirer story that exposed his extramarital affair and his claim that the tabloid attempted to extort him.” CNN

USDA’s ag census on tap today,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2019/04/11/usdas-ag-census-on-tap-today-579608,"With help from Helena Bottemiller Evich and Oma Seddiq Morning Story Continued Below
— It’s ag census day. USDA will release its 2017 Census of Agriculture at noon, highlighting demographic shifts since the 2012 survey and other changes within the industry that will help form U.S. ag policy over the next five years.
— Major food trade groups are trying to head off FDA’s work on short-term sodium reduction targets by pushing for a meeting with the White House’s budget shop. But there’s division within the industry over the controversial issue, as some big food makers support FDA’s goals.
— The Senate could take the lead in reauthorizing child nutrition programs, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts suggested Wednesday. The retiring Kansas Republican said a markup is possible in the “not-too-distant future,” but he predicted the legislative effort could face similar obstacles to the 2018 farm bill.
HAPPY THURSDAY, APRIL 11! we’re nerding out over the new black hole photo . Send tips USDA AG CENSUS ON TAP TODAY: The Agriculture Department will publish its five-year survey of U.S. farms and ranches at noon, followed by a briefing by Secretary Sonny Perdue at 1 p.m. The long-awaited census, which was delayed seven weeks due to the record-long government shutdown, will provide a detailed look at trends in the agriculture industry and influence state and national farm policy and rural programs.
What’s different this year: As MA has noted , producers filling out the survey this time around were able to list multiple principals equally involved in business decisions, rather than just one. That will make demographic comparisons with the 2012 census tricky but provide a clearer view of those involved in farming.
Trends to watch: The survey will also shed light on consolidation in the ag industry (recently a hot topic among 2020 contenders), whether farmers are getting older and changes in crop and livestock geography.
FOOD INDUSTRY SEEKS OMB MEETING ON SODIUM TARGETS: As FDA works to finalize short-term sodium reduction targets for dozens of processed food categories, several major trade associations are trying to get a meeting with OMB to present a new study showing that the agency’s suggested goals would be expensive to meet, Pro Ag’s Helena Bottemiller Evich reports .
The reduction targets are voluntary and laid out in FDA guidance, which is non-binding, but it puts significant pressure on food companies to comply.
The roster: Those hoping the White House will step in include the American Bakers Association, American Frozen Food Institute, International Dairy Foods Association, North American Meat Institute, National Restaurant Association and SNAC International, a trade association that represents more than 400 snack manufacturers, including PepsiCo.
“We have engaged throughout the policy process, highlighting opportunities and challenges, as a part of that dialogue,” the industry associations that are trying to get the administration to reconsider the guidance said in a statement to POLITICO. “We believe an OMB review will be a helpful part of the policymaking process.”
Don’t call it opposition: The trade associations said they want FDA’s voluntary guidance to be “a success.”
The salty debate: The reality is the food industry simply cannot agree on this issue. While the concept of federal sodium reduction targets once generated much broader backlash, there’s now a good chunk of industry on FDA’s side.
— The Sustainable Food Policy Alliance, which represents Nestlé, Unilever, Mars Inc. and Danone North America, this week defended FDA’s push to use voluntary guidance. Others, like the Kraft-Heinz Company, are staying out of the fight. The Grocery Manufacturers Association has also not jumped in.
FDA forges ahead: MA readers will recall former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb last week warned the food industry against pushing back on the targets, arguing such a move would backfire.
A divided house: The industry disagreement makes it more difficult to convince the administration to rethink its approach. But the drama is good news for public health groups, which have long pressed for more aggressive action on cutting sodium to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease.
CHILD NUTRITION EFFORT TAKING SHAPE: Roberts said Wednesday he wants to see the child nutrition bill reauthorized by Congress, but he cautioned the effort could face challenges similar to the 2018 farm bill, H.R. 2 (115) , Helena reports .
The Senate ag chairman didn’t commit to a timeline, but he acknowledged that rolling out draft legislation before the August recess “would be a very good goal.” (Once 2020 begins, of course, the presidential campaign could take the air out of most bipartisan legislative efforts on Capitol Hill.)
Early stages: Roberts, who is retiring from the Senate after 2020, said he’s had preliminary discussions with leaders of the House Education and Labor Committee, which has jurisdiction over child nutrition programs in that chamber.
Cracking down on improper payments: The GAO said Wednesday that USDA should beef up its efforts to reduce improper payments across child nutrition programs that either were made in the wrong amount or shouldn’t have been made at all, per Helena.
— USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service reported $1.8 billion in improper payments in fiscal 2018, with the highest error rates among school meal programs.
PORK GATHERING CANCELED OVER AFS FEARS: The National Pork Producers Council officially called off its 2019 World Pork Expo to avoid any chance of African swine fever spreading in the U.S. pig population, your host reports .
The annual event, scheduled for June in Des Moines, Iowa, was expected to bring in 20,000 attendees, the group said in a statement, including exhibitors from “ASF-positive regions” who may have been exposed to the disease (which doesn’t affect humans).
The deadly swine fever has decimated Chinese herds, and NPPC said an outbreak in the U.S. would be catastrophic for the pork sector, which is already facing economic challenges like retaliatory tariffs.

The issue has been a priority for the Trump administration, which previously indicated it would impose tariffs should Beijing violate provisions of the trade agreement. Mnuchin said he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would speak with Liu again this morning.
DEMS’ NEW APPROACH TO USMCA: House Democrats looking for a way around the stalemate over the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement suggested the Trump administration consider making small side revisions, Pro Trade’s Sabrina Rodriguez and Megan Cassella report .
Rather than reopening negotiations on the deal’s language — a move that a number of Democrats have called for in recent weeks, but each North American country opposes — the lawmakers are looking to make small-scale changes to address concerns about labor standards and pharmaceutical provisions.

State bans workplace discrimination over minor charges,www.politico.com,Emilie Ruscoe,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/04/10/state-bans-workplace-discrimination-over-minor-charges-963295,"Proponents say the legislation is needed at a time when background checks for employment have become standard practice across many industries. State bans workplace discrimination over minor charges
ALBANY — A new state measure will protect tens of thousands of New Yorkers against discrimination in the workplace over minor yet outstanding criminal charges.
The bill will apply to those who have been charged with a crime, but have had those charges adjourned contemplating dismissal — a case status commonly abbreviated as ACD.
“It will allow the tens of thousands of New Yorkers whose criminal cases are resolved with an ACD each year to work and support their families,” said Melissa Ader, an employment lawyer with the Legal Aid Society.
Following adjournment contemplating dismissal, a case technically remains open without further court dates, typically for either six months or a year.
If the defendant does not land back in court during that period, the case is dismissed without further action, and the charges are dropped — although such charges would appear on background checks for some jobs, such as those in law enforcement.
The majority of ACD defendants have received less serious misdemeanor charges, as opposed to felony charges.
Data from New York’s Division of Criminal Justice Services for 2017, the most recent year available, indicates that approximately 70,400 defendants charged with misdemeanors —nearly a quarter of misdemeanor arrests disposed of on that year’s court calendars — were adjourned contemplating dismissal. ACD was the most common outcome for misdemeanor arrests by far, after conviction.
Though ACD cases remain open and could be put back on a court calendar for prosecution if defendants offend again, data compiled by the Legal Aid Society indicates that this is extremely rare.
Analysis of more than 43,000 cases Legal Aid attorneys worked in the 2016 calendar year indicates that 99.4 percent of ACD cases were eventually dismissed, and most of the remaining resulted in non-criminal violation charges.
New York’s employment law already protects those who have been convicted from facing employment discrimination, but ACD charges, which appear on some commercial background checks simply as an open criminal case, currently could result in defendants being rejected for a job, or fired.
""I've had to say to attorneys, 'I understand that your client maintains their innocence. If they plead guilty to a disorderly conduct violation, they're likely not to face employment consequences. If they accept an ACD, they are likely to face employment consequences,"" said Ader.
Proponents say the legislation is needed at a time when background checks for employment have become standard practice across many industries.
“The vast majority of jobs in New York require a background check — and those jobs include jobs in schools, jobs in health care, but also jobs in retail, jobs in all sorts of low-wage work,” said Ader. “I mean, it's hard to find a job that does not require a background check.”"

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— President Donald Trump will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House today. Nuclear diplomacy is chief on the agenda, but there’s also a major trade issue weighing on the South Korean leader: the threat of auto tariffs.
— House Democrats are pushing for a compromise with the that would address their USMCA concerns through small-scale, specific changes without reopening the new trade pact.
— Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday that the U.S. and China have “pretty much agreed on an enforcement mechanism” that will help Beijing live up to any commitments it makes in a trade deal. High-level talks continue today, he added.

Driving the Day THE TRADE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM AT THE TRUMP-MOON SUMMIT: Moon’s visit to the White House today to talk nuclear diplomacy comes amid growing concerns back home that South Korea could soon be at odds with the U.S. over a very different issue: car tariffs.
The looming threat of punitive duties on South Korea’s exports of autos and auto parts to the U.S. is hanging over the country’s head despite the successful renegotiation of the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement, which was implemented at the start of this year. Beyond KORUS, officials there also emphasize that they have agreed to a 70 percent steel quota, cut their trade surplus over the U.S. in recent years and worked to reduce their non-tariff barriers — all of which, they feel, should merit them some immunity.
Yet the potential for new tariffs remains. “If that happens, I think the days of solid Korea-U.S. alliance may be facing a moment of truth,” said Choi Byung-il, president of the Korea International Economic Association in Seoul and a former South Korean trade negotiator.
Flip sides of the same coin: Some Moon advisers and analysts say the tariff issue is likely to be tangential rather than top of mind at today’s summit, which is expected to focus heavily on denuclearization. But the two issues playing out in tandem helps illustrate many South Koreans’ mixed feelings about the U.S. president.
“Within Korea … we say that President Trump is both blessing and curse,” said Moon Chung-in, a special adviser to the South Korean president who emphasized he was speaking in a personal capacity. While Trump’s focus on reaching a nuclear deal with North Korea is seen as a huge positive, car tariffs “would be one more item on the list depicting him as a curse.” Megan has more from Seoul here .
HOUSE DEMS LOOK TO BREAK STALEMATE ON NAFTA 2.0: A growing number of Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi , have called in recent weeks for the to make changes to the text of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. But House Democrats now say the changes don’t require major renegotiation, which the administration, Canada and Mexico all reject out of fear the deal would fall apart if it’s reopened.
House Democrats are unifying around a new message to Trump: With specific amendments, we can get USMCA to the finish line.
“We know, in the past, other agreements have been opened to make changes. We can be specific about what we want,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), a longtime vocal critic of NAFTA, told POLITICO. “The entire agreement doesn’t have to be reopened.”
Your host and Megan have the details here .
Freshman Dems focused on pharma: Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) said a major area of concern for new members is the intellectual property provision that provides 10 years of protection for test data used to develop biologic medicines. Democrats argue that the provision would lock in high prescription drug prices.
“The vast majority of new members came with a mandate to tackle the increasing pharmaceutical costs and this essentially ties their hands,” Escobar told Morning Trade. “You support USMCA and you’re immediately violating one of the more fundamental reasons why voters sent you here.”
Grassley: ‘Get off the perfect’: Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Pelosi needs to get USMCA passed or Democrats are “going to look very, very bad if this thing goes down the drain.” Grassley added that Democrats need to accept that “there isn’t such a thing as a perfect trade bill.” More here .
MNUCHIN: U.S., CHINA AGREE TO ‘ENFORCEMENT OFFICES’ IN TRADE TALKS: Mnuchin repeated Wednesday that the U.S. and China are serious about enforcing any bilateral deal they could strike in the coming weeks, pointing to their work on creating “enforcement offices” to ensure both sides live up to their commitments. Mnuchin told the House Financial Services Committee about the mechanism earlier this week.
“We’ve agreed that both sides will establish enforcement offices that will deal with the ongoing matters. This is something both sides are taking very seriously,” Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview.

CONGRESSIONAL TAX WRITERS REJECT UNILATERAL DIGITAL SERVICES TAXES: Leaders of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees on Wednesday rejected one-off taxes on digital services amid growing concern over a digital services tax in France that would target American tech companies like Google and Facebook.
In a rare joint statement, Finance Chairman Grassley and ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and ranking member Kevin Brady (R-Texas) urged countries to work together on a multilateral solution instead of pursuing unilateral measures.
“We are supportive of the United States participating in the ongoing OECD negotiations on these solutions. We call on other countries to focus on and engage productively in the OECD dialogue … and abandon unilateral measures,” the lawmakers said.
KAPTUR WANTS USMCA ‘LABOR SECRETARIAT’: Rep. Marcy Kaptur is trying to get support for her new bill that aims to “set the mark” on what progress on labor issues should look like in the USMCA. The Ohio Democrat passed out a packet of information on the legislation to her colleagues at a meeting on the new NAFTA that was hosted Wednesday by Pelosi.
The bill is being reviewed by the House Office of the Legislative Counsel before it’s introduced, an aide said, adding that Kaptur wanted to get a concept bill in front of colleagues before recess.
What’s in it: The bill would amend trade promotion authority legislation to apply the objectives on labor to all workers, regardless of immigration status. An “Independent Labor Secretariat” would be established to monitor and enforce labor-related provisions in the trade deal. The “Secretariat” would be allowed to freely travel and monitor workplaces and issue reports on compliance or noncompliance. In the event of noncompliance, goods would be affixed with a label that states the facility in which it is made is providing “sub-decent” wages; duties would be reimposed if noncompliance stretches beyond a year.
The bill would also require that labor disputes be subject to the agreement’s enforcement chapter with panels comprised of arbitrators with expertise in international labor or human rights. A panel would be able to authorize sanctions in the form of suspending tariff benefits.
ANALYST: USMCA VOTE UNLIKELY BEFORE 2020 ELECTION: Pelosi’s demand that the agreement be reopened to address Democratic concerns are hobbling Trump’s chances of winning approval of the deal before the November 2020 election, a former U.S. trade official said Wednesday at the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries’ annual meeting in Los Angeles.
“It’s becoming increasingly unlikely that the agreement is going to implemented before the election,” said Jeffrey Weiss, who worked at USTR in the Bush and Obama administrations and is now is a partner at Venable. The has resisted Pelosi’s demand, “but the speaker is holding all the cards on that. If it has to be reopened … that’s going to take us past the election.”
It doesn’t make sense politically for Pelosi to schedule a vote on the agreement this year “when she knows that [it] is going to split her members and hand the president a win before the election on one of his priority achievements,” Weiss said. It’s more likely she will continue to press USTR to improve the pact and wait for a more opportune time for a vote, he added.

"FLASHBACK: Charges could unsettle liberals, conservatives -- and Trump...",www.politico.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/julian-assange-charges-wikileaks-997122,"Legal Assange charges could unsettle liberals, conservatives — and Trump Some liberals have defended Assange as a journalist, conservatives celebrated him in 2016 and Trump once declared his 'love' for WikiLeaks. By DARREN SAMUELSOHN , JOSH GERSTEIN and MATTHEW CHOI 11/16/2018 02:30 PM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Apparent criminal charges against Julian Assange are thrusting the WikiLeaks founder back into American politics — a development that could create awkwardness across the political spectrum.
Many liberals and civil rights activists have defended Assange as a journalist entitled to First Amendment protections. Conservatives have celebrated him for exposing Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016. And President Donald Trump, who declared his “love” for Assange’s website during the 2016 contest, may have new concerns about whether the focus on Assange has a connection to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. Story Continued Below
For now, the details remain murky about what U.S. law Assange, an Australian national holed up in a London embassy, has even been charged with violating. An unrelated federal court filing discovered late Thursday appears to have accidentally mentioned Assange but doesn’t explain whether the sealed charges deal with WikiLeaks’ publication of stolen Democratic documents to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign or another matter that has also triggered notice from U.S. prosecutors.
It’s unclear when — if ever — the details about Assange will even be made public. Still, Assange’s reemergence at a time when Mueller has carefully studied how WikiLeaks obtained the Russian-hacked Democratic emails in 2016 jump-starts a debate over the fate of the Australian computer programmer.

Although Assange has legions of determined enemies in the U.S., especially pro-Clinton Democrats and national security insiders who consider him a hostile foreign agent, some influential actors may not be enthusiastic about his prosecution.
The American Civil Liberties Union, characterizing him as a journalist, warned that prosecuting Assange “would be unprecedented and unconstitutional, and would open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations.”
“It should not be lost upon anyone that there are leaks of classified information to the media just about every day,” added David Coombs, the lawyer who represented former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning during the 2013 trial about the leak of thousands of diplomatic cables and military reports to WikiLeaks.
Some Republicans argue that it is high time for Assange, who has been living under asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, to face justice.
“This is cut and dried: WikiLeaks is an outlet for foreign propaganda, and Julian Assange is an enemy of the American people,” said Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican. “He deserves to spend the rest of his life in an American prison.”
But many influential conservatives gleefully celebrated the release of Clinton’s emails in 2016 and have hailed Assange, 47, as a whistle-blower.
In September 2016, Fox News host and Trump confidant Sean Hannity hosted Assange on his show and congratulated him for showing “how corrupt, dishonest and phony our government is.”
“I do hope you get free one day,” Hannity added.
In late 2010, after WikiLeaks released a trove of sensitive U.S. diplomatic documents pilfered by Manning, Hannity called for Assange to be jailed for “waging war” against the U.S."

FIRST LOOK DEMOCRATS' PLAN FOR PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS: A group of Senate Democrats, led by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.), today are unveiling a new plan to overhaul federal student loan forgiveness for public servants, a program that’s been plagued by high denial rates over the past year.
— The legislation would allow borrowers to receive partial loan forgiveness — half of their loan balance — after five years of making payments rather than waiting the full 10 years that’s currently required. And it would simplify the process by which borrowers certify their public service employment, including creating a database of which employers count as public service under the program.
— The bill would also expand public service loan forgiveness to borrowers of all types of federal student loans who are enrolled in any of the various loan repayment plans. Only some federal loans and some repayment plans qualify, which has been a source of confusion for borrowers seeking to track 10 years of payments.
— Gillibrand, a 2020 presidential contender, said the bill was meant to create a “fairer and simpler process” for borrowers. “The current Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is a bureaucratic nightmare, and the Department of Education is failing to meet its obligation to help ease the student debt burden for our nation’s public servants,” she said in a statement.
— The Democratic effort to make it easier for borrowers to qualify under the Public Service Loan Program comes as the Education Department has been denying the vast majority of applications for loan forgiveness. Congress set aside a combined $700 million over the past two fiscal years to help borrowers who failed to qualify for loan forgiveness because they had enrolled in the wrong repayment plan. But that temporary “fix” hasn’t been working much better, as nearly all of the individuals who applied for the second chance were denied again, according to new federal data .
— DeVos was questioned during a House hearing on Wednesday about those high rates of denials. She said it was Congress, not her agency, that set the parameters for the program. She said Congress had crafted a system that made it “difficult” for borrowers to qualify.
— The Trump administration and some Congressional Republicans have sought to eliminate the program entirely. DeVos said she thought it was unfair that the benefit of loan forgiveness applied to borrowers working at nonprofit organizations but not for-profit companies.
— But eliminating the program was a tough sell even to some House Republicans, who bristled at the proposal as part of the House GOP plan to overhaul higher education in the last Congress. Public Service Loan Forgiveness is likely to be spared in any Higher Education Act reauthorization bill produced this year by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the leaders of the Senate education panel.
— A major expansion of the program, though, as the Democrats’ legislation calls for isn’t likely to attract much Republican support. No GOP senators signed onto the legislation, which is co-sponsored by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).

HAPPENING TODAY REAGAN FOUNDATION EDUCATION SUMMIT: The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute holds its 2019 RISE summit all day today at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. Organizers said the event’s focus “will be grounded in the premise that education is a national priority and a state’s responsibility.” Topics range from developing a holistic approach to education to preparing students for the job market of the future.
— DeVos and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) are the featured lunch speakers at noon.
— Alexander, Kaine and Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), the ranking member on the House Education and Labor Committee, are among the other speakers. Our Kimberly Hefling will moderate a panel called “From P-12: The Challenges of Creating a New School House.” View the agenda here .
DEVOS TO HEAD TO THE ‘BUCKEYE STATE’: The Education secretary is scheduled to travel on Friday to Fairfield Township, Ohio, to tour a manufacturing classroom at Butler Tech, which provides career-focused programming for high school students and adults. While there, she’ll attend a “signing day” ceremony and meet with students, according to an Education Department advisory. The Dayton Daily News reported that students participating in the ceremony will sport hats from the companies where they will work. The event starts at 9 a.m.
Congress EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS MARKUP IN MAY: Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), the ranking member on the House Labor-HHS-Education spending panel, said his subcommittee is expected to mark up its fiscal 2020 bill on April 30, with a full committee markup tentatively planned for May 8.
— The panel will have a piece of the $631 billion in non-defense spending House appropriators will be assuming as they mark up fiscal 2020 funding bills this spring , House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey said Wednesday. How the total will be broken down among the measures has yet to be decided. But Lowey is expected to divvy up the spending limits in the next few weeks. The House bills will be assuming a nearly 6 percent increase for non-defense spending above current levels. Jennifer Scholtes and Connor O’Brien have more .
INTERNAL MEMO: DEVOS HAD POWER TO REFUSE FEDERAL MONEY FOR GUNS IN SCHOOLS: Education Department attorneys said last year that the agency could block states from using federal grants to buy guns for schools, even as DeVos claimed she was powerless to do so, according to an internal agency memo released by House Democrats on Wednesday.
— The 14-page memo was displayed during a tense back-and-forth between DeVos and a freshman lawmaker and former teacher, Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), during a House education committee hearing.
— DeVos announced last year she would not stand in the way of states that wanted to use federal education grants to buy guns after Democrats implored her to prohibit such purchases. But on Wednesday, Hayes grilled DeVos over the internal memo that said the secretary did have the power to bar her agency's funding from being used to buy guns.
— DeVos said it was up to states and local communities to decide on the issue of using federal dollars to buy guns for schools. ""You have the authority to do it,"" Hayes said, holding up the memo. ""Read your memo.""

TREASURY MISSES DEADLINE ON TRUMP’S TAX RETURNS -- Barr thinks FBI spied on Trump campaign -- GOP TRIES TO REEL IN TRUMP AFTER DHS SHAKEUP -- Michael Grimm seeks support for congressional comeback,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2019/04/11/treasury-misses-deadline-on-trumps-tax-returns-barr-thinks-fbi-spied-on-trump-campaign-gop-seeks-to-reel-in-trump-after-dhs-shakeup-michael-grimm-seeks-support-for-congressional-comeback-423607,"TAX TIME -- It’s official: the Treasury Department has missed a Wednesday deadline from House Democrats to hand over President Donald Trump’s tax returns, with Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying he needs more time to consider the request. Trump himself was even more blunt, telling reporters earlier in the day: “I won’t do it.” While the White House was not expected to comply with the Democratic demands, the blown deadline significantly ratchets up the stakes in the brewing legal battle between Congress and the executive branch. Now, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) must decide if and when to pull the trigger on a subpoena. ""I will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response to the commissioner in the coming days,” he said in a statement.
Democrats worry that the legal fight could take months, if not longer, to get resolved. That means lawmakers — and the public — may not be able to learn about what is in the president’s tax filings until after the 2020 election. The administration, meanwhile, has every incentive to stall the issue, in hopes that Republicans can win back the House in next year’s elections.

I SPY -- In his second day of hearings on Capitol Hill, Attorney General William Barr made a startling assertion: he believes that “spying did occur” in the FBI's probe of the Trump campaign. The suggestion has long been a rallying cry for Trump and his allies, and the new backup from Barr will no doubt be music to Trump’s ears. But Democrats are furious with Barr, accusing him of drinking the “Kool-Aid” and noting that he is directly contradicting past statements by the DOJ.
Other nuggets : Barr clarified that Congress will get Robert Mueller’s full report sometime next week. But he also made another significant statement that is getting less attention: Barr said that redactions to protect the reputations and privacy of “peripheral third parties” would not apply to the president, only to private citizens.

GOP, TAKE THE WHEEL -- Republicans publicly pushed back against the president’s controversial purge of top DHS officials, just the latest example of the GOP seeking to contain the president. Now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is encouraging Republicans to head off problematic nominees — from hard-liners at DHS to controversial picks at the Federal Reserve — before the president officially announces them. While Republicans have grown more comfortable criticizing the president, it’s unclear just how far they are willing to go to rein him in.

MEDICARE VOTE FOR ALL -- McConnell is considering putting the progressives’ “Medicare for All” bill on the Senate floor, drawing on a similar tactic he used to expose Democratic divisions over the Green New Deal resolution. The idea is to put every lawmaker, including 2020 hopefuls, on the record over the issue. Most Democrats, however, ended up protesting the climate change “show” vote by voting present. But Democrats may be more eager to show support for the health care bill, which is an actual piece of legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and is a chief priority for the left.

GRIMM IT TO WIN IT -- Michael Grimm returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, where he schmoozed with his former colleagues and sought support for his (likely) congressional comeback. The former New York lawmaker had a brief meeting with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and spoke to other members on the House floor, reports Laura Barrón-López.
But Grimm may face a tough time convincing D.C. Republicans he is the right candidate for the job. Grimm, who once threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony, resigned from Congress in 2015 before serving time in prison for tax evasion. And he was trounced in last year’s primary race when he tried to run. Many in the GOP would prefer to support Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who they think has a better shot at defeating Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) in the general election (though the local GOP disagrees.) Much more: https://politi.co/2UMKSKR .

Kudlow: Fed may not hike interest rates 'in my lifetime' - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Caitlin Oprysko,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/11/larry-kudlow-interest-rates-1269762,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser said Thursday it’s possible the Federal Reserve may not hike interest rates again during his lifetime.
In an interview with The Hill, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow pointed to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell walking back the central bank’s predictions for multiple rate hikes this year and said he agreed with Trump’s frequent diatribes against raising interest rates, calling recent hikes “unnecessary.” Story Continued Below
“As I say, we wish they hadn't raised. I notice from the various reports and so forth that they've changed their view. I don't think rates will rise in the foreseeable future, maybe never again in my lifetime,” the 71-year-old said of Powell and Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida.
“Whether they will fall, I don't mind them falling,” he continued, rushing to add the caveat that he was not attempting to undermine the Fed’s independence. “I'm not storming the ramparts. Again, the Fed is independent.”
But while he alluded to the intention that the Fed remain isolated from political influence, a question raised by Trump’s frequent public criticisms of Powell, he defended the president’s breaks with the Fed chief.

“That doesn’t mean we can’t express our opinions periodically,” Kudlow said.
He insisted that Powell wasn’t on the chopping block at the White House, indirectly rebutting reports that Trump is unhappy with Powell amid a possible economic slowdown that could cut into his 2020 reelection message.
“Speaking personally, he has my confidence,” Kudlow said, predicting Powell would “turn out to be a good chairman” and praising him as a “brilliant, brilliant man.”
But he also downplayed the idea that the White House and the central bank were at odds when it came to economic policy.
“I’m not sure the differences between the Fed’s worldview and our worldview are as big as they are sometimes portrayed,” he said."

QUICK A U.S. agency will discuss creating a software “ingredient list” today. It could speed up discovering and fixing security flaws.
— The dark web is making tax identity theft simpler and less expensive. A report out today found bargain bin prices for documents.
— The federal chief information security officer has won praise in an OMB office with low morale. The bad news is the current CISO is doing two jobs at once.
HAPPY THURSDAY After scarring you with some horrifying bee news yesterday, your MC host hopes to make it up to you with a bit of bee comedy .
Driving the Day DO YOU KNOW WHAT’S IN YOUR CODE? — The telecom and tech agency NTIA will host a meeting today as part of its project with industry to develop a software “ingredient list” that promotes code transparency, and the agency is optimistic about this work.
The goal of a software bill of materials is to reduce supply chain risks and speed up the discovery and remediation of digital flaws. “Several working groups are digging into the details of how this would work, and studying what a more secure future can look like if stakeholders widely adopt SBOM across the Internet ecosystem,” Allan Friedman, director of cybersecurity initiatives at NTIA, said in a blog post . Medical device makers and hospitals are already pilot-testing one SBOM to see how useful it is. Friedman said NTIA hopes to explore “other use cases across diverse sectors in the months ahead.”
TAX SEASON JUST GOT A LOT MORE FRUSTRATING — Committing tax identity theft and fraud is getting cheaper and easier due to help from the dark web, research out today from Carbon Black suggests. With prices ranging from 19 cents to $62 apiece, hackers could buy several variations of tax-related items like W-2 and 1040 forms, names, Social Security numbers and birthdates, with W-2s and 1040s having a generally higher base price.
For a roughly $1,000 investment, Carbon Black researchers found, a “relatively inexperienced hacker” could buy authenticated access to a U.S. based bank account, file a false tax return, have the IRS refund deposited into the new account and transfer the combined balance into a crypto exchange or wallet. The hacker could then either continue to use that cryptocurrency on the dark web or cash out from an EU-based bank and turn the funds into real currency, which the report estimates “can more than double their initial $1,000 investment.”
Carbon Black’s report offered several tips for tax payers to protect themselves, including using a bank with multi-factor authentication, filing taxes as soon as possible and using a password manager. It also recommended authenticating requests for tax information via telephone or in person before giving away the information online and being skeptical of websites that require your tax information.
FEDERAL CISO’S BALANCING ACT — As OMB’s IT and cyber oversight office grapples with dismal morale, employees see Federal Chief Information Security Officer Grant Schneider as a rare bright spot in a leadership team that they say is letting them down. “He’s one of the few leaders that’s trying,” a current OMB employee told Eric for his story about turmoil in the office. “He is trying to engage at least the cyber team folks to see what he do can do and how he can help.” A former senior federal IT official who worked closely with the office echoed this perspective, calling Grant “a devoted public servant.”
But Schneider can’t focus on his team in the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, sources said, because he spends the vast majority of his time — one former OFCIO employee said “99 percent” — at the National Security Council, where he concurrently serves as a senior director for cybersecurity policy. “It is clear to some staff he’s investing more time with NSC than he is with OFCIO,” said the OMB employee. The former senior official said Schneider is “task-saturated,” adding, “He’s got two full-time jobs, and neither deserves to be part-time.”
Schneider has discussed employees’ concerns with Federal CIO Suzette Kent, whom sources said has adopted a much more distant management style than her Obama administration predecessor Tony Scott. “He has communicated to Suzette about the challenges and the need and the urgency to try to fix these things,” said the current OMB employee. “But that’s his boss, and he has to take the lead from her. So if it’s Suzette’s decision not to address these things, it’s out of his hands.”

HOMELAND SECURITY FOR THE FIRST TIME — A top DHS cyber official responded Wednesday to the question on everyone in the cybersecurity community’s mind right now: How will Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s departure affect the department’s cyber mission? “Professionals will keep doing their job regardless of the politics,” Jeanette Manfra, assistant director for cybersecurity at the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said at an Atlantic event. Many seem to agree, but the issue is whether DHS cyber people will be less effective with a different boss.
At the same event, the president of the National Association of Secretaries of State said there’s an effort afoot to improve election-system sensors known as Albert sensors. “We're working with Center for Internet Security on a pilot to develop an Albert monitor that works in the cloud,” said Jim Condos, secretary of state in Vermont.
LAZARUS GROUP STRIKES AGAIN — DHS and FBI alerted industry about their findings on new Trojan malware variants deployed by the Lazarus Group, widely believed to be backed by the North Korean government. The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team malware analysis report released Wednesday analyzes nine malicious executable files, seven of which are proxy applications that cloak traffic between the malware and remote operators.
The proxies can create counterfeit authentications using valid digital certificates or electronic passwords allowing for a secure connection and session, masking network connections with remote malicious actors. The agencies dubbed the malware “Hoplight.” The agencies recommended to users and administrators to implement 13 best practices to bolster organizations' defenses, including maintaining up-to-date antivirus signatures and implementing regular password changes.
 re’s at least one more victim of the hacker group behind the destructive malware known as Trisis or Triton, FireEye said. … Kaspersky Lab identified malware that can track keystrokes to pilfer files off USB devices. … Attorney General William Barr alleged that the Justice Department “spied” on the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, echoing a sentiment the president has embraced. … The State Department’s top cyber official said Europe should follow Germany’s lead on Huawei.

A 2014 election at the plant over whether to organize with the United Auto Workers became a national story when Republican politicians in the state, including Sen. Bob Corker (R.-Tenn.), tried to talk workers out of voting for the union even as VW management stayed neutral. Grover Norquist got involved , too. In the end the union lost, amid recriminations over Corker stating publicly two days before the vote that if the the plant went union it would lose its chance to make a new midsize SUV, a claim that the plant's chief of operations said was untrue. The new petition says 30 percent of the plant's employees have indicated they want union representation, and requests an election on April 29-30. More here .

Inside the Agencies LEADERSHIP LOWDOWN:
VITIELLO OUT AT DHS: Top immigration official Ronald Vitiello, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since June, will leave his post tomorrow, POLITICO’s Ted Hesson reports. “The agency has not announced a replacement, although Matthew Albence, acting deputy director, would be next in line.” Vitiello’s nomination to become permanent ICE director was pulled by the White House on Friday. Vitiello is the fourth top immigration official to be shown the door since Sunday.

REPUBLICANS LOOK TO TIGHTEN LEGAL IMMIGRATION: “Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, David Perdue of Georgia and Josh Hawley of Missouri, key allies of President Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, planned to introduce a bill Wednesday that would favor admitting skilled workers and their immediate family members but cut by half the number of legal immigrants,” POLITICO’s Anita Kumar reports . The move comes in an apparent rebuff to White House adviser Jared Kushner’s unexpected plan to expand the number of migrant workers admitted to the country, which he has been working on in secret for months. Kushner showed Trump the proposal last week, but the president suggested he expand it “to include both changes to legal and illegal immigration as to address what he calls a crisis on the southern border.”
MEDIAN PAY RISES AT S&P 500 COMPANIES: ""Median pay rose at most of the 282 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported two years of median employee pay through midday April 9,"" a Wall Street Journal analysis found. “Twice as many companies increased their median-pay figure as lowered it, the Journal found, with 45 companies reporting gains of at least 10 percent and 33 reporting declines at least that large.” Publicly traded companies were first required to disclose median pay last year under the 2010 Dodd–Frank Act .

DEATH OF BRICK AND MORTAR: “An estimated 75,000 stores that sell clothing, electronics and furniture will close by 2026, when online shopping is expected to make up 25 percent of retail sales,” a report by investment firm UBS found, Abha Bhattarai reports for the Washington Post. “The average U.S. household spent $5,200 online last year, up nearly 50 percent from five years earlier.” More here .
OFCCP EYES LAW FIRM DIVERSITY: “The Trump administration’s federal contractor police plans to take a closer look at diversity and discrimination at law firms,” Chris Opfer reports for Bloomberg Law. “Law firms need to get their houses in order,” said Craig Leen, director of the DOL’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. “There is a big problem at law firms for women and women of color.” In new guidelines released last year OFCCP said it was developing a system where contractors who don’t submit affirmative action plans will be more likely to come up for review. The directive cited a 2016 Government Accountability Office study that found a vast majority of contractors weren’t complying with affirmative action requirements.
Opfer notes the move comes as gender discrimination lawsuits are being filed against high-profile law firms. The New York Times’ Tiffany Hsu reported last week that Jones Day was sued by six former female employees who alleged the firm underpaid them and engaged in pregnancy discrimination.

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— The two chambers of Congress have conflicting ideas about how to approach the reauthorization of surface transportation programs. And has momentum stalled on a big infrastructure bill?
— A new bipartisan bill would raise a cap on the electric vehicle tax credit , but some key Senate Republicans remain opposed.
— DHS is facing potential blows to employee morale as Kevin McAleenan’s elevation to acting secretary leaves Customs and Border Protection without a leader, and TSA’s head takes on a Mick Mulvaney-esque second job.
IT’S THURSDAY:
""It's all four wheel drive, and jacked up tires, and rolling out with them speakers / But for a trip down memory lane tonight, I need something a little deeper.""
IN CONGRESS HOUSE VS. SENATE: I hope you’re sitting down, because this may come as a shock: The House and the Senate are taking different approaches on a surface transportation reauthorization. Your host caught up with House Transportation Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) on Wednesday, a day after Senate committee leaders said they wanted a bill marked up before the August recess. “If they're going to do it that quickly, I assume it's going to be a status quo markup with no money, which isn't very meaningful,"" he said. ""But I'd hope to be surprised, and I hope it's better than that."" He also took aim at Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso 's (R-Wyo.) opinion that the federal gas tax shouldn’t be increased, but that all options are on the table. “That doesn't make a lot of sense to me,” DeFazio said.
Response from the upper chamber: Barrasso and EPW ranking member Tom Carper (D-Del.) said in a joint statement they're committed to passing ""significant, bipartisan highway infrastructure legislation"" and they're aiming to make investments in ""a meaningful and fiscally-responsible way.""
What about a big infrastructure bill? DeFazio said he’s “not certain” about a broader infrastructure plan, which would have to involve House leadership and other committee chairs. But it’s a big item on the agenda at Democrats’ retreat in Leesburg, Va., this week, and lawmakers are planning a “working lunch” on infrastructure today, POLITICO’s Heather Caygle and Sarah Ferris report . “This is going to be an issue this caucus is going to focus on like a laser,” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) said at a press conference Wednesday.
By the way: Americans for Prosperity is launching a six-figure ad campaign advocating against raising the gas tax. The group also released a report breaking down an increase state by state.

AUTOMOBILES TO CAP OR NOT TO CAP: A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation on Wednesday that would dramatically boost the number of customers who can claim a tax credit for electronic vehicles, Pro Energy’s Anthony Adragna reports . The bill, S. 1094 (116) , would slightly lower the dollar amount, from $7,500 to $7,000, but would allow an additional 400,000 vehicles per automaker, up from an existing 200,000. Car manufacturers and environmental groups have backed raising the cap, but some senior Republicans like Barrasso would rather get rid of the credit altogether.
NASON’S HISTORY OF SILENCE: New FHWA head Nicole Nason has an interesting career past, and Maxine Joselow at E&E News unearthed some of the juicier details. She served as NHTSA chief during the George W. Bush administration, where she tried to delay EPA efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars, the story says. In that time, NHTSA cut off communication with EPA, refusing to return phone calls. Nason was also behind an order to NHTSA employees (including the communications office) not to speak with the press on the record. That tidbit is from a 2007 New York Times article , and you can read the full E&E story here .
Aviation BOEING UPDATES: The FAA is still waiting for Boeing to send its software fix for the 737 MAX, and the agency won’t sign off on the update until it's satisfied in terms of safety, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told a House subcommittee on Wednesday. She also told reporters afterward that if lawmakers want to rework the FAA’s aircraft certification process, specifically the Organization Designation Authorization program, “it is up to them.”
On automation: House Appropriations Transportation-HUD Chairman David Price (D-N.C.) said during the hearing that the two Boeing crashes raise “larger questions about whether DOT is fully prepared to oversee and regulate increasingly complex technologies in this age of automation.” The agency needs to “undertake a massive effort to recruit and retain staff who are qualified and knowledgeable about automation and human behavior,” he said. As for the FAA, Chao said she thinks it has “the capability … and the flexibility to go outside to get the people and the skill sets that they need.”
Few details from members' NTSB brief: Meanwhile, several lawmakers were briefed by NTSB on the Ethiopian Airlines preliminary report, but when MT caught up with DeFazio, he didn’t offer much beyond that it largely went over already-public facts. But he did say he’s continuing to learn how the flight control system works. His committee is “in conversation” with Boeing and FAA, and is waiting for both to respond to document requests on the 737 MAX certification. DeFazio said the documents will help guide the committee’s approach to investigating the crashes, including a potential hearing.
International 'sticking point': FAA and Boeing are strategizing about how to build international support once the company’s software fix is ready this summer, The Wall Street Journal reports . As the story says, the strategy is a sign of how much America’s air safety leadership has been damaged in recent months. One interesting insight: An internal FAA email said the European Aviation Safety Agency is a “sticking point” in the question of when the 737 MAX could be ungrounded in Europe.
Sensors under scrutiny: Bloomberg found that there have been at least 140 incidents since the early 1990's where angle of attack sensors, part of the system on the Boeing 737 MAX that investigators are reviewing, have been damaged by birds or equipment on the ground. As Alan Levin and Ryan Beene write, ""investigators are probing Boeing’s decision to enable the sensors on the Max model to go beyond warning pilots and automatically force the plane’s nose down.""
Security NOW WHAT? As of Wednesday afternoon, McAleenan is officially acting head of DHS, leaving CBP without a chief official. CBP declined to comment on the move, but some believe COO John Sanders will get the nod, bypassing Deputy Commissioner Robert Perez. Being without an acting commissioner will “definitely affect morale,” National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told POLITICO. He suggested the agency also would be in “good hands” with Manuel Padilla, who heads the Border Patrol’s Joint Task Force at the Southern border. House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) warned that the multiple vacancies within DHS leadership would “undoubtedly inflict untold damage on the management of the Department and the morale of its 240,000 employees.”
Adding to the confusion: TSA Administrator David Pekoske is expected to step in temporarily as deputy DHS secretary, though he’ll stay on at TSA, potentially playing dual roles like Mick Mulvaney. More on that from our Stephanie Beasley here .

Sanders unveils new ‘Medicare for All’ plan,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-score/2019/04/11/sanders-unveils-new-medicare-for-all-plan-579151," Campaigns Pro subscribers Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) rolled out the latest version of his signature Medicare for All plan, but voters and other 2020 hopefuls who support it all have different ideas about what the proposal really entails.
Story Continued Below
— Conservative Brian Hagedorn beat liberal Lisa Neubauer in the Wisconsin state Supreme Court race after Neubauer decided against a recount and conceded.
— Rep. Joaquín Castro and MJ Hegar are on a collision course for the Democratic Senate nomination in Texas.

THE TOPLINES THE HEALTH CARE ELECTION — Health care remains at the forefront of the 2020 presidential election, and Sanders unveiled an updated version of his Medicare for All plan Wednesday highlights that. Several other 2020 hopefuls co-sponsored his proposal: Sens. Cory Booker , Kirsten Gillibrand , Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren .
“Sanders’ plan is the most ambitious by far of Democrats’ slate of bills aimed at expanding health coverage, proposing a total restructuring of the national health care system that would effectively eliminate employer-sponsored insurance and other government programs like Medicaid,” POLITICO Pro Health Care’s Adam Cancryn reported. His office also released a separate document on how to pay for it .
But what exactly “M4A” means to the 2020 contenders is still up in the air. In an interview with WCBS-AM , Booker said “where I think we should be moving as a country is ultimately toward a Medicare for All system,” but there likely needs to be incremental steps in between. “Anybody who says ... Medicare for All who's running for president, the next thing out of their mouths should be talking to people about, we are a split Congress, what are you actually going to actually do in your first year to make health care more accessible and affordable?”
And voters’ opinions of Medicare for All are not solidified. A late-March poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found M4A has 56 percent approval to 39 percent disapproval (a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll from last week found a similar trend).But Democratic voters are divided on what should come next: 44 percent said Congress should focus on improving and protecting the Affordable Care Act while 46 said they should focus on passing Medicare for All. A January KFF poll found that Americans’ opinions on M4A are malleable, with wild favorability swings depending on what detail of M4A is described.
IN THE TRENCHES ALL OVER — Hagedorn defeated Neubauer in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race by about 6,000 votes. Neubauer called Hagedorn on Wednesday morning to concede, the AP’s Scott Bauer reported. The race was close enough that Neubauer could have requested a recount of the results — but if she would’ve done so, her campaign would have had to foot the bill. The race is the latest sign that Wisconsin will be one of the top battleground states in 2020 .
PRESIDENTIAL BIG BOARD — Warren raised $6 million in the first quarter of the year, with 135,000 people giving 213,000 contributions, per POLITICO’s Natasha Korecki . That puts her in the middle of the pack among those who have announced totals (Warren swore off big donor events in February). She has a sizable war chest thanks to a transfer from her Senate campaign; she’ll report nearly $11.2 million cash on hand. Warren showed some momentum toward the end of the quarter, raising $1.4 million in the last week.
— Some small fundraising details: Harris will report having $9 million cash on hand, per POLITICO’s Chris Cadelago . O’Rourke had 163,000 donors, per The Washington Post’s Matt Viser . Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said she crossed the 65,000 donor threshold, a way to qualify for the first debate.
— Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced her top hires in New Hampshire, including Scott Merrick as state director.
DEEP IN THE HEART — Texas Democrats are girding for a battle. “Neither Hegar nor Castro has announced they’re running, but both have met with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to discuss it,” Campaign Pro’s James Arkin reported . “And both have prominent Democratic supporters convinced they represent the party’s best option to turn Texas blue. But a divisive primary would likely leave the eventual nominee damaged and cash-depleted, making the uphill climb to unseat [GOP Sen. John Cornyn ] that much steeper.”
THE CASH DASH — Freshmen Democratic Rep. Jason Crow (CO-06) raised $490,000 and has $473,000 cash on hand, per his campaign. Fellow freshmen Democratic Rep. Colin Allred (TX-32) raised $530,000 with $527,000 on hand, per The Dallas Morning News’ Gromer Jeffers Jr. (Jeffers also has some potential challengers to Allred, including an ally of former Rep. Pete Sessions, saying Sessions is “still very interested in taking the district back.”).
— FIRST IN SCORE — NewDem Action Fund, the political arm of the New Democrat Coalition, raised $1.1 million for itself and its members in the first quarter. NewDem Action Fund said it also raised $1.3 million for the DCCC in March.
— Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) raised nearly $1.9 million in the first quarter. His campaign said he had over $3 million in the bank.
WILL HE OR WON’T HE? — What will New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, do? WMUR’s John DiStaso reported that “Republican sources” told him “that the governor has told them he intends to run for reelection and not take on Sen. Jeanne Shaheen next year.” But after DiStaso's report, Sununu put out a statement saying he hasn’t made up his mind and will decide what he’s doing in the spring.
— More Senate news: An adviser to New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told James that she is seriously considering a bid and eying a launch by the end of the month. Pros can read his full Senate recruiting notebook for more. Meanwhile, freshman Democratic Rep. Deb Haaland said she wouldn’t run for the Senate.

House Democrats launch probe into EPA officials' ties to utilities,www.politico.com,ZACK COLMAN,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/11/house-democrats-epa-utilities-1345505,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
The House Energy and Commerce Committee is launching an investigation into whether top EPA officials violated ethics rules by launching a rollback of air pollution regulations that benefited their former lobbying clients in the electric utility sector.
The committee's Democrats are seeking to probe communications between the utilities and an industry group that was run from the offices of the lobbying firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, which had employed Bill Wehrum, EPA's air chief, and David Harlow, the EPA air office's senior counsel. That industry organization, the Utility Air Regulatory Group, generated $8.2 million in 2017 alone for the lobbying firm and raised questions about whether Wehrum's involvement with it followed ethics guidelines, as first reported by POLITICO . Story Continued Below
""[W]e are deeply troubled by several reports of allegedly unethical behavior by EPA officials,"" Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.),subcommittee chairs Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) wrote in letters that were sent Thursday to Hunton and eight utilities.
The lawmakers are seeking communications betweenthe power companies and Hunton with EPA officials and to clarify their relationship to UARG. And the lawmakers are looking at whether Wehrum and Harlow worked on a December 2017 EPA policy memo that benefited one of their former clients, Michigan utility company DTE Energy. Democrats have separately asked the EPA Office of Inspector General to investigate that matter for a possible ethics violation.

""These allegations have raised substantial questions regarding whether Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow are properly carrying out the [Clean Air Act] as directed by Congress or instead changing Agency policies and programs to benefit former clients, who are also clients of your law firm,"" the lawmakers wrote to Hunton Andrew Kurth managing partner Wendell Taylor.
POLITICO in February reported that Wehrum continued to hold meetings for UARG while working at Hunton even as he was being considered for his job at EPA. A June 2017 meeting at Hunton's office, which Wehrum attended, included a UARG proposed budget and policy blueprint that laid out many of the regulatory changes the group sought — and which resembles the policy moves that Wehrum is now overseeing at EPA. Those documents, first obtained by POLITICO, listed UARG member companies and the fees they were to pay Hunton for UARG dues.
Since becoming EPA's assistant administrator for Air and Radiation, Wehrum has moved aggressively to undo regulations related to climate change, smog and mercury emissions that many coal-burning utilities have long opposed.
Wehrum hasmaintained that his client was UARG, not the utilities that made up its membership. At EPA, he has recused himself from participating in ""particular matters"" involving UARG.
Energy and Commerce Democrats want to shed more light on the relationship between Hunton, UARG and the companies, particularly whether the utilities used shareholders' funding or money derived from rate-paying customers to cover the fees. The companies that were sent the letters were DTE, Southern Company, American Electric Power, Ameren, FirstEnergy, Tennessee Valley Authority, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and Vistra Energy.
The committee also requested all paperwork ""relating to the legal status of UARG,"" as well as documentation regarding UARG'sfunding requests and workshop materials, and communications with 22 current and former EPA officials. It gave an April 25 deadline for handing over those materials."

LEESBURG, Va. — Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday sharply criticizedPresident Donald Trump’s planned picks for the Federal Reserve, Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, warning that the hyperpartisan duo would be “dangerous” for the economy. “With stiff competition, these two appointments to the Fed are the worst, ill-suited appointments that the president could come up with,” Pelosi told reporters at a news briefing on the second day of the House Democratic Caucus retreat. “There are so many bridges too far here, but this is a really dangerous one.”
Democrats and Republicans alike have skewered Cain, a former pizza magnate, and Moore, a former member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board, to the central bank’s coveted board of governors. Story Continued Below
The stakes are high, Democrats argue, because Trump has repeatedly lashed out Chairman Jerome Powell on Twitter for hiking interest rates and has reportedly threatened to fire him.
“It’s not clear to me whether that’s reality or a 'Saturday Night Live' skit,” House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Thursday morning. “It’s an embarrassment and the likelihood is that they will be withdrawn.”"

“I get it, you know,“ Vice President Mike Pence said of Pete Buttigieg's comments. ""They’re all competing with one another for how much more liberal they can be.“ | Alexandra Beier/Getty Images Print
Days after South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg directly attacked Mike Pence for his stance on LGBT issues, the Republican vice president denounced the comments, saying the 2020 hopeful “knows better.”
“He’s said some things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally. And he knows better,” Pence said Thursday in a CNBC interview. “He knows me.” Story Continued Below
This browser does not support the Ad element.
Conservatives have accused the 37-year-old candidate of bashing the vice president to endear his campaign — which garnered an explosion of interest in the last month — among those on the left, particularly liberal Christians and the LGBT community.
Buttigieg on Sunday again went after Pence from the campaign trail, speaking about his own decision to come out as gay in 2015 at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington, D.C.
“If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,” Buttigieg said . “And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me — your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”
The mayor has a history with the vice president that dates back to 2011, when he met Pence — then a congressman for Indiana — at the Indy 500 automobile race. On that day, “a long and complicated relationship began,” Buttigieg writes in his memoir, “The Shortest Way Home.”
Both men have described positive past interactions when meeting in the world of Indiana politics, at times lauding the other’s policies or personality.
“I worked very closely with Mayor Pete when I was governor of the state of Indiana, we had a great working relationship,” Pence said Thursday.
Buttigieg has complimented his former governor, too, recounting in his memoir a day in 2016 when he called Pence’s economic development plan “visionary.” Pence returned the praise by saying South Bend was “so blessed to have an energetic, innovative, forward-looking, creative mayor.”
It’s unclear when exactly the relationship took a turn for Buttigieg. He writes that the former governor was different from his predecessors for his fixation on social issues. He spoke out publicly in 2015 against Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a piece of legislation Pence signed that people argued could be used to discriminate against LGBT individuals.

But Buttigieg has ratcheted up attacks on Pence since joining the crowded pool of 2020 candidates, calling the vice president “ the cheerleader of the porn star presidency ” and accusing him of being “ at best complicit ” with the resurgence of white nationalism.
Some have speculated the mayor is jockeying to appeal to moderates, or even some on the right. Buttigieg has a background in business and the military, regularly attends church and comes from a mid-sized industrial Midwestern city — perhaps traits that could help his odds in a general election.
The relatively unknown candidate first faces the challenge of a primary race against big-name Democrats like former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris.
“I get it, you know,“ Pence said of Buttigieg's comments. “Nineteen people running for party on that side, in a party that’s sliding off to the left. And they’re all competing with one another for how much more liberal they can be.“ This story tagged under: "

That’s below the $750 billion the White House requested, but well above Budget Control Act caps. Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said they’re forging ahead despite opposition from progressive lawmakers who want to see higher non-defense spending.
""When they become chair of the Appropriations Committee, they can figure it out,"" Lowey said.
Kill the F-15EX: Four members of the F-35 caucus sent a letter to House defense committee leaders this month asking them to zero out funding for eight Boeing F-15EX jets, saying the savings aren’t there, the Air Force didn’t ask for them and F-35s are more capable, O’Brien reports .
HASC MARKUP: The House Armed Services Committee will mark up its version of the National Defense Authorization Act on June 12, O’Brien writes. The full markup schedule is here .
The full House could consider the bill by July. The Senate side begins its markup next month.
Driving the Day SPACE FORCE: Top Pentagon leaders head over to the Senate Armed Services Committee this morning to discuss the department’s proposal to create a new Space Force. Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, and U.S. Strategic Command chief Gen. John Hyten will be on hand to defend the plan. Hyten this week was nominated to be the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
Speaking of Space Force , our own Jacqueline Klimas got a copy of the Air Force’s five-phase plan to stand up the new service. Read about it here .
And the Center for Strategic and International Studies is out with a short documentary on the history of the debate to create a separate space service.
QUICK LAUNCH: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has awarded contracts to three companies to demonstrate their ability to conduct space launches on short notice, Klimas writes .
Each company received $400,000 and will be given a 30-day window next year in which to launch a payload. Companies that complete the mission receive a $2 million prize and get to take part in a second round.
KOREA REPORT MOON MEETING: South Korean President Moon Jae-in arrives at the White House at noon today to meet with President Donald Trump and discuss ways to revive stalled talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
The visit comes as Kim Jong Un , in forceful comments reported by state media, promises a “telling blow” against countries that deliver sanctions, The Washington Post reports .
“Kim underlined the need to ‘vigorously advance socialist construction’ based on North Korea’s own efforts, technology and resources, ‘under the uplifted banner of self-reliance, so as to deal a telling blow to the hostile forces who go with bloodshot eyes miscalculating that sanctions can bring the DPRK to its knees.’”
HOMELAND SECURITY MORE TROOPS? Trump said Wednesday he may end up sending more troops to the southern border due to the situation there.
“I'm going to have to call up more military. Our military, don’t forget, can’t act like a military would act. Because if they got a little rough, everybody would go crazy,” he said.
More housing: Shanahan has approved a Department of Health and Human Services request to find locations to house up to 5,000 migrant children who are unaccompanied, per Reuters.

ON THE HILL TURKEY SITUATION: David Satterfield, nominated to be ambassador to Turkey, appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at 2:30 today for his confirmation hearing. Turkey’s decision to purchase a Russian air defense system in defiance of Washington should be Topic A.
Turkey’s foreign minister, meanwhile , said his country may end up purchasing jets from Russia if Ankara is booted from the F-35 program, Reuters reports .
“If the F-35s don’t work out, I will again have to procure the jets I need from elsewhere. ... There are [Russian] Su-34, Su-57 and others. I will absolutely meet my needs from somewhere until I can produce it myself,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.
PAUL’S MESSAGE TO POMPEO: Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) warned Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Wednesday that the administration can’t go to war with Iran without permission from Congress, writes POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi.
“Only Congress can declare war,” Paul told Pompeo, after asking whether the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force covered Iran. Pompeo attempted to connect Iran with al-Qaeda.
INDUSTRY INTEL TWO DOZEN HAWKEYES: Northrop Grumman nabbed a $3.1 billion contract to produce 24 E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft for the Navy, the Pentagon announced Wednesday.
CLOUD COMPETITION: “The Pentagon has narrowed the field of potential awardees for its $10 billion cloud computing contract to just two companies: Amazon and Microsoft, Defense Department spokeswoman Elissa Smith said Wednesday,” The Washington Post writes .
“The Pentagon separately determined that alleged conflicts of interest on the part of Amazon Web Services did not adversely impact the procurement, concluding an investigation it opened in late February. The Pentagon’s investigation did uncover ‘potential ethical violations’ that would be forwarded to the Defense Department inspector general for further inquiry, Smith said Monday.
“The Pentagon’s decision effectively removes IBM and Oracle from the running for one of the biggest military IT procurements in history.”

Bernhardt set for confirmation,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-energy/2019/04/11/bernhardt-set-for-confirmation-423633,"With help from Zack Colman The Senate is on course to confirm David Bernhardt as Interior secretary today, despite lingering concerns over offshore drilling and conflicts of interest.
— President Donald Trump signed two executive orders Wednesday to speed up pipeline development — only to swiftly be met with legal threats.
— The Senate Energy Committee holds a hearing today examining how to handle global climate change.
WELCOME TO THURSDAY! Tamborrino. James Dozier of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions was the first to correctly guess there are six states that have sent three women to the Senate (California, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska and New Hampshire). Some procedural trivia today: In what year did the Senate first adopt the rule to limit the filibuster by requiring two-thirds majority to end debate?
Driving the Day TODAY'S THE DAY: The Senate meets this morning to vote on David Bernhardt's nomination for Interior chief before skipping town for a two-week recess. The acting secretary is expected to have the votes to sail through after clearing a procedural hurdle last night in a 56-41 bipartisan vote. Three Democrats supported Bernhardt Wednesday: Sens. Joe Manchin , Martin Heinrich and Kyrsten Sinema , as well as independent Sen. Angus King .
Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott — both of whom have doubled down against offshore drilling off Florida's coast — voted to advance Bernhardt's nomination after extensive conversations with the Trump administration, but without firm assurances that their state would be left off the table.
"" Legally,"" Interior can't take Florida off the table ""until it has taken public comment on the matter,"" Rubio tweeted , adding: ""I am VERY confident that when all is said & done no oil drilling is coming to our coastline.""
But Interior already has taken comments — Rubio even signed one letter of opposition in the docket — and it's unclear why the next phase of the plan has not emerged in the more than a year since then. Bernhardt says things are still at ""step one,"" but industry sources say the Eastern Gulf and Atlantic remain in the yet-to-be-released plan.
Rubio may be banking on Congress extending an existing ban on Eastern Gulf drilling if the administration does not remove it in response to local opposition. The current moratorium expires in 2022, meaning it may not see action until after the next presidential election, where Republicans are warning Trump that oil's unpopularity in Florida could be a political liability. Rubio has introduced a bill, S. 13 (116) , to extend the moratorium through 2027.
— SPOTTED: If you're on the Hill today, you might see some bicyclists with banners circling Union Station and the House and Senate office buildings, who are there to draw attention to what they see as Bernhardt's conflicts of interests. ""Swamp creature"" protests against Bernhardt also took place on the Hill Wednesday. See it .
AROUND THE AGENCIES TRUMP UNVEILS PIPELINE ORDERS: The president signed two executive orders Wednesday that he said would drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to permit oil and gas pipelines, Pro's Ben Lefebvre reports. The orders direct federal agencies to reduce the power that states, investors and even federal departments have to delay or block pipeline construction — although even Trump admitted that it may not produce the answer project backers want. ""Now, you may not get it at all, but it's going to be quick,"" Trump said in a speech in Crosby, Texas. (More here on the finer details.)
— The action drew legal threats almost immediately , as Pro's Annie Snider reports . 2020 presidential contender and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued a statement with his attorney general vowing ""to challenge any attempt by the administration to illegally constrain Washington's authority to protect our state’s natural resources.""
And it's not just Democrats: The bipartisan Western Governors Association said in a statement that the governors ""have concerns"" about the order but said they ""welcome the opportunity"" offered in the order to work with agencies on improving the Clean Water Act process — something the group has been requesting for months. Meanwhile Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said the ""top-down order threatens to undermine good environmental stewardship.""
But the EOs got at least one governor’s backing: Republican Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon applauded the directives despite being a member of WGA. His state has a major interest in a coal export facility blocked by Washington state under the Clean Water Act provision — a move Wyoming has fought in court. ""Far from weakening environmental regulation, this executive order recenters the application of the law on its original purpose as a tool to protect our water quality not a platform for electioneering,"" Gordon said in a statement.

— Fact check: In his remarks from Texas, Trump told the crowd: ""We actually buy a lot of oil from other countries like Russia because we aren't being permitted to build a pipeline through New York state."" He's referring to the Constitution pipeline in New York, which Energy Secretary Rick Perry has also railed against — but which transports natural gas. A delivery of Russian gas to New England made headlines back in January 2018. Oil imports from Russia, meanwhile, have fallen by half since the beginning of the decade, reaching 320,000 bpd in January,"

Driving the Day GAO ASSEMBLING A CAPITOL HILL GEEK SQUAD — The struggle by some lawmakers to ask coherent questions of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during his marathon Hill appearance last year intensified longstanding grumbles that lawmakers need access to top-notch technical advice, whether through a revived Office of Technology Assessment (the congressional tech guru office killed off in the ’90s) or the Government Accountability Office. Now GAO's out with a detailed plan to do exactly that via what it's calling the Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics Team. ""This is the GAO’s strong and official response recognizing that Congress has these key needs,"" GAO chief scientist and STAA co-managing director Tim Persons tells MT.
—The STAA team is on track to have 70 full-time staffers by the end of this fiscal year, but that's just the start, Persons said. The plan is to at least double the team so that it’s big and broad enough to help lawmakers navigate everything from AI to quantum computing to, yes, social media, he said. ""The blessing of the internet is that it's open, and the curse of the internet is that it's open, and often it's elucidating that double-edge sword"" to lawmakers before they go face-to-face with someone like Zuckerberg. ""It's, 'Here are the implications of these things, and here are what the best minds are telling us.’”
THUNE EYES HOTLINE ON ROBOCALLS BILL — As the Senate Commerce telecom subcommittee holds a hearing this morning on unwanted robocalls, chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) is planning an attempt to pass his own robocall legislation, known as the TRACED Act, S. 151 (116) , through the full Senate by unanimous consent following the Easter break. “It’d be a nice bipartisan accomplishment for this place right now,” he told John on Wednesday. “We need some of those.” The bill, which would boost the FCC’s power to crack down on illegal robocalls, cleared the full Commerce committee last week.
— During today’s hearing, featuring testimony from USTelecom, Nebraska’s attorney general and the National Consumer Law Center, Thune said he wants to learn “where we are and why the tools we have today don’t work and why we need to enhance not only the powers of the FCC but hopefully create the credible threat of criminal prosecution along the way.”
TECH’S LATEST CONGRESSIONAL GRILLING SESSION — Senate Judiciary Republicans on Wednesday floated an array of actions to rein in a tech sector they said has grown too powerful. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) called for swift action to draft and move federal privacy legislation while jabbing Facebook’s recent plan to boost protections for users . “At least here in the United States Senate, Mark Zuckerberg’s pivot to privacy isn’t fooling anybody,” she said at a hearing on tech company bias. And Ted Cruz (R-Texas) repeatedly raised the specter of altering Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which offers online platforms broad protection from liability for user-posted content. “If Congress were to repeal Section 230 of the CDA,” Cruz argued at one point, platforms would have more incentive to remove harmful hoaxes.
— But how close are we to a bill on 230? Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) praised Cruz for conducting “information gathering” on the statue by hosting the hearing. But he said he did not foresee immediate legislative action on the matter. “I don’t know that we’re ready to write anything at this precise moment because I think we need to get a better understanding of the potential ramifications,” he told Cristiano during an interview. And Hawley stressed that any action on Section 230 still had to be “pro-competition” and not “squelch new entrants into the market” — a tacit acknowledgment of criticisms of the potential action.
SPEAKING OF LEGISLATION — Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) teased a forthcoming bill addressing broadband mapping accuracy during Wednesday’s hearing on the topic. “Improving the nation’s broadband maps starts with better coordination and information sharing among federal agencies responsible for administering broadband deployment programs,” Wicker said, stressing the need for coordination among the FCC, NTIA and USDA. “I hope we will soon have legislation.” Existing broadband maps put out by the FCC have been broadly criticized as inaccurate.
AMAZON WORKERS TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE — Amazon is defending itself against employees who assert in a new online petition that the company must do more to thwart climate change. A spokesman pointed to plans announced in February for 50 percent of all shipments to Amazon customers to be net zero carbon by 2030. Amazon has also pledged to eventually use 100 percent renewable energy, although employees criticized the lack of a firm deadline. The company is expected to release a more detailed report on its carbon footprint and sustainability goals later this year. “Amazon’s sustainability team is using a science-based approach to develop data and strategies to ensure a rigorous approach to our sustainability work,” the company said in a statement.
— But the company did not address other complaints raised in the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice petition, including its political donations to climate change-denying lawmakers or its cloud computing services that help oil and gas companies extract fossil fuels. That petition has garnered more than 4,500 signatures. Employees have put Amazon on the defensive before, mobilizing, for instance, to urge the company to stop selling facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies.
GROUPS OPPOSE PRIVATE AIRWAVES SALE — The Taxpayers Protection Alliance, Americans for Tax Reform and other taxpayer or free market groups warned the FCC against a proposal from satellite companies to let them privately sell their airwaves licenses for 5G use, in a letter Wednesday. The FCC is weighing options including a public auction or those private arrangements to determine the right path forward to reallocate the satellite companies’ midband spectrum, known as the C-band, for 5G services.
— The coalition urged the FCC to reject the C-Band Alliance’s “self-serving scheme, and instead, oversee a public auction that would allow for the most competitive allocation of licenses to best enable 5G deployment. This policy would result in billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury — and the U.S taxpayer.”
CAP TURNS ITS ATTENTION TO TECH POLICY — The Center for American Progress is starting up a tech policy team to go along with its squads focused on topics like national security, immigration and health, CAP senior vice president of policy and strategy Ben Olinsky tells MT. The liberal think tank once headed by John Podesta has dabbled in tech, Olinsky said, but tech’s emerging prominence in national political debates requires a more centralized approach.
— ""There's a clear need for a progressive framework for how to deal with all these issues,"" said Olinsky, pointing to ""content management especially in the context of hate, privacy, algorithmic bias, growing competition in the tech sector, and the high levels of inequality in today's winner-take-all economy driven by tech.""

Driving the Day The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee convenes this morning to review the president's 2020 budget request forthe National Institutes of Health. NIH Director Francis Collins is expected to testify. House appropriators from both parties last week expressed their opposition to Trump‘s proposed 12 percent cut to NIH, which lawmakers fear would slash funding for research on Alzheimer's, cancer and infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS.
ON THE HILL REIKI FOR ALL? HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS IN SANDERS’ MEDICARE PROPOSAL — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) touted his revised Medicare for All proposal Wednesday. It would do a lot more than just expand insurance coverage. Pro’s Alice Miranda Ollstein and Joanne Kenen look under the hood and explain how it would transform the nation’s $3.7 trillion health care system, touching on everything from building primary and rural health care capacity to addressing socioeconomic disparities to alternative medicine — and focusing on 14 broad elements you may not know about. As for the laying on of hands, coverage of reiki would still need to be approved by HHS, based on expert advice. More here .
DRUGMAKERS ON THE HOT SEAT — Insulin prices are rocketing higher and if drugmakers don’t fix the problem, the government might have to set prices for the lifesaving diabetes medication, Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) said during a hearing Wednesday. Needless to say, the CEOs from Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi didn’t support that idea. Pallone indicated he’d rather not go there either but said something has to give because the current system ""is not working."" The three manufacturers said they would consider lowering list prices if the Trump administration's proposal to eliminate rebates went into effect across government and commercial plans.
... That idea looks to have at least a modicum of bipartisan support. After the hearing, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) told reporters that eliminating rebates from the g supply chain could be part of the solution to high costs. Her interest is notable because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have derided the administration's proposal, saying it would raise seniors' premiums and leave drugmakers' profits untouched. But DeGette was confident that the committee could come up with bipartisan legislation on broader drug chain reforms this year. Others look to be behind it too: Georgia Republican Rep. Buddy Carter , now in his third term, joked that Wednesday's grilling was the first show of bipartisanship he’d seen since arriving in Congress.
PBMS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE — Hearings like these can sometimes feel like a circular firing squad, with each interest blaming the other for the high cost of drugs. The day before was PBMs' turn, before the Senate Finance Committee. And chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) followed up on Wednesday, asking HHS's inspector general to investigate PBMs' practice of reimbursing pharmacies less than what they charge health plans for the drugs, also known as spread pricing. Read their letter here .
... Several state governments have taken action on spread pricing. Ohio ended Medicaid contracts with CVS and OptumRx in 2018 and this year sued OptumRx to recover $16 million it said the PBM overcharged the government. Pennsylvania and Kentucky also recently reported that spread pricing cost their governments millions.
INSIDE THE HUMPHREY BUILDING LOOKING FOR A SECOND OPINION — The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to protect its signature Medicaid initiative, appealing a federal court decision that blocked new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The filings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on behalf of HHS Secretary Alex Azar and CMS Administrator Seema Verma and their agencies seek to overturn District Court Judge James Boasberg's March 27 ruling that the administration failed to justify that adding employment conditions and other changes to Medicaid in Arkansas and Kentucky advanced the program's basic purpose of providing health coverage.
... While only those two states are directly affected by Boasberg’s decision, more than a dozen other conservative states where work rule waivers have been approved or submitted to the Trump administration will be watching to see whether their programs will meet the same fate or if a higher court can find legal safe ground for the linchpin of Trump‘s Medicaid reforms.
— Hutchinson wants faster action: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is presiding over the only program that has removed people from the rolls for noncompliance with work reporting requirements, has his eyes set on an even higher authority. He has already asked the DOJ to request an expedited appeal. “An expedited timeline from such an appeal should put this case in the position to get to the United States Supreme Court, if necessary, in a timely fashion,” he said in a statement.
EYE ON FDA ON SALT, TRUMP TEAM LOOKS TO LOCK IN OBAMA POLICY — Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told POLITICO shortly before he departed his post that guidance establishing sodium targets is in the final stages of clearance at the agency, suggesting it will head to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review in a matter of weeks. The policy, which pressures the food industry to reduce the amount of salt in processed foods was one of former President Barack Obama’s signature nutrition initiatives. The goal is to have Americans consume less salt, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the country. His remarks led some to suspect FDA was fast-tracking the sodium targets to try to circumvent lobbying from the industry.
... And the food industry isn’t sitting on its hands. Pro’s Helena Bottemiller Evich reports that some of its largest players are attempting to get the administration to pump the brakes — a stealth lobbying effort that’s laid bare a rift in the industry. More here .

Trouble in Mnuchin-land? — Per our Katy O’Donnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on CNBC defended his recommendation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to the White House, despite President Donald Trump's repeated disparagement of the Fed chief. ‘I don't feel like I picked the wrong person, but I respect the president's views and his views of the economy, where he's had tremendous insight.”

MARKETS WALL STREET EKES OUT GAINS — Reuters’ Stephen Culp: “Technology stocks led Wall Street slightly higher on Wednesday, as U.S. inflation data proved to be benign and the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting were unsurprising. The blue-chip Dow, held back by industrial stocks, squeaked into positive territory at the closing bell. The three major U.S. indexes were relatively unchanged following the release of the Fed’s minutes, which reaffirmed the central bank’s patience regarding future interest rate hikes.” Read more .
LYFT SHARES HIT NEW LOW — Reuters: “Shares of recently listed Lyft Inc fell to a fresh low and closed the day down almost 11 percent on Wednesday on news that rival Uber Technologies Inc was close to filing its own initial public offering.

But Uber is still aiming high — NYT’s Michael J. de la Merced and Kate Conger: “Uber gave the first sign of how big its highly anticipated initial public offering might be, telling some investors that its stock sale might value it at up to $100 billion, people briefed on the matter said.
“The number, which is below a $120 billion valuation that had been floated by investment bankers, highlights the size of the ride-hailing colossus as it prepares to embark on its market debut, the biggest in recent years. Its shares are expected to begin trading on the public markets next month.” Read more .

INFLATION STAYED TAME IN MARCH — WSJ’s Sarah Chaney: “U.S. consumer prices rose more than usual in March, driven by an increase in volatile oil prices that masked moderate underlying price pressures. The consumer-price index, which measures what Americans pay for household items and services such as fresh fruit or lawn care, increased 0.41 percent in March from the prior month, the Labor Department said Wednesday.

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— It’s official: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the administration needs more time to consider House Democrats’ request for returns, though Trump himself flatly said Wednesday that he won’t turn them over.
— Mnuchin’s response could also add further scrutiny to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig, who just finished his first two days of congressional testimony since taking over the agency.
— Bills galore: There are new proposals coming on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s pass-through deduction and IRS regulation of paid tax preparers.

Driving the Day AS EXPECTED: Mnuchin’s letter came as no surprise to those who have heard White House and administration officials, plus other allies and advocates for the president, raise all sorts of questions about ’s request for Trump’s returns.
As Pro Tax’s Brian Faler noted , Mnuchin’s letter — which didn’t outright refuse Neal’s request — nonetheless sent the two sides further down the road toward meeting in court. The Treasury secretary said one reason the department missed the deadline was that it had to consult with the Justice Department about its response, and Mnuchin also voiced concerns about ensuring taxpayer privacy and whether Democrats had a legitimate reason for requesting Trump’s returns.
What’s next? Democrats are expected to eventually subpoena Trump’s tax returns if they have to, though Neal (D-Mass.) is expected to send a second, more sternly worded letter before taking that step. But it’s still not clear when that next letter might come. For instance, a House Democratic aide told Pro Tax’s Aaron Lorenzo that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) doesn’t want outside issues like this overshadowing the caucus’ current retreat.
Rock, hard place: The fact that Mnuchin is the one responding could also make matters more awkward for IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig, who was the recipient of Neal’s original request last week. Rettig noted before the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday that the IRS is “supervised” by the Treasury. But that line of thinking clearly didn’t sit well with some key Democrats. “It’s a sign of political interference that Secretary Mnuchin is handling this request when authority has been delegated to the IRS,” said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on Finance, who also maintained that there was “no excuse” for Mnuchin blowing past Neal’s deadline.
Interesting, via The Associated Press : ”Trump has repeatedly asked aides as to the status of the House request, and has inquired about the ‘loyalty’ of the top officials at the IRS, according to one outside adviser who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.”
IT’S BACK: Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and all but one Senate Democrat ( Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona) rolled out a bill on Wednesday to expand both the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit. The Working Families Tax Relief Act would, among other things, boost the EITC for families with children, expand the EITC for workers without children, make the CTC fully refundable, create a Young Child Tax Credit and allow families advanced payments on their EITC.
Bennet and Brown have released versions of the bill during the previous two Congresses, but the proposal is probably still best viewed through a 2020 context — and not just because Bennet himself is likely to run for president. (In fact, another half-dozen confirmed presidential candidates are co-sponsors of the measure.) The bill underscores that Democrats, should they regain more power in D.C., are looking to the tax code to both force rich people to pay more (as in with Sen. Elizabeth Warren ’s wealth tax) and to potentially offer more benefits to lower levels of the income scale. (See, for instance, Sen. Kamala Harris ’ LIFT Act.)
WATCH OUT FOR IT: Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) will be dropping a bill today to make permanent the TCJA’s 20 percent deduction for pass-through income, a proposal already introduced in the House by Reps. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) and Jason Smith (R-Mo.). The two Republicans are both tax writers, and Daines, along with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), played a big role in making the law’s pass-through provisions more generous. More than 100 outside groups are on board with the proposal, Morning Tax has also learned.
This one, too: Wyden and Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) will be introducing legislation today that would allow the IRS to install minimum standards for paid tax preparers. The measure would allow the agency to strip tax preparers of their required identification numbers if found to be incompetent or fraudulent. Under the measure, preparers would have to prove their competency at a variety of tasks and complete continuing education requirements.
As the separate legislation suggests, the IRS revamp that passed the House this week, and that Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) hopes to quickly shepherd through his chamber, doesn’t include any provisions regulating paid preparers. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), like Cardin and Wyden, has an interest in more oversight of paid preparers, but that idea proved too controversial to be included in the current bipartisan IRS measure. (One reason for that: Some on the right are squeamish about giving the IRS more regulatory power over preparers.)
And a new campaign: Americans for Prosperity, part of Charles Koch’s political network, is launching a six-figure ad campaign today against a 25-cent increase in the gas tax. As part of the new campaign, AFP released state-by-state analysis of a gas tax increase across the U.S. and launched digital ads across 20 states and in 30 congressional districts — targeting, among others, 13 members of the House Ways and Means Committee (seven Democrats, six Republicans) and eight members of the Senate Finance Committee (five Republicans, three Democrats). See the sample ads .
 ATTENDANCE REQUIRED: Dutch lawmakers say they will insist that Shell send someone to a hearing next week on multinational tax avoidance, Reuters reported. Shell is of special interest to the Netherlands because of how the oil giant, whose parent company is headquartered in The Hague, is structured. (For instance, the Dutch can’t tax dividends sent to shareholders of a former British part of Shell.) The company’s chief executive has said that an advocate for all Dutch companies should represent the business community.

STATE NEWS ONE GOES UP, OTHER GOES DOWN: Three of the top GOP leaders in Texas — Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and House Speaker Dennis Bonnen — have signed off on increasing the state’s sales tax as a way to decrease property taxes, the Texas Tribune reports. The big catch: Lawmakers would also have to agree to a bill that curbs how much local governments can raise property taxes in a given year. Under the plan, the sales tax would rise from 6.25 percent to 7.25 percent. But while Republicans control the state legislature, the GOP will need to win over some Democrats on the plan, because the tax changes require amending the state constitution. And there are definitely Democrats dead set against raising the sales tax, which would affect all Texans, to help property owners with their taxes.

Senate confirms Bernhardt to head Interior,www.politico.com,ANTHONY ADRAGNA,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/11/david-bernhardt-secretary-interior-department-1345662,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
The Senate confirmed David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist and Interior Department veteran, to serve as the agency's 53rd secretary by a 56-41 vote on Thursday, rejecting ethics concerns raised by Democrats.
Four members of the Democratic caucus — Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Martin Heinrich (N.M.), Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Angus King (I-Maine) — joined with the unified Republican bloc to support Bernhardt’s confirmation. Story Continued Below
“There are few others who have the kinds of experience that he has that qualify him for Interior,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said on the floor Thursday. “I’m thankful there are qualified people out there like Mr. Bernhardt and his family who are still willing to wade through the muck and serve the people of the United States knowing they will be called a liar.”
Bernhardt, currently acting secretary, will replace Ryan Zinke, who left Interior in January in the midst of several ongoing ethical investigations.
Bernhardt won bipartisan backing from the chamber despite concerns that he has conflicts of interests related to past lobbying clients, criticism that he failed to keep adequate records, and worries about the department’s plans to expand offshore drilling along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Florida Republicans Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott voted in favor of Bernhardt after expressing confidence the state's coasts would not be opened to drilling, though they received no concrete public assurances along those lines.
Some Democrats accused Republicans of failing to put the public interest ahead of industry's desire to access federal property.

“I would remind all my colleagues on the Atlantic Coast that, again, I asked him to at least commit that he wouldn’t do drilling off the shore of states that didn’t want drilling off their shores. He would not commit to that,” Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor. “It’s hard to imagine someone whose background is so at odds with the department’s mission than Mr. Bernhardt’s.”
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told POLITICO she decided to back Bernhardt after receiving written assurances about his plans concerning offshore drilling.
“I exchanged correspondence with him on the issue that is of most concern to me, which is I do not want to see offshore drilling off the coast of Maine,” she said. “I’m very satisfied with his responses on that.”
Bernhardt served as the solicitor of Interior during the George W. Bush administration, but subsequent lobbying and legal work on behalf of fossil fuel and water interests have drawn heavy scrutiny. He joined the Trump administration as deputy secretary in August 2017 upon confirmation by the Senate.
Thursday's approval by the Senatewon't quell Democratic concerns over Bernhardt’s transparency and conflicts of interest. Multiple lawmakers have demanded an investigation into his role in blocking the release of a study examining a pesticides impact on endangered species.
Over in the House, Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) told POLITICO last week he wants Bernhardt to testify ""as soon as"" possible upon confirmation and last week requested a host of documents from Bernhardt’s former lobbying client about their coordination on endangered species issues.
House Democrats have also demanded Interior cooperate in an ongoing GAO probe related to that prior client, Westlands Water District, raised questions about compliance with record keeping requirements and sought a copy of the department’s reorganization plan in recent days.
Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) said the burden would be especially high on those in his party who supported Bernhardt's nomination.
“The Democrats who support him, they do so somewhat at their own peril,” he told reporters. “If I vote for somebody … I made sure that I knew how to reach them and that they’d be responsive, and I hope that will be the case with those that vote for him today.”"
South Korea could be betrayed by Trump’s auto tariffs,www.politico.com,MEGAN CASSELLA,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/11/south-korea-trump-auto-tariffs-1343290,"SEOUL, South Korea — President Donald Trump’s outstanding threat to slap steep duties on nearly all U.S. imports of cars and car parts is not aimed directly at South Korea, but the Asian nation may wind up caught in the crossfire just the same.
Although South Korean President Moon Jae-in‘s visit to the White House on Thursday will be primarily focused on nuclear diplomacy, it comes as the looming automotive tariffs threaten to hit one of the nation‘s top export industries. The possibility has prompted a deep fear among public- and private-sector officials here of more trade turmoil with the U.S. — and concerns over how that could ripple through the broader bilateral relationship.
“If that happens, I think the days of solid Korea-U.S. alliance may be facing a moment of truth,” said Choi Byung-il, president of the Korea International Economic Association in Seoul and a former South Korean trade negotiator.
Well-known South Korean brands like Hyundai, Kia and Genesis as well as thousands of lesser-known parts companies supply American automakers and foreign names alike. South Korea sends more autos to the United States than anything else, exporting $21 billion worth of cars in 2016, according to U.S. trade data .
South Korea had hoped to shield its export-driven economy from Trump's trade wrath by working with the U.S. president from the start. It was the first country to agree to renegotiate its bilateral trade deal with the U.S. and remains the only country to conclude and implement an updated agreement with . Yet officials in Seoul have received no assurances about whether the nation will avoid potential auto duties that could be as high as 25 percent.
Some advisers and analysts note that Moon is in a difficult spot when it comes to approaching both economic and security issues at once with Trump. South Korea is not interested in mixing trade and nuclear issues, and some fear that pressing too firmly against additional tariffs would lead Trump to use the threat as leverage, perhaps over questions of military spending and defense cost-sharing.
“You don’t want to have a situation where you commercialize the alliance,” one senior South Korean government official said, requesting anonymity to speak freely about sensitive discussions.
The White House, for its part, said in its formal announcement of Moon’s visit that discussions would focus on the latest developments regarding North Korea “as well as bilateral matters,” but it did not cite specific issues.
Still, the auto tariff issue remains top of mind for many across South Korea, which is already facing a period of economic stagnancy. New car tariffs would be considered a particularly offensive move because of how much the nation feels it has already done to bend to Trump’s demands.
It agreed quickly to a renegotiation of the Korea-U.S. free trade deal, known as KORUS, which remains the only major trade negotiation that has successfully concluded. Washington and Seoul began in January to implement the updated deal, where many of the most notable changes focused on cars and light trucks.
The South Korean National Assembly also approved the updated KORUS in December despite not having secured an exemption from car tariffs — considered an act of good faith — even though the threat was then already on the table.
South Korea has also been one of the few countries to cut a deal on one of Trump’s other favorite tariffs: those on steel imports. It agreed in early 2018 to a restrictive 70 percent quota on the amount of steel it sends to the U.S. in order to avoid punitive duties on those exports.
And officials stressed that South Korea has over the past two years cut the size of the trade surplus over the United States, an appeal to Trump’s biggest pet peeve.
If penalties are handed down now, “not just the National Assembly but the people of the Republic of Korea will be against that measure,” said Moon Hee-sang, the speaker of the South Korean National Assembly.
Both he and other South Korean officials inside and outside of government spoke with POLITICO and other U.S. journalists in Seoul as part of the Korea Journalist Fellowship Program. The program was sponsored by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, in partnership with the Korea Foundation.
In Washington, the White House has provided little public information or indication of what its plans are when it comes to car tariffs. The Commerce Department in February sent the White House its analysis of whether imports of cars and car parts pose a threat to U.S. national security, which is expected to recommend some sort of tariff action. But the report has not been released publicly, despite repeated calls from lawmakers, industry groups and others to do so.
Trump had initially been expected to make a decision within 90 days of receiving the report — or by the middle of next month — although White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said recently that his decision could come after that deadline.
It’s not just South Korea that could suffer if Trump decides to move forward with car tariffs. Asked whether Seoul would retaliate if faced with additional tariffs from the U.S., a special adviser to the South Korean president, Moon Chung-in, responded simply: “Every country does it.”
“No ordinary country would just stay idle when it got what we think is an unfair treatment by the United States,” he added, while noting he was speaking in a personal capacity. “South Korea will take corresponding measures.”
The potential consequences of new tariffs would be not just economic, but also geopolitical.
“With everything going on with North Korea, do you want to do something that might signal to the North Koreans that we’re not on the same page, and that we have significant disputes between ourselves?” said Troy Stangarone, the senior director of congressional affairs and trade at the Korea Economic Institute in Washington.
“This would send a signal that maybe we aren’t on the same page,” he added."

Former Giuliani aides still working for Qatar,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/04/11/former-giuliani-aides-still-working-for-qatar-423697,"With David Beavers and Daniel Lippman FORMER GIULIANI AIDES WILL KEEP WORKING FOR QATAR: Two former aides to Rudy Giuliani , Chris Henick and Tony Carbonetti , have extended their lucrative contract to lobby for the Qatari government, according to a Justice Department filing. Henick and Carbonetti first registered last year to help Qatar resolve its standoff with Saudi Arabia and its allies through their firm, Blueprint Advisors . They met with Tim Lenderking , the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for Arabian Gulf affairs, in June and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) in October, according to a disclosure filing. Carbonetti also met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.).
 The contract with Qatar is worth $100,000 a month — but in a disclosure filing submitted in January, Henick and Carbonetti acknowledged they hadn’t been paid yet. “Payments have not yet been received, but Registrant expects to receive full payment for services provided during the reporting period in the coming months,” the duo reported. In an interview on Wednesday, Carbonetti told PI they still hadn’t gotten any money but expected to be paid in full. “It’s all accounting on their end,” he said.
— In the meantime, they’ve covered their expenses — including nearly $1,100 in hotel and dining charges at the Four Seasons in Doha, Qatar, last year; nearly $7,300 in flights and Amtrak trips; and a $141.54 bill at the Monocle on Capitol Hill on the same day they met with Graham — themselves. (Qatar did shell out for a flight to the country last year, according to a disclosure filing.)
— Asked how he’d managed to secure meetings with Pompeo and other top officials, Carbonetti said he had been helped by “old acquaintances.” Giuliani was not among them, he said. But he acknowledged that his years working alongside Giuliani had helped him make the connections on which he’s relying. “Being his chief of staff introduced me to a ton of people over the years,” he said.

— The campaign pushes back against trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking Associations , which support raising the gas tax. “You can’t even maintain current spending without additional revenue,” Neil Bradley , the Chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer, said in an interview on Thursday morning, citing the Highway Trust Fund’s projected shortfall of more than $150 billion by 2029. “There’s nothing conservative about borrowing from China to fill our potholes and pave our roads,” Sue Hensley , the American Trucking Associations’ executive vice president of communications and public affairs, wrote in an email to PI. “In the wise words of President Reagan — who twice oversaw raises in the fuel user fee — ‘the bridges and highways we fail to repair today will have to be rebuilt tomorrow at many times the cost.'”
SPACEX HIRES FORBES TATE: SpaceX , Elon Musk ’s spaceflight company, has added Forbes Tate Partners to its roster of Washington lobbying firms. SpaceX, which launched its Falcon Heavy rocket into space in February, spent $2.2 million on Washington lobbying last year, according to disclosure filings, and also retains American Defense International , Bedrock Strategies , Crossroads Strategies , Harbinger Strategies , Invariant , J.A. Green & Company , PoliSpace and Squire Patton Boggs .
— Virpax Pharmaceuticals also hired Forbes Tate to lobby on “non-opioid pain management.”
HOUSE DEMOCRATS WILL INVESTIGATE EPA OFFICIALS: “The House Energy and Commerce Committee is launching an investigation into whether top [Environmental Protection Agency] officials violated ethics rules by launching a rollback of air pollution regulations that benefited their former lobbying clients in the electric utility sector,” POLITICO ’s Zack Colman reports. “The committee's Democrats are seeking to probe communications between the utilities and an industry group that was run from the offices of the lobbying firm Hunton Andrews Kurth , which had employed Bill Wehrum , EPA's air chief, and David Harlow , the EPA air office's senior counsel. That industry organization, the Utility Air Regulatory Group , generated $8.2 million in 2017 alone for the lobbying firm and raised questions about whether Wehrum's involvement with it followed ethics guidelines, as first reported by POLITICO.” Full story .
SALT CRACKDOWN SPURS LAST-MINUTE LOBBYING: From POLITICO ’s Helena Bottemiller Evich : “The Trump administration is preparing to lock in one of former President Barack Obama ’s signature nutrition priorities — a policy that pressures the food industry to cut back on salt in all manner of processed foods. … But some segments of the food industry are now mounting a late-in-the-game attempt to get the administration to pump the brakes — a stealth lobbying effort that’s laid bare a rift in the industry.”
— Several trade associations are now trying to meet with Office of Management and Budget “officials to present a new study showing that meeting [the Food and Drug Administration]’s sodium targets would be an expensive undertaking for companies across the industry. The effort to engage OMB is being waged by the American Bakers Association , American Frozen Food Institute , International Dairy Foods Association , North American Meat Institute , National Restaurant Association and SNAC International , a trade association that represents more than 400 snack manufacturers, including PepsiCo .” Full story .
FLYING IN: The National Community Pharmacists Association is on the Hill today for the second day of a two-day fly-in. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar addressed the group this morning before they hit the Hill, where they have met or will meet with Sens.

Terri Sewell (D-Ala.), Greg Walden (R-Ore.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), among others.
IF YOU MISSED IT LAST NIGHT: “Lawyers for Gregory B. Craig , a White House counsel in the Obama administration, expect him to be indicted in the coming days on charges related to his work for the Russia-aligned government of Ukraine,” The New York Times ’ Ken Vogel reports. While the case against Craig is related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, “Mr. Craig’s lawyers do not necessarily expect him to be charged with violating the act. Rather, they expect him to be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department officials examining whether he was required to register under the law for work he did in 2012 [on behalf of the Ukrainian government], while he was a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom .” Full story .

He’s both, and he’s only going to win in 2020 if he figures out how to explain that conundrum. By BILL SCHER April 11, 2019
Bill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine , and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show “ The DMZ .” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Is Joe Biden a bold progressive, equally at home with foreign leaders as with construction workers, who led the fight against domestic violence, kept Robert Bork off the Supreme Court, and pushed for gay marriage before his boss did when he ably served as Barack Obama’s wingman, America’s beloved “Uncle Joe”? Or is he “Creepy Joe,” an out-of-touch centrist dinosaur, waxing nostalgic about bipartisanship with segregationists, who carried water for the credit card companies and helped humiliate Anita Hill?
Assuming Biden enters the presidential race, he will immediately be confronted with these dueling, disparate narratives, because they’re both basically true. If Biden is to become the Democratic Party’s nominee for president, he will need to square these two narratives in a single story. Fortunately for Biden, there’s a simple answer: During his long career, he has frequently engaged with controversial issues—from busing to judges to abortion to crime. In doing so, he’s tried to push for the most liberal position that could still appeal to a majority of voters. The danger for Biden is that this story leaves him open to the charge that he was never all that liberal in the first place. Story Continued Below
Biden’s problem runs much deeper than that of the typical politician, who might have to explain away a difficult vote or explain why they now love the ethanol subsidies they used to hate. Biden doesn’t have to answer for an occasional unorthodox position or statement. During his 44 years in Washington, he has taken a lot of politically tricky positions and made a lot of blunt statements in support of those positions. To sift through them all is a colossal task which, while keeping many opposition researchers in business, would overwhelm the average voter.
Here are just a few examples:
While advocating for the 1994 crime bill, now often maligned as a contributor to excessive incarceration, Biden deployed loaded language, such as “predators on our streets” who are “beyond the pale"" and leave Americans with “no choice but to take them out of society.""
In 1975, Biden ripped busing programs designed to desegregate schools as “quota systems to assure a certain number of blacks, Chicanos, or whatever in each school. That, to me, is the most racist concept you can come up with.”
Biden has been a moderate on abortion; he no longer criticizes Roe v. Wade , as he did in the 1970s, but he voted in 2003 for a ban on late-term abortions without health exemptions for mothers, and in 2007, as a presidential candidate, he voiced opposition to ending the ban on federal funding for most abortions.
Over the years, Biden has gone out his way to take digs at the ideological left. In 1974, referencing the memorable attack on George McGovern’s presidential platform, Biden said that “when it comes to issues like abortion, amnesty and acid, I’m about as liberal as your grandmother.”
In the 1980s, Biden argued the left focused on the poor at the expense of the middle class : “In the late 1960s and through the 1970s, we [in the Democratic Party] forgot who our people were. Our main concern has been the poor. Our people were the middle class. The moral business of this country is not the way liberals think of it. The moral business of this country is securing the middle class as well as taking care of the poor.""
More recently, when campaigning for now-Senator Doug Jones in the 2017 Alabama special election, Biden took a gratuitous swipe at Bernie Sanders and class-based populism: “The wealthy are as patriotic as the poor. I know Bernie doesn’t like me saying that, but they are.”
In 1993, when defending the crime bill on the Senate floor, Biden mocked, in a cartoonish, professorial voice, “liberal Democrats who used to say, ‘let’s look at the sociological underpinnings of why this occurred,’” to figure out how government should respond to high crime rates.
As internet investigators have dug up nuggets like these, a portrait of a behind-the-times, culturally conservative, corporate-friendly Biden has emerged. Add those data points to Biden’s management of the Anita Hill hearing, and his sparring with then-professor Elizabeth Warren over bankruptcy legislation , and some progressives seem ready to call Biden a Republican and excommunicate him from the Democratic Party.
But, of course, that uncharitable depiction ignores big pieces of Biden’s career. In 1972, he won his first Senate campaign in part by strongly opposing the Vietnam War. In the 1980s, as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden helped lead the fight to block judges nominated by President Ronald Reagan who Democrats feared would roll back civil rights. Biden most famously helped derail Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, but he and his fellow Senate Democrats also blocked a district court nominee by the name of Jeff Sessions. (While Biden could not have known the impact at the time, the seat for which Bork was nominated ended up being filled by Anthony Kennedy, who decades later wrote the landmark Supreme Court opinion establishing equal marriage rights for gays and lesbians.)
Likewise, Biden made waves in 1986 when he angrily confronted Secretary of State George Shultz about Reagan’s passive approach to ending apartheid in South Africa. After noting the administration’s policy not to have “favorites” in South African politics, Biden exploded: “Dammit! We have favorites in South Africa. The favorites in South Africa are the people who are being repressed by that ugly white regime.” A month later, the Senate passed a bill applying economic sanctions on South Africa, and Congress would override Reagan’s veto of it.
And when Biden helped to craft the 1994 crime bill, he made sure to incorporate another bill he had been working on: the Violence Against Women Act, which is often credited for contributing to a nearly 60 percent decline in domestic violence from 1995 to 2010.
Biden is accused by the left (perhaps fairly), with the help of some stinging criticisms from Warren in her 2004 book, of siding with credit card companies over strapped families in his past support of bankruptcy reform. Yet Biden is also one of the Democratic Party’s loudest supporters of expanded labor union rights; in his recent speech to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, he brought the crowd to its feet when he thundered: “And how do you think we build the great middle class? I’ve been saying this for 45 years. Unions! Unions! … Some politicians are afraid to use the word ‘union.’ Not me!”
Resolving Biden’s true nature is not a matter of tallying all his progressive highlights on one side of the ledger and his not-so-progressive episodes on the other. Also insufficient is attributing his later progressivism to the timeworn political excuse of “evolving,” which is the classier way to say “flip-flopping” when catching up with changing norms and values out of political expediency. Granted, there are surely positions of Biden’s that are examples of such evolution, but that doesn’t capture the common, constant thread of Biden’s career.
One line on Biden’s résumé often attributed to political calculation is the Violence Against Women Act, because it was passed three years after millions of women were disgusted by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s treatment of Anita Hill (Biden himself did not ask Hill any demeaning questions or try to undermine her credibility. But in his role of committee chairman, he also did not confront any committee members who did or otherwise try to restrain their behavior.) New York magazine’s Rebecca Traister , in her recent case against Biden, characterized VAWA as “a form of repentance for Biden’s horrifying failures regarding Anita Hill’s testimony.”
There’s a problem with that chronology: Biden originally introduced VAWA in 1990, one year before the Hill hearings.
According to Jules Witcover’s biography of Biden, that year he was working on a crime bill when he learned that violent crimes against women were rising while those against men had declined. Biden had also been repulsed nine years earlier, while trying to pass a crime package with a provision equating marital rape with other forms of rape. According to Biden’s 2007 memoir, the bill was about to clear committee when Alabama Senator Jeremiah Denton held it up to say, “Damn it, when you get married, you kind of expect you're going to get a little sex.”
Biden drafted the legislation with the help of legal aide Victoria Nourse and the feminist organization NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund (full disclosure: I once worked for this organization, which during my tenure changed its name to Legal Momentum). The first hearing on the bill drew media attention as it featured Marla Hanson , a New York City model whose face was slashed by two men wielding razor blades. Hanson had rebuffed the sexual advances of her landlord and he hired the men to disfigure her. The hearings explored how victims of domestic violence are further victimized during the adjudication process. Hanson described the “psychological violence” she suffered during the trial, which was “more traumatizing to me than the attack on the street.”
Biden’s bill didn’t get a floor vote before the Anita Hill hearings, or soon after. Nor was the bill an easy sell. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, whose nomination Biden led the opposition for, returned the favor by encouraging opposition to the bill’s classification of domestic violence as a federal civil rights violation. Permitting civil lawsuits would have let victims, who were often poorly served by dismissive and misogynistic local authorities, sue their attackers in federal court. Rehnquist formed an ad hoc committee of judges to warn about case overload, and he would later write the Supreme Court majority opinion overturning that provision of the law.
But Biden kept plugging away. Having seized leadership of crime reduction issues by taking the Judiciary Committee chairmanship in 1987, and having enlisted the support of VAWA from his Republican Judiciary Committee colleague Orrin Hatch, he was perfectly positioned to fold the groundbreaking program into the 1994 crime bill.
That chronology doesn’t exonerate Biden’s handling of the Hill hearings. Daily Beast columnist Margaret Carlson was correct when she wrote, “Biden likes to believe the Violence Against Women Act and his support for Title IX make up for Hill. They don’t.”
However, understanding the chronology helps clarify that Biden’s handling of the Hill hearings wasn’t driven by clueless, retrograde sexism; he had been working on related issues for years. It was driven, he has said, by the primacy he placed on being a neutral and impartial committee chair. In his own words from 1992, he said, “Do I have any regrets … that I didn’t attack the attackers more? Some of the articles that have been written say, ‘Why didn’t I do what the Republicans did?’ If I had done what the Republicans did, I would have made a lie of everything I think I stand for … the one hallmark of my 20-year career is that civil liberties mean a great deal to me. Mark me down as not joining the school that the end justifies the means.”
That’s not exculpatory. One of Hill’s lawyers rebutted Biden’s assessment with: “She has civil rights and civil liberties, too … Anita Hill was pilloried from beginning to end without any protection from anybody in that process.” But it helps to square the Two-Biden Problem.
What are the common threads through Biden’s career? There is bipartisanship. There is irrepressible, gaffe-prone loquaciousness. There is a commitment to women’s rights (which may have propelled his “evolution” on Roe v. Wade. ) Less appreciated is a constant attraction to the political fray.
The Hill hearings brought all these facets of Biden into conflict. And yes, Hill wrongly suffered because of how Biden chose to balance them. But those same instincts led to the bipartisan compromise for the 1994 crime bill, which, for all its tough-on-crime excess, also included $30 billion for programs designed to keep people out of jail, on top of the Violence Against Women Act.
Why was Biden the Democrats’ point person on crime, a politically fraught issue that had been wrecking Democrats for years? Recalled Nourse to Witcover, “No other senator wanted to do it.”
Biden’s Forrest Gump-like ability to be present at so many cultural flashpoints in the past five decades is not strictly due to his longevity. It’s because, whether driven by brash ego or sincere commitment or both, he keeps running into the political fires. While that inclination gets him into all sorts of trouble, if he wasn’t neck-deep in controversial crime issues, he wouldn’t have recognized the need for a Violence Against Women Act.
That doesn’t make him correct in every instance. Maybe his penchant for bipartisanship makes him the wrong choice for Democrats to fight a merciless Republican Party, and an unreliable ally in the newest battles against sexism and racism. And of course, voters can look at any one of Biden’s shifts and simply chalk it up to self-serving flip-floppery.
Nevertheless, it’s in Biden’s interest to take all of those unsavory, vintage sound bites and place them in the broader context of someone who has dared to be in the thick of it, and produced results by doing so. If he’s evolved over time, it’s because he has taken political risks, not avoided them.
Biden’s challenge is not merely to win the Democratic nomination, but also to convince his progressive detractors that he isn’t their political enemy, so they won’t abandon him in the general election. To pull that off, he will have to follow his own advice, which he laid out in a 1974 interview , not even two years into being a senator.
In it, Biden summed up his political philosophy this way: “I don’t think the issues mean a great deal in terms of whether you win or lose. I think the issues are merely a vehicle to portray your intellectual capacity to the voters … a vehicle by which the voters will determine your honesty and candor. The central issue of my campaign—and I used all the issues from busing to the war to the economy, crime, and prison reform—was to convince the people that I was intelligent and to convince them that I was honest.” "

Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin endorsed GOP Sen. Susan Collins for reelection on Thursday, in a rare rebuff of partisan politics in an increasingly polarized Senate.
The moderate West Virginia senator also offered to campaign for the vulnerable Maine incumbent. It’s a boon for Collins, who Democrats likely need to beat if they hope to take the Senate majority in 2020. Story Continued Below

“I would go up and campaign for Susan Collins. If she wanted me to, I would campaign for Susan Collins. For America to lose somebody like Susan Collins would be an absolute shame. I feel that strongly about her,"" Manchin said on Thursday.
He admitted his comments will not please Democrats eager to defeat Collins.
“You think my party will be happy? No,"" Manchin said in an interview with C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” program that will air beginning on Friday night.
Though it's rare for a member of one political party to endorse another, Manchin and Collins are some of the few remaining moderates left in the Senate. And Manchin fundamentally disagrees with sitting senators campaigning against each other, making his endorsement of his Maine colleague a natural extension of his efforts to work across the aisle.

Dems rush to Omar’s aid amid conservative backlash on 9/11 comments,www.politico.com,SARAH FERRIS,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/11/democrats-defend-ilhan-omar-1271248,"LEESBURG, VA. — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other House Democrats are jumping to the defense of Rep. Ilhan Omar as she faces yet another wave of conservative attacks for her recent remarks on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “We are getting to the level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters at the House Democratic retreat here Thursday.
Story Continued Below
“And if they can’t figure out how to get it back to policy we need to call it out for what it is. Because this is not normal, and this is not a normal level of political debate or rhetoric.”
The Minnesota Democrat has come under fire this week for describing Sept. 11, 2001, as a day when “some people did something,” as she described how that act of terrorism contributed to the rise in Islamophobia globally.

“Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,” Omar said last month at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”
Omar’s allies have said that her remarks — which were part of a 20-minute speech — have been taken grossly out of context by conservative websites. That backlash inspired an inflammatory New York Post cover on Thursday, which featured a photo of a flaming World Trade Center building with the caption, “Here’s your something. 2,977 people dead by terrorism.”
The controversy has also sparked a testy back-and-forth on Twitter between Ocasio-Cortez and freshman GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Navy SEAL who lost his right eye during an IED attack in Afghanistan. Crenshaw seized on Omar’s comments, calling them “unbelievable” in a Wednesday tweet.
“First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as ‘some people who did something,’” he added.
Ocasio-Cortez later fired back on Twitter.
“You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund, yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes,” the New York freshman wrote and then urged Crenshaw to “go do something” about domestic terrorism spurred by right-wing extremists.
Ocasio-Cortez also told reporters that it was “incredibly upsetting and triggering” for the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post “to elicit such an image for such a transparently and politically motivated attack on Ilhan.”
“It’s transparent. Frankly, this is getting to a level that’s beyond politics or partisanship,” she added.
Rep. Max Rose, a moderate Democrat who represents Staten Island, tried to play mediator between the two high-profile freshman lawmakers.

“Let’s be clear, words matter: we were attacked by terrorists on 9/11. Thousands were murdered, too many of whom were from my district,” Rose responded on Twitter. “But actions matter too,” he added, encouraging Crenshaw to become a co-sponsor of the 9/11 victims’ legislation.
Another high-profile freshman progressive, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, accused the New York Post ownership of “stoking hate, fear & division, putting REAL lives at risk.”
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, described the publication’s cover as “pretty outrageous.”
“She’s getting a lot of scrutiny. I know she knows she has to be careful about what she says,” Jayapal told reporters at the Democratic retreat here on Thursday. “I also know there’s a lot of scrutiny on here that’s not on other people.”
And Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), another high-profile progressive freshman, defended her “sister,” saying critics of Omar were putting her life at risk by “taking those words out of context.”
“They do this all the time to us, especially women of color,” Tlaib said on MSNBC. “They do that, they take our words out of context because they’re afraid, because we speak truth, we speak truth to power.”
Rep. Katherine Clark, vice chair for the House Democratic Caucus, said on Thursday that Omar’s status as one of the first Muslim women in Congress has drawn sharper scrutiny.
“What we have seen with Ilhan Omar is she is the first Muslim woman to wear a hijab in the House of Congress and that has made her a target for some people,” Clark said in an interview Thursday.
“My understanding is that she is trying to promote that Muslim people should be addressed individually, and that she is hoping for equity,” Clark said."

Julian Assange Might Have Already Won Magazine,www.politico.com,JACK SHAFER,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/11/julian-assange-arrested-media-journalism-analysis-226650,"Has WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange already won his case?
British police arrested him on Thursday at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been living in external exile since 2012. The arrest was prompted by an extradition warrant filed by the United States, which has charged him with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.
In the immediate aftermath of the arrest, Assange partisans like journalist Glenn Greenwald have fulminated about the government’s heavy-handedness, saying this represents a dangerous crackdown on freedom of the press. If Assange goes down this way, they warn, our constitutional freedoms are going with him.
But if you look at the indictment, on a very narrow charge of computer hacking conspiracy, it’s evident that the government stayed well clear of the dangerous notion of prosecuting a publisher for publishing. And, if anything, Assange might get exactly the fight he’s looking for, served up to him by the government he purports to loathe.
If the case plays out as expected, he’ll first get a platform in Britain to argue to a worldwide audience that it’s all a political setup. And if he loses that round, and the case does come back to the United States, he might well get the government to serve him up, by law, the kind of massive document haul he loves.
Given the broad constellation of charges prosecutors have contemplated throwing at Assange, including the Espionage Act , Wednesday’s indictment is very weak tea. Unless prosecutors charge Assange with bigger crimes—something Reuters reports the Justice Department may do—the former fugitive could succeed in using British extradition proceedings to avoid U.S. prosecution.
Criminal defense lawyer Ken White was among the first to note the narrowness of the indictment. The government’s bare-bones indictment has avoided First Amendment issues by not charging Assange with publishing government secrets. Instead, it’s accusing him of computer crime—of agreeing to help former Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning hack the password on a classified government computer system containing classified information. (Manning had previously downloaded and shared classified files with WikiLeaks, which had published them.)
Did Assange actually perform the offered assistance? The indictment is cagey on this point. “Cracking the password would have allowed Manning to log onto” unauthorized computers, the indictment says. “Such a measure would have made it more difficult for investigators to identify Manning as the source,” it continues. (Emphasis added.)
The government’s belief that Assange offered Manning help with password cracking isn’t news—it was aired during Manning’s 2011 trial. As my colleague Josh Gerstein reported , prosecutors presented chat logs from Manning’s personal computer in which she asked a user named “Nathaniel Frank” for advice on cracking passwords, and that prosecutors linked that identity to an email address used by Assange. “Frank” replied that he had “ rainbow tables ” that could assist her.
Prosecutors probably brought a standard-issue computer crime against Assange instead of espionage charges for two reasons. Because computer crimes are punished under the law in both the United States and the United Kingdom, extradition cases involving them are relatively straightforward. Bringing espionage charges, on the other hand, would have complicated extradition by allowing a defendant to directly invoke the “ political offense exception ,” arguing that the treaty signed by the U.S. and the U.K. stipulates that a person shall not be extradited to be prosecuted of an offense of political character. Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish dissident currently living in the United States, is prepared to shield himself from any attempt by Turkey to extradite him using this exception.
If U.S. prosecutors bring no additional charges against Assange, he will surely argue in extradition proceedings that the United States is attempting to deceive British authorities about their true motives, charging for crime A (computer hacking) when their real intention is to punish him for an unindicted crime B (helping to steal classified documents). (The existing indictment accuses Assange of conspiring to do just that, although it doesn’t level an actual charge at him over it.) He might also argue successfully that the computer charges are a fig leaf, that the U.S. is using the pretext of the computer crime charge to extradite him with the intention of filing espionage charges against him when he arrives in America. Either argument could sway the British.
Even if prosecutors extradite Assange, he has other ways to thwart them. He would have the right to demand access to reams of potentially exculpatory government information to mount his defense, no matter what the charges. Are prosecutors ready to give up additional information—to hand it to lawyers for Julian Assange —just to put him away? The crime he’s presently accused of carries a relatively light sentence of five years.
The reason prosecutors have pussyfooted around charging Assange with espionage is what the Washington Post called the “ New York Times problem” in a 2013 article about the Obama-era decision not to charge Assange. “If the Justice Department indicted Assange, it would also have to prosecute the New York Times and other news organizations and writers who published classified material, including the Washington Post and Britain’s Guardian newspaper,” anonymous officials told the paper.
It might be true, as worried press advocates have been saying, that the move against Assange signals a new willingness on the Trump administration’s part to set aside the currently accepted First Amendment protections and prosecute news organizations for publishing classified information. But this indictment is a long way from anything that would scare off journalists from changing the way they do their jobs. Until the Trump administration takes that leap, the First Amendment seems safe.

"Schumer, McConnell trade blame as Senate declines",www.politico.com,JOHN BRESNAHAN,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/11/senate-nuclear-option-filibuster-1271791,"Schumer, McConnell trade blame as Senate declines The state of the Senate is bad, and it could get worse. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Has the Senate finally hit rock bottom?
Last fall’s brutal confirmation fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation led to such bad blood that even old friends weren’t talking. Story Continued Below
Then came an ugly, 35-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.
Just last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) triggered the “nuclear option” and weakened the Senate’s vaunted filibuster to steamroll over Democratic resistance to President Donald Trump’s nominees — the third time in six years the majority party has unilaterally changed Senate rules.
To top it all off, the Senate has now failed to muster enough votes to pass a simple disaster-aid bill, something that was once routine and is a failure that will affect millions of Americans.
McConnell and his Democratic counterpart, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, exchanged verbal blows on Thursday as they gave dueling accounts over who was to blame for the Senate morass.

Schumer first accused McConnell of overseeing a “legislative graveyard,” adding that McConnell’s Senate deserved an F.
McConnell responded hours later that Schumer was the father of gridlock, having blocked George W. Bush‘s judicial picks more than a decade ago.
“I know exactly who started it,” McConnell said.
Then Congress promptly left town for a two-week recess, frustrating members in both parties, who lamented the state of the Senate and said they hoped the situation couldn’t get worse. But it just might, senators from both parties admitted.
“The fact that we’ve had political vote after political vote after political vote while there’s issues like climate change and comprehensive immigration [reform] that we don’t take up — yeah,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) when asked if the Senate had bottomed out. “We’re an awful lot like the House now. It’s no longer ‘The Greatest Deliberative Body.’ It’s just another body.”
“We’re seeing what can happen if we don’t fix some things that we got to fix, but I don’t think we hit rock bottom by any stretch,” added Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). “Unfortunately, you could go a lot further than we’re going right now.
Some thought the 2016 retirement of Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada would improve the state of the Senate, and in a certain sense, it has. The personal relationship between McConnell and Schumer has not been nearly as toxic as was the relationship between Reid and McConnell.
“They’re a couple of old pros. They don’t take it personally,” insisted Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) of the two current leaders.
Yet functionally, the McConnell-Schumer dynamic isn’t really much different. Each party has grown more ideologically rigid as the moderate core of the Senate has either been ousted or retired. And Trump’s unpredictable nature makes legislating immeasurably more difficult.
As Republicans changed the Senate rules last week, McConnell and Schumer engaged in a fierce tit-for-tat on the floor culminating with McConnell literally pointing at Schumer as the one to blame.
It was an ugly moment for the Senate. Yet these types of bitter personal exchanges have become routine, and a growing number of senators just try to tune it all out."

City's plan to scrap elite schools draws accusations of racism at first Senate forum,www.politico.com,mtoure@politico.com (Madina Touré),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/04/11/citys-plan-to-scrap-elite-schools-draws-accusations-of-racism-at-first-senate-forum-965825,"The state Legislature is wading into the fraught debate over diversity at the elite schools, which admit black and Latino students at a rate far lower than their Asian and white counterparts. | AP Images City's plan to scrap elite schools draws accusations of racism at first Senate forum
Elected officials, parents and advocates spoke out over the elimination of the single admissions test at the city's eight specialized high schools Thursday night, during a forum marked by accusations of racism in the ongoing fight over segregation at city schools.
The forum was the first in a series the state Legislature plans to hold in the coming months as it wades into the fraught debate over diversity at the elite schools, which admit black and Latino students at a rate far lower than their Asian and white counterparts.
State Sen. John Liu (D-Queens), who heads the Senate's New York City education committee, asked roughly 100 people at Queens Borough Hall — including a large number of Asian individuals as well as some black and white attendees — to ""tell us what you think the problem is.""
Mayor Bill de Blasio and schools chief Richard Carranza are fighting to have the test scrapped as the sole means of admission to the schools as part of a larger plan to diversify them. Liu, saying the mayor was ignoring the Asian community, recently called that plan ""racist.""
""This [forum] is necessary because last year, the city proposed a plan without including many parts of the city,"" Liu said Thursday. ""In particular, the Asian community was completely excluded — not inadvertently, but intentionally and deliberately.""
State Senator Toby Ann Stavisky, who heads the Senate's higher education committee, said the city cannot impose a plan without hearing input. She also said she believes Queens is a ""good place"" for a new specialized high school.
""I believe you can have diversity and have the test and have other ways to improve diversity,"" Stavisky said. ""But the idea that you would pit one community, one group, against another group to me is wrong.""
The city is relatively powerless to impose any plan without approval from Albany.
Liu said that the Senate would host community forums on the issue in all five boroughs. The state Assembly is also planning to hold hearings on the issue in May.
The forums come on the heels of data the city Department of Education recently released on specialized high school offers, which showed the number of black and Latino students admitted to the schools continues to be low and disproportionate to the city's overall student demographics. Asian students also continue to make up the bulk of invitations to the Discovery program for students who just missed the cutoff score required for admission to the schools.
Parents, leaders and advocates called for expanding gifted and talented programs, decried the lack of Special Progress — or accelerated study — classes in middle schools and questioned the mayor’s proposal to reserve seats at specialized high schools for the top 7 percent of students at each middle school.
Some echoed Liu's assertion that the city's plan was “racist.”
David Lee, an alum of Brooklyn Technical High School and pro-test advocate, said that when he attended Brooklyn Tech — one of the elite high schools — it was majority black and Hispanic.
""The bottom line here is that taking away the test will marginalize opportunities for thousands of students, mostly low-income and mostly immigrant,"" Lee said. ""At this particular time, it will also marginalize mostly Asian students ... not only is the rollout racist, but the whole concept is racist. It's racist, it's divisive, it's polarizing.""
Mary Alice Miller, who is African American and attended Stuyvesant High School in the 1970s, said that she and her sisters all took the test and got into Stuyvesant, another of the elite eight, and were living in Brownsville at the time — one of the city's toughest neighborhoods.
Still, she spoke in support of the mayor's plan and decried the racial rhetoric the debate had spurned.
""It's very offensive to hear all the racial coding that African Americans are not good enough, if more of us are accepted into the schools, it's going to bring down the standards,"" Miller said. ""Don't act like the specialized schools belong to one race.""
Horace Davis, president of the Caribbean American Society of New York — who also attended Brooklyn Tech — said that across the five boroughs, communities of color have been stripped of much-needed educational resources, including Special Progress classes and gifted and talented programs.
""Underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics at specialized high schools is a symptom of a much larger problem,"" Davis said. ""We do not and should not eliminate the test. What we desperately need is to restore the gifted and talented programs especially in the early years."""

Trump push to finish Obama crackdown on salt prompts stealth lobbying,www.politico.com,HELENA BOTTEMILLER EVICH,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/12/fda-sodium-targets-lobbying-1341016,"The Trump administration is preparing to finalize a policy urging less salt in processed foods — one of former President Barack Obama's signature nutrition priorities.
The FDA is expected this year to release targets for how much sodium should be used in a wide variety of foods, from pickles to pizza. The goal is to get Americans to gradually eat less salt and reduce cardiovascular disease. The sodium targets would be voluntary.
But some segments of the food industry are now mounting a late attempt to get the administration to pause the effort — a stealth lobbying campaign that's laid bare a rift between food companies for and against setting federal sodium goals.
Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who departed his post on Friday, told POLITICO last week that guidance establishing sodium targets is in the final stages of clearance at the agency, suggesting it will head to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review in a matter of weeks.
""I think we've been very transparent about this all along,"" Gottlieb said, adding: ""I don't think people should be at all surprised about where the FDA landed on this.""
Surprised or not, several major trade associations are now trying to meet with OMB officials to present a new study showing that meeting FDA's sodium targets would be an expensive undertaking for companies across the industry.
The pushback is coming from the American Bakers Association, American Frozen Food Institute, International Dairy Foods Association, North American Meat Institute, National Restaurant Association and SNAC International, a trade association that represents more than 400 snack manufacturers, including PepsiCo.
""We have engaged throughout the policy process, highlighting opportunities and challenges, as a part of that dialogue,"" the industry associations said in a statement to POLITICO. ""We believe an OMB review will be a helpful part of the policymaking process.""
The associations said they are stepping in because they want FDA’s sodium reduction goals to be “a success.”
The Trump administration's efforts to push through salt-reduction targets is revealing a growing divide within the food industry. Some companies are trying to adapt to consumer demands for more transparency and healthier, less-processed foods, while others are resisting government attempts to set guidelines for the industry.
Other companies argue the voluntary targets will saddle them with significant costs and technical challenges, because it may be difficult for manufacturers to meet some of the goals without compromising on taste, food safety or shelf-life.
But a growing list of major food companies are now on FDA's side either because they support the agency's plan or because they see government intervention in nutrition as a fait accompli.
One of FDA's leading proponents is the Sustainable Food Policy Alliance, a new group that represents industry heavyweights Nestlé, Unilever, Mars Inc. and Danone North America. Those companies all left the food industry's main lobby, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, in recent years over similar policy disagreements. The alliance this week defended FDA's efforts to finalize voluntary sodium targets.
""The Sustainable Food Policy Alliance opposes any efforts to ignore evidence-based science on sodium reduction or undermine FDA's voluntary sodium reduction targets,"" the group said in a statement to POLITICO. ""We firmly agree with FDA and nutrition experts that reducing sodium levels can be a powerful public health action to reduce blood pressure, a leading risk factor for heart disease.""
Others, like the Kraft-Heinz Company, are staying out of the fight. The Grocery Manufacturers Association is also not engaging on the issue.
The divisions over salt show how much the food industry's posture in Washington has changed in a few short years.
The sodium goals sparked widespread opposition from the food industry when the Obama administration first floated them. FDA guidance is non-binding, but many in the industry feel significant pressure to comply.
Under Obama, FDA proposed two sets of sodium targets for nearly 150 food categories. One set encouraged the industry to comply within two years, the other within a decade. The Trump FDA is expected to finalize only short-term reduction targets, but the final details aren’t known.
After FDA proposed the targets in 2016, several industry groups lobbied Capitol Hill to block the agency from working on them until the National Academy of Medicine completed a review of scientific research on how much sodium people should be eating. The academy completed its review last month and confirmed the government's long-standing advice to cut back on salt, paving the way for FDA to act.
Gottlieb, a vocal proponent of the agency's work on salt, proclaimed last year that there is ""no single more effective public health action related to nutrition than the reduction of sodium in the diet"" — a statement that put him squarely in line with public health groups on the issue.
In the interview with POLITICO last week, Gottlieb warned the food industry against fighting the sodium goals.
""If the packaged food industry wants to start a lobbying campaign against voluntary guidelines, I think they risk ending up with multiple regimes in different states and municipalities,"" Gottlieb said. ""Then they're going to be looking for federal legislation and preemption.""
New York City's aggressive action on sodium reduction appears to have already influenced the industry. The city's health department launched an initiative back in 2009 to get food companies to commit to voluntary sodium reduction goals.
The city got several major companies to sign on to the effort, including Starbucks, Kraft-Heinz, Unilever and Hostess. Some data suggests the nudge from the city helped move the industry: One study found that between 2009 and 2014, there was a 6.8 percent reduction in sodium levels across the food supply. New York City last year rolled out a similar campaign to reduce sugar.
Sodium reduction is one of the rare Obama policies that the Trump administration isn’t trying to roll back — a stance that's pleasantly surprised health advocates.
The president himself hasn’t been known to encourage consumers to reduce their salt intake. During the partial government shutdown earlier this year, Trump made headlines for serving a sodium-laden fast food spread when Clemson University's national championship football team visited the White House, prompting snarky headlines about the president having ""turned the White House into a White Castle.""
The Agriculture Department took steps to relax some of the Obama-era nutrition standards for the school meals program, including future sodium limits. But the Trump White House has also allowed FDA to advance a number of major Obama administration nutrition priorities, including mandatory calorie labeling on restaurant menus and new Nutrition Facts labels on packaged foods.
As various industry groups seek an audience at OMB in an effort to slow the salt guidance, the deep division among food companies on the issue makes it more difficult to convince the administration to rethink its approach. But the disagreement among industry power players is good news for public health groups.
The government recommends that people limit their salt intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day. Americans are currently consuming an average of 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day, the majority of which comes from processed foods.
""We know that the level of salt in food today is putting people at risk of disease,"" said Laura MacCleery, policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which has long lobbied for sodium reduction at the federal level.
MacCleery criticized the trade associations that are trying to lobby the administration to slow down, calling it an attempt to exert ""backroom"" influence.
""It's unfortunate that there's a last-ditch attempt to throw sand in the gears,"" she said, adding: ""This game is over."""

Democrat Betsy Londrigan, who lost by less than a point last year to U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, is taking another shot at the 13th District seat. “Health care was the issue in 2018 and it’s still the No. 1 issue,” she told POLITICO yesterday after announcing she was running. Story Continued Below
She has the encourgement of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is led by U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois.
The 13th District encompases 14 counties, from Champaign-Urbana to Springfield and down to the Metro East area in southern Illinois.
Health care was the focus of Londrigan’s campaign the first time around , in part because of a personal experience. Her son was 12 when he developed Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever from a tick bite. He was in intensive care for three weeks, including 10 days in a medically induced coma. After receiving “great medical care,” Londrigan said, “We went home and exhaled and then the bills came.”
The family had insurance, allowing them to escape financial ruin, says Londrigan today. It was Davis voting against the AHCA in May 2017 that motivated her to run. “I remember seeing House Republicans celebrating on the White House lawn,” she said. “I thought these people don’t know what this will do to families or don’t care.”
Last week, the Democratic-controlled House voted to condemn the Trump administration’s support for a lawsuit to toss out the ACA. Davis, a Taylorsville Republican, was a no vote.
Londrigan says her 2020 campaign will spend more time in rural areas that may not have heard her message during last year’s election.
Last year, Londrigan raised $3.6 million to Davis’ $3.2 million, making it one of the pricier House races. MORE BUZZ

Ready or not for small satellite boom?,www.politico.com,BRYAN BENDER,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/12/virgin-orbit-dan-hart-space-1271107,"Virgin Orbit is poised to complete the first flight of its new space launch system in the coming months in what many see as a key milestone in the burgeoning market for small satellites – in this case placed in orbit via the LauncherOne rocket outfitted on “Cosmic Girl,” a modified Boeing 747-400.
But the California company’s CEO Dan Hart says he’s worried whether the Federal Aviation Administration and other oversight agencies can handle what one of billionaire Richard Branson’s upstart space companies envisions will be hundreds if not thousands of launches in the coming years.
“What they are going to have to do looking forward is they are going to have to respond to an increasing launch rate,” Hart tells POLITICO. “That will be the challenge for them. Everything from the tools that they use and the communications equipment and the staff that they have are going to have to flex to meet the launch rate.”
He added: “If what we see forecast by like every third party analyst out there happened, there will be hundreds of launches a year and the current system, just from a resource standpoint, won’t really be able to step up to that…there needs to be a much tighter communication between launch activity and air travel, so there is no need to close down air space for long periods of time for a launch that gets from the ground to outer space in 10 minutes.”
Hart, who has spent much of his career in the space industry – including working on the Space Shuttle program and the launch of the first GPS satellites -- spoke about the company’s big goals for this year; how it is navigating regulatory challenges; and what he sees as the company’s domestic and international competition in the small satellite launch market.
He also urged world governments to “pick up the pace” on the thorny issue of space traffic management given the explosion of satellites and other space-based technologies around the globe.
“It is really time to pick up the pace on space traffic management,” Hart admonished. “The Commerce Department was kind of given the baton last year and that was good to see. There is a lot of work to be done on norms of behavior in orbit, all the coordination, and getting the whole globe on the same page, so that everyone known what is going on in space like they do on airplanes. That is going to take a lot of work and a lot of time.
The
Tell about how you got to Virgin Orbit.
I’ve been involved in space my whole career. I left college and went down to Kennedy Space Center, got involved in the Space Shuttle program, went over to launch vehicles., missile defense, satellites.
Now at Virgin for another launch system. For me it has been a continuum in the development side of creating new capabilities and getting very jazzed about seeing the effects.
I came over to Virgin two years ago and we set up launch to orbit. Virgin is another great element to connect with space because it begot a very missionary style.
It has been a lot of fun, frankly, coming over to another big development program.
What are a couple of things that you might not have imagined at the start?
The most dramatic change from when I came into the business is the business was almost a 100 percent government activity. Space was the domain of government projects – big government projects, big government organizations. Commercial was in its nascent stage. Now there is kind of an equals – as a matter of fact it is more than equal, commercial is bigger with all the capabilities. That’s perhaps the biggest change.
The other thing that you notice is how space in orbit effects life on earth. Years ago, I put up a dozen GPS satellites – as a matter of fact when I was on the Delta program we launched the first GPS satellite – and now there is nobody on the Earth who goes more than three blocks without looking at their phone to see what GPS is saying is the shorter way to go. Same with communications. So the second thing is the effects. Then there is technology – with the latest generation of satellites becoming smaller and launch becoming more routine.
How does Virgin Orbit fit it and what are its biggest priorities over the next few years?
Satellites that are small are now becoming more and more capable. And it is much the same as these smart phones that we have. We used to use them to make a phone call (laughs). Now they do everything. Satellites that are getting smaller and smaller are getting more capable and businesses are forming around them. And they are much lower cost than the traditional large satellites. There are more and more businesses forming cases around putting up capability in orbit and they’ve now advanced to the point where they need individualized services. They need rides. They are not satisfied with finding an extra spot on a huge rocket that is going to whatever orbit it is going to.
That’s where we fit in. We are a rocket that is seized for the smaller satellites – about 300 kilograms. We are flexible and responsive in our schedule, being air-launched. So we can go when they want to go and we can go where they want to go. That kind of gives up that extra edge. We can maneuver so that we can avoid population areas and land masses and we’ll go to any or orbit.
Who do you see as your main competitors in this space -- in the U.S. and internationally?
There are not a huge number of existing small rockets; as a matter of fact, there are very few that are operating currently. In the U.S. it could be Pegasus and Rocket Lab. Internationally, there are a lot of projects going on in China. There are some in India and Korou [in French Guiana]. [Their rockets] are a little bit bigger than we are. I see the direct competition as those at 500 kilograms or less.
There are also few upstarts in the U.S., no? Like 3-D printed rockets.
There are a lot of companies putting an oar in the water on launch. But it takes a lot and creating a launch system. There is some great technology being created and there is really great innovation and that is going to pay off in the whole industry. It is not clear to me how many of those entities are going to be able to carry the full capitalization cost to create a space launch system.
What big goals does Virgin Orbit have on tap in the next few months?
The biggest milestone this year is first flight. We are targeting to get to first flight by the middle of the year. Then there are a couple of key milestones coming before that, which are completion of our flight test program and completion of our propulsion testing that we do up in Mojave. Those are the main things people will be most interested in and be noticing.
How much do you trying to shape the regulatory regime for space launch?
We are governed by the FAA primarily for most of our stuff. We went in providing them with lots of lots of information and they engaged with us. Which frankly is the only way it works with any regulatory agency. Things have worked very well over the past year or so with them.
What they are going to have to do looking forward is they are going to have to respond to an increasing launch rate. That will be the challenge for them. Everything from the tools that they use and the communications equipment and the staff that they have are going to have to flex to meet the launch rate. If what we see forecast by like everything third party analyst out there happened there will be hundreds of launches a year and the current system just from a resource standpoint won’t really be able to step up to that.”
The whole discussion about air space, there needs to be a much tighter communication between launch activity and air travel, so there is no need to close down air space for long periods of time for a launch that gets from the ground to outer space in 10 minutes.
There is actually quite a bit to be done there. There is also some modernization to be done. The whole discussion about export control. What exactly are we protecting from export? I have an aircraft that has been modified. It is not a missile. There are a few things like that.
Then the other aspects are space traffic management, with hundreds of or thousands of satellites going into orbit it is really time to pick up the pace on space traffic management. The Commerce Department was kind of given the baton last year and that was good to see. And there is a lot of work to be done on norms of behavior in orbit, all the coordination, and getting the whole globe on the same page, so that everyone knows what is going on in space like they do on airplanes. That is going to take a lot of work and a lot of time.
On export control, are there international deals being held back that you’d like to ink?
We are early on but yes. There are several countries that would love to have launch capability and we are having discussions. We have not had any real hurdles yet. But I am anticipating that we will probably have more paperwork and more meetings than perhaps is necessary.
So far the discussions I have had with the State Departments are very positive – that this ought to be doable. But even just fundamentally there are some aspects of the system that don’t even deserve a discussion. If [Northrop Grumman’s] Pegasus has been around for a while but probably didn’t operate as broadly as we are looking to, there will be some new ground we are going to cover.
Have you discussed launch services for small satellites with the Pentagon?
We have had a very rich discussion with the national security space leadership from the standpoint of being able to respond quickly and get satellites into orbit. They are looking at disaggregating systems, more small satellite constellations. They are sort of following the commercial world. I think the government is in the catbird seat.
So what’s it like to work for Richard Branson?
I haven’t gotten an email from him since about 45 seconds ago."

More faint praise for Cain,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2019/04/12/more-faint-praise-for-cain-424215," More faint praise for Cain — NEC Director Larry Kudlow offered further evidence for MM’s view that Herman Cain is not likely to make it to the Fed when he said the White House still supports the 2012 presidential candidate “for the moment” but would not prejudge the vetting process. Cain’s presidential bid got knocked off course in part by sexual harassment allegations. “We will see how that turns out. I don't want to prejudge it one way or the other,” Kudlow said.
Couple that with vocal opposition from some Senate Republicans and President Trump’s recent tepid remarks that “Herman would make that determination” and it suggests Cain’s name will not make it up to the Senate. Be kind of a miracle at this point if it did.
Dept. of Solutions — MM spent some time in the MSNBC green room on Thursday with MIT economics professors Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson talking about their new book “Jump-Starting America,” which argues for significant research and development spending outside already thriving areas to remedy the hollowed out nature of the U.S. economy.
Johnson told me : “We think it’s very easy to spread prosperity through investing more in science and technology, that’s the government making those investments, spreading it around the country. We identified 102 potential next-generation tech hubs.
“And we think there should be more of an upside, as in Alaska gives out oil revenue to its citizens in cash. Figure out how to give out revenues from the next big tech boom in cash to all Americans.

‘Liz Was a Diehard Conservative’ Magazine,www.politico.com,Alex Thompson,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/12/elizabeth-warren-profile-young-republican-2020-president-226613,"“Fight.” It’s the signature word of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s short but consequential political career. It’s in the title of both of the books she has published as a senator: A Fighting Chance and This Fight Is Our Fight . In her speech declaring her presidential candidacy in February, Warren told the crowd, “This is the fight of our lives” and, “I’ve been in this fight for a long time.” Her 2020 campaign asks voters to “Join the Fight.” Kate McKinnon-as-Warren on “Saturday Night Live” explained, “That’s the only f-word I know.”
Story Continued Below
But Warren used to be on the other side of the fight she is now waging. For many years before she entered politics, the woman now at the forefront of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party was a Republican.
County governments in New Jersey and Texas, where Warren lived in the 1970s and ’80s, could not locate Warren’s voter registration records, and the senator herself is circumspect about her political past. But records from the time Warren spent living in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts make clear that she was a registered Republican for at least several years of her midcareer adult life. It was not until 1996—when Warren was 47 years old and a newly minted Harvard law professor—that she changed her registration from Republican to Democrat.
Warren has acknowledged her Republican past before, but she does not often discuss it, or else downplays it. In a recent interview over tea at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she said she assumes the first time she registered as a Democrat was 1996, but added, “I’m not even 100 percent sure what I was registered as.” According to Warren, in the six presidential elections she voted in before 1996, she cast her ballot for just one GOP nominee, Gerald Ford in 1976. She does not talk about her Republican past in either of her books or as part of the biography she recounts in her stump speech; the information often comes as a surprise even to Beltway politicos and longtime Warren allies.
“I was just never very political,” is how Warren explains her Republican years. “I just never thought much about the political end.”
Friends and colleagues agree that Warren wasn’t much of a political activist in her youth or the early part of her career. But Warren’s intellectual journey is more complicated than the apathy-to-activism route she often presents.
Some on the left have already pointed out the less-than-progressive stances in her 2003 book, The Two Income Trap , including the rejection of a “quasi-socialist safety net to rival the European model.” But a review of Warren’s early scholarship and interviews with more than 20 friends and colleagues from her high school years through her academic career reveal a longer conservative track record that has not been fully explored. Warren’s conservatism centered not on social issues like abortion or gay rights, friends say, but on economic policy, the dominant focus of her academic work and now her presidential candidacy.

Katrina Harry, one of Warren’s best friends in high school in Oklahoma, remembers that she and Warren “talked politics a lot, taxes and welfare and such, and I was just a flaming liberal back then.” Harry adds, “Liz was a diehard conservative in those days. … Now we’ve swapped—a 180-degree turn and an about-face.”
“Liz was sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude,” says law professor Calvin Johnson, a colleague of Warren’s at the University of Texas at Austin in the early 1980s, who was also her neighbor and carpooled with Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann.
“I remember the first time I became aware of her as a political person and heard her speak, I almost fell off my chair,” says Rutgers law professor Gary Francione, who was a colleague of Warren’s at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1980s. “She’s definitely changed. It’s absolutely clear that something happened.”
Voter records from the time Warren spent living in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts make clear that she was a registered Republican for at least several years of her adult life. It was not until 1996, when she was 47, that she changed her registration to Democrat.
The story of Warren’s awakening—from a true believer in free markets to a business-bashing enforcer of fair markets; from a moderate Republican who occasionally missed an election to one of the most liberal senators in America vying to lead the Democratic Party—breaks the mold of the traditional White House contender and is key to understanding how she sees the world: with a willingness to change when presented with new data, and the anger of someone who trusted the system and felt betrayed.
Warren herself says that in her early academic work she was merely following the dominant theory of the time, which emphasized the efficiency of free markets and unrestrained businesses, rather than holding strong conservative beliefs herself. Still, she acknowledged in our interview that she underwent a profound change in how she viewed public policy early in her academic career, describing the experience as “worse than disillusionment” and “like being shocked at a deep-down level.”
Her conversion was ideological before it turned partisan. The first shift came in the mid-’80s, as she traveled to bankruptcy courts across the country to review thousands of individual cases—a departure from the more theoretical academic approach—and saw that Americans filing for bankruptcy more closely resembled her own family, who struggled financially, rather than the irresponsible deadbeats she had expected.
It wasn’t until Warren was recruited onto a federal commission to help reform the bankruptcy code in the mid-1990s—and then fought for those reforms and lost that battle in 2005—that she became the unapologetic partisan brawler she was in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, serving in the Senate and, now, stumping on the 2020 campaign trail. “I realize nonpartisan just isn’t working,” she recalls of that second conversion moment. “By then it’s clear: The only allies I have are in the Democratic Party, and it’s not even the majority of Democrats.”
Some friends and colleagues say Warren became radicalized, equating her change to a religious experience, to being born again. “She really did have a ‘Road to Damascus’ conversion when she saw the bankrupt consumers really were suffering—forced into bankruptcy by illness, firing or divorce—and not predators,” Johnson says. Other friends argue Warren’s shift has been more gradual, and that she is not the extremist her opponents have sought to portray her as. “It drives me crazy when she’s described as a radical left-winger. She moved from being moderately conservative to being moderately liberal,” says Warren’s co-author and longtime collaborator Jay Westbrook. “When you look at consumer debt and what happens to consumers in America, you begin to think the capitalist machine is out of line.”
After a childhood she describes as not very political, Warren attended George Washington University on a debate scholarship. Above, she is pictured second from left in the front row in the 1967 GWU yearbook as “Liz Herring” (her maiden name). | George Washington University Library
The fact that Warren likely has spent more of her voting years outside the Democratic Party than in it distinguishes her from her 2020 primary opponents. She and Senator Bernie Sanders, for example, share many policy objectives and an inclination to rail against the powerful. The Vermont senator, however, largely decided what he believed 50 years ago and has been remarkably consistent ever since. Warren is ever-evolving, questioning her own assumptions and hungry for new information—even today, as she sets the pace of the 2020 policy debate with detailed new proposals on childcare, taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, and a call for a new era of trust-busting in sectors from tech to agriculture.
“Her worldview is very informed by data,” says Angela Littwin, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who was Warren’s student in the late ’90s and became a mentee of both Warren and Westbrook. “What changed [Warren’s ideology] was the stories of ordinary people filing for bankruptcy. That speaks really well of her that she was presented with information contrary to her worldview and adopted it.”
Warren’s ideological and political transformations also occurred well before she entertained running for public office—lending them an authenticity often lacking in politicians who change their policy positions out of self-interest.
“If you had to pick a professor at Harvard to become a progressive icon in a decade,” says Littwin, “she wouldn’t have even been on the short list.”

Warren didn’t inherit the Republican Party from her parents or from her home state. Oklahoma was mostly a blue state while Warren was growing up there. Although partisan politics wasn’t much discussed at home, she speculated in a 2018 interview with the Intercept that her parents were New Deal Democrats. Yet Harry, one of Warren’s best friends in high school, distinctly remembers Warren being an “ice-cold Republican,” as she would sometimes tease her. (Warren joked back that Harry had “socialist” friends.)
It’s unclear exactly why Warren chose to become a Republican in the first place, given her family’s background. When I asked her, she said, “I voted—sometimes voted for Democrats, sometimes voted for Republicans—but never thought of myself, never had to frame myself, in political terms.”
In the late 1970s and ’80s, while Warren was in law school at Rutgers and then began her legal career, the right and Reaganomics were ascendant. In legal academia, this manifested itself in part through the “Law and Economics” movement, which sought to integrate the study of economics into law to emphasize efficiency and economic impact. In 1986, Columbia Law School professor Bruce Ackerman—now at Yale Law School—described the movement as “the most important thing in legal education since the birth of Harvard Law School.”
Colleagues from her early years as a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin recall Warren, second from left, as “surprisingly anti-consumer” and “believing much of what the corporate folks say about how the free markets work.” | Tarlton Law Library Digital Collections
The movement and its campus programs were fueled in part by funding from wealthy conservatives and corporations eager to inject some business-oriented thinking into the relatively liberal environs of elite American law schools. John Olin, a multimillionaire business tycoon who backed many conservative causes, began funding one of the movement’s intellectual founders, law professor Henry Manne, in the early ’70s and poured $68 million into Law and Economics programs at schools across the country in the late ’80s. “Economic analysis tends to have conservatizing effects,” James Pierson, the longtime director of Olin’s foundation, which distributed the funds, once explained to the New York Times .
A key component of the Law and Economics movement were frequent “summer camps” or “Manne camps”—conferences for law professors and judges hosted by Manne’s Law and Economics Center. The camps received funding from more than a hundred corporate donors, many of whom would later become favorite targets of Warren. In her first years as a self-described “baby law professor,” Warren attended a Manne camp, which she describes vaguely in A Fighting Chance as “an intensive course for law professors who wanted to learn more about economics.” It was there that Warren met her second husband, Bruce Mann, a fellow law professor.
“As we’ve always said, something good came from Law and Economics,” Warren says now. “I found my sweetie. That should be a good country-western song don’t you think? ‘I Found My Sweetie at Law and Economics Camp.’”
Warren joined the faculty at the University of Houston in 1978, and soon jumped to the University of Texas at Austin, where colleagues recall Law and Economics having a strong influence early on. “She did begin, as a student and as a young lawyer, sort of believing much of what the corporate folks say about how the free markets work, and they have to be left free to do what they want,” says Doug Laycock, who had the office next to Warren’s at UT-Austin and is married to Warren’s longtime co-author, Teresa Sullivan, a sociologist who later became president of the University of Virginia.
In a 1980 paper she wrote at the University of Houston, Warren argued that utility companies were over-regulated, and described the arguments of consumer advocates on the other side of the debate as “fallacious” and based on “unscrutinized, long-accepted conventional wisdom.” | Notre Dame Law Review via HeinOnline
In 1980, one of Warren’s first papers as a full-time professor at the University of Houston took on one of the most divisive political issues of the time: utilities. A decade of energy crises and nearly unprecedented price hikes had made government-sanctioned monopolies a popular target for populist politicians. As Arkansas state attorney general in the late ’70s and then again in his gubernatorial campaigns in the early ’80s, Bill Clinton made utility companies the poster boy for corporate greed and political corruption. In the 1982 gubernatorial race, Clinton attacked his Republican opponent as “soft on utilities, tough on the elderly.”
In her paper, however, Warren argued that utility companies were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be institutionalized to avoid “regulatory lag,” in spite of consumer advocate concerns. “Eliminating regulatory lag will end the need for frequent rate hearings, and will, thus, reduce the administrative costs of regulation,” she wrote. On the other side of the debate were consumer advocates, whose arguments she described then as “fallacious” and based on “unscrutinized, long-accepted conventional wisdom.”
Steve Mitnick, editor-in-chief of the trade publication Public Utilities Fortnightly , reviewed the paper at Politico Magazine ’s request and said he was shocked Warren had authored it. “That is such a pro-utility paper. It’s, like, awesome,” he told me. “She would never say this today. … If you’re a utility, you love that thing.” Barbara Alexander, a longtime consumer advocate in the utilities sector, also reviewed the paper, and blasted it: “What struck me was her lack of presentation of the consumer viewpoint and the underlying policies governing rate-making. She simplistically makes conclusions without any analysis of actual facts, just economic theory.”
In Warren’s prolific career, the article, originally published in the Notre Dame Law Review , has had a relatively long shelf life and has been cited in cases before the Ohio and Louisiana state Supreme Courts. The Texas Court of Appeals cited the paper approvingly in 2006.

In our interview, Warren dismissed the idea that the paper suggested she was a conservative. “I followed theory and tried my hand at what all academics did then in our field, and that was theory,” she said. “I pretty quickly discovered not only that the theory was wrong, but it was deeply misleading.”
“This was before Elizabeth formed her own notions about the justice aspect of contract law and the social utility of it,” Warren’s University of Houston colleague and mentor John Mixon told Warren biographer Antonia Felix for her recent book, Elizabeth Warren: Her Fight. Her Work. Her Life . In her early writing, Mixon said, Warren was “learning the technicalities of this essentially right-wing law.”
Warren’s academic career soon took a turn that made her far less comfortable with unfettered free markets. Prompted in part by a surge in personal bankruptcy filings following the passage of new bankruptcy laws in 1978, Warren, Sullivan and Westbrook in 1982 decided to study bankruptcy in a way that was then considered novel in academia: by digging into the anecdotal evidence of individual filings and traveling to bankruptcy courts across the country, often rolling a small copy machine through airports along the way.
By her own admission, Warren was the skeptic on the team. “I set out the prove [the people filing for bankruptcy] were all a bunch of cheaters,” she recounted in 2007 in an interview on University of California Television. “My take on this, my thrust, what I was going to do is I was going to expose these people who were taking advantage of the rest of us by hauling off to bankruptcy and just charging debts that they really could repay, or who’d been irresponsible in running up debts.”
But the team concluded the opposite: that abuse was rare and that bankruptcy filings were skyrocketing not because people were lazy but because the system was poorly designed—“rigged against” would come later. Warren, Westbrook and Sullivan published their work as a book in 1989, As We Forgive Our Debtors , which helped to make them stars in their fields.

Warren says the first trip to a bankruptcy court in San Antonio upended her feelings about Law and Economics and the more theoretical, free-market approach she had espoused. “My thinking rotates on its axis,” she says now. Westbrook recalls Warren’s conversion similarly. “Law and Economics in 1981 and ’82 was perhaps at its peak, particularly in bankruptcy,” he says. “I don’t have any question that over time she developed a greater empathy with people in financial distress.”
“I was willing to run down the path with these guys until I discovered there’s nothing solid under our feet,” Warren says of the more conservative legal academics at the time. “Forever after, I become inductive instead of deductive.”

Warren may well have remained a Republican and merely academically famous, not nationally famous, if not for a 71-year-old former middle school principal from Drumright, Oklahoma.
In 1994, on a lark, Virgil Cooper decided to run in the Democratic primary against an Oklahoma congressional incumbent, Representative Mike Synar. Cooper raised almost no money and said his political idol was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower. But Synar had become a top target for the National Rifle Association, which poured money into the primary. Cooper won. While he lost the general election to Tom Coburn, Synar’s ouster was an unlikely first domino to fall in the launch of Warren’s political career and helped to transform her from a policy-focused moderate Republican to one of the most potent forces in the Democratic Party.
President Clinton was the next domino in line. Clinton liked Synar—now out of a job—and appointed him in 1995 to chair a blue-ribbon commission to study the country’s bankruptcy laws. It was Synar who first brought Warren to Washington and kicked off what she later called her “long and painful baptism into national politics.” The two Oklahomans had been opponents in high school debate, and Synar asked Warren to be the adviser to the commission and to help write its report. “We hadn’t seen each other in the intervening decades, but 14-year-old boys seem to remember 15-year-old girls who once beat them in [debate] tournament play,” Warren recalls in A Fighting Chance , calling the moment “one of those little twists that makes me wonder about divine intervention.”
Even as her academic thinking had begun to shift left, Warren remained a registered Republican when she was a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, above, in the early 1990s. She changed her registration in 1996, shortly after moving to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to teach at Harvard. | Leif Skoogfors/Corbis via Getty Images
The commission met almost every month from April 1996 through August 1997, both in Washington and around the country. While there were debates among the commissioners, several members said they were policy-focused, not political. According to people on the commission, Warren—who was still a registered Republican when she started in the role and told other staffers so—came across as a policy-minded academic who worked hard at incorporating different viewpoints, even if she disagreed.
“Warren went above and beyond to ensure broad public inclusion,” says Melissa Jacoby, one of the staff attorneys on the commission who is now a law professor at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.
The partisanship ramped up just as the commission was winding down. In October 1997, the commission submitted its report to Congress with more consumer-centric recommendations. But in September, a business-friendly proposal making it more difficult to file for bankruptcy had already been introduced in Congress, setting up an eight-year fight over the topic that had become the central focus of Warren’s academic career.
She lost. In April 2005, President George W. Bush signed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, which made it harder to declare bankruptcy and erase past debts. “It’s a David versus Goliath story, but this time David gets his slingshot shoved down his throat—sideways,” Warren writes in A Fighting Chance .
Mentioning the 2005 bill still angers Warren. “It was worse than ‘ignore.’ They actually had to hold up a hand and say, ‘Don’t bother me with facts,’” she says of the Republicans and Democrats—among them, Senator Joe Biden—who pushed the bill. “I just saw that there was no pretense here of either adherence to theory, which is where we started this conversation, or to even a vague understanding of what was going on.”
She had officially changed parties in 1996, shortly after moving to Cambridge and in the months leading up to the presidential election that year. But it was after the 2005 bankruptcy reforms that friends and colleagues saw Warren take a real turn toward Democratic politics. The 2005 bill, Westbrook says, “got her even further into the political process, and she realized that people in the Republican Party didn’t share her views on policy.”
“Then it becomes really partisan after that, because I realize ‘nonpartisan’ just isn’t working,” Warren recalls. “‘Nonpartisan’ means that families who have already been kicked in the gut over and over just get kicked a few more times so that a handful of giant institutions can boost their profit margins.”
“This was raw politics.”
***
Warren’s anger soon met the moment.
In November 2008, as the economy collapsed, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called Warren and asked her to be a part of a five-person congressional oversight panel on the bank bailout package (also known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program). When the Obama administration came in early the next year, Warren began pitching the administration on what would eventually become the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republicans ultimately blocked her from running the federal agency, so she decided to challenge Republican Senator Scott Brown in 2012.
The very concept of the CFPB demonstrates how Warren has changed since her early academic career—but also the limits of that conversion. Warren insists she is still a believer in the power and efficiency of markets, a capitalist to “my bones,” she has said —using a label some of her Democratic opponents shy away from or outright reject.

Bush.| Melissa Golden/Bloomberg via Getty Images
On the presidential campaign trail, she still pitches her reforms and proposals, even those with dramatic government intervention, as means of correcting the market, not replacing it. Warren named her signature campaign proposal—sweeping reforms aimed at corruption—the Accountable Capitalism Act. Her call to break up large technology companies, she says, is about how their size has created an unfair playing field, a failing market. Her proposal to create a government manufacturer of generic drugs comes from her belief that the market has broken down, with generic drugs either not being produced or rising in price; a public option for generic drugs could jump-start the marketplace, she hopes.
“That’s her fundamental framework—she’s a believer in economics,” says Johnson, her UT-Austin colleague. “It’s just that she now shifts to protect consumers.”
“Throughout the years we worked together, she’s always been focused on markets,” Westbrook adds. “Both of us believe very much in markets.”
What Warren’s Republican history means for her presidential prospects remains unclear. There’s a version of this story in which her politically mixed background makes her the ideal candidate to capture not just the the American left but also the center—a pugilistic populist vowing to take on corporations, a policy-savvy reformer who believes that markets are essential to the economy.
But that’s not the political landscape of 2019. Warren’s tough stance during the financial crisis got her tagged by Republicans and many Democrats as more Harvard liberal than an up-by-the-bootstraps working mom from Oklahoma. And her work on the CFPB alienated much of the financial services industry. Meanwhile, much of the left wing of the Democratic Party, for which she was the banner-carrier after the financial crisis, has found a new champion in the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders. And members of the growing Democratic Socialists of America and the hosts of the popular leftist podcast Chapo Trap House have criticized Warren for her adherence to capitalism. As of this writing, she is generally polling fifth in the Democratic field, and her 2020 fundraising has fallen short of several other rivals’.
With some in the Democratic Party demanding purity, perhaps Warren thinks going back through her Republican history could hurt her. When I suggested near the end of our interview that she might consider talking more about that part of her biography, and her conversion, she was politely noncommittal.
“Sure, sure,” she said, before quickly pivoting back to another question."
Trump scoffs at two-year deal to raise spending caps - POLITICO,www.politico.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-defense/2019/04/12/trump-scoffs-at-two-year-deal-to-raise-spending-caps-424332,"With Wesley Morgan President Donald Trump says a two-year deal to raise spending caps is “not happening.”
— Democratic and Republican senators worry that a separate Space Force would waste money and add layers of bureaucracy just as the U.S. needs to get serious about space threats.
— New restrictions on transgender service members go into effect today.
HAPPY FRIDAY , where we're pitches and feedback. Email us at dbrown@politico.com @dave_brown24
Budget TRUMP SCOFFS AT DEAL: Trump on Thursday night said a two-year deal to raise spending caps is “not happening,” writes POLITICO’s Jennifer Scholtes.
“While the proposal would increase discretionary spending to about $1.3 trillion for the upcoming fiscal year, the Trump administration contends that it would lead to nearly $2 trillion in spending increases over 10 years.”
Under a plan proposed by House Democrats, the national defense spending topline would be set at $733 billion in fiscal 2020 and $749 billion the following year.
Space WORRIED ABOUT OVERHEAD: Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee from both political parties seemed genuinely undecided on the proposal to create a Space Force when they hosted top DoD leaders Thursday. Many, however, were wary of creating another layer of bureaucracy to solve the problem, your Morning D anchor writes .
""I don't understand how adding a box to an organizational chart will give us a qualitative military edge,"" Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said.
But Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan countered that the country needs a service specifically focused on the problem of “contested space.”
Shanahan and others knew the stakes going in , Defense News reports , and a read-ahead that was leaked to news outlets said Pentagon leaders stood a fighting chance of changing minds.
“Most notably, while members seem to have an understanding of the space threat, the perception is that the Department has not been successful in explaining to them WHY the Space Force is necessary to address that threat,” said the document, prepared for Pentagon leaders.
And a new Congressional Research Service report warns of confusion between organizations as military space proposals are developed, Bloomberg writes .
HAPPENING TODAY NEW TRANSGENDER RESTRICTIONS: A policy that sets new restrictions on transgender people serving in the military goes into effect today. Under the rule, people diagnosed with gender dysphoria will not be allowed to enlist, and those already in the service who haven’t been diagnosed must serve in their biological sex.
The Pentagon has posted more detailed information here .

ON THE HILL EYE ON JUNE 30: House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) wants the House to pass all 12 appropriations bills by June 30, per POLITICO’s Caitlin Emma.
Some of his urgency comes from a concern that Trump will use the debt limit this fall as a bargaining chip to force concessions.
“The budget process must run on time,” he said.
DISASTER AID: Lawmakers are heading out for a two-week recess without agreeing over a disaster aid package, mainly due to squabbles over how much aid Puerto Rico should receive, writes The Associated Press.
The various proposals under consideration have included money for hurricane repairs at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.
WEATHERING THE STORM: As recent flooding has hit military bases such as Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, Sens. Brian Schatz , Jerry Moran and Jack Reed unveiled bipartisan legislation Thursday — the ""Requiring Every American Defense Installation to Nullify Environmental Stresses for Security Act of 2019"" — to direct bases to prepare for extreme weather events, per POLITICO’s Kelsey Tamborrino.
NORTH KOREA TO SANCTION OR NOT TO SANCTION: Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agree that North Korea needs to give up its nukes. But they don’t agree on how much pressure to use, AP reports .
Trump wants to keep the sanctions, Moon wants them eased.
“We want sanctions to remain in place,” Trump said during their meeting. “I think that sanctions right now are at a level that’s a fair level.” He did say he was open to smaller measures, such as humanitarian aid.
AFGHANISTAN SPRING OFFENSIVE: “The Taliban announced Friday the start of their spring offensive despite talking peace with the United States and ahead of a significant gathering of Afghans meant to discuss resolutions to the protracted war and an eventual withdrawal of American troops from the country,” AP reports .
Nuclear Weapons GROWING PRICE TAG: The Arms Control Association is out with a new report today looking at the increasing cost of Trump’s nuclear weapons modernization plan, and looks at ways to cut the costs, perhaps saving as much as $300 billion over 30 years while maintaining a strong deterrent.
The report comes as Congress prepares to grapple with the administration’s budget request for nukes, which will gain momentum when lawmakers begin marking up the defense policy bill, according to Foreign Policy."
STATE OF THE SENATE IS NOT GOOD -- White House wanted to release detainees in sanctuary cities to go after Dems -- CAIN'T GET CONFIRMED -- Powell asserts Fed independence at House Dem retreat,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2019/04/12/the-state-of-the-senate-is-not-good-white-house-wanted-to-release-detainees-in-sanctuary-cities-to-go-after-dems-caint-get-confirmed-powell-asserts-fed-independence-at-house-dem-retreat-424304,"By MARIANNE LEVINE ( mlevine@politico.com ; marianne_levine) With an assist from Sarah Ferris and Melanie Zanona
THE STATE OF THE SENATE IS ... NOT GOOD: The Senate left for two weeks Thursday without an agreement on a multi-billion dollar disaster aid package - something that was once routine. It’s the latest in a series of lows for the legislative body, which has been through a lot in the last few months - from the brutal confirmation fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, to the longest shutdown in U.S. history to a unilateral change in Senate rules to speed up confirmation of President Donald Trump’s nominees.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) traded verbal blows Thursday over who was to blame for Senate dysfunction, Bres, Burgess and your guest Huddle host report.
Schumer accused McConnell of turning the Senate into a “legislative graveyard,” while McConnell responded that Schumer blocked President George W. Bush’s judicial picks. “I know who started it,” the majority leader told reporters. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) described the two leaders’ relationship as “not good, not good.”
There is bipartisan frustration in the Senate with the lack of progress on major legislation. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) complained that the Senate has taken up political votes at the expense of issues like climate change. “We’re an awful lot like the House now,” he said. “It’s no longer ‘The Greatest Deliberative Body.’ It’s just another body.” Retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) also wants the Senate to get moving. When asked whether the Senate would primarily focus on nominations in his final two years in the chamber, Alexander replied: “I sure hope not...We’ve got a whole lot more to do than that.” More here: https://politi.co/2WYgxGG

WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO RELEASE DETAINEES IN SANCTUARY CITIES TO GO AFTER DEMS: The White House sought to pressure officials at the Department of Homeland Security to release ICE detainees into “sanctuary cities” as a way to punish Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Washington Post’s Rachael Bade and Nick Miroff scoop. The suggestion, which came up at least twice in the last six months, prompted one whistleblower to alert Congress in February - amid negotiations to keep the government open, following the 35-day shutdown. The whistleblower warned that the White House was considering the plan if Democrats did not give up on their demand for fewer detention beds.
“The extent of this administration’s cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,” Ashley Etienne, Pelosi’s spokesperson, said in a statement. “Using human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.” More here: https://wapo.st/2GjFXcs

CAIN’T GET CONFIRMED: Well that was brief. With four Republican Senators opposing his potential nomination to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, Herman Cain is expected to withdraw from consideration for the job, according to ABC News’ Tara Palmeri and Katherine Faulders. Trump said last week he intended to nominate Cain. But Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) have already said they will oppose his nomination. More here: https://abcn.ws/2WZTueo
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday that there was a “lack of enthusiasm” among Senate Republicans for Cain. McConnell also had some general advice for the administration on potential nominees: do a background check and consider their likelihood of Senate confirmation. “Generally better to check that up in advance before you send that nomination up,” he said.

POWELL ASSERTS FED INDEPENDENCE TO HOUSE DEMS: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the “importance of the Fed’s independence” at the House Democrats’ retreat Thursday evening, according to a source in the room. Although Powell has come under attack from Trump for hiking interest rates, he reiterated to House Democrats Thursday that political pressure won’t have any impact on decision-making. Powell did appear to have a warning for Congress. When asked by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) what the consequences would be of a default on the debt ceiling, Powell replied that would be “unthinkable,” according to the source.
Several Democratic sources didn’t find Powell riveting, Heather notes. But after the Q&A, members had more fun and played trivia. Sources tell Heather that AOC dominated, answering several questions in a row correctly, including “What are Beyoncé’s fans called?”
BIPARTISANSHIP STILL EXISTS: Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) has endorsed his Republican colleague Susan Collins of Maine for re-election. “I would go up and campaign for Susan Collins,” Manchin told Burgess and The Hill’s Bob Cusack on C-SPAN’s Newsmakers. “For America to lose somebody like Susan Collins would be an absolute shame. I feel that strongly about her.” Manchin has had a newsy few weeks. Last week, he said he was considering a run against West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice in 2020. Manchin just won re-election to the Senate. We’re guessing Schumer is not exactly pleased with either of these remarks. More from Burgess: https://politi.co/2Pdt6vf
LIZ WAS A DIE-HARD CONSERVATIVE: Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is one of the most progressive members of the U.S. Senate. But she wasn’t always an anti-corporate firebrand, Alex Thompson writes in POLITICO Magazine. It wasn’t until 1996, at the age of 47, that Warren changed her registration from a Republican to a Democrat. “I was just never very political,” Warren said. “I just never thought much about the political end.” But a review of Warren’s records suggest a longer conservative record, particularly on economic policy - a key part of Warren’s presidential platform.
Katrina Harry, one of Warren’s best friends from high schoo l, said “Liz was a die-hard conservative in those days,"" while Calvin Johnson, a colleague of Warren’s at the University of Texas at Austin described the senator as “sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude"" in the early 1980's. Warren says that her early academic work was following the dominant theory of free markets and unrestrained businesses at the time but her viewpoints began to evolve in the mid-1980’s when she traveled the country to review thousands of individual cases in bankruptcy courts.

But she wasn’t prepared for scrutiny”: “In our conversation, the president wanted to be clear: He was very proud of all his children. ‘Barron is young, but he’s got wonderful potential,’ he said. ‘And Tiffany’s doing extremely well. Don is, uh, he’s enjoying politics; actually, it’s very good. And Eric is running the business along with Don, and also very much into politics. I mean, the children—the children have been very, very good.’
“[W]hile Don Jr. might be a hit at political rallies, Ivanka is the only child the president ever considered for an administration post. ‘She went into the whole helping-people-with-jobs, and I wasn’t sure that was going to be the best use of her time, but I didn’t know how successful she’d be,’ the president said. ‘She’s created millions of jobs, and I had no idea she’d be that successful.’ …
“‘She’s a natural diplomat,’ Trump said. ‘She would’ve been great at the United Nations, as an example.’ I asked why he didn’t nominate her. ‘If I did, they’d say nepotism, when it would’ve had nothing to do with nepotism.

WHAT THE … WAPO’S RACHAEL BADE and NICK MIROFF: “White House proposed releasing immigrant detainees in sanctuary cities, targeting political foes”: “White House officials have tried to pressure U.S. immigration authorities to release detainees onto the streets of ‘sanctuary cities’ to retaliate against President Trump’s political adversaries, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and email messages reviewed by The Washington Post.
“Trump administration officials have proposed transporting detained immigrants to sanctuary cities at least twice in the past six months — once in November, as a migrant caravan approached the U.S. southern border, and again in February, amid a standoff with Democrats over funding for Trump’s border wall.
“House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco was among those the White House wanted to target, according to DHS officials. The administration also considered releasing detainees in other Democratic strongholds. … A White House official and a spokesman for DHS sent nearly identical statements to The Post on Thursday, indicating that the proposal is no longer under consideration. ‘This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,’ the White House statement said.” WaPo

“But the Kentucky Republican did publicly offer some blunt advice for the administration as it floats Cain and Stephen Moore for the Fed and immigration hard-liners Ken Cuccinelli and Kris Kobach to lead the Department of Homeland Security. … ‘I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm, for one of them who was mentioned in some story and that was Ken Cuccinelli, who used to run the Senate Conservatives Fund.

THE DEM RETREAT …
-- NYT’S EMILY COCHRANE in Leesburg, Va.: “After Internal Divisions, Pelosi and House Democrats Seek to Regroup”: “House Democrats insisted on Thursday that they remained optimistic about potential compromises with the Trump administration on infrastructure, prescription drugs prices and immigration, even as they criticized the president’s prospective Federal Reserve Board picks and his recent comments about migrants and asylum seekers.
“The balance that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, her deputies and new Democratic members sought to strike during an annual member retreat underscored the contradictions of their approach to divided government.
“Even as they have railed against the president in pushing to expand their agenda and diverse majority, the Democrats still have clung to the possibility of compromise with President Trump and Senate Republicans to deliver some of their campaign promises.
“Much of the agenda that Democrats worked to highlight at the three-day conference at the Lansdowne Resort and Spa in suburban Virginia — ‘putting check marks next to the to-do list,’ as Representative Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, put it — has yet to reach the Senate floor. And it is not likely to, with Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, in control.” NYT

NEW … DEMOCRATS ARE MAKING a real effort to try to snatch the late REP. WALTER JONES’ (R-N.C.) seat on the coast in North Carolina. A firm led by DAN SENA, who ran the House Dems’ campaign arm last cycle, is behind a new 30-second ad that RICHARD BEW is running. Bew is a veteran, and the ad is thick with military imagery. Air Station Cherry Point and Camp Lejeune are both in the district, which Jones won unopposed in 2018. Bew is known in D.C.: He was the senior legislative aide to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and interfaced with lots of lawmakers over the years. Bew is spending roughly $100,000 on the ad. The 30-second spot

2020 WATCH -- ALEX THOMPSON: “Elizabeth Warren: The Republican Years: She doesn’t like to talk about it, but for years the anti-corporate firebrand was a free-market conservative registered with the GOP”: “The story of Warren’s awakening—from a true believer in free markets to a business-bashing enforcer of fair markets; from a moderate Republican who occasionally missed an election to one of the most liberal senators in America vying to lead the Democratic Party—breaks the mold of the traditional White House contender and is key to understanding how she sees the world...
“Warren herself says that in her early academic work she was merely following the dominant theory of the time, which emphasized the efficiency of free markets and unrestrained businesses, rather than holding strong conservative beliefs herself. Still, she acknowledged in our interview that she underwent a profound change in how she viewed public policy early in her academic career, describing the experience as ‘worse than disillusionment’ and ‘like being shocked at a deep-down level.’” POLITICO Magazine

PYONGYANG WATCHERS noticed a subtle shift in Trump’s comments Thursday about North Korea. His previous position on talks with Kim Jong Un, generally speaking, had been this: You ditch your nukes, and only then will we lift sanctions and help you grow your economy. But on Thursday, Trump hinted he might be open to the more incremental approach favored by many North Korea hands.
“There are various smaller deals that maybe could happen,” Trump said. “You could work out, step-by-step, pieces. But at this moment, we’re talking about the big deal. The big deal is we have to get rid the nuclear weapons.” WaPo’s David Nakamura has more .

Yet, like most families, the Sackler family is not a monolith. Neither Arthur nor his heirs had anything to do with the manufacture or marketing of OxyContin.
“Suggestions that his philanthropy is now somehow tainted are simply false. Purdue Pharma in its current form was founded by Arthur’s younger brothers, Mortimer and Raymond, four years after his death. None of the 1,600-plus lawsuits filed against Purdue Pharma, members of the Sackler family or others in the opioid business names Arthur or his heirs as defendants.” WaPo

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— The federal judiciary is likely to have to weigh in on House Democrats’ efforts to get returns at some point, and the central issue could be whether judges buy that the Democrats have a legitimate reason for wanting them.
— Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley said this week that he wants to move quickly on the IRS overhaul passed by the House this week, so don’t expect him to accept any changes to the measure.
— Sen. Elizabeth Warren released the latest in her series of tax increases on the rich and corporations.
IT’S FRIDAY, EVERYBODY, and your regular Morning Tax author will be handing off the reins for a week — for our first spring break vacation in a long while. (This time, with two children. Pray for us.)
One place we’re not going: Today marks 27 years since Euro Disney (now called Disneyland Paris) opened its doors for the first time.
You
Driving the Day EYE OF THE BEHOLDER: Some people’s necessary oversight of the IRS audit process is another group’s needless political witch hunt.
Legal experts aren’t all on the same page about whether ’s demand for Trump’s returns has a legitimate purpose, though it certainly seems easier to find those who say it does. But there does seem to be general agreement that the courts, once and if they get a Trump tax returns case, will weigh whether Neal is making a reasonable request, Pro Tax’s Brian Faler writes — even though the statute says the Treasury “shall” comply with a tax chair’s request.
For instance, the Supreme Court said some six decades ago that Congress’ power in this area wasn’t unlimited. And for whatever it’s worth, the legal questions might not stop if Neal (D-Mass.) succeeded in obtaining Trump’s returns. Ed Kleinbard, a former chief of staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation, wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed this week that Ways and Means Democrats would need to meet an even higher standard to forward Trump’s returns to the full House.
POST-RECESS TABLE SETTING: Congress won’t return to D.C. until it’s practically May, and Grassley (R-Iowa) told reporters this week that he wanted to move on the IRS revamp “just as soon as we can.” He added that basically it takes something pretty special to change a measure when the chairs and ranking members of both tax-writing committees have signed off. “I think that it puts to the side any consideration of using this as a vehicle to move something else because I would like to use it to move extenders but that’s not going to be possible,” Grassley said.
So what about the disagreement over locking in the agency's free file program with commercial tax prep companies? If nothing else, this week’s debate over the IRS bill has shone a brighter light on the partnership the agency has with those major companies to assist low-income filers, which progressives say the agency should do on its own. There’s certainly an argument that supporters of the program — which has been flying under the radar, as shown by the fact that it was a ProPublica article that tipped off and energized House progressives on the issue — erred in seeking to codify free file in the legislation.
John Koskinen, a former IRS commissioner, told Morning Tax in an email that tax prep companies have gotten concerned in the past that the agency wouldn’t extend the free file program when their contracts ran out, which could explain the desire to codify the program. But Koskinen also noted that there weren’t discussions while he was commissioner to either make free file permanent or for the agency to end the program, because “the IRS has a significant number of higher priorities ahead of developing its own free file system.”
The IRS’s finite resources could continue to play a key role on this issue, with House Democrats forming a working group that could at least prod the agency toward implementing its own filing system. That’s a feature common in other industrialized nations, but some IRS experts also wonder if it’s worth the investment here. Jeff Trinca of Van Scoyoc Associates, for instance, suggested that the IRS could put resources that would go into its own filing system into the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program that offers free assistance to lower-income taxpayers.
THREE’S A TREND: Warren’s newest proposal at the top end — a 7 percent surcharge on corporations with at least $100 million in earnings — is the second major tax proposal of her campaign. (There’s a third big tax plan if you go back to last year, when the Massachusetts Democrat proposed expanding the estate tax to pay for an affordable housing measure.)
As Brian noted, there’s no shortage of complications to the plan, including that the surcharge would be calculated using a different method than the regular corporate tax and that companies could face a double tax on their foreign income. There are other concerns, too, even from those who are sympathetic to the rationale for the tax — including that it doesn’t do much to fix the corporate tax base.
INTERNATIONAL UPDATE TIME FOR DIGITAL: Count Canada among the countries that are hoping for a breakthrough from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s efforts to reach a global consensus on digital taxes, as our Alexander Panetta reports. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said digital taxes will be a major topic at financial meetings this week. “It's an issue that's heating up in importance in all of our countries,” Morneau said while advocating for a similar approach as the U.S. ""We'll be advocating for moving forward as rapidly as we can,” he said. “Our view, though, is we really think an international problem is best solved internationally.""
STATE NEWS TAXACHUSETTS, CONT’D: Democratic lawmakers in Massachusetts gave a warm reception to a millionaires tax on Thursday, leading The Boston Globe to suggest the proposal has “an easy path ahead despite staunch opposition from business groups.” Supporters say the tax could raise as much as $2 billion a year that could help fund a variety of initiatives in the state, while Democrats at the Thursday hearing pushed back on business groups that said the tax would hurt growth. This is the second time that advocates have pushed for the tax, after the state’s Supreme Judicial Court tossed out an earlier ballot initiative. Supporters are now taking a new approach to try to get the tax into law, which will require an extensive procedural gauntlet that makes 2023 the earliest the new tax would go into effect.

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— To both cheers and jeers, the U.K. extradited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the U.S. to face hacking-related charges. It’s just the start of what could be a complex saga.
— The head of the NSA and Cyber Command placed additional flesh on the bone of the national security argument against Huawei. It stems from the nature of its home government.
— More on the morale issues at the OMB’s office that secures agency IT: A former office official says the turmoil will make it harder to achieve uniform cybersecurity progress.
HAPPY FRIDAY Stop already. Just … stop. Send SCREAMING OUT OF ECUADOR — U.S. authorities unsealed hacking conspiracy charges Thursday against WikiLeaks founder Assange, but there are still plenty of unknowns ahead.
— The charges: Those sympathetic to Assange, but even some who weren’t, found the charges weak, even “ shocking ” in the words of famed fellow leaker Edward Snowden. First Amendment attorney Ken White tweeted that the indictment “doesn't say that Assange hacked the password or [Chelsea] Manning used it or files were downloaded and distributed as a result, which it absolutely would charge if any of those things happened.” Reports that Assange might have offered aid to crack passwords date back to at least 2011 , and the Obama administration apparently did not find the idea compelling enough to pursue. The charge's timing appears related to a deadline clock from the alleged crime, and might be tied as well to the ease of extradition from the U.K. But Yahoo reported that there are other sealed charges against Assange, who has angered the U.S. government with plenty of other leaks such as revealing CIA hacking tools.
— The judges: One judge already offered a harsh appraisal of Assange. A U.K. court found him guilty of skipping bail. District Judge Michael Snow called Assange's behavior that ""of a narcissist who cannot see beyond his own self interest."" In the U.S., Eastern Virginia District Court Judge Claude Hilton, an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan and a former judge on the intelligence court that approves foreign surveillance warrants, will hear Assange’s case. That’s the same location as the trial of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and the place where Hilton recently held Manning in contempt of court.
MIXED FEELINGS ON ASSANGE ARREST — People and organizations across the spectrum had something to say regarding Assange’s arrest, with many lawmakers cheering it as a victory for democracy. Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted that he believes Assange’s actions put “troops at risk and jeopardized the lives of those who helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer focused elsewhere, tweeting a call for further investigation into Assange’s “meddling in our elections on behalf of Putin and the Russian government."" Renee DiResta, director of research at the social media research firm New Knowledge, noted on Twitter that throughout the lifecycle of Russian troll farm Internet Research Agency, the group showed broad support for Assange, painting him as a “noble freedom fighter across other accounts, to all audiences (right, left, Black community).”
Some activist and watchdog groups, however, were less than thrilled with Assange’s arrest. The ACLU's Ben Wizner wrote in a release that should prosecution occur, it would “open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations,"" and risk endangering “U.S. journalists, who routinely violate foreign secrecy laws to deliver information vital to the public's interest.""
As for the commander in chief? President Donald Trump said he knew “nothing about WikiLeaks” despite telling a crowd at a 2016 North Carolina campaign rally ""Oh, we love WikiLeaks.""
CHINA HUAWEI’S GOT A GUN — U.S. concerns about China using telecom companies such as Huawei to extend Beijing’s influence go beyond spying to include the looming availability of 5G technology, the head of US. Cyber Command and the NSA said Thursday. “If you have 5th generation wireless infrastructure, do you want a nation that doesn’t have respect for the rule of law, that doesn’t have a series of norms, and has a very, very concerted effort to partner both their government and their private sector together to make sure that the government’s will is being done — do you want that in the infrastructure that runs your economy, your national security, your social communications?” Army Gen. Paul Nakasone said during the 2019 Marshall Forum.
“That’s what we’re very, very concerned about. It’s not the fact that … we have a smoking gun that we can’t identify. We have a loaded gun — when you think about an adversary that has the ability to control your infrastructure,” the four-star added. He said the U.S. would continue to talk to allies about the threat.
MORE THAN JUST PRESTIGE — Turmoil in the OMB office that helps agencies secure their networks and upgrade their technology will reduce the office’s influence in interagency meetings and make it harder to achieve uniform cybersecurity progress, sources told Eric for his recent story on the office’s morale woes. The turmoil “contributes to less influence through the convening power of the office, if it’s obvious that the people who are in it don’t believe in the strategy or implementation or their leadership,” said one former Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer employee. A current OMB employee said that while other agencies “won’t say it openly … everybody knows” about the office’s issues, which include a confusing reorganization and grumbling about inaccessible leaders.
OFCIO staff are supposed to ensure that agencies implement the president’s vision for IT modernization and digital security. But in this environment, agencies will “question whether or not [OFCIO staff] really have leadership’s backing to be trying to get them to do something they don’t want to do,” said a former senior federal cyber official. “The agency may decide that it’s just easier to wait you out, because you might be leaving soon.” Agencies will also get frustrated if OFCIO can’t deliver the help they want and need. These possibilities alarmed several sources. “If you can’t convince the departments and agencies to actually implement a policy,” said a former senior federal IT official who worked closely with OFCIO, “then what good is it?”
WE’RE GOING STEADY — The level of cyber risk for U.S. businesses is holding steady for the first quarter of 2019, according to a report Thursday by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and FICO, with a national risk score of 687. The organizations kicked off their measurements just last year. The Assessment of Business Cyber Risk report found small firms improved 5 points, up to 740, while large firms dipped 3 points, to 643. The score, which ranges from 300 to 850, calculates the probability of an organization suffering a breach in the next year.
There is a disparity in risk scores between small and large businesses “due to the fact that large firms have a wider attack surface and are more frequently the target of cyber criminals,” said Doug Clare, vice president for cybersecurity solutions at FICO. But a lower score doesn’t mean “insufficient diligence is being applied by those entities,” said Christopher Roberti, senior vice president for cyber, intelligence, and security policy at the Chamber of Commerce. “Such entities may have a higher risk profile due to the nature of their businesses.”
 “Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley is seeking information from HHS about its cybersecurity policies following a watchdog report detailing security vulnerabilities.” … A federal jury convicted two Romanians of launching sophisticated malware attacks that infected 400,000 computers and netted millions of dollars. … The Ohio state legislature is moving quickly to advance a bill that would create a state cyber defense force comprised of civilian volunteers. … New cases suggest Robert Mueller’s investigation could yield fresh evidence and additional charges in the coming months and years. … EU Justice Commissioner is pitching a global coalition to help regulate privacy and data security.

QUICK FIX Jeff Bezos challenged other retailers to pay a $15 hourly minimum.
— The EEOC will be in court April 16 to seek delay for a judge's ruling that requires the agency to collect pay data broken down by race, ethnicity, and gender.
— Trump tried to dump immigrant detainees in Nancy Pelosi's district.
GOOD MORNING! It’s Friday, April 12, AMAZON'S FIGHT FOR $15: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos urged competitors to match the online superstore's $15 hourly minimum wage plus benefits in a letter to shareholders Thursday, even as those same companies struggle to catch up with Amazon's sales.
“I challenge our top retail competitors (you know who you are!) to match our employee benefits and our $15 minimum wage,” Bezos said in the letter, according to the Washington Post (which Bezos owns). “Do it! Better yet, go to $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us. It’s a kind of competition that will benefit everyone.” Amazon boosted its wage minimum in November (although it also slashed warehouse workers’ bonuses and stock option benefits).
The letter drew some shade from Walmart Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs Dan Bartlett, who tweeted Thursday morning: “Hey retail competitors out there (you know who you are) how about paying your taxes?” The tweet linked to a Feb. 16 news report by Yahoo! Finance that Amazon paid no federal income tax in 2017 or 2018. Bartlett added : “FWIW, the vast majority of our warehouse associates have been making more than $15 for a long time. And they still get quarterly performance bonuses.”
Diversity HEARING DATE ON EEO-1 DEADLINE: Attorneys representing the Office of Management and Budget and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will be in court April 16 for a hearing regarding the deadline for when businesses with 100 or more employees will be required to submit pay data broken down by race, ethnicity, and gender. An Obama-era requirement that the EEOC collect this demographic information was stayed by the Trump administration, but then reinstated by a DC federal court in March . The government said earlier this month that it could manage a September 30 deadline, but Judge Tanya Chutkan hasn't decided whether that will do. Chutkan wasn't pleased to learn that the agency didn't move quickly to alert businesses to the reinstated reporting requirements.
The National Women's Law Center, which challenged the Trump administration's stay of the new pay reporting requirements, has urged Chutkan to reject the EEOC's request. Meanwhile, the American Society of Employers and the DirectEmployers Association have urged Chutkan to put off the deadline to next year, and the Chamber of Commerce has asked Chutkan give employers 18 months to comply.

IMMIGRATION TRUMP TRIED TO DUMP DETAINEES IN SANCTUARY CITIES : At least twice in the past six months, the Trump White House tried to persuade U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release detainees in sanctuary cities, Rachael Bade and Nick Miroff report for the Washington Post. One proposed target was Nancy Pelosi's district in San Francisco. ""Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller discussed the proposal with ICE, according to two DHS officials. Matthew Albence, who is ICE’s acting deputy director, immediately questioned the proposal in November and later circulated the idea within his agency when it resurfaced in February, seeking the legal review that ultimately doomed the proposal.""
""The extent of this administration’s cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,” Pelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne told the Post. “Using human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.” More here .
MCCONNELL SAYS LETS TALK IMMIGRATION: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday ""it's way past time"" to have an ""adult bipartisan discussion"" with Democrats ""about our immigration laws,"" POLITICO's Marianne LeVine reports.
“I’m willing to enter into a negotiation to see what we can do to fix the problems,"" the Kentucky Republican said. The Senate last year crafted a bipartisan immigration bill that would have given as many as 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship while spending $25 billion on border security, but Trump wouldn't support it and the bill died. McConnell stipulated that any alterations to existing law would have to address border security and asylum. More here .
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS DROP TO HISTORIC LOWS: Only 196,000 people filed initial unemployment benefit claims during the week ending April 6, the lowest level since 1969, the Labor Department reported Thursday. But the Associated Press’ Christopher Rugaber points out that the historic numbers aren’t due only to a tight labor market. “Many states have imposed stricter rules on their unemployment insurance programs — from making it harder to qualify to reducing the duration of benefits to cutting payouts,” he writes .
The Labor Department published a proposal last year that would allow states to require a broad swath of applicants for unemployment insurance to pass drug tests. Under the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, Congress gave states the authority to impose drug tests, but that bill passed at a time when unemployment was high. Democrats agreed to the drug-test provision to secure Republican votes to extend emergency spending for unemployment insurance. The Obama administration then implemented a regulation that limited sharply the population that could be subjected to the drug tests. Then the Trump administration broadened that population, even as unemployment dropped below 4 percent. More from POLITICO’s Rebecca Rainey here .
UNIONS TRUMP SAYS HE'S STILL FRIENDS WITH LABOR: At an event Wednesday in Crosby, Texas, Trump promised the International Union of Operating Engineers that labor ""will always have a friend at the White House,"" the Washington Examiner's Sean Higgins reported. ""Under this administration we have ended the war on energy .... and we've put thousands and thousands of patriotic union members like you to work building our energy future,"" the president said.
But in a March event in Lima Ohio, Trump sang a very different tune . ""I sort of don’t want to meet"" with union leaders, Trump told that crowd. ""Because the heads of the union are not honest people. They’re not honest.“ Trump blamed the closing of GM's Lordstown plant on high union dues (""You're paying too much dues""), which didn't make a lot of sense because union dues comes out of workers' pockets, not management's. More from Higgins here .
Wages DUKE DOCTORAL STUDENTS WIN $15 AN HOUR: Doctoral candidates at Duke University will be paid the equivalent of $15 an hour starting in 2022, the university said in an email Thursday. “While the majority of our Ph.D. students already receive year-round funding, we believe that providing 12-month stipends, at the full rate, will enhance the experience for all graduate students."" Each grad student will receive $31,160 per academic year (the equivalent of $15 per hour for a full-time employee).
The announcement follows a yearlong effort by the Duke Graduate Students Union. “Duke is not an easy campus to organize on. We live in the right-to-work South,” said Claire Ravenscroft, a union leader and fifth-year doctoral candidate. “Every campus worker across the country should know that if we can fight and win in this condition they can fight and win in theirs.”
Emory University announced a similar pay raise last year. Nationally, stipends for funded graduate students range from about $13,000 a year to $34,000 a year, according to Inside HigherEd .
Worker Safety REPORT: TESLA SUPPRESSED WORKERS COMP CLAIMS: A new investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting found that automaker Tesla’s workers’ compensation manager routinely pressured Dr. Basil Besh, who ran the factory injury clinic, “to make sure Tesla wasn’t on the hook for certain injured workers.” Will Evans reports that the car company “coordinated behind the scenes in an arrangement that financially benefited both the carmaker and the doctor.” One former clinic employee told Rewire that Besh “ordered his medical staff to reverse course and change diagnoses and job restrictions to make the automaker happy.”
“He would say, ‘I’m not losing the contract over this – get this case closed,’” according to the former employee. Besh told Reveal that Tesla doesn’t pressure him to dismiss injuries and that his determinations are “only based on what the patient needs.” More here .
Strikes STOP AND SHOP STRIKE: “As many as 31,000 workers at Stop & Shop grocery stores in New England went on strike Thursday after contract negotiations stalled between management and the United Food & Commercial Workers,” POLITICO’s Ian Kullgren reports. “The union says it is fighting proposed benefit cuts at the same time that Ahold Delhaize, the corporation that owns Stop & Shop, voted to give shareholders an 11 percent dividends increase.” More here .
TEACHERS STRIKES:
Illinois: After bargaining for nearly a year, more than 93 percent of University of Illinois-Chicago United Faculty members voted to authorize a strike, the union announced Thursday. ""The administration admitted they don’t have a plan to invest in faculty for the sake of our students,” said Janet Smith, UICUF president. “Our faculty clearly think it’s time to address that.” The union argues that the administration has not “adequately” addressed the issue of compensation while enrollment has increased
California: Some 3,000 members of the Sacramento City Classroom Teachers Association , went on strike Thursday over what they said was the Sacramento City Unified School District's failure to fulfill the terms of a contract it reached with teachers in 2017. ""This strike is to ensure that SCUSD management keeps its promises to our students,"" said association president David Fisher. “The Sacramento City Teachers Association is the third major teachers union in California to strike this year, following those in Los Angeles and Oakland — all of whom have called for more school funding, smaller class sizes, and support services,” POLITICO’s Mackenzie Mays reports.

Illinois: Loyola University Chicago graduate workers plan a sit-in Monday to protest the institution's failure to reach a ""fair contract"" with their union.

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— Congressional Democratic leaders are planning to sit down with President Donald Trump to talk infrastructure. It's a sign that hope remains for a big, bipartisan bill, but they still face an uphill battle to actually passing something.
— The FAA is meeting with representatives from three major U.S. airlines today, as well as pilots unions, to gather information about their views on the troubled Boeing 737 MAX.
— Senate backers of a bill that would create a regulatory framework for driverless cars are trying to resurrect their legislation and have been meeting with leading House lawmakers on the issue.
HAPPY FRIDAY:
""I said / Jet Boy's fly / Jet Boy's gone / Jet Boy stole my baby.""
Infrastructure SIT-DOWN COMING SOON: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Trump are planning to meet in the next few weeks to talk infrastructure, a sign the leaders are still hopeful about pushing a bipartisan plan even as contentious issues like immigration and health care continue to divide the two parties.
No progress on pay-fors: How to pay for it remains the question everyone wants to ask, but few want to answer. House Democrats are pushing for an increase in the federal gas tax, but the chances of that passing in the Senate are as close to impossible as it gets while still acknowledging that Congress can be unpredictable on occasion. Even if Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put it up to a vote, it’s still not clear a gas tax hike could pass. Schumer has opposed an increase in the past, and dodged a question about it at a press briefing Thursday. It would be a tough vote for moderate, battleground state Democrats, who can probably already picture the campaign ads featuring their vote to raise a tax. And even some progressives like Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have expressed hesitancy — she’d rather tax multimillionaires.
Alternatives? Many lawmakers want to evolve from the gas tax to a vehicle miles traveled fee, which has been piloted in several states, but most experts say it couldn’t be implemented fast enough to pay for any meaningful infrastructure upgrades in the near term.
Wicker weighs in: Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) told our Stephanie Beasley that “it’s wonderful” there are bipartisan talks about infrastructure, but he warned there’s no “magic wand” for funding a bill. “In the end we're going to have to be grown-ups and figure out a way to pay for infrastructure,” he said.
Aviation SIT-DOWN OF ANOTHER SORT: The FAA is planning to meet with airlines and pilots unions today to talk about the 737 MAX, our Brianna Gurciullo reported . It’s essentially a listening session; a spokesperson told POLITICO the agency will use the meeting to “gather facts, information and individual views to further understand their views as FAA decides what needs to be done before returning the aircraft to service.” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Thursday that the company had completed 96 flights with the updated MAX software and is continuing to conduct more tests.
From the Hill: Brianna also reported that a new bill from Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) would require airplanes to have two cockpit features that were lacking in both of the 737 MAX jets that crashed in Ethiopia and Indonesia. The bill, co-sponsored by eight other Democrats, would require angle-of-attack indicators and disagree alerts on airliners as well as mandate that manufacturers offer “non-required safety enhancing equipment"" to airlines at no extra charge. Boeing said in a letter to senators last week that its aircraft “are equipped with all critical safety features necessary to operate the plane safely,” and it would never charge additional fees for access to necessary safety features. Markey’s bill is supported by groups representing pilots and flight attendants, as well as the National Consumers League.
It's official: Trump sent the nomination of Steve Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines executive tapped to lead the FAA, to the Senate for consideration on Thursday.
QATAR AIR RESPONDS TO OPEN SKIES CLAIMS: Qatar Airways fired back at allegations from U.S. lawmakers including Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, arguing that its investment in Air Italy fully complies with its Open Skies Agreement with the U.S. “Qatar Airways’ investment in Air Italy was a matter of public knowledge (as were Qatar Airways’ investments in other airlines) at the time of the U.S.-Qatar discussions; airline investments were not raised as a point of concern during those talks. The Understandings do not mention or prohibit cross-border investments of any type,” the company wrote . Cruz and others have claimed the Qatari government providing subsidies to state-owned airlines may violate the agreement.
KNOW BEFORE YOU FLY: The state legislatures in California and Utah in the past few weeks have passed resolutions in support of the Know Before You Fly campaign, an initiative aimed at promoting the safe and responsible use of drones. The campaign was launched in 2014 by the Academy of Model Aeronautics and Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. Read more about it here .
OFFICE SPACE: DOT could do a better job of efficiently managing its office space, according to a review by the agency’s inspector general. The report estimates that DOT could put $2.1 million to better use because it’s paying more for some space than its utilization standards call for. That’s true for nearly every subagency and major office within DOT that the IG sampled.

AUTOMOBILES CIRCLING BACK: Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) are working on resurrecting driverless car legislation after their bill fell flat last year. Our Tanya Snyder, Pro Tech’s John Hendel and your host report that they’ve been holding meetings with the House to try to find a consensus path forward. That’s Plan A, which they think gives them the best chance of getting a bill to the president’s desk, but they also have a backup, which is to simply reintroduce the legislation they failed to get off the ground, S. 1885 (115) .
CREEPING CARLESSNESS: A new survey from the Navy Federal Credit Union found that 42 percent of Americans would consider going carless, and the same can be said for 60 percent of Gen Z and millennials. The survey also found that 1 in 4 people use a ridesharing service at least monthly.
Security NO WORRIES: Senate Republicans appeared unfazed by the news of TSA Administrator David Pekoske temporarily taking over deputy DHS secretary duties while holding on to his title at TSA. Acting Deputy Administrator Patricia Cogswell will oversee the agency in his stead. Wicker said that while he knows little about her, “I just think it will all work out, and I don’t think there’s going to be much flap over this,” Stephanie reports .

Is it possible some candidates who meet the initial polling and fundraising criteria will be left off stage anyway?

THE TOPLINES THE DEBATE STAGE — We’re roughly two and a half months out from the first Democratic presidential primary debates in June, and there is a plausible universe in which some candidates are left off the stage.
To briefly reiterate the ways to qualify for the debates: A candidate either needs to get 1 percent in three qualifying polls or have 65,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 200 unique donors in each of at least 20 states. If more than 20 candidates qualify, it goes to a series of tiebreakers : Candidates who hit both thresholds take priority, followed by highest polling average, followed by highest number of unique donors.
According to a Campaign Pro analysis, 13 declared candidates have already met the polling threshold (in no particular order): Cory Booker , Kirsten Gillibrand , Kamala Harris , Amy Klobuchar , Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren , Julian Castro, John Delaney, Beto O’Rourke, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, Andrew Yang and Buttigieg. Additionally, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard tweeted that she qualified through the donor threshold (her campaign told Score they have hit 200 donors in more than 40 states). And this, of course, excludes former Vice President Joe Biden, who has easily crossed the polling threshold if (or when) he gets into the race.
If Biden declares, that brings us to 15 people on the stage. But more than five other people could be eyeing a debate podium. This includes declared candidates who have not hit the polling threshold and have not publicly said they’ve reached the donor mark, like Rep. Eric Swalwell or Marianne Williamson. But there’s also the prospective candidates who haven’t gotten in — which includes Stacey Abrams, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet , former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe or even a surprise candidate. Even if some don’t ultimately run, it is possible that someone will be on the outside looking in during the debates.
That’s where the tiebreakers become important, but parts of it are still unclear. A DNC official declined to discuss details about the tiebreakers with Score, saying “we will be communicating about the specifics to the campaigns and not commenting until after we do that.” But here are some of our most pressing unanswered questions: How exactly will the polling average be calculated? How are polls from the same pollster in the same demographic area treated in an average? How are polls that left out a candidate counted, and what if a candidate got less than 1 percent, but not zero? How exactly will donors be verified through ActBlue and NGP-VAN?
IN THE TRENCHES PRESIDENTIAL BIG BOARD — The early states are important, but many candidates are already looking ahead to Super Tuesday, where roughly 40 percent of pledged delegates will be decided. “In interviews, Democrats in these Super Tuesday states — a list that includes California, Texas, and a bevy of southern states — named Harris and Sanders as the candidates whose campaigns are doing the most outreach at this early stage, though that designation varied from state to state. Booker and Elizabeth Warren are also on the radar,” McClatchy’s Katie Glueck, Alex Roarty and Adam Wollner reported.
— Biden sought the support of segregationists in the Senate when he was fighting school busing in the 1970s, CNN’s Jeff Zeleny reported.
— The ideas primary continues for Warren: She rolled out a plan to impose a 7 percent tax on corporations making more than $100 million, POLITICO’s Brian Faler reported. POLITICO’s Alex Thompson also took a deep dive into Warren’s history as a young Republican in POLITICO Magazine.
THE CASH DASH — Ernst raised $1.7 million in the first quarter, with $2.8 million cash on hand, per Campaign Pro’s James Arkin . Gardner raised $2 million in the first quarter, with $3.4 million on hand, per James . Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) raised $1.4 million and has $4.2 million on hand ( FEC filing ).
— GOP Rep. Devin Nunes posted a massive haul in CA-22, bringing in more than $1.1 million in the first quarter, with $5 million in the bank, per the Washington Examiner’s David Drucker .
— More House Republican incumbent numbers: Ann Wagner (MO-02) raised $514,000 and has $1.4 million on hand, per her campaign. Andy Barr (KY-06) raised $608,000 with $639,000 cash on hand ( FEC filing ). Freshman Jim Hagedorn (MN-01) raised $319,000, with $247,000 in the bank ( FEC filing ).
BIPARTISAN FRIENDS FOREVER — Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) crossed the aisle to endorse Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) for reelection in a yet-to-air appearance on C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers,” POLITICO’s Burgess Everett reported.
SHOW US THE MONEY — A group of 16 good government advocacy groups released an open letter to all the 2020 candidates, calling on them to voluntarily release their bundlers, POLITICO’s Maggie Severns reported. In 2016, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush both released some details about their bundlers, while President Donald Trump and other GOP candidates did not.
CAMPAIGN CASH — David Emadi, the director of Georgia’s ethics commission, “plans to subpoena bank records from the campaign of 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and groups that raised money to help her,” The Atlanta-Journal Constitution’s James Salzer reported. “The investigations into the Abrams and [some Atlanta] mayoral campaigns came out of audits of contribution and expenditure reports candidates and political groups have to file”.
Abrams’ former campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, blasted the investigation: “The new ethics chief — a [now-Gov. Brian] Kemp donor and former Republican Party leader — is using his power to threaten and lob baseless partisan accusations at the former Abrams campaign”. Emadi was a former officer in a local county’s GOP.
HOUSE RECRUITMENT WATCH — Democrat Betsy Dirksen Londrigan announced she will run again in IL-13. She narrowly lost to GOP Rep. Rodney Davis in 2018.
THE GOVERNOR’S MANSION — Louisiana state Sen. Sharon Hewitt said she will seek reelection instead of running for governor, likely setting the gubernatorial field at Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and GOP Rep. Ralph Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, the Monroe News Star’s Greg Hilburn reported.
POLLS POLLS POLLS — A new Monmouth University poll in Iowa has a bump for Buttigieg. Biden is in first with 27 percent, followed by Sanders’ 16 percent. Buttigieg is in third with 9 percent, Harris and Warren are both at 7 percent and O’Rourke is at 6 percent. This was also the third qualifying poll for both Delaney and Yang (April 4-9, 351 likely Democratic caucus goers). And a reminder — it is still quite early!
— Some Georgia favorable/unfavorable numbers in a new Atlanta Journal-Constitution/UGA poll : 47 percent have a positive impression of GOP Sen.

Trump accuses media of not focusing enough on charges against Obama White House lawyer,www.politico.com,CAITLIN OPRYSKO,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/12/trump-media-gregory-craig-1272335,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump on Friday accused the media of burying news that a White House counsel in the Obama administration had been indicted on “very serious” charges similar to those his former campaign chairman and national security adviser pleaded guilty to last year.
“President Obama’s top White House lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, was indicted yesterday on very serious charges,” Trump tweeted, singling out The New York Times and The Washington Post over where each outlet placed the story in their respective papers Friday morning. Story Continued Below
“This is a really big story, but the Fake News New York Times didn’t even put it on page one, rather page 16. @washingtonpost not much better, ‘tiny’ page one,” Trump continued. “Corrupt News!”
Craig, who served in the White House in the first year of former President Barack Obama’s first term, was charged Thursday with making false statements and concealing material information about his work in private practice lobbying on behalf of the Ukrainian government.
While Craig’s indictment was heavily covered by the national media on Thursday and Friday, it was overshadowed by the sudden arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on U.S. charges of computer hacking. Craig’s indictment was also somewhat less of a surprise after his attorneys pre-emptively put out a statement in his defense the night before, foreshadowing the indictment.

Thursday’s indictments were one more signal that although special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has wrapped up, fallout from the inquiry is certain to continue. One of the lasting effects of the Russia probe will almost certainly be increased enforcement and scrutiny of those lobbying for foreign governments.
Trump's allies embraced Craig's indictment on Thursday. In one tweet, former Trump campaign manager and senior counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway hailed the ""breaking news,"" writing that ""FINALLY! WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL INDICTED in connection with MUELLER investigation!""
But while the president on Friday labeled the charges against Craig “very serious,” he didn't mention the parallels between the cases or Craig's ties to his own former advisers who he contends were treated unfairly by the Justice Department.
The charges announced Thursday stem from work Craig did in 2012 — after leaving the White House — on a report relating to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s jailing of one of his political opponents: former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. That report was meant to be used by Paul Manafort, the president’s former campaign chairman, who had been lobbying for Yanukovych at the time, to defend the former president.
While Craig has maintained his innocence, prosecutors accused him of purposefully and repeatedly misleading federal investigators about whether he needed to register as a foreign lobbyist, including when he sat for an interview with Mueller.
Manafort pleaded guilty last year for failing to register as a foreign agent, among other things, and earlier this year was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Trump said at the time that Manafort’s sentencing was a “very sad situation” and that he felt “badly” for him."

Driving the Day AG CENSUS HIGHLIGHTS FEWER FARMS, OLDER FARMERS: The Agriculture Department’s latest survey offers fresh numbers that back up major trends in the industry: the shrinking number of farms, aging producers and consolidation into larger operations, reports Pro Ag’s Catherine Boudreau.
— But there were some notable shifts: Most of the newly identified producers are female, USDA said, and about 56 percent of farms have at least one woman making decisions.
More young farmers: USDA defines young farmers as those aged 35 or younger, and in 2017 there were 321,261 — accounting for 8 percent of all producers. For many, farming wasn’t their primary occupation, and they tend to be working on larger than average operations.
This time, USDA allowed respondents to list multiple farm decision-makers instead of just one. That’s partly responsible for the uptick because it likely captured the next generation working with their parents, said Sophie Ackoff, vice president of policy and campaigns for the National Young Farmers Coalition. But there still aren’t enough young farmers to replace those who are aging out and retiring, Ackoff added.
Lack of racial diversity: More than 95 percent of producers are white; 3 percent are Hispanic; and 1.7 percent are Native Americans or Native Alaskans, the overall demographic figures show. African-Americans accounted for 1.3 percent of producers, while Asian-Americans and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders each accounted for less than 1 percent.
ECONOMICS AT A GLANCE IN THE CENSUS: The largest operations, or those with at least $5 million in sales, accounted for 35 percent of all sales in 2017. Only these very large farms — as well as very small farms with annual sales of $2,500 or under — increased in number over the five-year period. The number of middle-size farms in all ag sectors fell.
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the stats reflected the story of capitalism and economies of scale, requiring farms to get bigger to survive.
Dairy decline: The number of dairy farms dropped by more than 17 percent across the country. But milk sales have increased by 4 percent to more than $36 billion, reflecting how big operations are getting bigger. (ICYMI: This Pro DataPoint graphic shows how smaller operations have been squeezed out.)
A local food first: The 2017 census for the first time quantified direct-to-consumer sales, such as at farmers markets, which totaled $2.8 billion.
Farmers are also implementing more conservation practices, such as reducing tillage and planting cover crops , per Pro Ag’s Liz Crampton.
Can’t forget ginseng and alpacas: USDA doesn’t publish annual data on certain goods and animals like ginseng and alpaca, leaving it up to the five-year census to capture the numbers. Farmers are growing more ginseng, nearly tripling acreage to 1,050 acres in 2017. Alpacas are declining in number, though more farms are raising them.
Charting consolidation: This graphic from USDA shows how a small number of U.S. farms account for a large portion of production. Check it out below:

TRUMP, SENATORS HUDDLE ON DELAYED DISASTER AID: Senators whose states are recovering from recent natural disasters visited the White House on Thursday to discuss with Trump the fate of the stalled disaster aid package, H.R. 268 (116) , which the Senate failed to advance last week, POLITICO’s Marianne LeVine and Burgess Everett report .
The legislation has been bogged down for months, but Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) said he was more optimistic because the two-week recess will pressure negotiators to come to an agreement.
Meanwhile, winter storm Wesley dumped heavy snow on portions of the Plains and the Midwest on Thursday, leaving some 90,000 people without power in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, the Weather Channel reports . (More here .)
— Continued precipitation and snowmelt could cause another surge in the Missouri River after last month’s severe flooding breached levees and swamped farmland and grain storage sites along the river.
Grain freeze: Flooding continues to disrupt barge traffic on major Midwestern waterways, as 10 locks on the Mississippi River remain closed, according to USDA’s weekly Grain Transportation Report . Railroads are still recovering after the flooding, too.
PORK PRODUCERS PUSH FOR QUICK JAPAN TALKS: The pork industry is eager for U.S. trade talks with Japan to begin and plans to lobby the administration to move quickly in striking a favorable deal, according to Nick Giordano, vice president and counsel for the National Pork Producers Council.
During a media roundtable, he said the 11-nation CPTPP (the new name for the Trans-Pacific Partnership) has edged out U.S. companies already suffering from retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and Mexico.
“The fact that we’re on three retaliation lists — and I’m not sure there’s an industry in the country that’s on three retaliation lists — is an immediate hair on fire issue,” he said. “But what a lot of people don’t know is what we have at stake in Japan, which is our biggest value market and the math says you’ve got a big problem.”
— Glimmer of hope? China bought more than 77,700 metric tons of U.S. pork last week, as African swine fever continues spreading through parts of Asia. It’s the highest weekly sales to China since USDA began keeping records in 2013, Reuters reports .
TRADE CORNER AG STILL STICKING POINT AS U.S.-EU TALKS STEP FORWARD: European countries gave the initial go-ahead to launch trade talks with the U.S., but the negotiations are still headed for a major standoff over ag, food and other disputes, POLITICO Europe reports .
EU leaders want to reach a quick, limited deal, focused on removing industrial tariffs — and steering clear of agriculture and food standards. The Trump administration and many U.S. lawmakers insist on including ag in the negotiations, hoping for an agreement that opens up the European market to more farm goods and lifts bans on products like hormone-treated beef.
France to vote ‘non’: The negotiating mandates are set to be approved Monday, despite objections from France. (A French official said the country will vote against launching the trade talks, but it’s unlikely to affect adoption of the mandates.)
ROW CROPS — Senate Democrats offered warnings of a rural “disaster” as Trump’s trade wars continue into the 2019 planting season. “Show me a crop we can plant right now that’s worth anything. It’s really hard,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, your host reports.
— Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will meet with Trump on infrastructure in the next few weeks, though he’s skeptical any agreement can be reached, Pro Transportation’s Tanya Snyder reports .
— The White House is moving to limit the power of federal regulators to issue non-binding guidance without approval from OMB, in a bid to crack down on what deregulatory advocates see as backdoor rulemaking. Pro’s Victoria Guida has more here .
— A French appeals court found that Monsanto, now owned by Bayer, is liable for the health problems of a grain farmer who used the company’s Lasso herbicide and suffered comas, fainting and potential neurological disorders, our POLITICO Europe colleagues write .

"DeVos, Cruz targeting Democrats for 'Education Freedom' support",www.politico.com,politico.com,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-education/2019/04/12/devos-cruz-targeting-democrats-for-education-freedom-support-424348,"With help from Benjamin Wermund and Kimberly Hefling Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) are looking in a surprising place for support for their tax credit scholarship proposal: the Democratic Party (they acknowledge they face an uphill battle).
— A controversial Arizona “no promo homo” law has been repealed following a discrimination lawsuit filed by LGBTQ groups.
— A top Education Department official says the agency plans to experiment with income share agreements and move to an annual master promissory note as it seeks to address student debt.
IT’S FRIDAY (HOORAY!). Got news to share? Drop me a line at ngaudiano@politico.com
Driving the Day LOOKING TO DEMOCRATS FOR ‘EDUCATION FREEDOM’ SUPPORT: DeVos said Thursday that she and Cruz are “continuing to work on raising support for and sponsors for” their tax credit scholarship proposal, S. 634 (116) . “We’ve encouraged people to think very broadly about what choice can mean,” she said during the Reagan Institute Summit on Education.
— They face a very uphill battle — and they acknowledged as much Thursday, but said they have a plan. ""To pass Betsy's and my legislation now, we're going to have to broaden the coalition,"" Cruz said. ""We're going to have to start picking off Democrats. … Particularly in the [ Nancy] Pelosi House, but we're not going to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.""
— Cruz said Democrats are ""terrified to do something that the teachers unions disagree with."" But he noted that's why he built a separate ""tranche"" of funding for workforce programs into the bill that states can also opt into, even if they don't want to pick up the school choice tax credit: ""To try to pick off and build the support of blue collar unions that are typically Democratic allies and power centers.""

STATE NEWS 'NO PROMO HOMO' LAW REPEALED: Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey quickly signed legislation Thursday to repeal a controversial state law barring HIV and AIDS instruction that “promotes a homosexual lifestyle,” KTAR News reported .
— The 1991 law prohibited HIV and AIDS instruction that “portrays homosexuality as a positive alternative lifestyle” or “suggests that some methods of sex are safe methods of homosexual sex,” the station reported.
— Kathy Hoffman, Arizona’s Superintendent of Public Instruction, wrote in a series of tweets , “This repeal means students will no longer be denied access to medically accurate, science-based information regarding HIV/AIDS,” adding that it shows all are welcome in Arizona schools “regardless of who they are and who they love.”
— The Associated Press reported the move was intended to end a discrimination lawsuit filed by LGBTQ groups. Ducey’s signing came less than an hour after the state Senate approved the repeal with a 19-10 vote.

EDUCATION DEPARTMENT INCOME SHARE AGREEMENTS ON THE TABLE: Diane Jones, the Education Department's principal deputy undersecretary, said Thursday the department plans to experiment with income share agreements. Such agreements typically allow students to borrow money from their college or university to pay for tuition and then repay the school with a percentage of their future earnings.
— She didn't provide specifics of the plans during the Reagan Institute Summit on Education, beyond saying: ""We love income share agreements. We’re thinking about how we use the federal programs to do an experiment with income share agreements.""
— Jones also said within two years, the department wants to move to a master promissory note that students would sign annually, “so that we know that you know what you’re signing up for.” As of now, student loan borrowers sign a master promissory note explaining the terms of their loan, which is good for 10 years if they take out additional student loans. Kimberly Hefling has more .
Congress ALEXANDER, WEINGARTEN TALK EDUCATION POLICY OVER BREAKFAST: Senate HELP Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten don’t always see eye to eye, but apparently they can still dine together.
— Alexander mentioned during Thursday's Reagan Institute Summit on Education that he had breakfast with Weingarten earlier that morning. The comment came after he described how teachers unions had been among the groups supportive of replacing No Child Left Behind with ESSA. He also emphasized that in reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, he's striving again for a bipartisan law not only because it's easier to pass, but it also “creates stability in the policy.”
— Afterward, when asked, Weingarten revealed that the two ate at Bistro Bis on the Hill . She said the two developed a “pretty good working relationship” during ESSA. “Even when we differ, there’s a real respect for each other, and I’m grateful for that,” she said. Weingarten said HEA, ESSA and health care policy were discussed, but she was coy about the specifics.
— When asked whether the two discussed DeVos, Weingarten laughed and changed the subject.
K-12 ADVOCATES PUSH FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL FUNDING: Labor and community leaders are rallying around a bill to fully fund in 10 years both Title 1 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, laws that have been underfunded for decades.
— “Betsy DeVos has been in the news lately , talking about expanding choice ,” said Keron Blair, executive director of the Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools, at a bill introduction event Thursday. “We are here, parents and students, educators and lawmakers to say, it is not choice that we are demanding. We are demanding a deeper and more meaningful investment in our public schools.”
— Several 2020 contenders signed onto the measure, which was introduced by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.). They include: Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). No Republicans have signed on.
— Van Hollen has introduced a version of this legislation every Congress since he was first elected to the House in 2003, before becoming a senator. Last month, he introduced separate bipartisan legislation, S. 866 (116) , with Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) that would require regular increases in IDEA spending, which has also received strong support from advocates.
MOVERS AND SHAKERS — Sara Broadwater , DeVos' deputy press secretary, will start Monday as communications director for Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas).
— Brendan O’Callaghan starts next week as director of public affairs at Sarah Lawrence College. He previously was a senior account executive at the Hatch Agency, a tech-focused PR firm with offices in San Francisco and New York City.

IT'S FRIDAY, APRIL 12! your host has to get his vegetable garden into shape this weekend. Got any suggestions for what I should plant? Or trade tips?
Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi .
Driving the Day EU CLEARS HURDLE FOR U.S. TRADE TALKS BUT KICKOFF STILL FAR AWAY: European nations have agreed in principle to negotiating directives for a trade deal between the European Union and U.S., but it’s still unclear if the talks will get off the ground as the two sides remain deadlocked over the scope of any agreement. The U.S. wants to use the deal to crack open the EU’s agriculture market, which is something Brussels said has never been on the table.
Thursday’s action at least clears a procedural hurdle in the EU, where internal debate had kept the 28-nation bloc from agreeing on how to direct the European Commission, which negotiates on behalf of member states, to proceed with the talks. France had raised objections until the last moment, fearing the talks could revive a politically toxic trade debate ahead of next month’s European Parliament election.
""We may be ready to launch negotiations, but it's difficult to see how we can find a common ground,"" said Bernd Lange, chairman of the European Parliament’s trade committee. POLITICO Europe’s Hans von der Burchard has more here .
A ‘brutal’ trading partner: U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland warned on Thursday that the U.S. will aggressively combat what it views as unfair trade barriers leveled against U.S. companies. ""I think if we woke up five years from now, the level of non-tariff barriers and the deficit will be so insurmountable,"" Sondland said at a POLITICO Europe event in Brussels. ""It would be so difficult for U.S. companies to compete in Europe.""
His comments come just hours after President Donald Trump tweeted that the EU is ""a brutal trading partner with the United States, which will change.”
TRUMP TAPS NIKAKHTAR FOR COMMERCE UNDERSECRETARY SLOT: Trump has nominated Nikakhtar, who is currently assistant secretary of Commerce for industry and analysis, to be undersecretary of Commerce for industry and security. As the head of the Bureau of Industry and Security, Nikakhtar will be on the front lines of the administration’s fight against China and play a key role in developing new regulations to tighten exports of critical and emerging U.S. technology.
She would replace Mira Ricardel, who went to the White House last year to work as a deputy national security adviser and lost that job after clashing with first lady Melania Trump. Nikakhtar previously worked as a trade attorney at Cassidy Levy Kent. Prior to that she worked in the enforcement and compliance unit of the International Trade Administration’s China/non-market economy office. She also served a stint at BIS as an industry analyst.
China hard-liner: One private-sector source said Nikakhtar has been described as almost “Navarro-like” in her views toward China — a reference to extreme China hard-liner and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro. Nikakhtar has even suggested dismantling Commerce’s trade promotion programs in China over fears that it was only feeding the theft of U.S. technology, the source said.
A separate private-sector source said Nikakhtar warned U.S. aerospace executives at last summer’s Farnborough Air Show, a major annual industry event in the United Kingdom, to begin disentangling supply chains from the world’s fastest-growing aviation market.
MEXICAN ENVOY: BORDER DELAYS HURT AUTO INDUSTRY: The North American auto industry relies on companies being able to quickly transport parts across the border, Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Martha Bárcena said Thursday. Frustration has been building in recent days over long delays at the U.S.-Mexico border due to ’s decision to reassign 750 U.S. customs personnel who inspect commercial goods to help Border Patrol on immigration duties.
“The automotive sector in North America is highly efficient and integrated. One piece of a car can cross the borders up to 7 times … before the car is finally assembled. We need secure, fast, and working borders to increase competitiveness,” Bárcena said in a tweet.
Bárcena added in a Spanish tweet that “any delay in the delivery of parts affects the entire supply chain.”
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Wednesday that Mexican officials would speak with Department of Homeland Security leaders to work through the issue. Ebrard said the slowdown at the border is a “very bad idea,” adding it’s costly for both U.S. and Mexican industries.
WTO MEMBERS WANT RESOLUTION TO U.K.-EU QUOTA ISSUE: The U.S. and other World Trade Organization members want the United Kingdom and European Union to use a Brexit extension to figure out lingering issues related to how the U.K. would access tariff-rate quotas on sensitive EU imports such as beef and dairy products.
The U.S., Brazil, India, China, Mexico, Russia and other countries on Thursday once again raised concerns at the WTO Goods Council about the way the U.K. and EU plan to split their combined import ceilings. Countries argue that the proposed split would effectively decrease volumes of their exports.
The U.S. said it ""will not accept an EU-U.K. approach to TRQs that is prejudicial to our existing rights. … The current approach to Brexit TRQ negotiations is unacceptable and we are eager to engage [with the EU] to ensure our rights are maintained,"" according to a Geneva-based trade official.

AZEVÊDO: SOLVING APPELLATE BODY ISSUE IS ‘ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL’: Current international trade tensions are at least part of the reason why the WTO’s dispute settlement body is busier than at any point in the past two decades — meaning the stakes for resolving the current impasse over its appellate body are that much higher, the head of the global trading body said Thursday.
During a visit to Washington, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo called the dispute settlement system a “fundamental pillar” of the organization that helps “depoliticize issues by focusing on the technical elements,” which in turn “helps to dissipate tensions.”
The U.S. has for years been blocking the appointment of new judges to the Appellate Body over concerns that the panel has overreached its mandate and infringed on national sovereignty. If the U.S. doesn’t back down, the panel will not have enough members to hear cases by the end of the year.
“Finding an urgent resolution in this area is absolutely critical for the system,” he said during a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
CUELLAR TO TAKE DELEGATION ON USMCA TRIP TO MEXICO: Cuellar is organizing a trip to Mexico for House Democrats to learn more about the new trade pact and Mexico’s labor commitments in the deal. The Texan, who plans to support USMCA, told Morning Trade he’s pushing to make the trip happen during the two-week recess that just began.
The trip is an opportunity for lawmakers to discuss the necessary Mexican labor reforms required under USMCA with Mexican officials, he added.
Cuellar said he’s trying “to get at least one other member that’s more neutral,” given his very pro-trade attitude. He added he has discussed it with House leadership and they’re “receptive to the trip.”
PORK INDUSTRY SEEKS QUICK START TO U.S.-JAPAN TALKS: The pork industry is eager for U.S. trade talks with Japan to kick off — it plans to lobby the administration to move quickly to strike a favorable agreement, citing U.S. pork producers’ shrinking market share in Japan as a reason for urgency.
""The U.S. pork industry cannot get a free trade agreement with Japan implemented fast enough,"" Nick Giordano, vice president and counsel for the National Pork Producers Council, said at a media roundtable Thursday. He explained that the CPTPP has edged out U.S. producers that are already suffering from retaliatory tariffs.
""The fact that we're on three retaliation lists — and I'm not sure there's an industry in the country that's on three retaliation lists — is an immediate hair on fire issue,"" he said. ""But what a lot of people don't know is what we have at stake in Japan, which is our biggest value market and the math says you've got a big problem.""
