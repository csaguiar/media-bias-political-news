Mick Mulvaney Vows Democrats Will 'Never' See Trump's Tax Returns,crooksandliars.com,Heather,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/04/mick-mulvaney-vows-democrats-will-never,"
So much for pretending he was ever going to release them if not for that non-existent audit Trump keeps telling everyone he's under. Here's Trump's acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney on this weekend's Fox News Sunday , attacking Democrats for requesting that the IRS release Trump's tax returns to the House Ways and Means Committee :
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told ""Fox News Sunday"" in an exclusive interview that Democrats will ""never"" see President Trump's tax returns, days after a House Democrat committee chairman made the unprecedented demand that the IRS provide the documents.
Mulvaney's comments marked an apparent escalation in the White House's rhetoric on the issue. On Wednesday, Trump responded with a dismissive taunt to Democrats' renewed push for his tax information, but suggested he might be willing to provide the information pending the conclusion of an audit.
""Oh no, never -- nor should they,"" Mulvaney told Bill Hemmer, who is filling in for host Chris Wallace, when asked if Democrats will ever see the president's tax returns. ""That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway.""
Mulvaney added that Democrats ""know"" they won't get the returns, and ""just want attention on the issue because they don’t want to talk to us about policy."" A ""fundamental"" purpose of tax law, Mulvaney continued, is to protect the privacy of tax filers.
""If they don't get what they want in the Mueller report, they're going to ask for the taxes,"" Mulvaney said. ""If they don't get what they want in the taxes, they're going to ask for something else. It doesn't surprise anybody.""
The statute under which Ways and Means Chairman Neal requested the documents was written specifically after the Tea Pot Dome Scandal of the 1920s , to give congress the means to make sure that the Executive Branch was not using their offices for corrupt purposes. The ability to get tax returns from the IRS does not have a lot of ""wiggle room,"" according to most legal scholars . ↓ Story continues below ↓
If Trump has nothing to hide, he should be happy to release them, just like the Mueller report. You know Fox is never going to ask any of them that question, but it's long past time the rest of the media started. What is he hiding that he doesn't want the voters to know about? Tags:"

World view – Monday,yournz.org,Pete George,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://yournz.org/2019/04/08/world-view-monday-41/,"/ April 8, 2019
The Otago Daily Times makes a half-hearted and mealy mouthed attempt to say what the heck, they’re an Islamic country. Who are we to criticise if they choose to be barbaric because Islamic law provides for it.
I’ve googled for any criticism or comment by the Islamic Communities here that this is not Islam, but so far found nothing. It’s possibly just that it’s not the right time for them to comment, and it’s certainly as far as the msm and some supporters here are concerned the worst possible time for us to criticise.
But there’s no shortage of criticism of the Catholic Church- sometimes as a whole- for its recent exploding history of historic sexual offending by a few priests, and of the cover ups by the hierarchy. And for its past excesses and cruelties, that were never sanctioned by their prophet and teacher, Jesus.
“We accept, or at least endeavour to, religions which differ from our own beliefs. And we accept different countries hold those religious beliefs as central to their identities and their laws.
How, then, should we react when countries pass laws as far from our own ideals as Brunei’s form of sharia?
How do we, on the one hand, try to understand a religion central to the lives of many New Zealanders – and one so horrifically targeted by hate so recently – while on the other protest a nation’s adherence to an extreme, but not uncommon, version of that same religion?
What Brunei is doing is, to most of us, wrong. Protesting, either publicly or privately is, in such cases, both right and our right. But we should endeavour to accept such things are complicated. Brunei’s sharia is not the country’s defining feature, nor does it define our relationship with Brunei, nor does sharia define Islam.

April 7, 2019
Donald Trump WILL fight to keep the Congress and the American public from seeing what tells the government he makes….
Thus being the first President in modern history to do so….
One wonders what is in the forms he seems to be hiding?
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that Democrats will “never” see President Trump ‘s tax returns. “Nor should they. That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway,” Mulvaney said during an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” He added that Democrats “know they’re not going to” get the tax returns. “They just want attention on the issue because they don’t want to talk to us about policy,” he said. Last week, House Democrats formally requested Trump’s tax returns , with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) asking IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to turn over six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns. One of Trump’s personal lawyers later urged the IRS not to release the tax returns, arguing that Democrats can’t legally request them. Neal made the request under a provision of the federal tax code that states the Treasury secretary “shall furnish” tax returns upon request from the chairmen of Congress’s tax committees, provided that the documents associated with a particular taxpayer are viewed in a closed session. Trump has said repeatedly that he won’t release his returns because he is under audit. The IRS says it does not prevent individuals from releasing their personal returns. Mulvaney added Sunday that Democrats “know what the law is.”…."

That voting block is primarily Democratic leaning….
They tend to support Israel regardless…..
But with Israeli PM Netanyahu about to get indicted for the some of the things Donald Trump has been accused of?
The Republican effort to spend millions for the Jewish votes maybe wasted….
Republicans are planning a multimillion-dollar offensive aimed at fracturing the Democratic Party’s decades-long stranglehold on the Jewish vote.
Spearheading the push is the Republican Jewish Coalition, which receives substantial funding from casino mogul and GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. On Friday morning, the group’s board members — many of them prominent Republican Party donors — gathered in a conference room at Adelson’s Venetian resort, where they were briefed on plans for a $10 million-plus blitz geared toward attracting Jewish support for President Donald Trump. The investment, people familiar with the early discussions say, will far surpass what the group has spent in past presidential elections.
With Democrats embroiled in a wrenching internal debate over anti-Semitism and support for Israel, Republicans are moving to capitalize with an aggressive campaign painting Trump — who himself has at times faced accusations of stoking anti-Semitism — as a fierce and unapologetic defender of the Jewish state.
“We’re at the intersection of a very unique moment in time where we have the most pro-Israel president ever in history in Donald Trump, and we also at the same time have the Democratic Party— because of the pressure of the progressive left— moving away from the traditional support for Israel that has existed going back to 1948,” said Matt Brooks, who has served as RJC executive director for nearly three decades.
“This strain within the Democratic Party is making those centrist and center-left Jews who care about these issues feel more and more uncomfortable, and with the strength of Donald Trump and the Republican Party on these issues we believe that we’ll be able to bring those folks over to the Republican side,” Brooks added.
At a time when Trump’s approval rating remains mired in the low-to-mid 40s, the offensive shows how Republicans are taking steps to contest any votes they can. Jews only account for about 2 percent of the U.S. population and have overwhelmingly supported Democrats in past elections. But GOP officials believe that siphoning off even a small portion the Jewish vote in a few battleground states could be critical in 2020.
“The Jewish vote will remain and largely loyal Democratic vote because of domestic issues largely, but if there was ever a cycle where Republicans could make inroads it is this cycle,” said Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush White House press secretary who now serves as an RJC board member…."

It will involve finding a middle ground for Democratic candidates running for Congress inn places where Trump squeezed out wins… .
The party will NOT be just one thing….
And Joe Biden is probably right…..
The country as a whole….
Is closer to the middle than the right or even the left….
Joe Biden HAS had some of those voters on his side during his eight years as President Obama’s Vice President….They switched 2 years ago….Biden could bring them back for him and down ballot races?
“The white male vote is indispensable, it’s a part of any winning coalition,” said Democratic pollster Ronald Lester, who worked for Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016. He noted that successful national Democrats perform well with white men, and that includes Barack Obama, whose strength among white men in the Rust Belt helped fuel his White House victories in 2008 and 2012.
Several candidates have jumped in with their own suggestions of how to do that.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn’t said whether he is running, spoke to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in an appearance Friday that seemed designed to show how he could win back white working-class voters. Biden said some of his “sophisticated friends” don’t understand the need to treat laborers with respect.
“How the hell do we get to the place where a lot of you think the rest of the country doesn’t see you, or know you?” Biden asked the mostly male crowd.
When Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, announced his campaign earlier in the week, he said his more centrist approach could appeal to working-class voters like those in his district, which embodies the Rust Belt terrain that Trump won.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said her no-frills style has delivered white Midwestern voters before, while former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, uses his star appeal that helped him in Texas’ well-educated suburbs. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has said his economic populism will bring rural white voters back to the Democratic fold.
Polling makes clear why Democratic are searching for the right messenger.
White men make up typically make up about one-third of the electorate. In 2018, 41 percent of them voted for Democrats, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the national electorate. While Democrats’ strength among women won headlines and was often credited with Democrats’ strong showing, white men also moved to the Democrats column. VoteCast showed Democrats won the votes of 46% of white male college graduates, a figure that has given some in the party hope.
“The revolt in these suburban districts wasn’t just about white women, it was also about white men,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster advising the campaign of former Gov. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo. “Just as there’s been a movement of white, college-educated women, there’s been a movement of white college-educated men.”
That shift is part of a long-term trend.
According to the American National Election Survey, white men without college degrees have consistently supported the GOP over the past two decades, while those with degrees — roughly one-fifth of the 2018 electorate — have increasingly moved toward Democrats. In 1996, when President Bill Clinton overwhelmingly won re-election, he only received 36% of the votes of white male college graduates, according to ANES. Hillary Clinton lost her race in 2016 but won 43% of them.
Strategists generally find that college-educated white men are more moved by social issues and Trump’s violations of political norms, while those without degrees are more concerned about economic issues and like candidates who may shake up the establishment. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have gained ground among both groups since Trump’s election, but some see the college-educated cohort as the most promising…."

Surging gold prices dent jewelers business,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/surging-gold-prices-dent-jewelers-business-588383.html,"Surging Gold Prices Dent Jewelers Business Mohammad Ali (@ChaudhryMAli88) 9 hours ago Sun 07th April 2019 | 09:15 PM
ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Surging gold price , especially during the months of March and April , haunted the buyers and badly affecting the gold business during the peak wedding season.
According to the gold dealers, the significant reason attributed to the historical surge was the rupee-dollar exchange rate, which had an important role to play in gold rates.
Talking to APP, Muhammad Nafees, a gold trader in Rawalpindi , said the price of gold after touching the peak of Rs 70,500 had badly affected the jewelery business and even made it difficult for the traders to manage day to day expenses.
He said normally a wedding season was considered as a peak business season for the jewelers but increased prices of the gold had reduced the purchasing capacity of the people belonging to middle class and dented the demand of gold in the country.
While demanding the government to take measures to control the Dollar price , he said gold was mostly imported and hence if the rupee weakened against the dollar , the gold prices would likely appreciate in rupee terms.
Muhammad Anees, another jeweler, said traditionally a surge in the jewelry demand was witnessed during the festive and wedding seasons, but now majority of the people were more inclined towards buying artificial jewelry .
He was of the view that the people normally invested in gold as an asset but the surge in its prices was now keeping them at bay from buying the gold . Even those people who had some stock of gold in the shape of ornaments at homes, were selling it to get maximum benefit, he added.
Rabia Noreen, whose wedding was fixed in the month of April , said her parents had been planning to buy gold for the last many moths, but the continuous increase in its price had shattered their plans. Now they had opted to buy gold platted jewelry , which was not that much costly, she added.
