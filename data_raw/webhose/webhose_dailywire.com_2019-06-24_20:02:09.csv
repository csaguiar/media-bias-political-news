"The DOJ Accuses Kellyanne Conway Of Violating Hatch Act, Claims She Should Be Removed From White House",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48390/doj-accuses-kellyanne-conway-violating-hatch-act-emily-zanotti,"DailyWire.com The DOJ Accuses Kellyanne Conway Of Violating Hatch Act, Claims She Should Be Removed From White House Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 13, 2019 views
The Department of Justice's Office of the Special Counsel issued a blistering memo Thursday accusing White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway of being a ""repeat offender"" of the Hatch Act and suggesting she should be removed from the president's staff immediately. U.S. Office of Special Counsel finds Kellyanne Conway repeatedly violated the Hatch Act: ""Given that Ms. Conway is a repeat offender and has shown disregard for the law, OSC recommends that she be removed from federal service.” https://t.co/97JW3IKhMW pic.twitter.com/yF4a6t6c9Y — Dan Linden (@DanLinden) June 13, 2019
The Office of the Special Counsel, which has no relation to Special Counsel Robert Mueller (who has since left his job, anyway), issued the report Thursday morning as part of an ongoing, non-partisan watchdog investigation into members of the Executive Branch. In it, the OSC cites several instances where Kellyanne Conway appeared to go out of her way to engage in ""politicking"" — that is, engaging in political activity or endorsing a political candidate, in violation of the Hatch Act of 1939.
Most notably, the report says, Conway made comments in favor of the then-Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, Roy Moore, and against Moore's opponent, Doug Jones, who went on to win the race.
""Doug Jones in Alabama, folks don’t be fooled,"" Conway reportedly said in one of her interviews on Fox News. ""He’ll be a vote against tax cuts. He’s weak on crime, weak on borders. He’s strong on raising your taxes. He’s terrible for property owners. And Doug Jones is a doctrinaire liberal, which is why he’s not saying anything and why the media are trying to boost him.""
The OSC also, ABC News reports , cited instances where Conway spoke out about former Vice President Joe Biden and socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
""Ms. Conway's disregard for the restrictions the Hatch Act places on executive branch employees is unacceptable,"" the report reads. ""If Ms. Conway were any other federal employee, her multiple violations of the law would almost certainly result in removal from her position by the Merit Systems Protection Board.""
""As a highly visible member of the administration, Ms. Conway's violations, if left unpunished, send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act's restrictions. Her actions erode the principal foundation of our democratic system - the rule of law,"" it continues.
Conway has been officially reprimanded but not severely punished for these kinds of statements before, so it's probably unlikely that she'll be severely punished — or booted from the White House — for these kinds of statements now. In response to the report, the White House called the entire OSC investigation ""deeply flawed.""
“The Office of Special Counsel’s (OSC) unprecedented actions against Kellyanne Conway are deeply flawed and violate her constitutional rights to free speech and due process,"" a spokesperson for the White House told reporters in a statement. ""Others, of all political views, have objected to the OSC’s unclear and unevenly applied rules which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees. Its decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations – and perhaps OSC should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, non-political manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act.""
The Hatch Act was developed and passed in 1939, but has been relatively unchallenged since the late 1970s, when the Supreme Court ruled that it did not violate the First Amendment rights of Executive Branch officials and others to bar them from openly politicking during their tenure. Although it does not appear Conway is about to suffer any consequences of her statements, if she did, she could challenge that ruling again, now decades later. "
'Chernobyl' Producers: Please Stop Taking Half-Naked Instagram Selfies At Disaster Site,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48389/chernobyl-producers-please-stop-taking-half-naked-emily-zanotti,"June 13, 2019 views
The writers of HBO's hit miniseries, ""Chernobyl,"" are asking people to please stop taking half-naked, raunchy selfies at the actual Chernobyl site, in an effort to gain popularity on social media sites like Instagram.
Insider magazine reports that Instagram influencers have been flooding the Chernobyl nuclear site since the documentary premiered several weeks ago, seeking to capitalize on the popularity of the HBO series to boost their own brand profiles. As a result, Instagram is now peppered with photos of half-naked women and perfectly posed models, posing in front of burned out busses and melted buildings.
In one particularly egregious case, a female Instagram ""influencer"" even did a ""nuclear striptease"" for the camera at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine, unzipping a white cloth biohazard suit in front of an abandoned and burned out building to reveal a pair of skimpy thong underwear beneath. — Reel Review (@reelreviewnet) June 12, 2019
The problem began with the documentary itself, which spurred a wave of ""disaster tourism"" at the Chernobyl site in the Ukraine. Visits to the Chernobyl site — most of which is now available for tours, only decades after the nuclear reactor there melted down, destroying everything in its path — have spiked out of interest, with people flocking to the disaster zone to get a sense of the true story.
But, Insider reports, regular tourism is often accompanied, now, by Instagram tourism, and many of those visiting the Chernobyl site are anxious to get just the right 'gram to get them attention on social media.
As a result, producers and writers for the show have issued a warning to potential Chernobyl tourists: please be respectful.
""It's wonderful that #ChernobylHBO has inspired a wave of tourism to the Zone of Exclusion. But yes, I've seen the photos going around,"" producer Craig Mazin said in a statement on social media. ""If you visit, please remember that a terrible tragedy occurred there. Comport yourselves with respect for all who suffered and sacrificed.""
Chernobyl is, of course, the site of the famous nuclear meltdown in 1986 that took more than 30 lives immediately and countless more in the aftermath. More than 8 million people in Belarus, the Ukraine, and Russia were exposed to high levels of radiation as a result of the blast.
Most of the site is still considered radioactive, but a large portion of Chernobyl and the town of Pripyat are open to visitors. The World Nuclear Association declared the area ""safe"" in 2011, allowing those curious about the history to visit key sites, take tours, and snap photos. Pictures of Chernobyl's long-abandoned amusement park — complete with ghostly Ferris wheel — are the most popular.
But there's still danger for selfie-takers like the ""nuclear striptease."" Those who visit Chernobyl are required to don either a ""clean suit"" or to wear long sleeves, long pants, and shoes to cover any exposed skin, just in case of contamination. Visitors are also warned not to touch any buildings or items, and to stay away from Chernobyl's local flora and fauna out of an abundance of caution, since not all lingering effects are yet quantified.
Removing your clothes, for example, is a big no-no."
HAMMER: Christianity And The GOP Are Both On Trial In Iowa. Here’s What You Need To Know.,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48399/hammer-christianity-and-gop-are-both-trial-iowa-josh-hammer,"June 13, 2019 views
Terry Branstad, the mustachioed former Republican governor of Iowa and present U.S. ambassador to China, is now on trial in state court back in the Hawkeye State. Branstad, you see, had the temerity to request the resignation, in 2011, of a leftist mandarin named Chris Godfrey, who served as commissioner of the Iowa Division of Workers' Compensation. Godfrey was, reliable sources tell me, unanimously despised by the Iowa Association of Business and Industry (Iowa's closest equivalent to a statewide chamber of commerce) due to his deeply held hostility to business interests. After Godfrey — who had been both initially appointed and reappointed by Democratic governors — refused to resign upon Branstad's request, Branstad slashed his pay by 35%.
All standard fare for a newly elected Republican governor looking to re-shape the direction of his state's anti-business governance, right?
Well. As it turns out, Chris Godfrey is an open homosexual. So Godfrey now claims, in a lawsuit that went to trial in state court in Iowa last week , that his sexual orientation is the reason that Branstad ""retaliated"" against him.
Godfrey offers zero direct evidence that anti-homosexual animus had anything whatsoever to do with the fact that a newly elected Republican governor of Iowa, upon taking office, sought to rework his administration to cleanse it of anti-business bureaucrats who were holdovers of previous Democratic administrations. Even more interesting, Roxanne Conlin, who is Godfrey's attorney, seems to have a personal vendetta of sorts against Branstad — she ran against him in a decades-old gubernatorial race, as a Democrat, and lost.
And yet the facts actually get even more bizarre. The trial court judge assigned to the case made some utterly insane bizarre recent rulings as to what types of purely circumstantial evidence to allow at trial. You see, the trial judge here seems hell-bent on ensuring Godfrey has every possible means available to ""prove"" anti-homosexual retaliatory animus on the part of Branstad, his chief of staff, and his legal advisor. Here is how a local Iowa blogger summarizes the evidentiary proceedings thus far (I have also directly reviewed Branstad's petition for certiorari to the Iowa Supreme Court, for corroboration):
The trial started last week with District Court Judge Brad McCall, a Culver appointee and former plaintiff’s attorney, presiding. McCall, who is a district court judge in Jasper County (Judicial District 5A), was assigned the trail despite its location in Polk County (Judicial District 5C).
Branstad’s attorneys, Katie Graham and David Bower, petitioned the Iowa Supreme Court to place a stay on the trial until the resolution of a dispute over evidence McCall allowed.
According to the petition, McCall ruled that the following “circumstantial evidence” is admissible at trial: Evidence of candidate/Governor Branstad’s public policy positions on Varnum v. Brien, same-sex marriage, and the constitutional amendment process in Iowa; Evidence of Governor Branstad, Boeyink, and Findley’s affiliation with the ""anti-gay"" Republican Party of Iowa; The private, religious beliefs of individual members of the Iowa Association of Business and Industry (ABI"") regarding whether homosexuality is sinful; and Opinion testimony that the Republican Party of Iowa is ""anti-gay"" from elected officials who had no involvement in Governor Branstad’s decisions.
Let's translate this into non-legalese. The trial court is permitting evidence to be entered with respect to Branstad's personal thoughts on Varnum v. Brien , the outrageously activist Iowa Supreme Court decision wherein the Court held the state's traditional marriage definition to be incompatible with the Iowa Constitution, as well as his personal policy views on what the state's definition of marriage ought to be. The trial court is furthermore permitting evidence with respect to a mere affiliation with the Republican Party of Iowa allegedly being ""anti-gay"" due to the fact that the state's GOP affirms the conjugal, one-man/one-woman definition of marriage to which disparate religions, ethnicities, and cultures from all around the globe had all adhered for millennia, in uninterrupted and unquestioned fashion, prior to the revisionist fad to redefine marriage as an institution oriented toward adult romance and not toward the rearing of children. Even worse , the trial court is permitting evidence with respect to whether the (presumptively Christian) individual members of the Iowa Association of Business at issue have the audacity to actually believe what the Bible says about homosexual conduct!
In a word, Christianity is on trial here in Iowa. Indeed, the very notion of whether it is ""anti-gay"" to believe in the once-universal conjugal definition of marriage is also on trial.
This ought to be deeply, deeply harrowing for anyone who supports religious liberty. ""[Judge] McCall’s rulings have put Iowa's freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of association at risk,"" concluded the local Iowa blogger, Shane Vander Hart. ""By not stopping it, the Iowa Supreme Court just gave its tacit approval.""
The Iowa judiciary, in direct opposition to the Midwestern Christian sensibilities of the Iowa people, is disproportionately leftist. Nonetheless, God-willing, the judiciary will come to its senses and exculpate Branstad and his former legal advisor and chief of staff. But the fact that this case is even being tried — and that this outrageous circumstantial ""evidence"" is even being admitted into court — ought to be deeply depressing for patriotic Americans of all political and religious stripes."
"Graham: Trump Was Wrong To Say He'd Take Intel From Foreign Agent, And Hillary Was Wrong To Actually Do It",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48398/graham-trump-was-wrong-say-hed-take-intel-foreign-james-barrett,"June 13, 2019 views
On Wednesday, President Trump made a comment that ended up earning him rebukes from both sides of the aisle. In an Oval Office interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, Trump said that he wouldn't necessarily contact the FBI if he received incriminating intel on a political opponent from a foreign agent. ""It's not an interference,"" Trump said . ""They have information. I think I'd take it. If I thought there was something wrong, I'd go maybe to the FBI, if I thought there was something wrong. I think I'd want to hear it ... I think you might want to listen, there isn't anything wrong with listening."" That kind of thing, he suggested, is what happens in ""opposition research.""
One of those on the right going on record in unequivocal disagreement with Trump is Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). But while Graham took a moment to push back on Trump's statement, which he called a ""mistake,"" he also took the opportunity to expose what he suggested was Democratic hypocrisy on the issue.
In his reponse to reporters about the controversy Thursday, Graham emphasized that ""no party should be hiring foreign agents to look at their opponents."" But, as Ed Morrissey points out, Graham made sure not to leave his comment there. Instead, he took the chance to remind Democrats about what ""actually"" happened in 2016.
""I'm hoping that some of my Democratic colleagues will take more seriously that Christopher Steele was a foreign agent paid for by the Democratic Party to gather dirt on Trump — a document unverified used to get a warrant,"" said Graham. ""That's why I'm so upset about that. Foreign influence in our elections is growing not lessening, and we don't want to send a signal encouraging it. So that's why I think looking at the FISA process regarding the Steele dossier is important.""
The FBI's handling of the dossier produced by Steele and funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign, particularly its role in obtaining a FISA warrant on a Trump associate, is currently under multiple investigations.
""I think it's a mistake. I think it's a mistake of law, and I don't want to send a signal to encourage this,"" Graham said. ""And I hope that my Democrat colleagues will be equally offended by the fact that this actually did happen in 2016, where a foreign agent was paid for by a political party to gather research. All those things are wrong.""
Graham also faulted Donald Trump Jr. for sitting down with a person during the 2016 campaign that claimed to have intelligence from Russian sources, which turned out to be false, but then again returned to the fact that the Democrats and Hillary Clinton did actually fund opposition research from a foreign agent that helped spark the ""collusion"" narrative.
WATCH: Sen. Lindsey Graham says ""it's a mistake"" for President Trump to say he would be willing to accept dirt on political rivals from foreign governments. ""I don't want to send a signal to encourage this."" https://t.co/n1mQaFaD98 pic.twitter.com/qDvDrcCjcq"
British Law Enforcement Hands Out Dull Knives To Abuse Victims To Prevent Violence,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48397/british-law-enforcement-hands-out-dull-knives-emily-zanotti,"British Law Enforcement Hands Out Dull Knives To Abuse Victims To Prevent Violence Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Images June 13, 2019 views
British authorities are pioneering a ""violence prevention"" program that involves swapping out sharp knives for dull knives in order to prevent domestic violence and abuse-related stabbings.
Victims who have been threatened at knife-point will receive a special gift of ""no point knives"" to keep in their home from Nottinghamshire Police, who say the pilot anti-knife program is designed cut down on knife-related violence, according to the Independent .
“We do see a fair amount of knife-related incidents in domestic abuse, not just on the streets,"" a Nottinghamshire Police supervisor told reporters about the pilot program. “This is a measure we need to take. We want to reduce that risk. It is a trial. We have about 100 of them – and we have so far given out about 50. The knife is blunt at the end – but still functions as a knife – so you can’t stab someone.""
The police say the effort is designed to help people who stay in abusive situations avoid becoming victims of violence: “People will stay in a relationship after some serious episodes of domestic abuse. They may stay together for children, get back together, or might get back together when they are out of prison.”
There's one major flaw in Nottinghamshire's logic, though: by removing knives from any home where domestic violence has occurred, they're not just removing potential weapons, but a method of protection. Fortunately, the program is by agreement only, and domestic violence victims can select whether they'll turn in their sharp knives for dull ones.
Victims rights organizations didn't mince words when commenting on the planned program. The founder of London-based Victim Focus, which advocates for domestic violence victims, called the brains behind the operation, ""morons,"" according to Sky News .
""I feel like we are getting dumber and dumber around domestic violence,"" she said on Twitter. ""So you gonna leave her in the situation but nip round to provide the offender with some blunt knives?...IN DV [domestic violence], ANYTHING IS A WEAPON, YOU MORONS.""
She also suggested that if a victim is at a high enough visible risk that police feel obligated to replace her cooking utensils, law enforcement may want to consider counseling the victim into a more suitable solution, arrest the offender, or refer the victim to a group designed to help manage violent and abusive situations.
The police, though, seem more concerned with ending what they believe is a ""wave"" of knife violence — a wave that is taking over the United Kingdom, where guns and other weapons are banned. Nottinghamshire, for example, had more than 900 incidents of knife-related violence just last year, 150 of which were related to domestic abuse cases. Across Britain, the numbers are similar. Knife crime is on the rise.
Nottinghamshire is hardly the only agency to try dulling citizens' knives in the name of safety. Last year, a judge in the U.K. called for all knives over 8 inches to be blunted, the Independent reports , arguing that no one outside of professional chefs and butchers truly need large, sharp knives unless they're planning to harm another person.
""I would urge all those with any role in relation to knives – manufacturers, shops, the police, local authorities, the government – to consider preventing the sale of long pointed knives, except in rare, defined, circumstances, and replacing such knives with rounded ends,"" the judge said in a ruling. “It might even be that the police could organise a programme whereby the owners of kitchen knives, which have been properly and lawfully bought for culinary purposes, could be taken somewhere to be modified, with the points being ground down into rounded ends.”
Law enforcement seems to be taking these steps because they're at a loss over what else to do. In London, especially, knife crime is out of control. According to a report issued by the conservative party late last month, since London Mayor Sadiq Khan took office, knife crime has risen in the city more than 50%. The murder rate in London, the report says, has now overtaken that of New York City for the first time in nearly two centuries, even though most weapons — including all kinds of guns — are prohibited."
BIG TECH CRACKDOWN: YouTube DELETES Project Veritas Video On Pinterest Censorship,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48387/big-tech-crackdown-youtube-deletes-project-veritas-james-barrett,"June 13, 2019 views
In a chilling move that suggests Big Tech is coordinating to censor conservative voices, YouTube deleted a video produced by Project Veritas exposing alleged censorship of conservative and Christian content by Pinterest. Along with YouTube's removal of the video, Pinterest put the whistleblower who provided the documents featured in the report on administrative leave and permanently banned pro-life group Live Action, which was listed on its ""porn domain block list,"" as shown in the video. Twitter also appears to have joined with the other platforms in targeting Project Veritas, hitting founder James O'Keefe for supposedly violating someone's personal privacy through his journalistic investigation and blocking content involving Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro.
As The Daily Wire reported, Project Veritas released an exposé video on Pinterest featuring testimony from an employee of the company and internal documents he presented to O'Keefe indicating that the popular social media platform was quietly censoring some conservative content and voices. Among those that appear to have been targeted by the platform is Shapiro, who was censored in a ""zero tolerance moment,"" Live Action, links to which were blocked on the platform, and a video series exposing Planned Parenthood, which was included in a censor list as a ""harmful"" ""conspiracy.""
Since the release of the report, Pinterest has placed the whistleblower, Eric Cochran, on administrative leave and permanently suspended Live Action's account.
But it's not only Pinterest who is cracking down on those involved in the exposé; on Wednesday, YouTube deleted Project Veritas' video report, citing ""privacy"" violations and informing the organization that it could not show the name of the employee at Pinterest who placed Live Action on the block list or the documentation of that action.

In a statement to The Daily Wire, Project Veritas said that while YouTube outlines the content supposedly in violation in the video, the platform ""does not give us any recourse by which to make the requested 'blur' since they've taken down the video."" Doing so would be ""anathema to presenting information the public has a right to know,"" the organization argues.
""The established media and technology are so afraid of investigative journalism they need to censor it,"" O'Keefe tweeted Wednesday. ""YouTube calls REPORTING on someone by showing their face and name, and how they added a pro-life group to a porn blacklist, a 'privacy complaint.' Would they do this to NYT?"" The established media and technology are so afraid of investigative journalism they need to censor it.

As reported by Town Hall , Twitter has also hit O'Keefe for the Pinterest exposé, specifically evidence that Shapiro was targeted by the platform, which was censored for exposing ""other people’s private information,"" according to a Twitter insider.
""Twitter has decided that investigative journalism is in violation of their terms of service - @Project_Veritas has been temporarily suspended from posting for tweeting internal communications from @Pinterest which show them calling @benshapiro a 'white supremacist,'"" O'Keefe tweeted Thursday. ""What does this mean for journalists around the world? For their sources in government, tech, education, etc? Is Twitter your newspaper's editor?"" What does this mean for journalists around the world? For their sources in government, tech, education, etc? Is Twitter your newspaper's editor? — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) June 12, 2019
In an interview with The Daily Wire Thursday, O'Keefe called the situation a ""watershed moment"" for both free speech and Big Tech. ""I think that this is a watershed moment in the history of the First Amendment and Big Tech,"" he said. ""What we have seen here is one brave individual come forward, risking everything, in order to combat the collusion that we're witnessing among these powerful companies. What Eric wants is for twelve more people in the industry who are likewise concerned about free speech and transparency to come forward. If they do, we will see real change.""
Pinterest has responded to some of the allegations presented in the YouTube-blocked video: ""Religious content is allowed on Pinterest, and many people use our service to search for and save Pins inspired by their beliefs,"" the company said in a statement to Project Veritas . ""To protect our users from being targeted based on personal characteristics such as their religion, we have policies in place so that ads and recommendations don’t appear alongside certain terms."""

GOOD NEWS: New Vaccine Might Prevent Development Of Alzheimer's,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48396/good-news-new-vaccine-might-prevent-development-hank-berrien,"June 13, 2019 views
According to the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Department, researchers at the university have created a vaccine that could prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease.
The department’s newsroom website stated that the vaccine uses virus-like particles (VLPs) to eliminate the tangling of the tau protein, which when accumulated in the brain can interrupt neurons in the brain from communicating. Alzheimer’s, which is expected to strike triple the number of people by 2050, cripples the brain as human beings age, as beta-amyloid proteins in the brain get stuck together and tau proteins start to tangle, both of which inhibit neural connections.
Nicole Maphis, a PhD candidate who was working in the lab of Kiran Bhaskar, PhD, an associate professor in UNM’s Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology, stated, “We’re excited by these findings, because they seem to suggest that we can use the body’s own immune system to make antibodies against these tangles, and that these antibodies actually bind and clear these tau tangles.”
Maphis tested the vaccine in mice and they showed a marked improvement in their capacity to deal with mazes. The UNM Health Department site stated, “MRI scans showed that the vaccinated animals had less brain shrinkage, suggesting that the vaccine prevented neurons from dying. Maphis also found significantly fewer tangles in both the cortex and the hippocampus – areas in the brain that are important for learning and memory, and which are destroyed in Alzheimer’s.”
UNM scientists David Peabody and Bryce Chackerian also aided in the process; they were instrumental in starting to use VLPs to create vaccines targeting dengue virus, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus and amyloid beta protein.
In November 2018, a study published in Alzheimer's Research & Therapy touted a new Alzheimer's vaccine developed by scientists at the University of Texas Southwestern that could conceivably cut the number of dementia cases in half. The research team tested four groups of mice; the vaccinated mice experienced as much as 40% of their beta-amyloid plaques reduced and as much as 50% of their tau tangles diminished. No adverse immune response was observed.
The study stated:
We report, for the first time in an AD mouse model, that active DNA Aβ 42 immunization into the skin targets two pathologies: amyloid-containing plaques and tau. DNA vaccination, in which not the antigen (peptide or protein) but the DNA encoding this peptide is administered, is an alternative route of vaccination. Genes encoded by the DNA are expressed within the skin, and the peptides are taken up by dendritic cells traveling to the regional lymph nodes and presenting the antigen to B and T cells. Immune responses to DNA or peptide immunization differ qualitatively.
We have shown previously that full-length DNA Aβ 42 trimer immunization is noninflammatory and induces a regulatory immune response. DNA Aβ 42 trimer immunization has been shown to be effective in removing amyloid from the brain in immunized double-transgenic mice. In the present study, we used a triple-transgenic AD mouse model that exhibits Aβ and tau pathologies characteristic of human AD. We found that immunotherapy with DNA Aβ 42 trimer leads to reduction of Aβ 40 /Aβ 42 peptides and amyloid plaques, and we show for the first time that DNA Aβ 42 trimer immunization leads also to significant reduction of tau from the mouse brain.

Oakland Decriminalizes Hallucinogenic ‘Magic Mushrooms’ And Peyote,www.dailywire.com,Jeffrey Cawood,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48402/oakland-decriminalizes-hallucinogenic-magic-jeffrey-cawood,"DailyWire.com Oakland Decriminalizes Hallucinogenic ‘Magic Mushrooms’ And Peyote Councilman adds amendments suggesting new users start with small amounts in the presence of a trusted friend. Photo by Andrew Hasson/Getty Images June 13, 2019 views
The Oakland City Council unanimously passed a resolution last week effectively decriminalizing the adult use of hallucinogens derived from plants or fungi, including entheogenic mushrooms and the psychoactive alkaloids found in the peyote cactus.
The lawmakers agreed to prohibit city money from being used “to assist in the enforcement of laws imposing criminal penalties” against individuals who possess, cultivate, or ingest several plant-based mind-altering substances, which are still illegal under federal and state law. The new citywide policy does not apply to synthetic psychedelics, such as LSD and ecstasy.
Opponents say the change will encourage people to partake in potentially harmful activity. However, advocates argue that hallucinogens have creative and therapeutic benefits and could be used to treat addictions and mental disorders.
The measure was introduced by Councilman Noel Gallo who, according to CNN , descends from a Native American family. He reportedly told the network that he was familiar with natural psychedelics as a youth growing up in Oakland.
“These plants have been in use for thousands of years, not only spiritually, but also health-wise,” Gallo explained , referencing Indigenous cultures that used hallucinogens as part of religious rituals. “(My grandmother) was a curandero (healer) in Mexico and she didn’t go to Walgreens to get her medication, they grew it in their backyards, and that is how we healed each other for thousands of years.”
He said “there will be no sales of entheogenic plants and fungi,” adding that the hallucinogens might be shared in collectives in the future.
Councilman Loren Taylor added several amendments to the ordinance offering guidance to users, which included cautioning those who experiment with hallucinatory drugs to begin with small amounts and have a trusted friend present.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, “though there are rarely any arrests in Oakland over the use of psychedelic plants, Gallo said the resolution is a step toward legitimizing use of the plants for medicinal purposes.”
The outlet went on to describe the Oakland initiative as “part of a wave of decriminalization efforts nationwide,” as similar drives are taking place in Oregon, Iowa, and elsewhere in the country. Oakland became the second city in the United States to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms after Denver voters narrowly approved a ballot initiative a month ago. Some advocates refer to the phenomenon as a “psychedelic renaissance.”
More from The Chronicle : The concept of using natural psychedelics for medical reasons has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years, including from mainstream research institutions that for decades had avoided study of hallucinogens after they were roundly maligned in the 1960s and ‘70s… As with cannabis, the first steps are in deprioritizing enforcement of federal laws on psychedelic use. After that, it’s unclear what the path toward legalization will look like for psychedelics, assuming that’s the agreed-upon end goal. Few people want, or expect, psychedelic dispensaries to pop up next door to cannabis shops. What advocates are pushing for now is safe access to drugs that are increasingly seen as potentially “paradigm-shifting” therapies for a host of mental health issues, from post-traumatic stress and depression to end-of-life despair and addiction.
“Things are starting to roll. We’re getting calls from L.A. and other states in the U.S.,” said Carlos Plazola, a co-founder of Decriminalize Nature Oakland (DNO), the group behind the Oakland resolution. “There’s an international movement.”
According to the Los Angeles Times, DNO started discussions in the community in early 2019, holding its first public education event in March.
“If you have a progressive city council, things can change quickly,” Plazola said .

On Thursday, Charlotte Clymer, the press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, issued a tweet that seemed highly problematic, stating, “Not all opinions are equal. Not all opinions are deserving of our time and consideration. Not all opinions should be given space in the public square. If you push a ‘belief’ that is directly harmful to others, you have moved past ‘opinion’ and into a threat to public safety.” Not all opinions are equal.

If you push a “belief” that is directly harmful to others, you have moved past “opinion” and into a threat to public safety. — Charlotte Clymer(@cmclymer) June 13, 2019
That tweet engendered fierce criticism from conservatives; Jason Howerton of the Blaze responded:
“Not all opinions should be given space in the public square."" These people think they are qualified to decide which opinions are ""harmful"" and ""allowed"" to be shared in the public square.

Clymer then patronized, “No, Sweetie, you just want the unchecked freedom to spread hateful nonsense that directly harms others, and that bullshit does not belong in the public square. Period.” No, Sweetie, you just want the unchecked freedom to spread hateful nonsense that directly harms others, and that bullshit does not belong in the public square.

Howerton fired back, “Actually puddin', I want everyone, including you, to be able to speak with all the freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. It's vital for a free society.

Clymer then upped the ante, claiming, “Except for all those LGBTQ people who are assaulted, killed, and otherwise discriminated against because of deeply irresponsible, hateful rhetoric, right? But they don’t matter, right, Jason?”
Howerton then fired back, “Incitement of violence is not covered by the First Amendment. So the speech of which you refer to is already illegal. You're not very good at this.” Incitement of violence is not covered by the First Amendment. So the speech of which you refer to is already illegal.

They’re not trying to hide it anymore. https://t.co/LyxMnR0n9q — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 13, 2019
Clymer tried to respond to Howerton: “Once again, gotta love the bad faith framing here. A literal, explicit call for violence is not required to encourage violence and discrimination against marginalized communities. And the irony with your tragic misunderstanding is that even explicit threats are often ignored.”
Howerton countered: 1. We shouldn't ignore explicit threats. 2. So you are the one who gets to decide when speech is ""hateful"" enough to be banned? Amazing and absolutely no problems with this plan. 3. We should have this discussion respectfully, in-person. This is an important issue https://t.co/a3EZkSX6y5 — Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) June 13, 2019
Meanwhile, Clymer had switched gears, protesting that the intent was to target anti-vaxxers: Yeah, because speaking out against anti-vaxx bullshit that harms children is the same as burning books. Fun equivocating there, Sweetie. https://t.co/dA13f7sr0a — Charlotte Clymer(@cmclymer) June 13, 2019
Clymer tried to attack Walsh, doubling down on the claim that the intent was to target anti-vaxxers; Conservatives appear to be outraged that I’m calling anti-vaxx opinions a threat to public safety. Because they are. Gotta love these fools who are bringing back measles to “own the libs”. https://t.co/2k3uq4Y8EB — Charlotte Clymer (@cmclymer) June 13, 2019
Walsh decided he was done with the posturing: Do you ever stop being a liar? I mean even for two seconds? Doesn’t it get exhausting? You said absolutely nothing about vaccines in your tweet, as you well know. You made general statements, which I am responding to. My God you’re a fraud. https://t.co/ucjQNqK2QO — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 13, 2019
And one minute later, Allie Beth Stuckey added to the fusillade: Who decides what opinions are equal? Deserving of time and consideration? Acceptable in the public square? “Harmful?” You? https://t.co/zqsnCMGLsP — Allie Beth Stuckey (@conservmillen) June 13, 2019
Clymer still tried to wiggle out of the dilemma, answering, ""Giving harmful anti-vaxx propaganda a platform that has been shown to directly lead to unnecessary deaths of children? Yeah, I’m pretty damn sure that’s harmful, and every reasonable adult would agree with me.""

Stuckey echoed Walsh, snapping, ""First of all, that’s not what you said in your original tweet.

Author Nicholas Sparks Accused Of Banning An LGBT Club At The Christian School He Founded,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48388/author-nicholas-sparks-blasted-banning-lgbt-club-paul-bois,"Author Nicholas Sparks Accused Of Banning An LGBT Club At The Christian School He Founded ""Marginalized, bullied, and harassed members of the School community."" Rosdiana Ciaravolo / Contributor / Getty Images June 13, 2019 views
Romance novelist Nicholas Sparks (""The Notebook"") has come under fire for founding a Christian school that promoted biblical views on sexual morality.
According to The Daily Beast , in 2006, Sparks helped co-found a prep school in New Bern, North Carolina, called the Epiphany School of Global Studies, which sought to become a ""faith-based academy focused on world issues with an emphasis on language-learning, regular visits to other nations, and a shared understanding that 'learning about the world' was an integral part of 21st-century life."" With a student body of just 500, the school also sought to promote Judeo-Christian values.
Since 2014, however, legal documents show that Sparks and the school's board of trustees have been battling Epiphany's former headmaster and CEO, Saul Benjamin, who alleges the school engaged in various forms of bigotry.
""Sparks and members of the Board unapologetically marginalized, bullied, and harassed members of the School community,"" Benjamin’s attorneys alleged in the complaint, ""whose religious views and/or identities did not conform to their religiously driven, bigoted preconceptions.""
Though Benjamin alleges that Sparks engaged in forms of racial discrimination against black students attending the school, he provides no evidence and only claims that the author attributed the dearth of black students at the school to cultural and economic differences. Without evidence, Benjamin also alleges that one of the school's board members told him she specifically avoids a Wal-Mart staffed by black people and that he was subjected to ""unwelcome comments and increased scrutiny"" when he hired the first full-time black faculty member.
None of that suggests Benjamin's accusations of racial discrimination are false, but it's odd that The Daily Beast article dwells very little on that portion of his complaint — the most serious allegation against the school. In fact, the only evidence presented of Sparks directly addressing the school's diversity issue is an email in which he tells Benjamin of his current plans to create a scholarship program for diversity.
""If you want to talk to someone about diversity, talk to Jenna (who's designing the diversity scholarship program) or me (who will be responsible for raising the money to fund the scholarship program once Jenna has designed it),"" the email states.
Instead, The Daily Beast dedicates a majority of the article to Benjamin's allegations about Epiphany's Christian conservative beliefs regarding LGBT issues. According to Benjamin, LGBT students at the school began meeting in private, forming a club of sorts, which resulted in instances of bullying when word spread about the group. From the report:
The incident seeded tension among the student body and staff. Rumor spread that Benjamin had formed what Sparks called a “gay club,” and the Board of Trustees insisted the club be banned. Two bisexual teachers approached administrators about the group, and were allegedly threatened with termination if they continued to discuss the issue, according to Benjamin’s complaint. It further alleges that at a board meeting on Oct. 30, 2013, a Board of Trustees member claimed Benjamin was “promoting a homosexual culture and agenda.” Sparks allegedly warned Benjamin against pushing the subject, suggesting it would be “wasting time on a side issue,” according to the complaint.
By November, resentments were running high. That month, Benjamin states in his complaint that two LGBT students approached Benjamin and informed him of their plan to stage a protest during chapel. They planned to remove their clothes and announce their orientation in body paint. Benjamin says he asked the girls not to protest, claiming it “was a time for healing, not heroics.” Instead, in the Friday morning Chapel Talk, a weekly tradition at the school, Benjamin spoke about bullying, and the school’s commitment to “loving their neighbors.”
In an email, Sparks expressed anger and frustration with Benjamin, whom he said had earned a reputation among the faculty for being elitist and dismissive of Christian beliefs. ""I told you this would happen… if you didn’t follow our advice, which was simply ‘don’t rock the boat on this particular issue,'"" Sparks said in the email before later advising him to make sure ""all Christian traditions feel especially Christian, especially as we move into the Christmas season.""
In another email, Sparks noted that the school allowed LGBT students to attend but simply did not want them to form a club, which would violate the school's beliefs. Eventually, the tensions resulted in Benjamin being fired from his position as headmaster and CEO. In October 2014, he filed a lawsuit alleging discrimination, breach of contract, emotional distress and defamation, which will go to trial this August.
In a declaration, Nicholas Sparks denied all the allegations brought against the school, asserting that Benjamin lost his job as headmaster of the Christian school for being ""aloof, even rude, elitist and dismissive of their beliefs or backgrounds."" He also claims that Benjamin intentionally tried to start an LGBT club on campus in violation of the school's policy."

Tony Barson / Contributor / Getty Images June 13, 2019 views The abortion cause just garnered for itself another pop cultural cheerleader in the form of singer Selena Gomez, who has now resorted to wearing a 1973 necklace to honor the year that Roe v. Wade made the killing of unborn children legal in all 50 states. According to Yahoo News , the ""Good for You"" singer appeared on ""Live With Kelly and Ryan"" where she wore her necklace on TV – a 14-karat gold piece of protest jewelry designed to commemorate abortion. Created by Sophie Ratner Jewelry on the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the necklace currently goes for $380 online , with proceeds being donated to the Physicians for Reproductive Health. From the company website: Sophie Ratner Jewelry x Physicians for Reproductive Health collaborative necklace commemorates the 45th anniversary of the historic 1973 Roe v.

A post shared by Sophie Ratner Fine Jewelry (@sophieratner_jewelry) on Jun 12, 2019 at 7:32am PDT
Speaking with Bustle , the necklace maker, Sophie Ratner, said that her OBGYN mother taught her the importance of women's healthcare, which includes abortion. ""Growing up with a mother who is an OBGYN has always shown me the importance of equality in healthcare and particularly with women's reproductive health,"" she told the outlet. ""I've always believed that everybody should have the choice to make their own decisions about their bodies and more now than ever it is important to fight for this, which is what inspired our 1973 piece and our collaboration with Physicians for Reproductive Health.""
Selena Gomez jumped into the abortion debate this past May when Georgia and Alabama instituted strict abortion bans. ""To see what is happening right now in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and several other states in our country is not only deeply upsetting but seems that it can’t possibly be real in 2019,"" said Selena Gomez on Instagram . ""It’s no one’s business what a woman chooses to do with her body. End of story. If you want to help fight this, click on the link in my bio to find out how you can volunteer or make a donation.""
Just this week, abortion conglomerate Planned Parenthood released a statement praising pop singer Ariana Grande for donating a hefty sum of $250,000 from her concert proceeds to the organization.
""Ariana Grande’s generous donation comes at a critical time — in Georgia and across the country, anti-women’s health politicians are trying to ban all safe, legal abortion,"" said PP president Leana Wen. ""This is not what the American people want, nor is it something they’ll stand for. Thanks to inspiring support like hers, Planned Parenthood can continue to fight back — in the courts, in Congress, in state houses and in the streets — against these dangerous attacks on people's health and lives."""

Charlamagne Tha God blasted Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday and Thursday this week over her recent comments on her false claim of being Native American.
In an interview on FOX Business Network’s ""Kennedy,"" host Lisa “Kennedy” Montgomery spoke to nationally syndicated radio host Charlamagne Tha God about his recent interview with Warren, whom he compared to Rachel Dolezal.
""But a lot of people want to ride that oppression train like Elizabeth Warren,"" Montgomery said. ""And I thought that you offered her some pretty pointed questions about her declaration of being Native American. And you compared her to Rachel Dolezal, which was a very far comparison.""
""Yes, people acting like that comparison was so off,"" Charlamagne Tha God responded. ""But, I mean, if you were saying that you are a Native American and you got some type of benefit from that, and she said she didn't, but -- how does she know she didn’t?""
""Then why would you put it on your Bar Association card?"" Montgomery asked, referencing Warren. ""And the universities where she was teaching and trying to get jobs, and why were the universities marketing your color in a way that made them look more inclusive?""
""Absolutely. And I would just like to know, you know, why?"" Charlamagne Tha God responded. ""And when you found out that you weren’t Native American, then the rest of your family find out, and she’s such -- she’s a woman that has such great detailed plans, and she has a policy for everything.""
""So, when you guys talked, I was like this is the end of her campaign, because she looked so clueless,"" Montgomery said. ""She looked mentally deficient and she looked like an unserious person who is not fit to be president.""
""It’s like the fact that she has all these policies, but when you ask her something as simple as, so why did you do that with the Native American thing, she’s like, 'I don't know,'"" Charlamagne Tha God said.
""And you asked her like, why were you a Republican? And she’s like, well, I was fighting the banks,"" Montgomery said as she mocked Warren.
""Yes,"" Charlamagne Tha God acknowledged.

Oberlin Hit With $33 Million In Punitive Damages After Calling Local Baker A Racist,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48416/oberlin-hit-33-million-punitive-damages-after-ashe-schow,"Oberlin Hit With $33 Million In Punitive Damages After Calling Local Baker A Racist Ohio law will cap the damages at $22 million mgkaya June 14, 2019 views
Jurors awarded the family owners of a bakery maligned by Oberlin College a whopping $33.2 million in punitive damages after the school accused them of racism in 2016. The same jurors had previously demanded the school pay the owners $11.2 million in compensatory damages.
Three years ago, a black Oberlin student tried to use a fake ID to purchase a bottle of wine at Gibson’s Bakery. The store employee, the grandson of the owner and descendant of the original 1885 bakery founder, refused to sell the alcohol and noticed two more bottles of wine under the student’s shirt. When the employee, Allyn Gibson told the student, Jonathan Aladin, that he was calling the cops, Aladin knocked the phone out of Gibson’s hand and ran from the store. Gibson chased Aladin down. Aladin and the other two students with him — Cecelia Whettstone and Endia Lawrence — began hitting Gibson.
The three students were charged for their crimes and admitted in court that racial bias did not play a role in the altercation.
Oberlin students and administrators, including interim vice president and dean of students Meredith Raimondo, protested the bakery and called the owners racist. The school even broke ties with the bakery, which it had purchased goods from previously.
The Gibsons sued and were awarded $11.2 million in compensatory damages last week . In response, Oberlin’s vice president, general counsel and secretary for the college, Donica Thomas Varner, sent a community-wide email disparaging the jury and its decision, writing the jurors missed “clear evidence” that Oberlin was innocent and that the school was in fact “held liable for the independent actions of their students.”
Jurors were not allowed to see the full email , but the Gibson family’s attorney was able to get them to hear parts of it through legal maneuvers. While trying to avoid paying millions more in damages, Oberlin filed a motion for a mistrial because the jury didn’t specifically portion out the compensatory damages to each member of the Gibson family. The school also claimed it was poor and that being forced to pay the Gibson family for defaming them would hurt students.
Jurors didn’t buy the sob story and demanded Oberlin pay the Gibson family an additional $33.2 million in punitive damages. Ohio law, however, caps the amount of punitive damages to twice that of the compensatory damages, so Oberlin actually only has to pay $22 million more to the Gibsons.
“All they ever asked from the beginning, from Oberlin College, was to use its power and influence and might to tell the truth, and that letter never came,"" said the Gibson family's attorney , Lee Plakas, according to The Chronicle-Telegram. ""But the jury sent the letter that was louder and more visible and more public. I think the Gibson family is grateful for that and grateful for the jury to have the courage to be able to send a letter that no one else would send for the last almost three years.”
While Oberlin argued this judgment hurts free speech, it must be noted that there are legal consequences for free speech that involves defaming people based on knee-jerk reactions and extremist social justice views that deem any action against a black person by a white person as racist."
"SOPO: No, You Will Not Call Us ‘Latinx’",www.dailywire.com,Giancarlo Sopo,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48413/sopo-no-you-will-not-call-us-latinx-giancarlo-sopo,"June 14, 2019 views
If you follow politics closely, chances are that you have encountered the word “Latinx” in recent years. From freshman congresswoman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to the DNC to left-wing outlet We Are Mitu, it has become a popular term among progressives who say it’s a more inclusive way to refer to people (like me) of Latin-American ancestry.
Allow me to explain their mindset: Many words in Spanish are gendered. For instance: la silla (the chair) is female and el auto (the car) is male. Plural nouns may also take a masculine or feminine form with the former describing groups of people that include individuals of both genders. Hence, los medic o s (the doctors), los american o s (the Americans), and so forth.
Progressives have now decided that the binary nature of Spanish is incompatible with wokeness and they intend to bury what they believe is a remnant of colonial patriarchy. Since there is no discernible limit to what the far Left is willing to do in the name of equality of outcome, everything is on the table. In Latin America, there are now efforts on college campuses to upend the entire Spanish language.
But dismantling Spanish poses a logistical nightmare for the far Left, since it is the primary language of 500 million people across 20 countries. Also, unlike English, Spanish has an official referee. A board of linguists known as La Real Academia Española (The Spanish Royal Academy) preserves the language’s integrity and has already rejected “Latinx.”
The far Left is cunning, though. They recognize that “Latinx” will never catch on organically. To overcome these obstacles, leftists are now resorting to emotional manipulation . What began around 2004 as a substitute for “ [email protected] ” has been reframed as pro-LGBT equality. However, by arguing that the traditional use of “Latinos” excludes people who identify as gender-fluid, progressives are deceiving Americans. Indeed, the Left’s latest linguistic crusade has nothing to do with inclusiveness at all — it’s about cultural control and hegemony.
Unfortunately, we all know how this will play out. Those who prefer “Latinos” over “Latinx” will be publicly shamed and accused of bigotry. Since most people would rather not be shoved out of the Overton window, corporate boardrooms and celebrities will eventually buckle to leftist demands. In fact, the term is already being embraced by major corporations .
The way forward for conservatives, moderates, and reasonable liberals is to not acquiesce an inch to the Left’s pedantry and linguistic gaslighting. Rejecting “Latinx” has nothing to do with being mean; it’s about standing up to bullies with the full confidence that facts, reason, and decency are on our side.
Here’s what you need to know.
First, English is a gender-neutral language. So, if you are speaking English and refer to a group of people as “Latinos,” you have not mis-gendered anyone.
Next, if you are unsure what to call someone who identifies as “non-binary,” just say “Latin.” This word dates back over a millennia and has been an appropriate way to refer to people of Latin American origin for decades.
Finally, regardless of what your woke friend who minored in Spanish says (oh, the irony of our cultural overlords from Brooklyn dictating to minorities how to speak their language!), rest assured that “Latinos” is also gender-inclusive in español . Yes, plural words in Spanish include everybody.
In fairness to our progressive friends, it’s likely that centuries-old machismo is why today’s plural terms for mixed-sex groups are the same ones also used for male-only groups. However, it’s unclear what, if any, problem this poses. Even if a problem did exist, dismantling a language where even inanimate objects and adjectives are gendered opens a Pandora’s box.
Non-Spanish speakers should care about this because language is the Left’s Trojan horse. As Orwell noted: “If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” You see, the radical Left has always understood that how we speak shapes how we think. Even if it’s unwitting, by dismembering Spanish, the Left would insidiously advance many of the diabolical ends once set forth by Marx — namely severing people from their families, cultural traditions, and their religion.
Butchering Spanish would strain intergenerational communication and the ability to disseminate and share common values. If children have trouble speaking to their moms, dads, and grandparents, or if they believe the way their family speaks reinforces oppression, this will surely build resentment and weaken family bonds. In due course, the absence of strong, loving families will create a void that the far Left will gladly fill with its governmental leviathan and its cultural proxy, Hollywood.
Another offspring of the far Left’s linguistic tyranny could emerge in education by promoting critical theory from the fringes of college campuses to the mainstream of American grade schools. It’s not difficult to imagine indoctrinated high school Spanish students deconstructing José Martí’s Cultivo Una Rosa Blanca (I cultivate a white rose) and lamenting the gendering of flowers as female “because of the patriarchy,” or some other silliness.
Left to their own devices, the far Left would ruin a beautiful culture. Before you know it, a timeless classic, like Manzanero’s “Somos Novios,” (We Are Lovers) sung by Elvis Presley as “It’s Impossible,” would become “Somos Novixs.” Needless to say, “Lx Macaranx” just doesn’t have the same ring to it.
As someone who believes in treating everyone with kindness, I understand why some might find “Latinx” appealing, but it is ultimately a radical solution in search of an imaginary problem. First-generation Americans already have plenty of real challenges to deal with to have to preoccupy ourselves with the extreme Left’s interminable pathologies, complexes, and electoral interest in cultivating insecurities in others.
Let’s take a hard pass on this insanity by saying clearly, firmly, and unequivocally: No, you will not call us Latinx.

"As Democrats Fight It Out In An Overcrowded Primary, Team Trump Starts Targeting Battleground States With Digital Ads",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48410/democrats-fight-it-out-overcrowded-primary-team-ashe-schow,"HBO DailyWire.com As Democrats Fight It Out In An Overcrowded Primary, Team Trump Starts Targeting Battleground States With Digital Ads BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / Contributor / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
In 2016, political pundits mocked the crowded Republican primary and its two-tier debate system. Now that more than 20 Democrats are running in 2020 against a Republican incumbent, the massive field in 2016 doesn’t look so silly.
Why? Because in 2016 both parties had a primary. Even though Hillary Clinton was all but assured the Democratic nomination, there was still a primary process during which neither side could run national ads for any single nominee — since one had not been selected yet. But in 2020, those 20-plus Democrats aren’t running against 5, 10, or even 20 Republicans. The GOP already has their nominee — President Donald Trump. So, while the massive field of Democrats battles it out for the next year, Trump will be able to spend that time campaigning for re-election.
Sure, President Barack Obama was able to do this in 2012, and President George W. Bush was able to do the same in 2004, but with so many candidates in the race — all with different bases and with so many having a personal brand for attention — things are different in 2020.
And that leaves a gigantic opening for Trump. Just as in 2016, pundits have already declared Trump the election loser. If they’re to be believed, Trump is coming from a serious support deficit. The large Democrat primary is basically a gift to the allegedly embattled president, who has already started spending his massive war chest on battleground states.
The Associated Press reported that Trump is already running ads in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — all states he was able to flip red in 2016. Democrats aren’t able to respond to the ads since they’re too busy attacking each other for the chance to eventually run ads against Trump.
""The real concern here is that Trump is able to have unchallenged positions when it comes to issues that a lot of voters care about,"" Tara McGowan, founder and CEO of the progressive digital campaign firm ACRONYM, told the AP. ""We are going to see outside (Democratic) groups start to spend with offensive and defensive messages, but I worry that it's still not going to be enough to compete with the infrastructure the right has.""
The ads so far focus on finishing the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, and manufacturing jobs by discussing how Trump has been tough on China. Other ads focus on raising Trump’s favorability among African-Americans by pointing out low black unemployment and criminal justice reform.
Whoever becomes the eventual Democratic nominee will have a tough road ahead of them to beat Trump, despite what the media reports. Incumbents usually get re-elected unless something happens to the economy. The last incumbent to lose re-election was President George H.W. Bush, who promised he wouldn’t raise taxes on the American people but then raised taxes. Prior to that, President Jimmy Carter oversaw a massive economic recession and lost to Ronald Reagan.
Democrats, meanwhile, are campaigning on undoing all the positive economic policies Trump has promoted — they want to raise taxes on all Americans and return to the job-killing policies of President Obama. In addition, the candidates and the party has publicly accepted the most extreme position on abortion (up to the minute or shortly after birth) — a position held by barely 10% of the American people."
PolitiFact Nails Ilhan Omar Over 'False' Gun Control Claim,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48406/politifact-nails-ilhan-omar-over-false-gun-control-amanda-prestigiacomo,"PolitiFact Nails Ilhan Omar Over 'False' Gun Control Claim Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Backing an agenda to crack down on Second Amendment rights, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) echoed common gun control talking points last week, highly exaggerating the rate of “gun violence.” The claims were so weak, even left-wing PolitiFact nailed the freshman congresswoman with a false rating.
“Supporting my colleagues’ call on Senate Majority Leader to vote on H.R. 8, 1112 & 1158,” Omar pushed. “Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence. How many more lives will we let gun violence claim?” Supporting my colleagues’ call on Senate Majority Leader to vote on H.R. 8, 1112 & 1158. Gun violence is an epidemic. Every day on average 500 people die from gun violence. How many more lives will we let gun violence claim? — Rep. Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) June 5, 2019
In its review of Omar’s claim that 500 people are killed in the United States every day due to “gun violence,” PolitiFact admitted: “The actual figure is nowhere near that high.”
“Based on the latest federal figures, for 2017, the average per day was 109 — that’s counting deaths resulting from suicides, homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths as well as those from law enforcement,” the partisan fact-checker said. “And it’s 100 if you use a five-year average for 2013 to 2017.”
“We rate Omar’s statement False.”
According to Politifact’s Tom Kertscher, a representative from Omar’s office claimed the Democrat was referencing gun deaths worldwide. However, as noted by Kertscher, the Minnesota rep. posted the claim while pushing a gun control measure in the United States:
Omar’s spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, defended Omar’s use of the 500 figure. But he acknowledged to us that Omar’s tweet was in the context of domestic legislation and that the reference to 500 could have been more precise.
In other words, the cover-up is not very convincing.
The gun control measure Omar was backing, H.R. 8, “establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties (i.e., unlicensed individuals),” according to congress.gov . “Specifically, it prohibits a firearm transfer between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. The prohibition does not apply to certain firearm transfers, such as a gift between spouses in good faith.”
The same week, Omar took a serious hit when reports surfaced claiming the congresswoman filed taxes with her now-husband while she was married to someone else, a violation of federal law. The Daily Wire reported earlier this week:
"" According to the Associated Press , the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board mentioned that Omar's financial disclosures contained some irregularities, and although they aren't the ones to ultimately investigate and punish her for them, the board felt they were worth mentioning.
‘Omar and her husband, Ahmed Abdisalan Hirsi, filed joint tax returns for 2014 and 2015 — before they were actually married and while Omar was legally wed to another man,’ a practice that runs afoul of both Minnesota state law and federal tax law.”"

There's a reason that references to the Japanese internment camps stir up so much outrage. George Mason University 's summary of the infamous executive order issued by FDR:
In an atmosphere of World War II hysteria, President Roosevelt, encouraged by officials at all levels of the federal government, authorized the internment of tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese ancestry and resident aliens from Japan. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, dated February 19, 1942, gave the military broad powers to ban any citizen from a fifty- to sixty-mile-wide coastal area stretching from Washington state to California and extending inland into southern Arizona. The order also authorized transporting these citizens to assembly centers hastily set up and governed by the military in California, Arizona, Washington state, and Oregon. Although it is not well known, the same executive order (and other war-time orders and restrictions) were also applied to smaller numbers of residents of the United States who were of Italian or German descent. For example, 3,200 resident aliens of Italian background were arrested and more than 300 of them were interned. About 11,000 German residents—including some naturalized citizens—were arrested and more than 5000 were interned. Yet while these individuals (and others from those groups) suffered grievous violations of their civil liberties, the war-time measures applied to Japanese Americans were worse and more sweeping, uprooting entire communities and targeting citizens as well as resident aliens.

'STONE-COLD KILLER': Name Of Potential Sarah Sanders Replacement Emerges,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48405/stone-cold-killer-name-potential-sarah-sanders-ryan-saavedra,"June 14, 2019 views
Hours after President Donald Trump announced that White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders would be leaving her position at the end of the month, a name emerged from multiple sources close to the president for who should be Sanders' replacement.
Stephanie Grisham, the White House Director of Communications for first lady Melania Trump, has been a loyal soldier fighting to advance Trump's agenda dating all the way back to his first month on the campaign trail in 2015 when she was a low-level press staffer.
In December, The Washington Post noted that Grisham has grown to become ""one of the more powerful figures in the ever-evolving Trump White House"" and referred to Grisham as ""Melania Trump's enforcer.""
A source close to the White House told The Daily Wire on Thursday night Grisham ""has proven herself to be a stone-cold killer"" and that ""no one else comes close"" to being able to match Grisham in her ability to command problems that arise.
The source said that Grisham was a ""risk-free move for the administration in the run-up to perhaps the most important election in American history.""
""Grisham is pure Trump,"" the source said. ""She holds down the East Wing with ease and has no loyalties to any faction within the Republican Party. Members of the first family love her and know that she is fiercely dedicated and loyal.""
Another source, a Trump ally close to the President and the Trump family, told The Daily Wire: ""Stephanie Grisham is a favorite of Trump loyalists, many in the national press corps, and most important, the Trump family. The First Lady loves Stephanie’s tenacity and loyalty, and President Trump has remarked that he respects Stephanie’s ability to stay cool under pressure and manage the toughest of news cycles. Stephanie might not be the first name that comes to mind for this role, but she’s the one person inside or outside the building who everyone nods their head and says, 'She’d be great.'""
A third source, who is a former high-level Trump administration official, told The Daily Wire: ""Stephanie is one of the last remaining Trump 'originals' in the White House. She’s been with him since the beginning, is unquestionably loyal and has the respect of the press corps. She’d be a total home run as press secretary — both for the President and his supporters.""
In The Post's report, Sanders spoke highly of Grisham, saying: ""During the campaign she developed a good relationship with the president, and that’s carried through. She has developed a great amount of trust from both the president and the first lady, which is a pretty high commodity here. There aren’t a lot of people who have a lot of regular interaction with both of them.""
The Post noted that Grisham is hard-nosed and unapologetic in her defense of the president and highlighted Grisham's response to Trump mocking MSNBC co-host Mika Brzezinski over an apparent facial surgery she underwent.
Speaking on Melania's behalf, Grisham said: ""When her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder.""
The Post noted the following story as an example of how Grisham takes command of a situation:
White House staffers are also learning that Grisham is not someone with whom to tangle. In preparation for Melania Trump’s first solo trip abroad, which she took to Africa this fall, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel clashed with members of the first lady’s staff. Upon their return, Grisham and the first lady’s chief of staff, Lindsay Reynolds, approached White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly about the issue. When he took no apparent action, Grisham spoke directly to Melania Trump, who in turn spoke to her husband privately. Then, when still nothing happened, Grisham suggested to the first lady a different strategy: Without giving the West Wing warning, Grisham put out a statement: “It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.”
Within days, Ricardel was out of the White House.
...never before has the East Wing issued a statement that resulted in the dismissal of a member of the West Wing, notes Myra Gutin, a professor of communications who studies the history of first ladies at Rider University in New Jersey.
Tom Horne, the former Arizona attorney general who hired Grisham, said: ""She’s a very loyal type of person and when there are unfair attacks she responds strongly.""
One White House official told The Post that ""whereas the president will tweet himself and react himself,"" Melania's ""got Stephanie.""
On Friday, Trump was asked during an interview on ""FOX & Friends"" about Anthony Scaramucci and Stephanie Grisham being candidates to replace Sanders.
On Scaramucci, Trump said: ""Well I like Anthony and he’s been very nice and all but I think Anthony should stay where he is right now.""
On Grisham, Trump said: ""Stephanie is terrific."" Trump is asked about Anthony Scaramucci & Stephanie Grisham being candidates to take over for Sarah Sanders Trump on Scaramucci: “Well I like Anthony and he’s been very nice and all but I think Anthony should stay where he is right now” Trump on Grisham: “Stephanie is terrific” pic.twitter.com/sVTIct3BJm — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) June 14, 2019

She Claimed He Raped Her In A Public Place Yet No One Heard. An Appellate Judge Just Saved His Life.,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48426/she-claimed-he-raped-her-public-place-yet-no-one-ashe-schow,"HBO DailyWire.com She Claimed He Raped Her In A Public Place Yet No One Heard. An Appellate Judge Just Saved His Life. Gorfer June 14, 2019 views
In 2016, a male West Point cadet was accused of raping a female cadet in her sleeping bag while the two – and others – were participating in summer field training.
The male cadet, who will not be identified by The Daily Wire, was convicted in a West Point star chamber of three counts of sexual assault and sentenced to 21 years in prison. Last week, while his attorneys argued for a reduced sentence, a military appeals court completely reversed the ruling against him, released him from prison, and returned him to the academy.
The reason was that the alleged rape was so improbable, and the evidence so thin, that a conviction should not have occurred.
The woman claimed the male cadet raped her while she was in her sleeping bag. Others were around, but she said she froze in fear (a widely used claim by those making sexual assault accusations these days) when she awoke to find the male cadet assaulting her. He allegedly assaulted her despite how easily it would have been to be caught by nearby squad members. That’s what the judges found so difficult to comprehend.
“It is hard to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant could complete the charged offenses without cooperation or detection,” the panel of three judges wrote, according to The Associated Press. “It is even harder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant would anticipate that (the woman) would not make any reflexive noise or movements upon being awakened, which would have alerted multiple others to his criminal activity.”
The male cadet had said the encounter was consensual and that both he and the female cadet took steps to conceal their affair by remaining quiet.
The appeal panel further wrote that a rape was implausible because of how easily the woman have been able to identify the male cadet.
“Furthermore,” the judges wrote, “appellant left his semen on (the woman’s) bivy cover, and there is no evidence that he tried to remove this evidence.”
Cadets are barred from having sex during field training.
Attorney Scott Greenfield wrote that each side presented competing narratives at trial, and that “Given the conflicting testimony, it would be fair to assume that the cadet was acquitted, as even under the civil preponderance of the evidence standard, there was nothing to suggest one side outweighed the other.”
But we are in a world where an accusation holds more weight than evidence (or lack thereof) or common sense, so the man was convicted.
The male cadet served 25 months of his sentence before the appellate court reversed an earlier court’s decision.
Naturally, activists like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who’s never seen an accusation she didn’t believe, called the appeals court’s decision loss for “survivors.”
“I am extremely concerned that the panel’s reasoning reflects an outdated understanding about the nature of sexual assault and may deter reporting by survivors,” she said.
Gillibrand’s claims reflect an absurd reading of reality, insisting that any action an accuser takes (whether its lying or conveniently “freezing” or sending thankful text messages after the encounter) is evidence of sexual assault merely because the accusation exists."

One thing President Trump is not is a word mincer.
The president appeared Friday on his favorite morning TV show, ""Fox and Friends,"" and gave his very blunt assessment on some of the candidates currently running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
First up was Joe Biden. Trump questioned the former vice president's ""mental capacity"" and declared Biden ""doesn't have what it takes.""
Host Steve Doocy asked Trump what he meant that Biden ""doesn't have what it takes.""
""It means mental capacity, it means a lot of different things. He never did have what it takes,"" said Trump, adding that he has referred to Biden as ""one percent Joe"" after his two previous failed bids for the Democratic nomination.
""Everybody knows that Joe Biden does not have what it takes,"" Trump said. ""He ran two or three times. I used to call him '1% Joe' because he never got more than 1%. Then Obama came along and, surprisingly, took him off of, I say, the trash heap.""
Trump then moved on to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whom he called ""Pocahontas"" for her longtime false claims to be a Native American. The president said she's finally starting to move up in the polls — from single digits to barely double digits — and added he'd ""love to run against her.""
""I see that Pocahontas is doing better. I would love to run against her, frankly,"" Trump said.
Trump also mentioned Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist from Vermont. ""I see that Bernie Sanders is not doing well at all,"" Trump summed up.""I would've frankly liked to have run against—"" Trump began before breaking off.
But he said Biden, Warren, and Sanders are the top contenders. ""I think it’s probably those three. I don’t see the other ones. I really don’t see it.""
Then, as he does, he went through a few of the other wannabes anyway, like California Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana.
""They talk about Kamala, I don't see Kamala. ... Mayor Pete, I don't see at all, I think that's a joke, Mayor Pete,"" said Trump.
The president, who formally kicks off his re-election campaign Tuesday in Orlando, Florida, dismissed polls that show him trailing in some key states.
""Well, the polls I see, we're doing great in Pennsylvania, we're doing really good in North Carolina, and in Florida I'm winning by a lot. Ohio I'm winning by a lot. I just left Iowa, we're winning that by a lot. And every poll that I see and every poll that we have, we're doing well,"" Trump said. He added that he's also polling well in Michigan and Wisconsin, two states that have traditionally voted for Democrats but went Republican in 2016.
Democrats will hold their first debates on June 26 and 27 in Miami. There are 23 candidates and each had to achieve at least a 1% score on three specific polls. That left three Democrats out of the debates — Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam."
DeSantis Follows Through: Will Sign Bill Today Banning Sanctuary Cities,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48423/desantis-follows-through-will-sign-bill-today-hank-berrien,"DeSantis Follows Through: Will Sign Bill Today Banning Sanctuary Cities Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Fulfilling a promise he made when he successfully campaigned for governor in 2018, on Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will sign into law a bill that will ban sanctuary cities in Florida. The bill, which was passed on May 2 by both the Florida House and Senate, was sent to DeSantis on Thursday.
The Orlando Sentinel reported that DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Ferre sent the Sentinel an email stating: ""Earlier this year, Governor DeSantis asked the Florida Legislature to present him with meaningful legislation to uphold the rule of law and ensure that no city or county jurisdiction can get in the way of Florida’s cooperation with our federal partners to enforce immigration law. Public safety is paramount and local law enforcement agencies can and should work with the federal government to ensure that accountability and justice are one in our state.""
The Sentinel noted that supporters of the bill have urged local governments and law-enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration detainers and share information with federal immigration authorities once illegal immigrants have been detained.
The bill, SB 168 , flatly states, “A state entity, law enforcement agency, or local governmental entity may not adopt or have in effect a sanctuary policy.”
The bill explains exactly what that entails:
“Sanctuary policy” means a law, policy, practice, procedure, or custom adopted or allowed by a state entity or local governmental entity which prohibits or impedes a law enforcement agency from complying with 8 U.S.C. s. 1373 or which prohibits or impedes a law enforcement agency from communicating or cooperating with a federal immigration agency so as to limit such law enforcement agency in, or prohibit the agency from:
(a) Complying with an immigration detainer;
(b) Complying with a request from a federal immigration agency to notify the agency before the release of an inmate or detainee in the custody of the law enforcement agency;
(c) Providing a federal immigration agency access to an inmate for interview;
(d) Participating in any program or agreement authorized under section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s. 1357; or
(e) Providing a federal immigration agency with an inmate’s incarceration status or release date.
In May, DeSantis warned the U.S. Border Patrol not to transfer illegal immigrants to Broward and Palm Beach counties. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and Broward Mayor Mark Bogen had stated that U.S. Border Patrol said that two planeloads of immigrants would be transferred to those counties each week, roughly 500 per month to each county. DeSantis said he was going to communicate with President Trump, according to the Orlando Sentinel , asserting, “Nothing’s concrete. There’s been no migrants brought, released, in Florida. This was not something that came down from the White House. This is something that came out of the agency. Sometimes this stuff happens. Ultimately this is something I’m going to have to talk to the president about. We cannot accommodate in Florida just dumping unlawful migrants into our state. I think it’ll tax our resources, schools and health care, law enforcement, state agencies.”
Fox News noted, “Nine states -- they are Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas -- have passed laws requiring law enforcement to cooperate with ICE.”"
Britain Bans Ads Containing ‘Harmful Gender Stereotypes’,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48422/britain-bans-ads-containing-harmful-gender-ashe-schow,"Britain Bans Ads Containing ‘Harmful Gender Stereotypes’ Jacobs Stock Photography Ltd June 14, 2019 views
Scenes in commercials that could offend the most sensitive of Britons are now banned in Britain.
The Agence France-Presse reported that a ban took effect Friday that keeps “harmful gender stereotypes” out of ads, including scenes depicting a woman who can’t park or a man who can’t change a diaper. Other potentially “harmful” stereotypes, such as women cleaning or men fixing things around the home, will remain, the Presse reported.
“Our evidence shows how harmful gender stereotypes in ads can contribute to inequality in society, with costs for all of us,"" said Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) chief executive Guy Parker in a statement . ""Put simply, we found that some portrayals in ads can, over time, play a part in limiting people's potential.”
“It's in the interests of women and men, our economy and society that advertisers steer clear of these outdated portrayals, and we're pleased with how the industry has already begun to respond,"" Parker added.
ASA, the U.K’s regulator of advertising, identified a 2017 ad for Aptamil baby milk formula as “problematic” because it depicted a little girl growing up to be a ballerina and little boys growing up to be engineers and mountain climbers, according to the Presse.
ASA’s new guidelines list a number of scenarios “likely to be problematic,” including: An ad that depicts a man with his feet up and family members creating mess around a home while a woman is solely responsible for cleaning up the mess. An ad that depicts a man or a woman failing to achieve a task specifically because of their gender e.g. a man’s inability to change nappies; a woman’s inability to park a car. Where an ad features a person with a physique that does not match an ideal stereotypically associated with their gender, the ad should not imply that their physique is a significant reason for them not being successful, for example in their romantic or social lives. An ad that seeks to emphasise the contrast between a boy’s stereotypical personality (e.g. daring) with a girl’s stereotypical personality (e.g. caring) needs to be handled with care. An ad aimed at new mums which suggests that looking attractive or keeping a home pristine is a priority over other factors such as their emotional wellbeing. An ad that belittles a man for carrying out stereotypically ‘female’ roles or tasks.
Other gender stereotypes are not considered problematic, according to ASA, including: A woman doing the shopping or a man doing DIY. Glamorous, attractive, successful, aspirational or healthy people or lifestyles. One gender only, including in ads for products developed for and aimed at one gender. Gender stereotypes as a means to challenge their negative effects.
If some of these scenarios seem contradictory or confusing, too bad. ASA has “evidence” of harmful effects.
Rules like this inherently treat all people as idiots who can’t think for themselves. It assumes girls are too dumb or easily brainwashed to determine they can become an engineer or that men are too ignorant to believe they can do the dishes.
The Committee of Advertising Practice, which works with ASA, will review the effects of the new policy in 12 months to see if it has had any success."

Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was arrested Thursday for allegedly groping a woman at a Manhattan bar on Sunday. The actor pleaded not guilty to one misdemeanor account of forcible touching and was released without bail.
Attorney Mark J. Heller, representing Mr. Gooding, told reporters that his client is ""completely confident” and ""will be totally exonerated,” according to The New York Post .
""There is not a scintilla of criminal culpability that can be attributed to Cuba Gooding Jr.,"" Heller said, adding that he was ""shocked and horrified"" about the prosecution of Gooding even after police were provided surveillance footage of the alleged incident.
On Tuesday, Gooding told TMZ that the surveillance video from the bar would exonerate him; it will show ""what really happened, and that's the most important thing,"" he said.
The surveillance video in question was obtained by TMZ. At around 10:15 p.m. the accuser (whose face has been blurred to keep her anonymity) sits down next to Gooding and his girlfriend Claudine De Niro at the Magic Hour Rooftop Lounge New York City. ""Almost immediately you see Gooding reach over Claudine and place his hand on the woman's left thigh,"" the outlet reported (video, below). ""A few seconds later his hand moves up to her breast, and the accuser puts her hand on his. What happens next is open to interpretation -- she either pushes his hand back toward him, or he pulls her hand to his mouth and kisses it.""
Then an unidentified man walks over and talks to Gooding, De Niro, and the accuser; the group soon talks seemingly without any argument.
""However, about 30 minutes later ... Cuba and Claudine were downstairs lounging on a couch and making out. A man, who we're told works security for the bar, was standing next to the couch when the accuser approached him and started arguing,"" TMZ noted. ""We've blurred her face to protect her identity, but she appears to say, ‘Yes, he did.’ She repeated that after the security guard shook his head. It's unclear if Cuba heard their conversation, but he got up, stumbled and then walked right past the accuser and left.""
In 2017, Gooding responded to accusations of sexual misconduct after he lifted the skirt of actress Sarah Paulson, a friend and ""American Horror Story"" colleague of the actor’s, at a promotional event with a live audience.
""I love the lady that is Sarah Paulson,"" Gooding responded, according to HuffPost . ""We have a banter like brother and sister, which is how the spirit of that whole panel was.""
""Yet that image was taken out to represent some kind of sexual misconduct, and that wasn’t my intent,"" he continued. ""The first person, when I heard about the fervor, I called Sarah, I said, 'I love you, I see you as my sister,' and she said, ‘I feel the same way about you.’ And so I let it go.""
The Oscar winner described the mishap as a ""'teachable moment' for his sons, who are in college, about how images can be misinterpreted on the internet,"" noted HuffPost."
KNOWLES: Trump's Foreign Government Comment A 'Bad Political Look'; Democrats Actions Far Worse,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48414/knowles-trumps-foreign-govt-comment-bad-political-daily-wire,"June 14, 2019 views
On Thursday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,” the host discusses President Donald Trump’s answer on whether or not he would turn over documents from a foreign government regarding political opponents. Video and partial transcript below.
It's a bad look to say, ""Yeah, I want foreign governments to give me dirt on my opponents."" You don't want to encourage them to give you dirt on your opponents because then you owe the foreign governments. And by the way, Trump didn't do this. He's putting himself into this hypothetical situation that he's going to be criticized for that he didn't even do. It's just a bad political look.
Now the left and the anti-Trump right are in hysterics and they're saying he's not a patriot and he's a traitor to his country. That's not the issue. The actual thing he's talking about isn't even the issue. Every country interferes in every other country's elections. Countries interfere with each other. They do it all the time. During the Obama administration, Barack Obama sent his senior campaign aides to Israel to try to oust Benjamin Netanyahu from power. He sent $350,000 of U.S. taxpayer money to a front organization to oust Bibi Netanyahu from power in Israel. We all interfere in each other's elections.
Still, what you don't want is for the President of the United States to accept this sort of thing and premises publicly. Because what it does, invariably, is create the impression of disloyalty to your country. That's the impression that President Trump is giving off. He's saying, yeah, I would totally accept the help of foreign governments I would incentivize foreign governments to give me dirt on American politicians.
He's not actually doing it, but actually, Democrat politicians have done this. They have gone and colluded with foreign governments to try to win elections. Ted Kennedy colluded with the Soviet Union to try to win the presidency. He was negotiating with the Soviet Union to help him get elected. So, it does happen. But why don't you say it? You don't say it because hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue. Because you don't want to create incentives. Publicly speaking, you don't want to put out on your bullhorn and say ""hey foreign governments of the world give me dirt on my opponents. Please spy on American citizens, spy on American politicians."" It's just a bad look.
The good thing you can say for President Trump in this interaction is something that I've said for a long time. Which is that President Trump is the most honest president that we've ever had. He is. Call him honest Donald. You have Honest Abe and now you can have honest Donald. Why is he the most honest president? Because President Trump brags about doing all the bad things and thinking all the bad things that all the other presidents have also done but they've hidden. He's open about it. He's honest about it. What he said is practically true. If you're the president or you're running a campaign, and someone comes up to you and says, ""We got dirt on your opponent"". Let's say it's some Norwegian lawyer.
Maybe he's got ties to the Norwegian government. He says, ""I've got a ton of dirt on your opponent"". One hundred percent of political campaigns take that meeting and take the dirt, they hear him out. As Trump said, maybe they call the FBI after maybe they don't - who knows. One hundred percent of campaigns do it.
Only this guy would actually admit to wanting to do that or to actually doing that. In some ways this is refreshing. I actually do think this has some positive effect on our political discourse because it just knocks away so much B.S. so much preening, falsehood. However, what this also means is then we need to articulate that it's bad. You don't want to incentivize foreign governments to spy on American citizens, even if they're awful American citizens like Hillary Clinton. You don't want to incentivize that. You don't want it to seem like the President of the United States is encouraging you to do that or offering you something in return. That's not a good idea. It's refreshing to hear a guy speak honestly but then it's incumbent on all the rest of us to say right that's true and that is honest, but we shouldn't do that ... don't do it."
Trump Responds To Calls To Fire Kellyanne Conway After Report She Violated Federal Law 'Numerous' Times,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48415/trump-responds-calls-fire-kellyanne-conway-after-james-barrett,"Trump Responds To Calls To Fire Kellyanne Conway After Report She Violated Federal Law 'Numerous' Times Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
A new report by a federal government watchdog issued Thursday determined that White House adviser Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act — which limits political activities of federal employees — on ""numerous occasions"" by repeatedly blasting Democratic presidential candidates. For the violations, the watchdog recommended that Conway be removed. But in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" Friday, Trump made clear that's not going to happen.
""I'm not gonna fire her. I think she's a terrific person. She's a tremendous spokesperson,"" Trump told the hosts, in comments reported by Fox News.com . Trump went on to criticize the Office of Special Counsel — an independent office tasked with government oversight (unrelated to the Robert Mueller investigation) — with ""trying to take away her right of free speech"" and suggesting that he wouldn't ask her to dial back her rhetoric, saying he believes government employees should be allowed ""to express themselves.""
On Thursday, the Office of Special Counsel Henry Kerner issued a letter recommending the dismissal of Conway, citing ""numerous violations of the Hatch Act.""
""Attached to this letter is a copy of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel's (OSC) investigative report detailing numerous violations of the Hatch Act by Counsellor to the President Kellyanne Conway,"" the letter reads. ""Ms. Conway's disregard for the restrictions the Hatch Act places on executive branch employees is unacceptable. If Ms. Conway were any other federal employee, her multiple violations would almost certainly result in removal from her federal position by the Merit Systems Protection Board. As a highly visible member of the Administration, Ms. Conway's violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act's restrictions. Her actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system — the rule of law.""
The accompanying report goes on to cite examples of Conway ripping Trump's potential political opponents.
In response, White House deputy press secretary Steven Groves argued that the Special Counsel ""violate[d] her constitutional rights to free speech and due process,"" CNN reports. ""Others, of all political views, have objected to the (the office's) unclear and unevenly applied rules which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees. Its decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations — and perhaps (the Office of the Special Counsel) should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, non-political manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act,"" he said.
Counsel to the President Pat Cipollone also responded to Kerner's recommendation, which he blasted in a letter as ""a product of a fatally flawed process.""
""I write to submit an initial response to the draft Office of Special Counsel report concerning Assistant to the President and Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway...,"" the letter reads. ""The OSC's draft Report is based on multiple fundamental legal and factual errors, makes unfair and unsupported claims against a close adviser to the President, is the product of a blatantly unfair process that ignored statutory notice requirements, and has been influenced by various inappropriate considerations. As a result, the current Report would serve only to undermine public confidence in OSC and its procedures. At 5:00 pm on May 29, 2019, OSC provided the White House with a 17-page report raising numerous unsubstantiated allegations spanning many months, many of which had never been raised by OSC through the appropriate procedure. OSC then demanded a response by 9:00 a.m. the following morning. As you later acknowledged, OSC's actions were prompted by your desire to respond to press questions concerning a media report that day about comments that Ms. Conway had allegedly made and by the purported personal 'offense' that you took to those comments­ even though you made no effort to investigate before rushing to judgment. OSC's patently unreasonable demand for an overnight response, standing alone, shows that the Report was the product of a fatally flawed process."""
Charlottesville Mayor Seeks To End Celebration Of Thomas Jefferson’s Birthday,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48420/charlottesville-mayor-seeks-end-celebration-thomas-ashe-schow,"Charlottesville Mayor Seeks To End Celebration Of Thomas Jefferson’s Birthday ericfoltz June 14, 2019 views
It doesn’t matter what you do — for your country, for your fellow man, whomever — if you also do something reprehensible or seen as reprehensible in the future, that’s it. You’re finished. Banned from history.
Such is the fate of founding father and third president, Thomas Jefferson. Current social justice theology dictates that his contributions to this country, the Declaration of Independence — none of that matters because he also owned slaves at a time when it was legal to do so.
Nearly 200 years after his death, Jefferson’s birthday is set to be removed as a city holiday in Charlottesville, VA. Instead, the city’s mayor proposed replacing it with “Liberation and Freedom Day” in March to celebrate the emancipation of slaves in the area. The day is already celebrated, but Mayor Nikuyah Walker appears to want that day recognized as a paid holiday instead of Jefferson’s birthday.
The Daily Progress, a local paper in Charlottesville, reported that while Albermarle County observes Jefferson’s birthday in an official capacity, the University of Virginia — which Jefferson designed and founded himself — does not.
The Progress could not get a response from the mayor or her office about the reason behind her proposal, nor would several other members of the City Council respond.
Councilor Wes Bellamy, however, said he was “proud” of the mayor for her proposal.
“I think it’s a conversation that we definitely as a city need to have,” he said, according to the Progress. Bellamy also acknowledged the reason for the proposal was because Jefferson owned slaves and “raped Sally Hemings” — one of his slaves.
John Blair, the city attorney, said the city could revise an ordinance for the holiday observance.
Gayle Jessup White, the community engagement officer at Monticello and a descendant of Hemings and Jefferson, said the historical site already handles the “tension” created by Jefferson’s complicated life.
“We respect the city’s process for resolving questions around its official holidays. At Monticello we hold Jefferson’s immense achievements and deep flaws in tension. We have those discussions with guests every day,” White told the Progress. “We are committed to sharing an honest, complicated and inclusive view of our history — including the history of race and slavery at Monticello — and the commemoration of Jefferson’s birthday is an important time for these tensions to be engaged.”
Joy Pullman, executive editor of The Federalist (where I also have a byline), wrote that the proposal to remove Jefferson’s birthday as an official holiday comes from “resentment, envy, and ignorance.”
It assumes that someone who has done something terrible can never be recognized for what he has done that is great. It assumes that we should socially elevate those who have accomplished nothing over those who have built a great nation, simply because the former can land a valid criticism against the latter.
Followed to its logical conclusions, this line of thinking bans the idea of greatness itself. It subsumes all good actions to any possibly connected evil actions. It insists that the most defining feature of any person is his sins. And it pretends that simply by virtue of understanding that slavery is wrong, we who live today in the West are perfectly holy, and may freely and smugly condemn every single person who has ever gone before us, and brush away every insight and achievement of human history."
"Federal D.C. Employees, Miffed At Being Relocated To Heartland, Turn Their Backs On Agriculture Secretary",www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48419/federal-dc-employees-miffed-being-relocated-hank-berrien,"Federal D.C. Employees, Miffed At Being Relocated To Heartland, Turn Their Backs On Agriculture Secretary Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
On Thursday, employees of the federal Department of Agriculture, miffed that their jobs were being relocated from Washington D.C. to Kansas City, turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he spoke to them at an all-hands meeting. American Federation of Government Employees members from NIFA snd ERS turn backs on Agriculture Secretary Perdue at session on their unwanted relocation from DC to Kansas City area. #USDA pic.twitter.com/40JlVtuXFl
As CNN reported :
Perdue announced earlier Thursday morning that the Economic Research Service, which provides research and statistical analysis for lawmakers, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which allocates federal research funding, will be relocated to Kansas City from Washington, DC, the final announcement in a process that began last year.
In a letter to employees , Perdue stated:
As you all know, we have evaluated 136 expressions of interest from parties in 35 states, based upon objective criteria and mission operational needs, and conducted site visits to three areas – Kansas City, North Carolina, and Indiana. The Kansas City Region takes into account the expectations that employees wanted in a new location.
The Kansas City Region has proven itself to be a hub for all things agriculture and is a booming city in America’s heartland. There is already a significant presence of USDA and federal government employees in the region. Boasting not only a low cost of living, with high-quality, affordable housing, it has an excellent public school system and a community filled with family-oriented activities. The city itself is extremely livable, with access to arts, culture, and a thriving food scene. Our belief is that this relocation will give USDA the opportunity to attract a staff with training and interest in agriculture.
Perdue has stated that the move will save taxpayers roughly $20 million a year. He had asserted, according to Politico , “The Kansas City Region will allow ERS and NIFA to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and bring important resources and manpower closer to all of our customers. This agriculture talent pool, in addition to multiple land-grant and research universities within driving distance, provides access to a stable labor force for the future.” He added that the saved funds would permit more funding for “critical needs like rural prosperity and agricultural competitiveness,” saying that it would also allow the agencies to prosper “even in the face of tightening budgets.” He acknowledged that state and local governments had offered $26 million in incentives.
The employees turned their backs on Perdue as he tried to offer some comfort, saying:
I know that you probably already know that we announced this morning that Kansas City region’s been selected as the new home for ERS and NIFA; and throughout the process I’ve emphasized that this should never be construed in any way, shape fashion, or form as a decision based on the jobs that are being done by our ERS and NIFA employees. In fact, I often publicly and privately brag to our colleagues that USDA have the best workforce in the federal government. So this is a strategic and long-term decision for USDA as an agency.
While this is a strategic and long-term decision for USDA, I know that it’s not so much for you all. I realize that this is a real-time immediate and major change for many of you. I know that your primary concern, as expected, at this moment, is for you and your families, and I absolutely understand that. I know that you’ve been feeling a lot of stress since we announced, I think about ten months ago, our strategic plan to move ERS and NIFA out of the national capital region. I want you to know that this decision was not entered into lightly, and having recently undergone a major relocation of my own, I understand the decision creates personal disruption for some of you as well as your families.

WATCH: O'Keefe To Klavan: Big Tech Colluding To Silence Conservative Voices,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48409/okeefe-klavan-big-tech-colluding-silence-daily-wire,"June 14, 2019 views
On Thursday’s episode of “The Andrew Klavan Show,” the host speaks with James O’Keefe about how social media has been quietly censoring conservative and Christian voices, particularly O’Keefe’s revelations about Pinterest's actions to limit conservative posts. Video and partial transcript below.
James O'Keefe: A whistleblower comes to us inside of a company called Pinterest, which is a big tech company. It's a 13-billion-dollar company who had a recent IPO. And this is a whistleblower. This is someone who was willing to lose his job. He knew the risks. He gave us secret documents and since I'm on the Daily Wire one of the pieces of information in this document, I have the document in front of me. Internal employees at Pinterest were calling Ben Shapiro a ""white supremacist."" And they put Ben Shapiro, the words ""Ben"" space ""Shapiro"" space ""Islam"" or ""Muslim"". Any of those combinations of words on what they call an S.T.L. or a sensitive terms list. He shared screenshots of employees working at a high level in the company talking about how they would censor any content mentioning Ben Shapiro.
So, there's this information. There's also information that Live Action, the largest pro-life organization, the biggest pro-life media organization, they actually consider them to be ""pornography."" And also, other websites; PJ Media, Zero Hedge, all ""porn."" So, we reach out for Pinterest to comment on Monday afternoon. And Pinterest scrambles to try to cover this information up and removes Live Action from the porn domain blacklist before we published the story. We published the story. The story blows up. Drudge links to the video, and then Pinterest then places Live Action back on to the porn domain blacklist. And then after that happens Pinterest just bans Live Action. And then what happens is YouTube, which Drudge has just linked to the video of all of these exposés, YouTube bans the video, claiming that we violated a privacy violation of Pinterest and then what happens is Twitter censors us publishing the video. So, YouTube bans the video and then Pinterest informs this young man who blew the whistle that he's been placed on administrative leave. So, they didn't actually fire him. ... I think the reason why they didn't fire him is because they know that they have a lawsuit on their hands. If they fire him for blowing the whistle on what has occurred. So, an extraordinary series of events.
Andrew Klavan: That is absolutely amazing. It is absolutely amazing that social media is ganging up on you to keep you from exposing social media from ganging up on conservatives. I mean it's George Orwell, it really is. They've gone ... they've lost their minds but really not. I mean it's a strategy, right? They are trying to silence us before the 2020 election. They want Conservatism to (be silence).
James O'Keefe: This is the, his name is Eric Cochran. I mean he is a hero. We just published an interview with him. He did go on the Tucker Carlson show last night. And what's extraordinary, you listen to this guy Eric, he says I don't care about ... He was making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year working and he just gave it all up. Because he wants to draw out a dozen people like him to do what he did. And if you listen to Eric talk, Eric says this is the watershed moment. He says this is the moment. He says it's all happening. I've been doing this for 10 years. I've never had YouTube take down one of my videos. And I covertly film people, I leak documents. That's what investigative journalists do. But now what's happening is that the public, the tech companies are putting down the gauntlet and saying no, no this is a bridge too far, you're throwing the stone in Goliath's eye and it's hurting us too greatly. They would never do this to the New York Times. They would never do this to The Washington (Post). Those guys publish secret documents all the time. They publish secret documents into state secrets they publish. I don't know the documents on you and I that they have.
But that does that's not what this is about. This is about putting the line in the sand. And this young man has made the extraordinary decision to give it all up. To basically ruin his career for a cause greater than himself. I think that what's going to happen next is there's going to be a dozen people like him to blow the whistle. I don't think big tech is going to be able to stop them all.
Andrew Klavan: Well this is the thing, I mean, first of all just to unpack it just a little bit. What you exposed was they were putting Ben Shapiro but also Lila Rose and her fight against abortion, they put her as a porn site. I mean that's an amazing thing. So porn sites [are] legitimately banned from Pinterest. And they put her on a porn site. You expose that and they shut you down. I mean it's amazing.
James O'Keefe: Truth is stranger than fiction. If you wrote, you're from Hollywood, if you wrote a screenplay about this, the executive producer would throw it in the trash. That's too ridiculous. That's too cliché. I know this sounds crazy but, it's all happening. This is the moment in time, I'm not exaggerating.
Pinterest put pressure on Google. Pinterest put pressure on YouTube corporate and said this is too true. Just like from that movie The Insider. That's a metaphor for what's happening because this guy's an insider. When Al Pacino says the more true it gets the worse it gets. He sits. He talks. He courageously blows the whistle. We published the information in a responsible way. I'm not an opinion guy I'm not a pundit. I just published facts that the public had a right to know and I can't go to the New York Times, The Washington Post, because those guys hate my guts so much that they put their hatred and their passion for politics and party over the First Amendment. And the only place I have to go is YouTube and YouTube takes me down. And do you see those blue checkmark guys on Twitter giving a crap about this? No. They say off with his head. The Intercept, which is the entire purpose of The Intercept, is to publish secret documents. He's saying Facebook needs to ban O'Keefe. This is the moment, and this is the moment in time."
SAD: Democratic Debates Announced. Warren Gets Left At Kids’ Table.,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48437/sad-democratic-debates-announced-warren-gets-left-hank-berrien,"SAD: Democratic Debates Announced. Warren Gets Left At Kids’ Table. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
The Democratic Party, as always, favoring fairness over merit, held a random drawing to determine which candidates would appear in the two debates scheduled for June 26-27 in Florida, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) got left at the kids’ table.
The New York Times tried to put the best spin on the situation, arguing that Warren, who is running third in most polls behind former vice-president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who are both in the June 27 debate, will face-off against Beto O’Rourke, but O’Rourke’s recent poll numbers show that he is not currently a serious candidate in the race. The Times wrote, “Elizabeth Warren will share the stage with Beto O’Rourke on one night, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. will face off against Bernie Sanders on the next …”
20 candidates will participate in the debates, ten on each night, which will be shown on NBC. The Times noted that Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., “did not meet the polling and fund-raising criteria outlined by the Democratic National Committee,” and thus will not be part of the debates.
Politico reported that DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa told Fox News, “I think both nights will get amazing viewership. I think we’re already starting to hear, people are extremely excited about these candidates. I think they’re both very strong lineups. I think that you will also hear candidates respond to each other on various nights.”
The anchors for the debates will be Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, the Telemundo anchor José Díaz-Balart, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.
The first night’s debate will feature Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. (D-NJ), Julián Castro, former housing secretary in the Obama administration, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, John Delaney, former representative from Maryland, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Beto O’Rourke, former representative from Texas, and Tim Ryan, representative from Ohio.
The second night will feature former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Marianne Williamson, self-help author, and Andrew Yang, former tech executive. "

During an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" Friday morning, President Trump compared his wife Melania to the 20th century's most iconic first lady, Jackie Kennedy — and sparked more controversy, hilarity and outrage online in the process.
His comparison to the former first lady came during a discussion of his decision to give Air Force One a new paint job, which he unveiled Thursday. The current light blue and gold stripe design was first created when Jacqueline Kennedy was first lady. Trump's new design will replace the light blue and gold with navy blue and red.
""You know the baby blue doesn't fit with us,"" he explained. ""People get used to something — and it was Jackie O, and that's good — but we have our own Jackie O today. It's called Melania. Melania. We'll call it Melania T.""
""By the way, people love her, people love her,"" he added. ""She gets no credit from the media, but she gets credit from the people.""

As Investor's Business Daily notes, while the design is in, the ""final decision on the plane's color won't be approved until 2021, and if Trump loses his re-election bid the change could be scrapped.""
Trump's Jackie O comments have inspired several headlines and a lot of responses online, many of which include risque photos of Melania from her modeling days and cheap shots at the first lady. While some agreed that both women are stylish and beautiful, others were incensed at the comparison. Some noted that Jackie Kennedy only became ""Jackie O"" after Kennedy was assassinated and she got remarried to Aristotle Onassis, a Greek shipping magnate. Others portrayed Melania in derisive terms. Here are some of the more PG-13 reactions:
""Both these ladies are very stylish, there have been comparisons since day one these are probably the two most fashionable first ladies the country has ever had!"" wrote one Melania fan. ""Very stylish,"" said one twitterer, who included some sensual shots of Melania. ""He ... refers to his wife as 'it?'"" one critic asked, a question several others posted. ""As a matter of fact, I see the comparison,"" one guy wrote, including some more hot pics of the first lady. ""Too bad he can't be more like Jackie's first husband,"" one critic quipped. ""Does he not realize that she became 'Jackie O' after her first husband was assassinated and she married a Greek billionaire?"" wrote another. (That post prompted one fellow critic to suggest she wanted Trump assassinated, writing , ""Let’s hope one of those things happen for Melania as well."") Both these ladies are very stylish, there have been comparisons since day one these are probably the two most fashionable first ladies the country has ever had! "
Steve Scalise Was Shot Two Years Ago Today. Why Is The Media So Silent On The Anniversary?,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48434/steve-scalise-was-shot-two-years-ago-today-why-josh-hammer,"DailyWire.com Steve Scalise Was Shot Two Years Ago Today. Why Is The Media So Silent On The Anniversary? Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Today marks the two-year anniversary of the nearly fatal shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) on a baseball field in Virginia. The shooter, who will not be named as a matter of Daily Wire company policy , was revealed to be a Bernie Sanders campaign- volunteering hard leftist who thought Republicans deserved to die for their alleged sins committed against the American people. This is not an exaggeration — it was all but made clear as an express motivation . To be sure, no one whatsoever was to blame for the shooter's actions other than the shooter himself — human beings are discrete actors and, absent direct incitement or agitation to violence, we each possess individual culpability and bear responsibility for only our own actions.
But perhaps because the shooter was a leftist and the target was a notable Republican, the media coverage today, on the two-year anniversary, seems rather ... sparse. CNN and The Hill have anniversary pieces, but a quick survey of the mainstream media landscape reveals not too many other entries. CNN's write-up is straightforward enough:
On June 14, 2017, a man who posted online about hating conservatives and President Donald Trump fired a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic handgun at Republican lawmakers, staff and coaches practicing for an upcoming charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia. The shooter fired at least 70 rounds before he was killed.
Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was gravely wounded, and his determined recovery has been widely reported on, but for the four others who were struck by bullets and shrapnel, their road to recovery has been largely out of the spotlight in the years since the attack.
Scalise himself furthermore tweeted earlier today: ""Two years ago, my colleagues and I were attacked while practicing for a charity baseball game, simply because we’re Republicans. Thanks to countless heroes, miracles, and prayers, I’m still here today getting to do the job I love in Congress—and play a little baseball."" Two years ago, my colleagues and I were attacked while practicing for a charity baseball game, simply because we’re Republicans. Thanks to countless heroes, miracles, and prayers, I’m still here today getting to do the job I love in Congress—and play a little baseball. pic.twitter.com/4DWeeFrc76 — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) June 14, 2019
Still, fully accepting the premise of individual culpability for one's own actions, the inescapable reality of the facts surrounding this shooting is that a deranged socialist went on a kamikaze mission to go shoot up as many Republicans as he possibly could. Against that backdrop, and surveying the relative paucity of media coverage today on the shooting's two-year anniversary, one must naturally wonder: How differently would this anniversary be covered if the shooter had been wearing a MAGA hat and had specifically targeted not Republicans, but Democrats?
The thought experiment seems to answer itself. It goes without saying that our myopic fourth estate, which is comprised of 90+% registered Democrats , is ultimately but one of many instruments wielded by our broader bi-coastal clerisy — our supercilious ruling class that deigns to govern the misbegotten heartland yokels. Alternative history speculations are ultimately just that — speculations. And, to be sure, we can never know for sure how exactly subsequent media coverage would have transpired had the political and partisan identities of the involved actors been reversed. But we can make an educated guess that there would surely be more mainstream media coverage on the two-year anniversary of a brazen attempt to assassinate a sitting U.S. congressman if the identities had been reversed. And the fact that we can so easily make such an educated guess ought to be distressing."
Local Anytime Fitness Blasted For This Fat-Shaming Promotional Email,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48430/anytime-fitness-blasted-body-shaming-promotional-paul-bois,"Local Anytime Fitness Blasted For This Fat-Shaming Promotional Email ""I want to call it what it is… FAT."" Gilles Mingasson / Contributor / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
A Connecticut location for the gym Anytime Fitness has been taking a good deal of heat on social media for sending out a promotional email that fat-shamed people into working out.
According to Fox News , a woman was ""horrified"" to receive an email from the gym that urged her to ""pinch"" and ""grab"" her body's love-handles to shame her into joining the gym just in time to get her summer bikini bod going.
""I...am horrified by this promotional email from @AnytimeFitness ,"" said Mora Reinka on Twitter. ""I just don’t even know where to begin.""
Reinka shared the email earlier this week, titled ""Be comfortable in your skin this summer."" Her post has since gone viral with 1,300 likes and 260 comments. I...am horrified by this promotional email from @AnytimeFitness . I just don’t even know where to begin pic.twitter.com/6DOBq9sfiI — Mora Reinka (@MoraReinka) June 12, 2019
""Mora, I need you to do me a favor,"" the email began. ""Think about the warm days of summer ahead. Warm summer night breezes. Lake or beach time. Seeing family (the ones you like). Spending more time with the kiddos (also the ones you like.). Listening to music. Shorts, bathing suits, flip flips. The smell of suntan lotion.""
“And LOTS of pictures of you that will be posted online forever,"" the email continued. ""LOTS of sucking in, side turns, skinny arm posts, and God forbid, a side [picture] while sitting down. Do me a second favor: Take your hand, and grab the excess you have on your waist (front/back/sides). Can you pinch it? Or can you grab it? Well, I want to call it what it is… FAT.""
""Apparently nowadays I gotta be politically correct. Maybe I should say 'adipose tissue,'"" the email concluded.
Yahoo Lifestyle reports that the owner of the gym's Manchester location sent the email to Reinka, who had stopped attending Anytime Fitness two years ago.
After serious backlash on social media, a spokesperson for Anytime Fitness later told Fox News that the company found the email both appalling and ""insensitive.""
""We are appalled by the message that an Anytime Fitness franchisee sent to several former members of his gym. The message was the polar opposite of how we coach our franchisees to communicate with the public,” Mark Daly, national media director of Anytime Fitness, told Fox News. ""We’re proud of the fact that Anytime Fitness has rightly earned a reputation as a gym that supports and encourages its members. The owners and staff at thousands of Anytime gyms worldwide genuinely care about the well-being of their members and strive to assist them in improving their quality of life.""
Daly asserted to Fox News that the individual franchisee sent the email in jest to people urging them into joining the gym and did not have corporate backing.
""This particular franchisee thought he was being clever in motivating former members to re-join his gym. He was wrong. He was insensitive,"" Daly continued. ""We told him so, in no uncertain terms, and he apologized – promising not to repeat his errors. Our corporate staff spent much of the day yesterday apologizing to those who were offended by the franchisee’s message. I imagine we will continue to do the same today."""
Alyssa Milano Releases Abortion Map On Where Hollywood Should And Should Not Film,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48427/alyssa-milano-releases-abortion-map-where-paul-bois,"Alyssa Milano Releases Abortion Map On Where Hollywood Should And Should Not Film ""Those in our industry need to be able to make informed choices."" Rich Fury / Staff / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Since her proposed ""sex strike"" failed to keep pro-life states from passing several bills either banning or strictly limiting the cruel practice of abortion, actress Alyssa Milano has now created a tool that will help filmmakers determine where they should and should not film potential projects.
In a mission statement exclusively shared with Variety , Alyssa Milano and fellow activist Ben Jackson said the new survey will enable production companies to select states and locations that give helpful tax credits while being supposedly ""safe"" places for women to work.
""Following the passage of a number of draconian attacks on a pregnant person’s right to choose in 2019, including those in states in which the motion picture and television industries conduct significant business, it has become apparent that those in our industry need to be able to make informed choices,"" the mission statement said.
The state-by-state abortion map took a month for the actress to assemble in cooperation with the National Assn. for the Repeal of Abortion Laws and the political encyclopedia Ballotpedia. The states have been color-coded according to the threat-level of anti-abortion laws, ranging from ""most threatened"" to ""under threat"" to ""least threatened."" From Variety:
In Colorado, for instance, productions get a 20% tax credit on qualified expenditures as long as 50% of crew members are state residents. Colorado also has no major pending abortion laws or existing bans, so that state gets a “least threatened” grade. Florida, on the other hand, has introduced the notion of a six-week abortion ban and currently has no tax incentive for film and TV. The survey looks exclusively at abortion law, though other human rights issues like LGBTQ equality have previously threatened production in places like North Carolina.
Milano will also be working in concert with Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms to develop a mobile app that will enable film location scouts in Georgia to avoid conservative areas, or places that the actress says will ""fund voter suppression, inequality and the stripping away of anyone’s rights.""
""I asked if there was a version we could create with maps to the block of people that support a progressive policy, versus homes that are supporting a hurtful policy,"" Milano said. ""Can we use these to pinpoint in red states where it is safe for productions to spend their money? She thought it was a brilliant idea.""
Milano claims her idea for the app came while shooting the show ""Insatiable"" this past month outside of Atlanta, where producers rented a house from a conservative homeowner.
""I walk into this house that someone owns and rents out for production, and in front of the sink is a ‘Brian Kemp for Governor’ kitchen mat,’"" she said. ""So I think to myself, every time we shoot on location outside of Atlanta, we are funding a hurtful policy.""
""The original idea was to prevent Gov. Kemp from signing this bill,"" she said of her efforts. ""We in the entertainment industry pride ourselves on inclusivity, equality and choice. All of these really symbolic, important things that we understand become a beacon for the country to follow suit,” she concluded, noting that her research helps serve “this very tricky balance of not wanting to ever cause families harm in the state of Georgia, but being aware enough to know that the only thing that changes the state of policy is usually money."""
Dershowitz Would ‘Enthusiastically’ Endorse Biden Over Trump,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48421/dershowitiz-would-enthusiastically-endorse-biden-paul-bois,"Dershowitz Would ‘Enthusiastically’ Endorse Biden Over Trump ""You’re not going to vote for Donald Trump, are you?"" John Lamparski / Stringer / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Despite spending the past three years defending President Trump from calls for impeachment by leftists, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz would still ""enthusiastically"" support Joe Biden in 2020 race.
Speaking with Dan Abrams on SiriusXM , Dershowitz said his support for President Trump in 2020 depends on who gets the Democratic nomination. In the case of Bernie Sanders, the Harvard Law professor admitted that he would be in ""a real dilemma.""
""You’re not going to vote for Donald Trump, are you?"" Abrams asked Dershowitz, according to Fox News .
""It depends who runs against him,"" Dershowitz said. ""If Bernie Sanders is nominated, that would present a real dilemma for me.""
""And what if the candidate is Joe Biden?"" Abrams shot back.
""I’m a strong supporter of Joe Biden,"" Dershowitz responded. ""I like Joe Biden. I’ve liked him for a long time and I could enthusiastically support Joe Biden.""
""Over Donald Trump?"" asked Abrams.
""Over Donald Trump, yeah,"" Dershowitz concluded.
The fact that Dershowitz would still support a Democrat over President Trump in 2020 illustrates the Harvard Law professor's commitment to liberal ideas over party politics. Throughout the entire Mueller investigation, as Democrats were calling for the president's impeachment over alleged Russian collusion, Dershowitz stood firm in his conviction that every American deserves civil liberties, including and especially Americans with whom he disagrees. Just by merely sticking up for President Trump's rights as an American, Dershowitz claimed he faced intense scrutiny and ostracization from his liberal friends.
""I am a liberal Democrat in politics … but that is not good enough for some of my old friends on Martha’s Vineyard. For them, it is enough that what I have said about the Constitution might help Trump. So they are shunning me and trying to ban me from their social life on Martha’s Vineyard,"" he wrote in an op-ed last year.
Later, Dershowitz would go on to say that his social ostracization was actually a blessing, referring to it as a ""red badge of courage.""
""The idea that some of these people aren’t talking to me is not a punishment, it’s a great reward. I am so pleased,"" he said on WABC in July of last year as the Mueller investigation kicked into high gear. ""It’s a red badge of courage for me that there are some people who prefer to shut down debate and not talk to me.""
""These are people who have asked me for help over the years, who have asked me for support when their kid gets busted on a marijuana charge, or on possession of alcohol, I’m the first one they call,"" he continued. ""But as soon as I defend the rights of Donald Trump or anybody else they disagree with, I’m am a pariah.""
Just recently, when the Mueller investigation finally came to a close, Dershowitz severely criticized the special counsel for having a bias toward President Trump.
""Until today, I have defended Mueller against the accusations that he is a partisan,"" Dershowitz wrote in an op-ed. ""I did not believe that he personally favored either the Democrats or the Republicans, or had a point of view on whether President Trump should be impeached. But I have now changed my mind. By putting his thumb, indeed his elbow, on the scale of justice in favor of impeachment based on obstruction of justice, Mueller has revealed his partisan bias. He also has distorted the critical role of a prosecutor in our justice system."""
"VIDEO: Deputy 'Pushed, Struck In Face' By Raptors President; Online Response Turns Racial",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48432/video-deputy-pushed-struck-face-raptors-president-james-barrett,"June 14, 2019 views
A post-game confrontation caught on video involving the Toronto Raptors president and a Sheriff's deputy has triggered an investigation. In a statement Friday morning, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office confirmed that it is pursuing a misdemeanor complaint against the president of the Toronto Raptors.
""We can confirm our deputy was pushed and struck by a Raptors executive after he asked him for his credentials to go on the court at the end of the game,"" Sgt. Ray Kelly with the Alameda County Sheriff's Office said in a statement first reported by NBC Bay Area. ""We are working with the Oakland Police Department to file a report and contact witnesses and review video.""
The incident between the officer and the executive, identified as Raptors President Masai Ujiri, took place after the Raptors defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 in Oracle Arena Thursday night, a victory that secured Ujiri's team the championship. Law enforcement says Ujiri shoved and struck an officer in the face after he was stopped from joining the team on the court for the championship celebration. Ujiri, they say, failed to show them the required credential.
Video published by NBC Bay Area's Kristofer Noceda shows Ujiri appear to shove an officer, which results in a chaotic moment where a man, who presumably works with the team, attempts to keep the officers from taking action against Ujiri.
""Sheriff's deputy reportedly pushed and struck in the face by a man believed to be a Toronto Raptors executive after Game 6 of the #NBAFinals at Oracle Arena, @ACSOSheriffs says,"" Noceda tweeted Thursday night. NBC's Raj Mathai added in a follow-up post: ""Raptors exec (believed to be Team President Masai Ujiri) involved in courtside altercation after the game. @ACSOSheriffs say he hit a deputy in the face. We're waiting response from @NBA."" #BREAKING : Sheriff's deputy reportedly pushed and struck in the face by a man believed to be a Toronto Raptors executive after Game 6 of the #NBAFinals at Oracle Arena, @ACSOSheriffs says. https://t.co/fobdK9iWEq pic.twitter.com/a4X0IysY5Z — Kristofer Noceda (@krisnoceda) June 14, 2019 #EXCLUSIVE : #Raptors exec (believed to be Team President Masai Ujiri) involved in courtside altercation after the game. @ACSOSheriffs say he hit a deputy in the face. We're waiting response from @NBA . #NBAFinals https://t.co/iCIXWuPjqi — Raj Mathai (@rajmathai) June 14, 2019
Ujiri appears to be holding what may be his credential in his right hand; another video showing Ujiri waiting in the tunnel before the incident also appears to show him holding the credential, USA Today reports. The outlet notes, however, that NBA rules specify that ""only personnel with specially designated gold armbands were allowed on the court after the conclusion of the game, and it's unclear if Ujiri was wearing one or had one in his possession.""
Response online to Noceda's post of the video online immediately became racially charged, with several responders assuming the deputy's actions were racially motivated. ""If the sheriffs have a clue, they will back the hell down, chalk it up to a mistake on both sides and move along. No doubt they laid hands first, and I bet it was because they could never fathom a black man was the president of a team,"" wrote one responder. ""Black man with an African accent...cop probably still doesn’t believe it,"" wrote another.
Some came to the officer's defense. ""Switch it up tho, say he’s just some rando in a suit and gets into it with, or assaults, a player out there and then cop says 'oh I saw him but he said he was the team prez and had a nice suit on so I let him through.' Then where we at?"" tweeted one defender. But most weren't so willing to give a white officer the benefit of the doubt. ""But how can he not know who the opposing team's president is, especially knowing the possibility of an on court celebration of the Raptors win?? That would just be gross negligence on the staff at Oracle to have not been prepared for that regardless!"" one person fired back ."
HAMMER: Don’t Let Kim Kardashian Fool You. America Has An UNDER-Incarceration Problem.,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48431/hammer-dont-let-kim-kardashian-fool-you-america-josh-hammer,"June 14, 2019 views
Kim Kardashian was back at the White House this week to peddle her pernicious ""criminal justice reform"" agenda. While Kardashian's passion about helping ex-felons reintegrate into society may be well-intentioned, the cold truth is that an absolutely staggering 83% of state prisoners are re-arrested within nine years of their release. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), furthermore, the so-called ""low-level drug offenders"" that Kardashian and much of the weak-on-crime/jailbreak cartel so aggressively promote are, in fact, also huge recidivism risks for acts of violent crime :
Overall, 68 percent of released state prisoners were arrested within three years, 79 percent within six years and 83 percent within nine years. The 401,288 released state prisoners were arrested an estimated 2 million times during the nine years after their release, an average of five arrests per released prisoner. ...
More than three-quarters (77 percent) of released drug offenders were arrested for a non-drug crime within nine years, and more than a third (34 percent) were arrested for a violent crime.
The risk of recidivism is not just a fantasy concocted by law-and-order conservatives — it is very, very real.
But the broader reality is that weak-on-crime political operatives often operate under misleading or disingenuous premises. As Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) pointed out at National Review in the debate leading up to a vote on the White House-supported ""First Step Act"" criminal justice reform jailbreak bill, this ""low-level drug offender""-centric law actually allows for early prison release for a veritable hodgepodge of thugs — everyone from dangerous weapon-wielding robbers to law enforcement officer assaulters to violent carjackers to traffickers of fentanyl, a narcotic so potent that a sugar packet-sized dose could kill a whole room. The general profiles of these miscreants would more readily resemble MS-13 brutes than they would the ""low-level drug offenders"" that the weak-on-crime sycophants would have you believe are the true target of ""reform.""
Far from having a general over-incarceration problem, the United States in the year 2019 actually has an under -incarceration problem — especially for violent criminals and mid-high level drug traffickers. As Sen. Cotton argued in 2016, the actual percentage of violent criminals even arrested — let alone prosecuted and subsequently convicted — is harrowingly low: ""Law enforcement is able to arrest or identify a likely perpetrator for only 19 percent of property crimes and 47 percent of violent crimes. If anything, we have an under-incarceration problem."" Indeed, according to 2017 FBI Uniform Crime Reporting statistics , the number of cases uncleared by law enforcement in a given year is astonishing: 6,013 murder cases, 79,310 rape cases, 206,091 robbery cases, and 349,190 aggravated assault cases in 2017 alone.
The good news, from a broader perspective, is that crime in America has indeed dramatically plummeted over the past few decades. According to Pew , citing FBI statistics, violent crime fell 49% between 1993 and 2017. That is outstanding news and ought to be applauded. But as Pew also notes , violent crime actually recently rose from 2014–2016. Furthermore, BJS's 2017 National Crime Victimization Survey showed a ""statistically significant increase"" in violent crime victims from 2015–2017.
Distressingly, this recent increase in violent crime has coincided with a continued hollowing out of America's prison population. As psychology professors Keith Humphreys and Richard Lane observed in April, in focusing solely upon the black subset of our prison population, ""the African American male imprisonment rate has dropped by a third since its peak and is now at a level not seen since 1991. African American women’s rate of imprisonment has dropped 57 percent from its peak and is now at a 30-year low."" Amazingly, Pew actually noted last year that America's total incarcerated population is now at a two decade -low :
At the end of 2016, there were about 2.2 million people behind bars in the U.S., including 1.5 million under the jurisdiction of federal and state prisons and roughly 741,000 in the custody of locally run jails. That amounts to a nationwide incarceration rate of 860 prison or jail inmates for every 100,000 adults ages 18 and older.
The nation’s incarceration rate peaked at 1,000 inmates per 100,000 adults during the three-year period between 2006 and 2008. It has declined every year since then and is now at its lowest point since 1996, when there were 830 inmates per 100,000 adults.
The generally tough-on-crime policies of the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton presidencies blessed this country with decades of relative tranquility. Why on earth would we risk throwing that away to satisfy law enforcement officer assaulters and MS-13 fentanyl traffickers? Why on earth would we now be further hollowing out the nation's prison population, amidst a two-decade low in the prison population and recent increases, contrary to the longstanding trend, of increased violent crime?
On the contrary, now is the time to double down on giving law enforcement the resources they need to arrest more violent criminals and on giving prosecutors the resources they need to charge and ultimately convict more violent criminals. There are far, far too many violent criminals and drug traffickers who get off scot-free.
Now is not the time to be hoodwinked by perhaps well-intentioned, but nonetheless naive, promoters of the weak-on-crime and jailbreak agenda. And as for President Donald Trump, he should stop appeasing weak-on-crime libertarians within his White House and quickly retreat to his 2016 campaign-era rhetoric on drugs and crime. He had it right back then. This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou — Donald J.

Parents Of Baby Charlie Gard Get Backing For 'Charlie's Law' After Son's Death | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48435/charlies-law-parents-baby-charlie-gard-getting-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Parents Of Baby Charlie Gard Get Backing For 'Charlie's Law' After Son's Death Photo by Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
The parents of baby Charlie Gard have received critical backing for a law pushing for parental rights of sick children. Charlie’s Law was inspired by the tragic ordeal parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard went through in 2017 when courts ordered the couple to bypass possibly life-saving experimental treatment for their infant son, instead being forced to watch baby Charlie die in a London hospital.
“If the proposal is backed by Parliament, the parents of sick children who disagree with doctors on life-and-death decisions will have more rights over treatment,” reported The Daily Mail on Thursday. The law would reportedly have a “significant harm” test, meaning parents would have the right to seek treatment for their sick child at other hospitals as long as it wouldn’t cause the child “significant harm.”
“Charlie’s tragic death on 28th July 2017 exposed the limitations of current processes available to parents, doctors and the NHS in efforts to ensure the best outcomes for seriously ill children,” outlines the Charlie Gard Foundation, which was set up by Gard and Yates in the wake of Charlie’s death. “Charlie’s fight highlighted an urgent need for changes in the law, policy and legal and health practice to support families, as well as medical and legal professionals involved in what are deeply emotive, difficult and life-changing circumstances.”
Charlie’s Law has received backing from “prominent peers, doctors and lawyers,” The Daily Mail reported. “This has my full support and that of many colleagues from all sides of the House,” former president of the British Medical Association Baroness Hollins said, per Gard.
As previously covered by The Daily Wire, baby Charlie suffered from a rare condition known as encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Though Gard and Yates raised a stunning $1.6 million on their own to pursue experimental but potentially life-saving treatment in the United States, court rulings decided it was in the baby's best interest to remain at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London to die.
The clear government overreach surrounding Charlie's case sparked reactions across the globe, including President Donald Trump and Pope Francis offering support for the Gard family.
""Our beautiful little boy has gone, we are so proud of you Charlie,” the couple announced in a heart-wrenching social media post on July 28, 2017. Charlie was just a week shy of his first birthday.
“I have been contacted by dozens of parents who cannot agree with doctors over the treatment for their sick children. They quickly find themselves locked in painful disputes, some of which end up in court,” Yates said, according to The Daily Mail. “Charlie’s Law would put a stop to this. These situations are bad for doctors, bad for parents and bad for the reputation of the NHS.”
Gard added, “In Charlie’s final hours, I made some promises to him, ones I will never break, and among them was that we would go on fighting in Charlie’s name to help other children. This would be Charlie’s legacy and I wanted him to know it.”"

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced on Thursday that she will be stepping away at the end of the month, inspiring much speculation on who will take on the challenge of taking on the media on Trump's behalf — and opening the door for the mainstream media, with whom she's frequently exchanged barbs, to take some parting shots. On his radio program Friday, Rush Limbaugh blasted the media for its ""despicable"" treatment of Sanders, as highlighted by their response to the announcement of her departure.
""I love the job she does. She is perfect for that job,"" said Rush (transcript via RushLimbaugh.com ). ""One of the best things that Sarah Sanders has done, aside from her daily conduct of the job, one of the best things she’s done is end and eliminate the daily White House press briefing, because you know what that became under Trump? It wasn’t a press briefing. ...The White House press briefing became an audition for various members of the Drive-By Media to make fools of themselves in order to stand out and get noticed. Exhibit A: Jim Acosta of CNN. It was just an opportunity to humiliate, embarrass, misbehave.""
Of all the reporters at the White House, the exchanges between Sanders and Acosta have made the most news, as The Daily Wire has chronicled .
Limbaugh pointed out that Trump is constantly blasted for his ""unacceptable"" behavior, but then pointed to the media's treatment of Sanders as evidence of their hypocrisy. ""What the hell would you describe the media’s behavior every day toward Trump or toward Sarah Sanders as? Is that representative of Washington values?"" he asked.
He then cued a montage of media personalities working in needless jabs on Sanders in their coverage of her announcement:
ERIN BURNETT: (dramatic music) Trump’s most loyal defender, Sarah Sanders, is leaving. (pause) Can she get her credibility back?
JIM ACOSTA: (outdoor noise) She fell short of her duty to the American people.
PAULA REID: (voice over) The White House briefing effectively died on her watch.
PAMELA BROWN: (outdoor noise) … accused of not being truthful.
MATT MILLER: I hope that she’s not able to escape this White House without, kind of, the shame and stigma following her.
ANDERSON COOPER: Who gets out of the Trump White House alive — you know, with their reputation intact? (Snort!)
AMANDA CARPENTER: She’s been exposed for the fraud that she is.
JACKIE KUCINICH: She’ll go down as someone who is very loyal to the president and not very loyal to the truth.
JOE LOCKHART: … failure on the most important parts of the job, as a liar.
NICOLLE WALLACE: She was a liar. It’s in the Mueller report.
DON LEMON: Sarah Sanders lied again and again and again.
DAVID GERGEN: Sarah Sanders has opened the door to massive amount of lying.
APRIL RYAN: She suffers from lie-abetes. Her tenure has been fraught with sex, lies, and videotape. She’s lied, lied, lied, lied, lied.
""'Lied, lied, lied…'"" Limbaugh said, imitating April Ryan. ""You, you will not find that kind of reaction to an outgoing White House press secretary anywhere else ever. Not a single one.""
After playing a clip of Trump praising Sanders on Thursday for doing ""an incredible job"" and being both ""tough"" and ""good,"" Rush stressed that he agrees.
""She was exceptional at this job,"" he said. ""She was a pit bull in their faces, had answers, and made them look like the children they are. She had this unique talent to make them look bad. She didn’t cower. She didn’t play the game. She called them out when they were grandstanding in order to call attention to themselves, and that’s why they don’t like her. They don’t like her because she was effective. They don’t like her because she was loyal to Trump."""
New York Ends Religious Exemptions For Vaccine Mandates,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48438/new-york-ends-religious-exemptions-vaccine-amanda-prestigiacomo,"New York Ends Religious Exemptions For Vaccine Mandates Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
On Thursday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed a bill into law that will immediately end religious exemptions for vaccine mandates.
Cuomo said he signed the bill in order to protect the public in the midst of one of the worst measles outbreak in decades, which he categorized as a “public health crisis,” reported CBS New York.
The outbreak first sparked in October, the outlet noted, and spread in parts of New York City, particularly among Orthodox Jewish communities.
“Rockland County declared a countywide State of Emergency relating to the ongoing measles outbreak,"" reported NBC in March. ""Effective at the stroke of midnight, Wednesday, anyone who is under 18 years of age and unvaccinated against the measles will be barred from public places until this declaration expires in 30 days or until they receive the MMR vaccination.”
With the passing of the law, parents will be forced to vaccinate their children before they can attend school in the state, and religious exemptions won’t get them out of it. Parents and teens have morally objected to certain vaccines based upon ties to abortion. Now, the only acceptable exemptions from the mandate will be for medical reasons, such as a child’s weakened immune system.
While opponents of the legislation protested in Assembly chambers on Thursday, sponsors of the bill praised its passing as a measure of protection for children.
“If your kid is immunocompromised and going to school or a day care center, you want to know that they’re going to be safe,” said State Sen. Brad Hoylman, a sponsor of the legislation, according to CBS New York.
“It’s our obligation to act,” State Sen. David Carlucci said. “We have to do everything we can to get the number of people vaccinated up.”
“The government does not have the right to interfere with my personal religious beliefs,” said one woman protesting the law. “We will not vaccinate. What’s going to happen is we’re going to either home school or we’re going to move out of state.”
Assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein, a Democrat, noted that he is pro-vaccine but could not vote for the bill out of “constitutional duty.”
“Despite my pro-vaccination stance and despite my beliefs that there are no religious restrictions, it is my constitutional duty to vote in the negative,” he said.
California is headed the way of New York when it comes to vaccines via SB 276. Actress Jessica Biel sparked debate over vaccines earlier this week when she met with some 15 California legislators to discuss her concerns about the bill and advocate for parental rights.
Biel said she is ""not against vaccinations"" but supports ""families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.”
""This week I went to Sacramento to talk to legislators in California about a proposed bill,” she wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday. “I am not against vaccinations — I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.”
“My concern with #SB277 is solely regarding medical exemptions. My dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family’s ability to care for their child in this state,” the post continued. “That’s why I spoke to legislators and argued against this bill. Not because I don’t believe in vaccinations, but because I believe in giving doctors and the families they treat the ability to decide what’s best for their patients and the ability to provide that treatment.”
Proponents of vaccination mandates claim SB 276 “will have minimal impact on those with valid reasons for exemption, citing medical authorities like the bill’s prominent co-sponsors: the California Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, California,” The Daily Beast reported .
As reported by The Daily Wire in April, a judge told a Catholic teenager from Kentucky, Jerome Kunkel, that he is not allowed back in school after morally objecting to receiving a vaccination for the chicken pox due to its apparent ties to abortion.
”It’s my understanding that the vaccine is derived from aborted fetal cells,” said Kunkel, according to WLWT. ""And it is against my religion. Abortion is against my religion.”
As noted by KHN Morning Briefing, ""The Varicella vaccine, specifically, is derived from the cell lines of two fetuses that were electively aborted in the 1960s."""
WATCH: Brian Kilmeade And Sean Hannity Argue Over Trump’s Foreign Intel Remarks On ‘Fox & Friends’,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48439/watch-brian-kilmeade-and-sean-hannity-argue-over-frank-camp,"June 14, 2019 views
On Thursday, Sean Hannity appeared on ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss the ongoing controversy surrounding President Trump’s comments regarding listening to foreign intel on his opponents.
After playing a sound bite from the president’s interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, co-host Brian Kilmeade had the following exchange with Hannity:
KILMEADE: Is the president right or wrong on that?
HANNITY: This was the greatest setup that Donald Trump has ever made because all, you know, I call them the media mob ... they've lied to us for two years – conspiracy theories, hoax. So, Donald Trump, if you're outraged in the media over that, ""Well, I might want to listen."" ""Listen"" is what he said, [and] maybe report to the FBI. If you’re outraged over that, how could you not be outraged [that] Hillary Clinton literally empowered a foreign agent who produced a dossier full of Russian lies that was used to infiltrate our electoral process, first by influencing the American people, but more importantly...
KILMEADE: Using a British spy.
HANNITY: They used the British foreign national ... it's full of Russian lies. It was never verified. They used it then to spy on Americans and hence Carter Page, they got into the Trump campaign.
At this point, co-host Steve Doocy jumped in: ""So are you saying, what's the difference?""
Hannity replied:
No, I'm saying that it's far worse what Hillary Clinton did, and they show no outrage in this fake media environment we live in. And Trump – if you got outraged over him saying ""I'll listen and maybe tell the FBI,"" why didn’t you get outraged about the woman that paid for the Russian lies and used it as a means of trying to destroy Donald Trump and steal the election.
Kilmeade didn’t appear to be satisfied with Hannity’s answer, leading him to push further:
Would you also say, Sean, that the better answer for the president would have been, ""Listen, I'm not taking Russian or Chinese or any outside influence because I don't need it...""
This led to the following exchange:
HANNITY: What is wrong with listening to what they have to say?
KILMEADE: I don't think you should be listening to what China has to say about your opponent.
HANNITY: Oh really? Why not? What about Norway?
KILMEADE: That’s a foreign – you want them playing a role?
HANNITY: When you listen you might learn something, or you might learn something that you share with the FBI, as the president said. And I'm a believer – look, if I ever was the president in the United States, I’d talked to Putin. I know he's a hostile actor. I’d talk to the Iranians. I wouldn't give them $150 billion like Biden and Obama, but I’d talk to them and probably tell them, ""If you ever make the wrong move, this is what's gonna happen.""
KILMEADE: If they said, ""Hey, I know you're running against John Kerry, and let me just tell you what John Kerry did.""
HANNITY: Okay. Is it true or false? And you have to determine if it's true or false. If it's true, boom, you just got a big favor.
KILMEADE: Is that okay?
HANNITY: Sure it's okay! When did talking go wrong?
Hannity then returned to Hillary Clinton, and the infamous Steele dossier. After Hannity wrapped up his reply to Kilmeade’s question, the hosts moved on to other subjects.
In a Wednesday-aired interview with President Trump, ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos asked the president if he would accept foreign oppo research on his eventual 2020 opponent:
STEPHANOPOULOS: Your campaign this time around, if foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on opponents, should they accept it or should they call the FBI?
TRUMP: I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don’t- There’s nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country — Norway — ""We have information on your opponent."" Oh. I think I’d want to hear it.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You want that kind of interference in our elections?
TRUMP: It’s not interference. They have information. I think I’d take it. If I thought there was something wrong, I’d go maybe to the FBI, if I thought there was something wrong. But when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, they come up with oppo research. ""Oh, let’s call the FBI."" The FBI doesn’t have enough agents to take care of it. When you go and talk, honestly, to congressmen, they all do it. They always have, and that’s the way it is. It’s called oppo research.
On Friday, the president attempted to walk back his remarks during a call-in to ""Fox & Friends,"" saying:
First of all, I don’t think anybody would present me with anything bad because they know how much I love this country. Nobody’s gonna present me with anything bad. Number two, if I was — and of course, you have to look at it, because if you don't look at it, you’re not gonna know if it’s bad. How are you gonna know if it’s bad? But of course, you give it to the FBI or report to the attorney general or somebody like that. But of course you do that — you couldn't have that happen with our country, and everybody understands that and I thought it was made clear.
The president then spoke about his numerous interactions with foreign leaders, asking about what he should do if someone like the president of France says he doesn’t like one of Trump’s political opponents. ""Am I supposed to report him to the FBI?"""
Chicago Cardinal Cupich Will Allow Pro-Abortion Politicians To Receive Holy Communion,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48444/chicago-cardinal-cupich-will-allow-pro-abortion-paul-bois,"Chicago Cardinal Cupich Will Allow Pro-Abortion Politicians To Receive Holy Communion ""I think it would be counterproductive to impose sanctions"" Franco Origlia / Contributor / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich will allow Illinois state politicians who helped pass a law guaranteeing women the right to abortion to receive what Catholics believe to be the body and blood of Jesus Christ in the form of Holy Communion.
Speaking with Catholic News Agency , Cupich said that barring pro-abortion Catholic politicians from receiving Holy Communion would be ""counterproductive.""
""I think it would be counterproductive to impose sanctions, simply because they don’t change anybody’s minds, but it also takes away from the fact that an elected official has to deal with the judgment seat of God, not just the judgment seat of a bishop. I think that’s much more powerful,” Cupich told CNA. ""I have always approached the issue saying that the bishop’s primary responsibility is to teach, and I will continue to do that.""
Senate Bill 25 — a.k.a., the ""Reproductive Health Act"" — passed the Illinois State Senate by a 34-20 vote and essentially guarantees that the state will enshrine abortion rights into law should Roe v. Wade be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. It even expressly states that the ""fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights."" Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the bill into law this past Wednesday.
According to Catholic Canon Law 915 , people who publicly express grave sin are not to be admitted to Holy Communion. The Catholic Church has always taught abortion to be intrinsically evil and that people who either procure or support the practice are in grave error that can only be reconciled through the sacrament of Confession.
Cardinal Cupich did, however, tell Catholic News Agency that the ""Reproductive Health Act"" is ""pernicious"" by denying the humanity of the unborn child.
""What’s pernicious about this law, and what’s so very difficult, is that it says that the unborn child has absolutely no claim on rights,"" Cupich said. ""It says that human life is cheap. That’s the message that we send—that human life is cheap in the State of Illinois.""
Cardinal Cupich's decision to give pro-abortion politicians Holy Communion stands in direct contrast to another bishop in Illinois – Bishop Thomas John Paprocki of Springfield, who expressly forbid all priests under his governance to give Holy Communion to politicians that supported the ""Reproductive Health Act.""
""In accord with canon 915 of the Code of Canon Law … Illinois Senate President John Cullerton and Speaker of the House Michael J. Madigan, who facilitated the passage of the Act Concerning Abortion of 2017 (House Bill 40) as well as the Reproductive Health Act of 2019 (Senate Bill 25), are not to be admitted to Holy Communion in the Diocese of Springfield in Illinois because they have obstinately persisted in promoting the abominable crime and very grave sin of abortion as evidenced by the influence they exerted in their leadership roles and their repeated votes and obdurate public support for abortion rights over an extended period of time,"" Paprocki wrote in a statement.
In 2017, the American Catholic hierarchy elected Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann to head the U.S. Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities, who expressly stated that bishops should bar pro-abortion politicians from receiving Holy Communion."
Discovery Family Show ‘My Little Pony’ To Introduce Lesbian Couple,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48446/discovery-family-show-my-little-pony-introduce-paul-bois,"Discovery Family Show ‘My Little Pony’ To Introduce Lesbian Couple Aunt Holiday and Auntie Lofty Albert L. Ortega / Contributor / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
LGBT pride will be coming to the Discovery Family show ""My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic"" this weekend in an episode that will feature a lesbian couple.
According to HuffPost , the episode will air Saturday and introduce the characters Aunt Holiday and Auntie Lofty, who both take care of the character Scootaloo.
""The characters previously appeared in the 2017 book ' Ponyville Mysteries: Riddle of the Rusty Horseshoe ,' but this will be their first appearance on the Discovery Family series, a reboot of the Hasbro 1980s original,"" reports the outlet. ""One of the series’ writers, Michael Vogel, pointed out the perfect timing of the episode’s June 15 air date."" Hey hey!!! @NicoleDubuc , @joshhaber and I doin what we can to bring more EQuality to EQuestria!! #PrideMonth https://t.co/YPOvvxT3v0 — mktoon (@mktoon) June 10, 2019
Speaking to BuzzFeed , the openly gay Vogel said that diversity and representation is always ""my first priority on everything I work on.""
""Diversity and representation are important for kids for so many reasons, and it’s my first priority on everything I work on,"" he said. ""'My Little Pony' has always been about friendship and accepting people (or ponies) that are different from you. So it just felt like something important to do.""
""Nicole and I thought this was a great opportunity to organically introduce an LGBTQ couple in the series, and we asked Hasbro and they approved it. With Josh and Nicole running the final season together, it was something we all wanted to do — bring this out couple into the final season and make them ‘officially’ a part of the MLP world.""
The inclusion of LGBT characters on ""My Little Pony"" follows the PBS Kids show ""Arthur"" featuring a prominent character in a same-sex marriage , which earned the praise of multiple LGBTQ organizations while alienating conservatives.
""PBS Kids programs are designed to reflect the diversity of communities across the nation,"" the public network said in a statement at the time. ""We believe it is important to represent the wide array of adults in the lives of children who look to PBS Kids every day.""
The episode featured Arthur's teacher, Mr. Ratburn , tying the knot with his same-sex partner. Alabama public television chose to ban the episode from airing and play a re-run of the program. APT’s director of programming, Mike Mckenzie, said the station thought the episode would violate parent trust.
""Parents have trusted Alabama Public Television for more than 50 years to provide children’s programs that entertain, educate and inspire,” Mckenzie said. ""More importantly – although we strongly encourage parents to watch television with their children and talk about what they have learned afterwards – parents trust that their children can watch APT without their supervision. We also know that children who are younger than the ‘target’ audience for Arthur also watch the program. The vast majority of parents will not have heard about the content, whether they agree with it or not. Because of this, we felt it would be a violation of trust to broadcast the episode.""
HuffPost reports that Hulu will be breaking barriers with the upcoming debut of "" The Bravest Knight ,"" which tells the story of ""Sir Cedric and Prince Andrew, an interracial couple raising an adopted daughter, Nia."""
"More New Yorkers Like Donald Trump Than NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio, Poll Finds | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48453/more-new-yorkers-donald-trump-nyc-mayor-bill-de-ashe-schow,"More New Yorkers Like Donald Trump Than NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio, Poll Finds Scott Olson/Getty
In a somewhat unexpected turn, President Donald Trump has a higher favorable rating in New York than New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
A Sienna College poll from last week found that 29% of New Yorkers polled had a favorable of de Blasio, while 34% had a favorable view of Trump.
While these numbers seem good or at least interesting for the current president, his unfavorable rating in the state is not. De Blasio had a 53% unfavorability rating, up from 50% in April, according to The New York Post . Trump, meanwhile, holds a 63% unfavorability rating, up from 59% in April.
Further, the poll found that even though New Yorkers don’t like de Blasio, they would still vote for him over Trump, 48% to 36%, in a head-to-head election. The most popular of the New York politicians currently running for president (or re-election) is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who, despite taking three months to qualify for the first debate and not even registering on many polls, has a 44% favorability rating in the Empire State.
Gillibrand would also beat Trump if the election were held today, 58% to 34%.
“New York Democrats strongly prefer the hometown senator over the hometown mayor. Gillibrand would easily best de Blasio in every region of the state, including New York City, where she beats him 56-29 percent,” Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in a statement about the poll. “Blue New York shows no interest in supporting the incumbent Republican President for re-election.”
And that’s the big takeaway. It’s certainly interesting that New Yorkers gave Trump a higher favorability rating than de Blasio (probably because much of New York outside of the Big Apple is actually red) he would still lose the state to whichever Democrat wins the primary. And that was never going to change.
New York is a Deep Blue state. The population centered in New York City makes it so. Trump was never going to win the state or even come close to doing so.
This poll also does nothing for de Blasio nationally. He was already polling around 0, so the fact that people in his own home state don’t like him all that much wasn’t going to hurt his chances any more. A recent poll from Iowa, the first primary state, found that de Blasio was absolutely no one’s first or second choice for president from the massive list of Democrats running in the primary. De Blasio and Miramar, FL, Mayor Wayne Messam were the only two that received no first- or second-choice votes. It was a pretty stunning feat for de Blasio, since the mayor of New York City tends to have pretty decent name recognition. Few people outside of that area in Florida have heard of Messam.
It must be embarrassing for the Democratic candidates who typically get so much media coverage – such as de Blasio or Gillibrand – to be doing so poorly in the Democratic Party primary."
Arrest Made In Connection With Shooting Death Of Former Arkansas State Senator | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48454/arrest-made-connection-shooting-death-former-ashe-schow,"Arrest Made In Connection With Shooting Death Of Former Arkansas State Senator Caspar Benson/Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
Former Arkansas State Sen. Linda Collins-Smith, a Republican, was shot and killed in early June. Her body was discovered on June 4. Her death was immediately treated as “suspicious” and investigated as a homicide. Now, an arrest has been made in relation to her death.
Fox News reported that former campaign staffer Rebecca Lynn O’Donnell, 48, had been identified as the suspect. Arkansas State Police told the outlet criminal charges were pending, but wouldn’t say whether other suspects had been identified or were being sought.
KTHV-TV reported O’Donnell’s connection to Collins-Smith’s last campaign. Ken Yang, former communications director for Collins-Smith, told the outlet that O’Donnell had worked on the former state senators last campaign and that the two were friends.
NBC-affiliate KARK published a statement from Collins-Smith’s family released Friday evening:
This evening, our family received the news that an arrest was made in connection to the ongoing investigation. We are sickened and upset that someone so close to Linda, would be involved in such a terrible, heartless crime. The family is confident that the Randolph County Sheriff's Department and the Arkansas State Police will continue to work diligently to bring justice to this case. We would like to thank everyone for the continued prayers and thoughts for our family during this difficult time.
No motive has been suggested, and a photo of the two women smiling together has been making the rounds online. KARK reported that O’Donnell made the photo her profile picture “days after the homicide.”
Arkansas police have told multiple outlets that the investigation is still ongoing and no further information is available.
The Daily Wire previously reported that Collins-Smith served one term in the Arkansas state senate. She was elected in 2014 but primaried in 2018 and lost. Still, the Arkansas Republican Party and Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a fellow Republican, remembered her fondly.
“It's an incredible loss of a human life who's served the public and an office and that has continued to be engaged in public affairs but she's also a family person and it's just a great loss. So, we express our sympathies there and we're awaiting more details in the state police investigation,"" Hutchinson told “KARK 4 Today” after Collins-Smith’s death.
The Arkansas GOP offered its own condolences on Twitter:
Today, we learned of the untimely death of former Senator Linda Collins Smith. She was a passionate voice for her people and a close member of our Republican family. We are praying for her loved ones during this difficult time.
The day after Collins-Smith was discovered, another former Republican state senator – Jonathan Nichols of Oklahoma – was also discovered dead from a gunshot wound.
The deaths were completely unrelated and there is no new information on the events surrounding Nichols’ death."
Bill de Blasio: Trump Saying He Would Listen To Foreign Government Dirt On Opponent is ‘Openly Treasonous’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48457/bill-de-blasio-trump-saying-he-would-listen-ashe-schow,"June 15, 2019 views
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday criticized President Donald Trump’s statement that he would listen to opposition research about an opponent from a foreign country.
De Blasio, who is trying to run for president in a crowded Democratic field, told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” hosts that Trump’s acceptance of foreign information was “openly treasonous.”
The Associated Press reported de Blasio said Trump’s comments were “the last straw,” and that Congress should open an impeachment inquiry. He claimed Trump’s answer to a question from ABC amounted to an open invitation for foreign government “interference in our election.”
De Blasio is struggling to even register in may Democrat primary polls. He currently is tied for last in the Real Clear Politics polling average – at 0.3% - with Reps. John Delaney of Maryland, Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Eric Swalwell of California, and new-age author and activist Marianne Williamson.
In an interview with former advisor to President Bill Clinton and ABC host George Stephanopoulos, Trump said he wouldn’t immediately call the FBI if a foreign government offered dirt on his opponent.
It's not an interference. They have information. I think I'd take it. If I thought there was something wrong, I'd go maybe to the FBI, if I thought there was something wrong,"" Trump said .
""I think I'd want to hear it ... I think you might want to listen, there isn't anything wrong with listening,"" he added, calling the information “opposition research.”
He added: “If somebody called from a country — Norway — ‘we have information on your opponent' — oh, I think I'd want to hear it.”
Naturally, Trump’s opponents went nuts. While they had a good reason to worry about whether the president would accept foreign intelligence to use against an opponent, they completely missed that their outrage was completely partisan.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report found that the Trump campaign did not work with a foreign government to dig up dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Clinton and her campaign, however, are a different story. Not only did the Clinton campaign pay law firm Perkins Coie to hire opposition law firm Fusion GPS to pay ex-British Intelligence agent Christopher Steele to use his Russian sources to create an uncorroborated and largely debunked dossier full of dirt on Trump, they concealed their payment to avoid federal finance reporting laws.
In 2017, Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) asked then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the violation.
“It seems to me that a presidential campaign using a law firm as a conduit to pay for activities with which the campaign itself doesn’t want to be associated is more than just dirty politics, it’s also quite possibly illegal,” Chabot said. “To me it seems that it’s at least a violation of campaign finance laws and a failure to accurately disclose the actual recipients of campaign disbursements. However, this type of arrangement is not illegal – if it’s not illegal under current law – I fear we’re risking opening Pandora’s Box with all sorts of underhanded activities by campaigns being laundered through law firms and being shielded by attorney-client privilege.”
Chabot then asked for Sessions’ thoughts on the matter. Sessions said he couldn’t comment without looking into the specific details of the allegation."
Trump Endorses Amendment That Would Let Congress Prohibit Flag Burning,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,06-16-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48461/trump-endorses-congressmens-amendment-would-frank-camp,"Trump Endorses Amendment That Would Let Congress Prohibit Flag Burning Photo by Ioannis Alexopoulos/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
On Friday, Rep. Steve Womack (R-AR) and Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) ""introduced a Constitutional Amendment to give Congress the authority to prohibit burning the American flag,"" according to Daines’ official website .
H.J. Res. 65 reads (emphasis added):
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), that the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years after the date of its submission for ratification...
The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.
Both Rep. Womack and Sen. Daines issued press releases regarding the proposed amendment.
Womack stated:
Our flag is more than a cloth painted red, white, and blue. It is a symbol of worldwide freedom, unity, and liberty. It has guided troops into battle, flown during our triumphs and challenges, and is placed over the caskets of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Generations have fought to defend our stars and stripes – and the American people have simply given too much for the flag to not have the ability to protect it.
Daines made a similar comment, adding that ""our nation should always render the flag the honor and dignity it is due.""
Several veterans organizations have endorsed the proposal, including the American Legion of Montana and the Department of Montana Veterans of Foreign Wars.
On Saturday, President Trump offered a full-throated endorsement, tweeting: All in for Senator Steve Daines as he proposes an Amendment for a strong BAN on burning our American Flag. A no brainer! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2019
All in for Senator Steve Daines as he proposes an Amendment for a strong BAN on burning our American Flag. A no brainer!
Although the tweet has approximately 70,000 ""likes"" as of publication, numerous Twitter users excoriated the president for his support of the proposed amendment.
Jeffery Guterman, a psychologist and self-described ""ardent critic"" of Trump, linked a clip from a 2012 interview in which the late-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stated that flag burning was indeed a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment: Even Scalia disagrees with prohibiting burning the flag. pic.twitter.com/VcOn4Zn4ki — Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) June 15, 2019
If I were king, I would not allow people to go about burning the American flag. However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged — and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government. That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress. Burning the flag is a form of expression. Speech doesn’t just mean written words or oral words — [it could] be semaphore. Burning a flag is a symbol that expresses an idea. I hate the government; the government is unjust; whatever.
In 1989’s Texas v. Johnson and 1990’s U.S. v. Eichman , SCOTUS ruled that flag burning falls under the umbrella of free speech.
In the majority opinion for Texas v. Johnson , Justice Brennan wrote :
We can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag than waving one's own, no better way to counter a flag burner's message than by saluting the flag that burns, no surer means of preserving the dignity even of the flag that burned than by – as one witness here did – according its remains a respectful burial. We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote :
Our colleagues in dissent advance powerful arguments why respondent may be convicted for his expression, reminding us that among those who will be dismayed by our holding will be some who have had the singular honor of carrying the flag in battle. And I agree that the flag holds a lonely place of honor in an age when absolutes are distrusted and simple truths are burdened by unneeded apologetics.
With all respect to those views, I do not believe the Constitution gives us the right to rule as the dissenting Members of the Court urge, however painful this judgment is to announce. Though symbols often are what we ourselves make of them, the flag is constant in expressing beliefs Americans share, beliefs in law and peace and that freedom which sustains the human spirit. The case here today forces recognition of the costs to which those beliefs commit us. It is poignant but fundamental that the flag protects those who hold it in contempt.
For all the record shows, this respondent was not a philosopher and perhaps did not even possess the ability to comprehend how repellent his statements must be to the Republic itself. But whether or not he could appreciate the enormity of the offense he gave, the fact remains that his acts were speech, in both the technical and the fundamental meaning of the Constitution.
The Daily Wire reached out to Rep. Womack and Sen. Daines for clarification, but as of publication, we have not received a reply."

Not only did the Clinton campaign pay law firm Perkins Coie to hire opposition law firm Fusion GPS to pay ex-British Intelligence agent Christopher Steele to use his Russian sources to create an uncorroborated and largely debunked dossier full of dirt on Trump, they concealed their payment to avoid federal finance reporting laws.
In 2017, Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) asked then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the violation.
“It seems to me that a presidential campaign using a law firm as a conduit to pay for activities with which the campaign itself doesn’t want to be associated is more than just dirty politics, it’s also quite possibly illegal,” Chabot said. “To me it seems that it’s at least a violation of campaign finance laws and a failure to accurately disclose the actual recipients of campaign disbursements. However, this type of arrangement is not illegal — if it’s not illegal under current law — I fear we’re risking opening Pandora’s Box with all sorts of underhanded activities by campaigns being laundered through law firms and being shielded by attorney-client privilege.”
Chabot then asked for Sessions’ thoughts on the matter. Sessions said he couldn’t comment without looking into the specific details of the allegation."
WILLIAMS: How To Create Conflict,www.dailywire.com,Walter E. Williams,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48452/williams-how-create-conflict-walter-e-williams,"WILLIAMS: How To Create Conflict Photo By: Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
We are living in a time of increasing domestic tension. Some of it stems from the presidency of Donald Trump. Another part of it is various advocacy groups on both sides of the political spectrum demanding one cause or another. But nearly totally ignored is how growing government control over our lives, along with the betrayal of constitutional principles, contributes the most to domestic tension. Let's look at a few examples.
Think about primary and secondary schooling. I think that every parent has the right to decide whether his child will recite a morning prayer in school. Similarly, every parent has the right to decide that his child will not recite a morning prayer. The same can be said about the Pledge of Allegiance to our flag, sex education and other hot-button issues in education. These become contentious issues because schools are owned by the government.
In the case of prayers, there will either be prayers or no prayers in school. It's a political decision whether prayers will be permitted or not, and parent groups with strong preferences will organize to fight one another. A win for one parent means a loss for another parent. The losing parent will be forced to either concede or muster up private school tuition while continuing to pay taxes for a school for which he has no use. Such a conflict would not arise if education were not government-produced but only government-financed, say through education vouchers. Parents with different preferences could have their wishes fulfilled by enrolling their child in a private school of their choice. Instead of being enemies, parents with different preferences could be friends.
People also have strong preferences for goods and services. Some of us have strong preferences for white wine and distaste for reds while others have the opposite preference — strong preferences for red wine. Some of us love classical music while others love rock and roll music. Some of us love Mercedes-Benz while others love Lincoln Continentals. When's the last time you heard red wine drinkers in conflict with white wine drinkers? Have you ever seen classical music lovers organizing against rock and roll lovers or Mercedes-Benz lovers in conflict with Lincoln Continental lovers?
People have strong preferences for these goods just as much as they may have strong preference for schooling. It's a rare occasion, if ever, that one sees the kind of conflict between wine, music and automobile lovers that we see about schooling issues. Why? While government allocation of resources is a zero-sum game — one person's win is another's loss — market allocation is not. Market allocation is a positive-sum game where everybody wins. Lovers of red wine, classical music and Mercedes-Benz get what they want while lovers of white wine, rock and roll music and Lincoln Continentals get what they want. Instead of fighting one another, they can live in peace and maybe be friends.
It would be easy to create conflict among these people. Instead of market allocation, have government, through a democratic majority-rule process, decide what wines, music and cars would be produced. If that were done, I guarantee that red wine lovers would organize against white wine lovers, classical music lovers against rock and roll lovers and Mercedes-Benz lovers against Lincoln Continental lovers.
Conflict would emerge solely because the decision was made in the political arena. Again, the prime feature of political decision-making is that it's a zero-sum game. One person's win is of necessity another person's loss. If red wine lovers win, white wine lovers would lose. As such, political allocation of resources enhances conflict while market allocation reduces conflict. The greater the number of decisions made in the political arena, the greater the potential for conflict. That's the main benefit of limited government.
Unfortunately, too many Americans want government to grow and have more power over our lives. That means conflict among us is going to rise.

Disgraced Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Says Now Is The Time To Try To Impeach Trump,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48456/disgraced-former-fbi-deputy-director-andrew-mccabe-ashe-schow,"DailyWire.com Disgraced Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Says Now Is The Time To Try To Impeach Trump Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images; Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
After a leading question from CNN host Chris Cuomo, fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said now is “absolutely” the time to start impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.
McCabe made the statement after being asked by Cuomo, “Do you believe that an impeachment inquiry is warranted based on what you understand and what has come out of the Mueller report?""
McCabe, who wrote a memoir trashing Trump and defending the FBI, immediately agreed with Cuomo, saying, “absolutely.”
The Hill reported that McCabe insisted Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report provided enough evidence to impeach Trump, even though the report found no evidence of collusion and made no determinations regarding obstruction of justice. Democrats have fixated on the obstruction claims, even though Mueller’s investigation was supposed to be a counterintelligence investigation, which is done on behalf of the president and therefore cannot be obstructed by the president. Further, since there was no underlying crime, only partisans can argue that Trump was obstructing rather than protesting the false accusations against him.
“I think we are clearly there with the results of the special counsel team,"" McCabe said regarding impeachment. ""There are so many witnesses who could provide important, essential testimony to Congress that can only be done in the scope of an impeachment inquiry.""
McCabe added that “Action should be taken immediately,"" and that it didn’t matter whether such an inquiry led to an actual impeachment.
McCabe was fired 26 hours before he was set to retire from the FBI and collect his full pension. His firing came as the result of an inspector general investigation that found he had leaked information to the media regarding the special counsel investigation and then lied, repeatedly, to investigators about doing so. As The Washington Post wrote at the time:
The report from Inspector General Michael Horowitz is remarkable for its level of detail, casting McCabe as a man who repeatedly lied to investigators and his own boss about his role in a disclosure of information, even while he lashed out at others who he thought might be responsible for leaks.
It accuses McCabe of lying at least four times, three of them under oath, and says that while he had the power to approve disclosures of information to the media, his doing so in this instance violated policy because it was done “in a manner designed to advance his personal interests at the expense of Department leadership.”
It also says McCabe and Comey contradicted one another in their descriptions of how a media disclosure was authorized. While the report favors Comey’s account, it will likely generate tough questions for him as he launches a media blitz to promote his new book .
Since being fired, McCabe has made questionable claims while promoting himself. Earlier this year, he claimed that Department of Justice leaders discussed working with Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Trump’s Cabinet “to remove the president of the United States under the 25 th Amendment.”"
Oberlin Remains Obstinate After Being Fined $33 Million For Supporting Racism Charge Against Bakery,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48455/oberlin-remains-obstinate-after-being-fined-33-ashe-schow,"Oberlin Remains Obstinate After Being Fined $33 Million For Supporting Racism Charge Against Bakery itchySan June 15, 2019 views
On Thursday, Oberlin College was hit with $33 million in punitive damages thanks to Ohio jurors, who agreed the school participated in and encouraged protests defaming a local bakery as racist.
Ohio law capped the punitive damages at $22 million — twice what the jurors charged Oberlin in compensatory damages a week earlier.
As The Daily Wire previously reported , Oberlin’s vice president and general counsel, Donica Thomas Varner, sent a community wide email blasting the jury for its findings, claiming the jurors ignored “clear evidence” that Oberlin was not at fault and insisting the school was being “held liable for the independent actions of their students.”
But school administrators, including interim vice president and dean of students Meredith Raimondo, participated in protests deeming the bakery as racist because a bakery employee held a black Oberlin student accountable for shoplifting and using a fake ID to purchase alcohol.
Oberlin is still remaining obstinate even after being hit with the massive $33 million fine.
The New York Times, while reporting on the punitive damages rewarded to the Gibson family, who own Gibson’s Bakery, included a line from an email sent to the Oberlin community by president Carmen Twillie Ambar, which said, “none of this will sway us from our core values.”
Those “core values” apparently mean supporting students who make false accusations of racism.
The Times also quoted a statement from the college that blamed Gibson’s Bakery for the whole ordeal.
“Gibson bakery’s archaic chase-and-detain policy regarding suspected shoplifters was the catalyst for the protests,” the statement said. “The guilt or innocence of the students is irrelevant to both the root cause of the protests and this litigation.”
Oberlin is essentially saying that the bakery should have just let the shoplifter go in order to adhere to current “woke” theology.
Here’s what happened: A black Oberlin student, Jonathan Aladin, tried to use a fake ID to purchase alcohol from bakery employee Allyn Gibson. Gibson refused to accept the fake ID and noticed two additional bottles of alcohol hidden under Aladin’s shirt. Gibson told Aladin he was calling the cops. Aladin, according to Gibson’s lawsuit against Oberlin, knocked the phone out of Gibson’s hand and ran from the store. Gibson chased after him. When police arrived, Gibson was being physically attacked by Aladin and the two other students who accompanied him to the store — Cecelia Whettstone and Endia Lawrence.
All three students pleaded guilty. Aladin acknowledged race was not a factor in his treatment.
Yet to Oberlin, Gibson is a racist for trying to hold Aladin accountable because he is black.
Jurors saw through Oberlin’s “defense” and hit them with tens of millions of dollars in damages. Oberlin tried to claim it was too poor to pay — a claim that failed to sway jurors.
David French, a senior writer for National Review who has covered campus insanity for years, wrote that the Oberlin trial provided a “blueprint for fighting back.”
“The case represents an important moment — the moment when the American legal establishment learned that it can potentially impose steep costs on institutions that participate in the kind of cruel, malicious, and vicious mob tactics that have become an all-too-familiar part of the American political landscape,” French wrote. “It turns out that the law can indeed offer an answer to the worst forms of illiberal behavior.”
Increasingly over the last half-decade, colleges and universities have gotten away with stepping on the constitutional rights of students, faculty, and outsiders in the name of social justice. Jurors in Ohio just provided a big check on whether such behavior is acceptable anymore."
PRAGER: Leftism Makes People Meaner: Reflections On The Torture Of Paul Manafort,www.dailywire.com,Dennis Prager,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48450/prager-leftism-makes-people-meaner-reflections-dennis-prager,"PRAGER: Leftism Makes People Meaner: Reflections On The Torture Of Paul Manafort Photo by Aaron P. Bernstein/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
The sadistic treatment of Paul Manafort illustrates something I have believed since I attended graduate school in the 1970s and saw the behavior of left-wing students: Leftism makes people meaner.
There are kind and mean conservatives and kind and mean liberals. Neither liberalism nor conservatism makes people kinder or meaner. But this is not the case with leftism. With the handful of exceptions that accompany every generalization, leftism makes people meaner, even crueler.
Take the transfer of Manafort, the one-time Trump campaign manager, from a federal prison to New York's Rikers Island prison. Rikers Island is universally regarded as a wretched place. As Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz wrote:
""The decision to move Paul Manafort ... from the decent federal prison to which he was sentenced to solitary confinement to the dangerous hell hole that is New York City's Rikers Island seems abusive and possibly illegal.
""I know Rikers well having spent time there visiting numerous defendants accused of murder and other violent crimes. It is a terrible place that no one should ever be sent to.""
Mass murderers and torturers are among those incarcerated at Rikers Island.
Moreover, Manafort, found guilty solely for white-collar crimes, will be placed in solitary confinement — ""for his own safety.""
Virtually everyone who has written about solitary confinement, both on the right and the left, deems it torture. Manafort will therefore be tortured after being sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for fraud and, in the words of the Daily Wire, ""a little-known law that requires lobbyists to report that they are working on behalf of a foreign government (in Manafort's case, Ukraine).""
Angry over the possibility that Manafort may be pardoned by President Trump, the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, charged Manafort with additional crimes based on state law. That way, if found guilty of state offenses, he cannot be pardoned by Trump, as the president's power to pardon applies only to federal — not state — crimes.
Everyone knows this prosecution is politically motivated. Vance hates the president and wants to use solitary confinement in a hellhole with violent criminals to squeeze Manafort into testifying against the president.
As Dershowitz said to me on my radio show, what Vance is doing reminds him of Stalin and Beria — the infamous state prosecutor, a man Stalin referred to as ""my Himmler."" Dershowitz, a lifelong liberal Democrat and supporter of Hillary Clinton, does not use Stalin analogies loosely.
To her credit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: ""A prison sentence is not a license for gov torture and human rights violations. That's what solitary confinement is. Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary.""
I might add that my opposition to Manafort's treatment is not partisan or new. On a number of occasions over the years, I have cited favorably New York Review of Books articles describing the horror of solitary confinement.
Despite its history of opposition to solitary confinement, The New York Times article reporting the plan to relocate Manafort said nothing against the unnecessary transfer but did comment on the expensive suits Manafort used to wear.
Solitary confinement is ""basically a deathtrap,"" former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik wrote when Manafort was placed in solitary at his federal prison. Manafort should never have been sentenced to solitary confinement. But Robert Mueller (and Judge Amy Berman Jackson) sought it for the same political reason Vance has: to break the man.
As former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell wrote: ""When a witness or defendant from whom prosecutors want 'cooperation' does not do as they demand, they put him in solitary confinement. And it works. It literally breaks people.
""Solitary does have a place in our prison system, but only for those people who are simply too dangerous to be placed around others at all. However, the torture of solitary confinement should never be used as it is now to break people to prosecutors' will — to torture them until they will say or do anything to get out.
""Solitary is also called the 'hole.' It's a small space, barely large enough to stand, with a slit for light, to which prisoners are confined/caged for 23 hours a day. ...
""Paul Manafort, seventy years old, has endured this torture for eight months. He's now in a wheelchair, while Judge Amy Berman Jackson mocks his rapidly deteriorating health. Where is the outcry from the ACLU?""
So, then, what enables Vance, Mueller and Jackson to engage in such evil?
The only answer is their politics — the politics of the Trump-hating left. Cyrus Vance, Robert Mueller and Amy Berman Jackson may well be good parents, loving spouses, loyal friends and charitable individuals. But leftism has given them permission to act vilely and mercilessly while thinking of themselves as fine people — just as evil doctrines have done throughout history.
As noted at the beginning of this column, when I was at Columbia, I witnessed this leftist mean-spiritedness firsthand in the personal cruelty of left-wing agitators against professors and others with whom they differed.
Here's a question perhaps millions of parents will be able to answer: If your child returned home from college a leftist, was he or she a kinder or meaner person than before he or she left for college?
The question is rhetorical.

KNOWLES: Keep Jackson On The $20 Bill,www.dailywire.com,Michael J. Knowles,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48445/knowles-keep-jackson-20-bill-michael-j-knowles,"Everyone these days seems to hate the founder of the Democratic Party.
Andrew Jackson’s national historical turmoil first began in 2015, when Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced plans to replace a different dead white man, Alexander Hamilton, with a woman — any woman — on the $10 bill. Hamilton dodged erasure thanks to the popularity of a biographical Broadway hip-hop musical about him, prompting Lew to announce the following year that Jackson would lose his spot on the $20 bill to abolitionist and former slave Harriet Tubman.
Leftists cheered the removal of a man they imagine to have perpetrated genocide against Native Americans. Many Republicans celebrated the monetary ouster of the man who founded the Democratic Party. Both sides sell our seventh president short.
Fortunately in May, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced plans to delay the Tubman $20 until 2028. With any luck, Americans will spend the ensuing years disabusing themselves of the revisionist smears against Jackson, a war hero and reformer president unfairly blamed for things he never did.
During the War of 1812, Jackson successfully and unexpectedly repelled invading British troops from New Orleans. The outnumbered Americans under Jackson’s command successfully prevented the British from gaining a foothold in the southern territories. Jackson’s victory engendered a renewed sense of unity and purpose in a nation that had by then defeated the most powerful empire on earth twice over the course of three decades.
In 1828, Jackson’s war heroism helped to propel him to the White House, where he instituted a series of anti-corruption reforms including investigations into all cabinet offices and departments. Jackson’s campaign chased corrupt officials out of the government and reduced waste and abuse, freeing up funds that he would use to enable widows of Revolutionary War veterans to receive their husbands’ pensions. Jackson also distinguished himself as the only president in American history to pay off the national debt.
Jackson’s critics assail him for presiding over the “Trail of Tears,” but the brutal Cherokee “Trail of Tears” began in May 1838, a full year after Jackson left office. Jackson did indeed support the policy of Indian Removal, an inevitable consequence of persistent conflicts between settlers and natives, but on roughly 70 occasions Jackson secured the relocation of Indians through negotiated treaties and federal payments totaling millions of dollars. The process of Indian Removal extended far beyond the presidencies of Andrew Jackson or even Martin Van Buren, ultimately spanning the administrations of nine separate presidents with official support from Congress. Moreover, as the Smithsonian reminded readers last year, the prevalence of wealthy, slave-holding Indians who marched their own black slaves down the ""Trail of Tears"" complicates the neat historical narrative preferred by modern revisionists.
The historical record also shatters the caricature of Jackson as some sort of Indian-hating, genocidal bigot. In fact, he appears to have held no personal animosity toward Indians at all. After the Battle of Tallushatchee during the Creek War, Jackson adopted an Indian orphan whose own village had rejected him. Jackson, an orphan himself, took pity on the boy, named the boy Lyncoya Jackson, brought him back to his home in Tennessee, and educated him alongside his other adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr.
Other critics attack Jackson as a lawless, imperial president for his famous dismissal of the Supreme Court’s decision in Worcester v. Georgia , when he remarked, “[Chief Justice] John Marshall has made his decision. Now let him enforce it.” Putting aside the merits of the case, there is no evidence that Jackson ever actually uttered his famous remark, which comes to us third-hand and without citation from newspaper publisher and politician Horace Greeley by way of the Massachusetts congressman George N. Briggs.
Jackson’s many virtues do not mean he lacked moral flaws. He held slaves. But then so did George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. If we are to remove Jackson from the $20 bill for his complicity in slavery, must we also remove Jefferson from the $2 bill and Washington from the $1 bill?
Harriet Tubman accomplished many great feats in her courageous life, for which she has been honored with national parks and memorials in New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts. Perhaps we ought also to put her face on some new denomination of money. One can imagine bestowing such an honor on many other fine people who helped to build this country: Christopher Columbus, William Bradford, Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, and Ronald Reagan all come to mind. Their honor need not come at the expense of Andrew Jackson. Our national future does not demand we revise and malign our past."
Arrest Made In Connection With Shooting Death Of Former Arkansas State Senator,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48454/arrest-made-connection-shooting-death-former-ashe-schow,"Arrest Made In Connection With Shooting Death Of Former Arkansas State Senator Caspar Benson/Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
Former Arkansas State Sen. Linda Collins-Smith, a Republican, was shot and killed in early June. Her body was discovered on June 4. Her death was immediately treated as “suspicious” and investigated as a homicide. Now, an arrest has been made in relation to her death.
Fox News reported that former campaign staffer Rebecca Lynn O’Donnell, 48, had been identified as the suspect. Arkansas State Police told the outlet criminal charges were pending, but wouldn’t say whether other suspects had been identified or were being sought.
KTHV-TV reported O’Donnell’s connection to Collins-Smith’s last campaign. Ken Yang, former communications director for Collins-Smith, told the outlet that O’Donnell had worked on the former state senator's last campaign and that the two were friends.
NBC-affiliate KARK published a statement from Collins-Smith’s family released Friday evening:
This evening, our family received the news that an arrest was made in connection to the ongoing investigation. We are sickened and upset that someone so close to Linda, would be involved in such a terrible, heartless crime. The family is confident that the Randolph County Sheriff's Department and the Arkansas State Police will continue to work diligently to bring justice to this case. We would like to thank everyone for the continued prayers and thoughts for our family during this difficult time.
No motive has been suggested, and a photo of the two women smiling together has been making the rounds online. KARK reported that O’Donnell made the photo her profile picture “days after the homicide.”
Arkansas police have told multiple outlets that the investigation is still ongoing and no further information is available.
The Daily Wire previously reported that Collins-Smith served one term in the Arkansas state senate. She was elected in 2014 but primaried in 2018 and lost. Still, the Arkansas Republican Party and Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a fellow Republican, remembered her fondly.
“It's an incredible loss of a human life who's served the public and an office and that has continued to be engaged in public affairs but she's also a family person and it's just a great loss. So, we express our sympathies there and we're awaiting more details in the state police investigation,"" Hutchinson told “KARK 4 Today” after Collins-Smith’s death.
The Arkansas GOP offered its own condolences on Twitter:
Today, we learned of the untimely death of former Senator Linda Collins Smith. She was a passionate voice for her people and a close member of our Republican family. We are praying for her loved ones during this difficult time.
The day after Collins-Smith was discovered, another former Republican state senator — Jonathan Nichols of Oklahoma — was also discovered dead from a gunshot wound.
The deaths were completely unrelated and there is no new information on the events surrounding Nichols’ death."
"More New Yorkers Like Donald Trump Than NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio, Poll Finds",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48453/more-new-yorkers-donald-trump-nyc-mayor-bill-de-ashe-schow,"More New Yorkers Like Donald Trump Than NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio, Poll Finds Scott Olson/Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
In a somewhat unexpected turn, President Donald Trump has a higher favorable rating in New York than New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
A Sienna College poll from last week found that 29% of New Yorkers polled had a favorable view of de Blasio, while 34% had a favorable view of Trump.
While these numbers seem good or at least interesting for the current president, his unfavorable rating in the state is not. De Blasio had a 53% unfavorability rating, up from 50% in April, according to the New York Post . Trump, meanwhile, holds a 63% unfavorability rating, up from 59% in April.
Further, the poll found that even though New Yorkers don’t like de Blasio, they would still vote for him over Trump, 48% to 36%, in a head-to-head election. The most popular of the New York politicians currently running for president (or re-election) is Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who, despite taking three months to qualify for the first debate and not even registering on many polls, has a 44% favorability rating in the Empire State.
Gillibrand would also beat Trump in New York if the election were held today, 58% to 34%.
“New York Democrats strongly prefer the hometown senator over the hometown mayor. Gillibrand would easily best de Blasio in every region of the state, including New York City, where she beats him 56-29 percent,” Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in a statement about the poll. “Blue New York shows no interest in supporting the incumbent Republican President for re-election.”
And that’s the big takeaway. It’s certainly interesting that New Yorkers gave Trump a higher favorability rating than de Blasio (probably because much of New York outside of the Big Apple is actually red) even though Trump would still lose the state to whichever Democrat wins the primary. And that is never going to change.
New York is a Deep Blue state. The population centered in New York City makes it so. Trump is never going to win the state or even come close to doing so.
This poll also does nothing for de Blasio nationally. He was already polling around 0, so the fact that people in his own home state don’t like him all that much isn’t going to hurt his chances any more. A recent poll from Iowa, the first primary state, found that de Blasio was absolutely no one’s first or second choice for president from the massive list of Democrats running in the primary. De Blasio and Miramar, Florida Mayor Wayne Messam were the only two that received no first- or second-choice votes. It was a pretty stunning feat for de Blasio, since the mayor of New York City tends to have pretty decent name recognition. Few people outside of that area in Florida have heard of Messam.
It must be embarrassing for the Democratic candidates who typically get so much media coverage — such as de Blasio or Gillibrand — to be doing so poorly in the Democratic Party primary."
LIMBAUGH: Leftists Will Be Leftists,www.dailywire.com,David Limbaugh,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48449/limbaugh-leftists-will-be-leftists-david-limbaugh,"LIMBAUGH: Leftists Will Be Leftists Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's comments on the pro-life cause and its advocates are illustrative of the left's increasing extremism, militancy and disturbingly intolerant and authoritarian mindset.
Someone asked Gillibrand if having a litmus test for judicial nominees would threaten judicial independence, as she has promised to only appoint justices who would affirm the Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade, which created — out of whole cloth — a constitutional right to abortion.
""I think there's some issues that have such moral clarity that we have as a society decided that the other side is not acceptable,"" said Gillibrand. ""Imagine saying that it's OK to appoint a judge who's racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic ... asking someone to appoint someone who takes away basic human rights of any group of people in America. ... I don't think those are political issues anymore.""
""And we believe in this country in the separation of church and state, and I respect the rights of every American to hold their religious beliefs true to themselves, but our country and our Constitution has always demanded that we have a separation of church and state,"" she continued. ""And all these efforts by President Trump and other ultra-radical conservative judges and justices to impose their faith on Americans is contrary to our Constitution, and that's what this is. And so, I believe that for all of these issues, they are not issues that there is a fair other side. There is no moral equivalency when you come to racism, and I do not believe there is a moral equivalency when it comes to changing laws that deny women reproductive freedom.""
What a treasure trove of otherworldly statements! You have to wonder whether this longer-than-long-shot Democratic presidential fantasist actually believes these things or if she is just desperate to outflank her rivals to the left.
Contemplate the arrogance of asserting that society has reached moral clarity in saying that it is wrong to change laws that deny women reproductive freedom. Polls show that Americans are equally divided on the abortion question, so who does Gillibrand have in mind when she says ""society""? Does she live in an impenetrable bubble, or does she have such contempt for those who disagree that she doesn't consider them valued members of society?
She seems to be saying that the pro-choice half of America has decided that the other half ""is not acceptable."" This inference is not a stretch, considering that leftists consider most of us ""deplorables,"" and that they declare a consensus on other factual and moral questions to discourage further debate. They foreclose, by fiat, debate on climate change and many cultural issues. If you disagree with any of the left's politically correct pronouncements, even if they have been established for only five minutes, you are not only unquestionably wrong but also irredeemably evil. So absolute is the leftists' position on these ""settled questions"" that the questions can't even be considered political.
This is dangerous thinking, but it is how leftists think. They take a position, grow increasingly entrenched and then declare a societal consensus. Consensus doesn't mean that almost everyone agrees but that everyone who matters, or who is reasonable, does. This is a neat circular trick. Proclaim, for example, that the pro-life position is so manifestly wrong that anyone who disagrees — even if dissenters equal proponents in number — is unreasonable and immoral.
Next consider her statement that no one who ""takes away basic human right of any group of people in America"" should be appointed to the court. The basic human right to which she refers is a woman's ""reproductive freedom."" You would expect that a right that constitutes a ""basic human right"" would at least be clearly stated, rather than shrouded with deceitful euphemism. ""Reproductive freedom"" in pro-abortion parlance has nothing to do with reproduction. Abortion only occurs when reproduction has already occurred. Reproductive freedom means the right to kill an unborn baby, which is quite the antithesis of reproduction. It is destruction. More important, it ignores the basic human right to life of the unborn baby.
Gillibrand is correct about one thing. There is abundant moral clarity on the abortion issue. With certain exceptions, which are debatable, it is wrong to kill an unborn baby. But unlike the Gillibrand left, conservatives aren't likely to declare dissenters as societal outcasts or their views beyond debate.
Finally, there is the left's ongoing misinformation about the so-called separation of church and state. While the Constitution's First Amendment Establishment Clause prohibits the federal government (and state governments via the incorporation doctrine) from establishing or unduly supporting a national religion, it does not prohibit people from supporting or opposing laws consistent with their faith. I support laws against murder, theft and other things based on my Christian beliefs. Secularists support and oppose laws based on their beliefs. All groups are free to do that without violating the Establishment Clause, and if you deny them the right to advocate for or oppose laws based on their respective worldviews, then you violate their First Amendment right to free speech and possibly the right to the free exercise of religion.
It is ironic that people so confused about basic constitutional issues and fundamental moral questions presume their absolute moral superiority on such questions and declare them beyond debate. But leftists will be leftists.

ERICKSON: Truth Should Outweigh Narrative,www.dailywire.com,Erick Erickson,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48451/erickson-truth-should-outweigh-narrative-erick-erickson,"ERICKSON: Truth Should Outweigh Narrative Photo by Karl-Josef Hildenbrand/picture alliance via Getty Images June 15, 2019 views
Last week, The New York Times ran a story about a study on Google and the press. The story claims that Google made $4.7 billion off the content created by American news outlets.
The story is based on research done by the News Media Alliance. The Times reports, ""That $4.7 billion is nearly as much as the $5.1 billion brought in by the United States news industry as a whole from digital advertising last year."" The Times did not tell us that the News Media Alliance is the lobbying arm for the newspaper industry. The Times did not tell us that most media observers reviewed the report and decided it was bunk.
In the words of Matthew Ingram at Columbia Journalism Review: ""That study relies on a public comment then-Google executive Marissa Mayer made at a media event in 2008, when she estimated that Google News brought in $100 million in revenue. The NMA report calculates what the same proportion of the company's revenue would be today, then further inflates this figure based on the fact that news consumption via Google's main search is 6 times larger than via Google News."" As Ingram summarizes, the report ""appears to be based almost entirely on questionable mathematical extrapolation from a comment made by a former Google executive more than a decade ago.""
What the Times danced around is that this lobbying report based on bunk came out in the run-up to a congressional hearing on HR 2054, called the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act. The legislation, if passed, would exempt newspapers from anti-trust laws so they could collaborate together to keep their content off Google, Facebook and even a local blog. The Times advanced sheer propaganda as news because the narrative is more important than the truth.
In this case, the narrative is that social media is killing newspapers. Newspapers are in trouble, but that is different from news being in trouble. In many cases, local television and radio stations have stepped up to cover local government as newspapers declined. Newspapers should be an indispensable part of every community, but some people just do not value them anymore, and that is not Google or Facebook's fault.
The Times and other news organizations' advancing narratives instead of truth is increasingly problematic. This past week, multiple press outlets ran sensational stories that President Donald Trump intended to house illegal immigrants in a former Japanese internment camp. Progressive activists seized on the reports as proof that the President was operating concentration camps. The Daily Beast, Fortune, The Hill, USA Today, Time, The Washington Post and Business Insider are just some of the publications that ran with the claim.
There is just one problem. Fort Sill is an American military base in Oklahoma. In 2014, Barack Obama also put immigrant child detainees at Fort Sill, and the very same media outlets never made wild claims about the connection to Japanese internment in World War II.
On Wednesday last week, President Trump said he would welcome foreign intelligence against his political opponents and may not hand it over to the FBI. The media yet again went into overdrive with the outrage. What they all ignored was that Democrats had done the exact same thing. Democrats paid a foreign intelligence operative named Christopher Steele to generate the so-called Steele dossier. That dossier, according to the Mueller investigation, contained some pretty wild claims about President Trump.
Democrats, with help from their friends in the press, screamed that they had handed that over to the FBI. What they all failed to note was that the Democrats actually spent several months dripping out nuggets to friendly members of the press to generate hit jobs on Trump. They only took it to the FBI a month before the election.
The American media has largely embraced a progressive, anti-conservative and explicitly anti-Trump bias. Stories about the President, such as the Fort Sill story, are put in the worst possible framing, and stories about Democrats are routinely downplayed or ignored. The American media used to believe in telling facts and truth. Now, the press narrates stories that are borderline fables to help their partisan friends.

KLAVAN: Conservatives Have To Be Fearless In The Face Of Leftist Censorship,www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48417/klavan-conservatives-have-be-fearless-face-leftist-andrew-klavan,"June 15, 2019 views
The corporate media — including social media — are now engaged in a full-fledged and collusive attempt to silence conservative voices in time for the 2020 election. On Sunday, just as YouTube was threatening to pull down thousands of “hateful” (i.e. conservative) videos, The New York Timesprinted a breathless and idiotic piece supposedly charting a YouTubeviewer's descent into right-wing radicalism.
How radical did this poor radical soul get from watching conservative videos? Well, okay, he ""never bought into the far right’s most extreme views, like Holocaust denial or the need for a white ethnostate ..."" But, ""he began referring to himself as a ‘tradcon’ — a traditional conservative, committed to old-fashioned gender norms. He dated an evangelical Christian woman, and he fought with his liberal friends.""
The horror. The horror.
This suspiciously timed piece — clearly designed to give cover to YouTube’s censorship plan — featured a collage of faces of right-wing radicals. These included such raving hate-filled alt-right evil-doers as mild-mannered gay centrist Dave Rubin and of course Daily Wireeditor-in-chief Ben Shapiro — whom various left-wing outlets have repeatedly identified as the one and only orthodox Jewish Nazi in all the universes!
But while branding Dave and Ben alt-right may be absurd, it’s not unintentional. It is part of a strategy. 1. Convince people that hate speech should be silenced. 2. Define hate speech as alt-right. 3. Label powerful mainstream conservatives “alt-right.” 4. Silence powerful mainstream conservatives.
And if you don’t think the effort is collusive — if not by conspiracy at least by conformist sympathy — consider the case of James O’Keefe, the journalistic gadfly of Project Veritas.
O’Keefe recently exposed anti-conservative censorship at social media outlet Pinterest. Pinterest execs were listing pro-life website Live Action as porn in order to ban it, and foiling searches for PJMedia and — wait for it — that tireless doer of wickedness Shapiro. And when O’Keefe exposed the practice, he was temporarily banned from Twitter and his video removed from YouTube.
Social media censored a conservative for proving that social media was censoring conservatives!
Again, one doesn’t need to be a conspiracy theorist to understand that all this is strategic. The internet and its various platforms broke the monopoly on information once controlled by huge corporations, almost all of which lean left. It democratized the spread of information, creating venues for independent voices, many of them on the right. That was fine with our elite overlords for a while because the left still managed to silence people through demonization and bullying. People don’t like being called racist, sexist, Islamophobic, homophobic and so on, especially if it might cost them their jobs. Like the family in the film A Quiet Place , those with conservative leanings learned to live in silence lest the beasts come after them.
But then along came Donald Trump — rude, boorish and completely indifferent to whatever names they called him. Trump said things people were afraid to say and gave others the feeling they could say them too. When Trump actually pulled off his upset victory, the left knew this freedom of speech thing had gone way too far.
The first stage of Operation Don’t Speak was the “fake news” controversy manufactured by Google-funded organization First Draft, and boosted by leftwing conniver David Brock, with assists from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The object of the fake news panic was to convince social media to install left-wing hate groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center to curate material — i.e. censor conservatives. The move was successful.
But as 2020 approaches and Trump continues to expose our corrupt press and reach the people, panic is beginning to set in and the next phase of Operation Don’t Speak is in play: a massive and collusive move to define mainstream right-wing speech as hateful and shut it down.
What conservatives have to understand is that this is the central fight we’re in. This is where the battle for the soul of the future is taking place. We have to remember that we are not just on the right, we are in the right. And if we allow ourselves to be silenced — if we allow ourselves to be frightened — if we start to watch our words or apologize for faked misunderstandings or dial back our humor or throw our friends overboard when they misspeak, we lose.
We lose because we have allowed the left to set the terms of the debate."
BOZELL & GRAHAM: HBO Drags Disney Star Into The Gutter,www.dailywire.com,"L. Brent Bozell III, Tim Graham",06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48448/bozell-graham-hbo-drags-disney-star-gutter-l-brent-bozell-iii,"June 15, 2019 views
The programmers at HBO pride themselves in setting the tone for the rest of television, especially when it comes to the absence of taste, from Bill Maher's ""Real Time"" talk-show tantrums to Lena Dunham marching around undressed on ""Girls.""
Every time HBO hits the bottom of the gutter, it finds a way to go deeper still. It is really headed into the gutter, and it knows it. A new HBO series about teenagers and sex and drugs called ""Euphoria"" is starting June 16, starring 22-year-old Zendaya, another former Disney Channel star desperately seeking to keep her career alive in the eyes of Hollywood casting agents and limiting herself to one name in the pursuit of that.
The show's creator, Sam Levinson, gleefully predicted to The Hollywood Reporter, ""There are going to be parents who are going to be totally f—-ing freaked out.""
This is how The Hollywood Reporter began its story: ""Thirty penises in one episode? Zendaya's new series, filled with graphic nudity, violence and drug use among young people, is so extreme that one star quit mid-shoot, but the network hopes that authenticity will help the show break through.""
Ah, ""authenticity."" That's the word HBO uses when it makes a wildly over-the-top series. Levinson claimed the point of the show is to ""expose an adult audience to the challenges of growing up in 2019,"" and that many of the scenes come directly from Levinson's life. ""It may seem boundary-pushing, and the idea of putting them on TV may be, but somebody lived them."" Levinson, born in 1985, is the son of top Tinseltown filmmaker Barry Levinson.
Many ""somebodies"" have navigated through dramatically sinful lives, but that doesn't mean they're all going to be exploited by HBO. If the company just loves ""authenticity"" for its own sake, can we expect it to run ""Gosnell"" on its channels, or ""Unplanned""? Or is the authentic ugliness of the abortion industry just too tawdry?
Casey Bloys, HBO programming president, claimed the show is ""not sensational to be sensational."" There is zero authenticity in that claim.
Levinson says HBO executives have been supportive, but they did push back on two scenes. He wanted to start the whole series with a camera shot focusing on the birth of Zendaya's character that came from ""behind a doctor and went straight between her mother's legs and into her vagina,"" the Reporter says. In the actual version, her character narrates over a clip of herself in utero, saying, ""I was repeatedly crushed over and over by the cruel cervix of my mother.""
The network also protested a scene in the second episode featuring dozens of naked high school boys. How responsible. ""What made it to air is a trimmed-down version of the original shot, which included 'like, 80 more' penises,"" the Reporter says. It never ceases to amaze that HBO is now the first destination for new ""Sesame Street"" programming. The executives cravenly cashed in.
Parents Television Council President Tim Winter made the most salient point to the Hollywood Reporter. This show ""appears to be overtly, intentionally marketing extremely graphic adult content — sex, violence, profanity and drug use — to teens and preteens.""
HBO makes its way into millions of American homes, and not just on the television anymore. Children can easily stream a perverted show like this on their laptops or iPads or even cellphones. Parents should be alerted that this smutty show will be bubbling up from the bottom of the sewer.
Until HBO goes deeper still.

Chicago Cardinal Cupich Will Allow Pro-Abortion Politicians To Receive Holy Communion,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48444/chicago-cardinal-cupich-will-allow-pro-abortion-paul-bois,"Chicago Cardinal Cupich Will Allow Pro-Abortion Politicians To Receive Holy Communion ""I think it would be counterproductive to impose sanctions"" Franco Origlia / Contributor / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich will allow Illinois state politicians who helped pass a law guaranteeing women the right to abortion to receive what Catholics believe to be the body and blood of Jesus Christ in the form of Holy Communion.
Speaking with Catholic News Agency , Cupich said that barring pro-abortion Catholic politicians from receiving Holy Communion would be ""counterproductive.""
""I think it would be counterproductive to impose sanctions, simply because they don’t change anybody’s minds, but it also takes away from the fact that an elected official has to deal with the judgment seat of God, not just the judgment seat of a bishop. I think that’s much more powerful,” Cupich told CNA. ""I have always approached the issue saying that the bishop’s primary responsibility is to teach, and I will continue to do that.""
Senate Bill 25 — a.k.a., the ""Reproductive Health Act"" — passed the Illinois State Senate by a 34-20 vote and essentially guarantees that the state will enshrine abortion rights into law should Roe v. Wade be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. It even expressly states that the ""fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights."" Democrat Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the bill into law this past Wednesday.
According to Catholic Canon Law 915 , people who publicly express grave sin are not to be admitted to Holy Communion. The Catholic Church has always taught abortion to be intrinsically evil and that people who either procure or support the practice are in grave error that can only be reconciled through the sacrament of Confession.
Cardinal Cupich did, however, tell Catholic News Agency that the ""Reproductive Health Act"" is ""pernicious"" by denying the humanity of the unborn child.
""What’s pernicious about this law, and what’s so very difficult, is that it says that the unborn child has absolutely no claim on rights,"" Cupich said. ""It says that human life is cheap. That’s the message that we send — that human life is cheap in the State of Illinois.""
Cardinal Cupich's decision to give pro-abortion politicians Holy Communion stands in direct contrast to another bishop in Illinois — Bishop Thomas John Paprocki of Springfield, who expressly forbid all priests under his governance to give Holy Communion to politicians that supported the ""Reproductive Health Act.""
""In accord with canon 915 of the Code of Canon Law … Illinois Senate President John Cullerton and Speaker of the House Michael J. Madigan, who facilitated the passage of the Act Concerning Abortion of 2017 (House Bill 40) as well as the Reproductive Health Act of 2019 (Senate Bill 25), are not to be admitted to Holy Communion in the Diocese of Springfield in Illinois because they have obstinately persisted in promoting the abominable crime and very grave sin of abortion as evidenced by the influence they exerted in their leadership roles and their repeated votes and obdurate public support for abortion rights over an extended period of time,"" Paprocki wrote in a statement.
In 2017, the American Catholic hierarchy elected Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann to head the U.S. Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities, who expressly stated that bishops should bar pro-abortion politicians from receiving Holy Communion."
Discovery Family Show ‘My Little Pony’ To Introduce Lesbian Couple,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48446/discovery-family-show-my-little-pony-introduce-paul-bois,"Discovery Family Show ‘My Little Pony’ To Introduce Lesbian Couple Aunt Holiday and Auntie Lofty Albert L. Ortega / Contributor / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
LGBT pride will be coming to the Discovery Family show ""My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic"" this weekend in an episode that will feature a lesbian couple.
According to HuffPost , the episode will air Saturday and introduce the characters Aunt Holiday and Auntie Lofty, who both take care of the character Scootaloo.
""The characters previously appeared in the 2017 book ' Ponyville Mysteries: Riddle of the Rusty Horseshoe ,' but this will be their first appearance on the Discovery Family series, a reboot of the Hasbro 1980s original,"" reports the outlet. ""One of the series’ writers, Michael Vogel, pointed out the perfect timing of the episode’s June 15 air date."" Hey hey!!! @NicoleDubuc , @joshhaber and I doin what we can to bring more EQuality to EQuestria!! #PrideMonth https://t.co/YPOvvxT3v0 — mktoon (@mktoon) June 10, 2019
Speaking to BuzzFeed , the openly gay Vogel said that diversity and representation is always ""my first priority on everything I work on.""
""Diversity and representation are important for kids for so many reasons, and it’s my first priority on everything I work on,"" he said. ""'My Little Pony' has always been about friendship and accepting people (or ponies) that are different from you. So it just felt like something important to do.""
""Nicole and I thought this was a great opportunity to organically introduce an LGBTQ couple in the series, and we asked Hasbro and they approved it. With Josh and Nicole running the final season together, it was something we all wanted to do — bring this out couple into the final season and make them ‘officially’ a part of the MLP world.""
The inclusion of LGBT characters on ""My Little Pony"" follows the PBS Kids show ""Arthur"" featuring a prominent character in a same-sex marriage , which earned the praise of multiple LGBTQ organizations while alienating conservatives.
""PBS Kids programs are designed to reflect the diversity of communities across the nation,"" the public network said in a statement at the time. ""We believe it is important to represent the wide array of adults in the lives of children who look to PBS Kids every day.""
The episode featured Arthur's teacher, Mr. Ratburn , tying the knot with his same-sex partner. Alabama public television chose to ban the episode from airing and play a re-run of the program. APT’s director of programming, Mike Mckenzie, said the station thought the episode would violate parent trust.
""Parents have trusted Alabama Public Television for more than 50 years to provide children’s programs that entertain, educate and inspire,” Mckenzie said. ""More importantly – although we strongly encourage parents to watch television with their children and talk about what they have learned afterwards – parents trust that their children can watch APT without their supervision. We also know that children who are younger than the ‘target’ audience for Arthur also watch the program. The vast majority of parents will not have heard about the content, whether they agree with it or not. Because of this, we felt it would be a violation of trust to broadcast the episode.""
HuffPost reports that Hulu will be breaking barriers with the upcoming debut of "" The Bravest Knight ,"" which tells the story of ""Sir Cedric and Prince Andrew, an interracial couple raising an adopted daughter, Nia."""
Limbaugh: Check Out The Media's 'Despicable' Handling Of Sarah Sanders' Departure,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48443/limbaugh-check-out-medias-despicable-handling-james-barrett,"Limbaugh: Check Out The Media's 'Despicable' Handling Of Sarah Sanders' Departure Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced on Thursday that she will be stepping away at the end of the month, inspiring much speculation on who will take on the challenge of taking on the media on Trump's behalf — and opening the door for the mainstream media, with whom she's frequently exchanged barbs, to take some parting shots. On his radio program Friday, Rush Limbaugh blasted the media for its ""despicable"" treatment of Sanders, as highlighted by their response to the announcement of her departure.
""I love the job she does. She is perfect for that job,"" said Rush (transcript via RushLimbaugh.com ). ""One of the best things that Sarah Sanders has done, aside from her daily conduct of the job, one of the best things she’s done is end and eliminate the daily White House press briefing, because you know what that became under Trump? It wasn’t a press briefing. ...The White House press briefing became an audition for various members of the Drive-By Media to make fools of themselves in order to stand out and get noticed. Exhibit A: Jim Acosta of CNN. It was just an opportunity to humiliate, embarrass, misbehave.""
Of all the reporters at the White House, the exchanges between Sanders and Acosta have made the most news, as The Daily Wire has chronicled .
Limbaugh pointed out that Trump is constantly blasted for his ""unacceptable"" behavior, but then pointed to the media's treatment of Sanders as evidence of their hypocrisy. ""What the hell would you describe the media’s behavior every day toward Trump or toward Sarah Sanders as? Is that representative of Washington values?"" he asked.
He then cued a montage of media personalities working in needless jabs on Sanders in their coverage of her announcement:
ERIN BURNETT: (dramatic music) Trump’s most loyal defender, Sarah Sanders, is leaving. (pause) Can she get her credibility back?
JIM ACOSTA: (outdoor noise) She fell short of her duty to the American people.
PAULA REID: (voice over) The White House briefing effectively died on her watch.
PAMELA BROWN: (outdoor noise) … accused of not being truthful.
MATT MILLER: I hope that she’s not able to escape this White House without, kind of, the shame and stigma following her.
ANDERSON COOPER: Who gets out of the Trump White House alive — you know, with their reputation intact? (Snort!)
AMANDA CARPENTER: She’s been exposed for the fraud that she is.
JACKIE KUCINICH: She’ll go down as someone who is very loyal to the president and not very loyal to the truth.
JOE LOCKHART: … failure on the most important parts of the job, as a liar.
NICOLLE WALLACE: She was a liar. It’s in the Mueller report.
DON LEMON: Sarah Sanders lied again and again and again.
DAVID GERGEN: Sarah Sanders has opened the door to massive amount of lying.
APRIL RYAN: She suffers from lie-abetes. Her tenure has been fraught with sex, lies, and videotape. She’s lied, lied, lied, lied, lied.
""'Lied, lied, lied…'"" Limbaugh said, imitating April Ryan. ""You, you will not find that kind of reaction to an outgoing White House press secretary anywhere else ever. Not a single one.""
After playing a clip of Trump praising Sanders on Thursday for doing ""an incredible job"" and being both ""tough"" and ""good,"" Rush stressed that he agrees.
""She was exceptional at this job,"" he said. ""She was a pit bull in their faces, had answers, and made them look like the children they are. She had this unique talent to make them look bad. She didn’t cower. She didn’t play the game. She called them out when they were grandstanding in order to call attention to themselves, and that’s why they don’t like her. They don’t like her because she was effective. They don’t like her because she was loyal to Trump."""
New York Ends Religious Exemptions For Vaccine Mandates,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48438/new-york-ends-religious-exemptions-vaccine-amanda-prestigiacomo,"New York Ends Religious Exemptions For Vaccine Mandates Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
On Thursday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, signed a bill into law that will immediately end religious exemptions for vaccine mandates.
Cuomo said he signed the bill in order to protect the public in the midst of one of the worst measles outbreak in decades, which he categorized as a “public health crisis,” reported CBS New York.
The outbreak first sparked in October, the outlet noted, and spread in parts of New York City, particularly among Orthodox Jewish communities.
“Rockland County declared a countywide State of Emergency relating to the ongoing measles outbreak,"" reported NBC in March. ""Effective at the stroke of midnight, Wednesday, anyone who is under 18 years of age and unvaccinated against the measles will be barred from public places until this declaration expires in 30 days or until they receive the MMR vaccination.”
With the passing of the law, parents will be forced to vaccinate their children before they can attend school in the state, and religious exemptions won’t get them out of it. Parents and teens have morally objected to certain vaccines based upon ties to abortion. Now, the only acceptable exemptions from the mandate will be for medical reasons, such as a child’s weakened immune system.
While opponents of the legislation protested in Assembly chambers on Thursday, sponsors of the bill praised its passing as a measure of protection for children.
“If your kid is immunocompromised and going to school or a day care center, you want to know that they’re going to be safe,” said State Sen. Brad Hoylman, a sponsor of the legislation, according to CBS New York.
“It’s our obligation to act,” State Sen. David Carlucci said. “We have to do everything we can to get the number of people vaccinated up.”
“The government does not have the right to interfere with my personal religious beliefs,” said one woman protesting the law. “We will not vaccinate. What’s going to happen is we’re going to either home school or we’re going to move out of state.”
Assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein, a Democrat, noted that he is pro-vaccine but could not vote for the bill out of “constitutional duty.”
“Despite my pro-vaccination stance and despite my beliefs that there are no religious restrictions, it is my constitutional duty to vote in the negative,” he said.
California is headed the way of New York when it comes to vaccines via SB 276. Actress Jessica Biel sparked debate over vaccines earlier this week when she met with some 15 California legislators to discuss her concerns about the bill and advocate for parental rights.
Biel said she is ""not against vaccinations"" but supports ""families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.”
""This week I went to Sacramento to talk to legislators in California about a proposed bill,” she wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday. “I am not against vaccinations — I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians.”
“My concern with #SB277 is solely regarding medical exemptions. My dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family’s ability to care for their child in this state,” the post continued. “That’s why I spoke to legislators and argued against this bill. Not because I don’t believe in vaccinations, but because I believe in giving doctors and the families they treat the ability to decide what’s best for their patients and the ability to provide that treatment.”
Proponents of vaccination mandates claim SB 276 “will have minimal impact on those with valid reasons for exemption, citing medical authorities like the bill’s prominent co-sponsors: the California Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, California,” The Daily Beast reported .
As reported by The Daily Wire in April, a judge told a Catholic teenager from Kentucky, Jerome Kunkel, that he is not allowed back in school after morally objecting to receiving a vaccination for the chicken pox due to its apparent ties to abortion.
”It’s my understanding that the vaccine is derived from aborted fetal cells,” said Kunkel, according to WLWT. ""And it is against my religion. Abortion is against my religion.”
As noted by KHN Morning Briefing, ""The Varicella vaccine, specifically, is derived from the cell lines of two fetuses that were electively aborted in the 1960s."""
Parents Of Baby Charlie Gard Get Backing For 'Charlie's Law' After Son's Death,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,06-15-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48435/charlies-law-parents-baby-charlie-gard-getting-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Parents Of Baby Charlie Gard Get Backing For 'Charlie's Law' After Son's Death Photo by Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
The parents of baby Charlie Gard have received critical backing for a law pushing for parental rights of sick children. Charlie’s Law was inspired by the tragic ordeal parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard went through in 2017 when courts ordered the couple to bypass possibly life-saving experimental treatment for their infant son, instead being forced to watch baby Charlie die in a London hospital.
“If the proposal is backed by Parliament, the parents of sick children who disagree with doctors on life-and-death decisions will have more rights over treatment,” reported The Daily Mail on Thursday. The law would reportedly have a “significant harm” test, meaning parents would have the right to seek treatment for their sick child at other hospitals as long as it wouldn’t cause the child “significant harm.”
“Charlie’s tragic death on 28th July 2017 exposed the limitations of current processes available to parents, doctors and the NHS in efforts to ensure the best outcomes for seriously ill children,” outlines the Charlie Gard Foundation, which was set up by Gard and Yates in the wake of Charlie’s death. “Charlie’s fight highlighted an urgent need for changes in the law, policy and legal and health practice to support families, as well as medical and legal professionals involved in what are deeply emotive, difficult and life-changing circumstances.”
Charlie’s Law has received backing from “prominent peers, doctors and lawyers,” The Daily Mail reported. “This has my full support and that of many colleagues from all sides of the House,” former president of the British Medical Association Baroness Hollins said, per Gard.
As previously covered by The Daily Wire, baby Charlie suffered from a rare condition known as encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Though Gard and Yates raised a stunning $1.6 million on their own to pursue experimental but potentially life-saving treatment in the United States, court rulings decided it was in the baby's best interest to remain at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London to die.
The clear government overreach surrounding Charlie's case sparked reactions across the globe, including President Donald Trump and Pope Francis offering support for the Gard family.
""Our beautiful little boy has gone, we are so proud of you Charlie,” the couple announced in a heart-wrenching social media post on July 28, 2017. Charlie was just a week shy of his first birthday.
“I have been contacted by dozens of parents who cannot agree with doctors over the treatment for their sick children. They quickly find themselves locked in painful disputes, some of which end up in court,” Yates said, according to The Daily Mail. “Charlie’s Law would put a stop to this. These situations are bad for doctors, bad for parents and bad for the reputation of the NHS.”

On Thursday, Sean Hannity appeared on ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss the ongoing controversy surrounding President Trump’s comments regarding listening to foreign intel on his opponents.
After playing a sound bite from the president’s interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, co-host Brian Kilmeade had the following exchange with Hannity:
KILMEADE: Is the president right or wrong on that?
HANNITY: This was the greatest setup that Donald Trump has ever made because all, you know, I call them the media mob ... they've lied to us for two years – conspiracy theories, hoax. So, Donald Trump, if you're outraged in the media over that, ""Well, I might want to listen."" ""Listen"" is what he said, [and] maybe report to the FBI. If you’re outraged over that, how could you not be outraged [that] Hillary Clinton literally empowered a foreign agent who produced a dossier full of Russian lies that was used to infiltrate our electoral process, first by influencing the American people, but more importantly...
KILMEADE: Using a British spy.
HANNITY: They used the British foreign national ... it's full of Russian lies. It was never verified. They used it then to spy on Americans and hence Carter Page, they got into the Trump campaign.
At this point, co-host Steve Doocy jumped in: ""So are you saying, what's the difference?""
Hannity replied:
No, I'm saying that it's far worse what Hillary Clinton did, and they show no outrage in this fake media environment we live in. And Trump – if you got outraged over him saying ""I'll listen and maybe tell the FBI,"" why didn’t you get outraged about the woman that paid for the Russian lies and used it as a means of trying to destroy Donald Trump and steal the election.
Kilmeade didn’t appear to be satisfied with Hannity’s answer, leading him to push further:
Would you also say, Sean, that the better answer for the president would have been, ""Listen, I'm not taking Russian or Chinese or any outside influence because I don't need it...""
This led to the following exchange:
HANNITY: What is wrong with listening to what they have to say?
KILMEADE: I don't think you should be listening to what China has to say about your opponent.
HANNITY: Oh really? Why not? What about Norway?
KILMEADE: That’s a foreign – you want them playing a role?
HANNITY: When you listen you might learn something, or you might learn something that you share with the FBI, as the president said. And I'm a believer – look, if I ever was the president in the United States, I’d talked to Putin. I know he's a hostile actor. I’d talk to the Iranians. I wouldn't give them $150 billion like Biden and Obama, but I’d talk to them and probably tell them, ""If you ever make the wrong move, this is what's gonna happen.""
KILMEADE: If they said, ""Hey, I know you're running against John Kerry, and let me just tell you what John Kerry did.""
HANNITY: Okay. Is it true or false? And you have to determine if it's true or false. If it's true, boom, you just got a big favor.
KILMEADE: Is that okay?
HANNITY: Sure it's okay! When did talking go wrong?
Hannity then returned to Hillary Clinton, and the infamous Steele dossier. After Hannity wrapped up his reply to Kilmeade’s question, the hosts moved on to other subjects.
In a Wednesday-aired interview with President Trump, ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos asked the president if he would accept foreign oppo research on his eventual 2020 opponent:
STEPHANOPOULOS: Your campaign this time around, if foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on opponents, should they accept it or should they call the FBI?
TRUMP: I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don’t- There’s nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country — Norway — ""We have information on your opponent."" Oh. I think I’d want to hear it.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You want that kind of interference in our elections?
TRUMP: It’s not interference. They have information. I think I’d take it. If I thought there was something wrong, I’d go maybe to the FBI, if I thought there was something wrong. But when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, they come up with oppo research. ""Oh, let’s call the FBI."" The FBI doesn’t have enough agents to take care of it. When you go and talk, honestly, to congressmen, they all do it. They always have, and that’s the way it is. It’s called oppo research.
On Friday, the president attempted to walk back his remarks during a call-in to ""Fox & Friends,"" saying:
First of all, I don’t think anybody would present me with anything bad because they know how much I love this country. Nobody’s gonna present me with anything bad. Number two, if I was — and of course, you have to look at it, because if you don't look at it, you’re not gonna know if it’s bad. How are you gonna know if it’s bad? But of course, you give it to the FBI or report to the attorney general or somebody like that. But of course you do that — you couldn't have that happen with our country, and everybody understands that and I thought it was made clear.
The president then spoke about his numerous interactions with foreign leaders, asking about what he should do if someone like the president of France says he doesn’t like one of Trump’s political opponents. ""Am I supposed to report him to the FBI?"""
SAD: Democratic Debates Announced. Warren Gets Left At Kids’ Table.,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48437/sad-democratic-debates-announced-warren-gets-left-hank-berrien,"SAD: Democratic Debates Announced. Warren Gets Left At Kids’ Table. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
The Democratic Party, as always, favoring fairness over merit, held a random drawing to determine which candidates would appear in the two debates scheduled for June 26-27 in Florida, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) got left at the kids’ table.
The New York Times tried to put the best spin on the situation, arguing that Warren, who is running third in most polls behind former vice-president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who are both in the June 27 debate, will face-off against Beto O’Rourke, but O’Rourke’s recent poll numbers show that he is not currently a serious candidate in the race. The Times wrote, “Elizabeth Warren will share the stage with Beto O’Rourke on one night, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. will face off against Bernie Sanders on the next …”
20 candidates will participate in the debates, ten on each night, which will be shown on NBC. The Times noted that Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., “did not meet the polling and fund-raising criteria outlined by the Democratic National Committee,” and thus will not be part of the debates.
Politico reported that DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa told Fox News, “I think both nights will get amazing viewership. I think we’re already starting to hear, people are extremely excited about these candidates. I think they’re both very strong lineups. I think that you will also hear candidates respond to each other on various nights.”
The anchors for the debates will be Savannah Guthrie, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, the Telemundo anchor José Díaz-Balart, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.
The first night’s debate will feature Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. (D-NJ), Julián Castro, former housing secretary in the Obama administration, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, John Delaney, former representative from Maryland, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Beto O’Rourke, former representative from Texas, and Tim Ryan, representative from Ohio.
The second night will feature former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Marianne Williamson, self-help author, and Andrew Yang, former tech executive."

During an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" Friday morning, President Trump compared his wife Melania to the 20th century's most iconic first lady, Jackie Kennedy — and sparked more controversy, hilarity and outrage online in the process.
His comparison to the former first lady came during a discussion of his decision to give Air Force One a new paint job, which he unveiled Thursday. The current light blue and gold stripe design was first created when Jacqueline Kennedy was first lady. Trump's new design will replace the light blue and gold with navy blue and red.
""You know the baby blue doesn't fit with us,"" he explained. ""People get used to something — and it was Jackie O, and that's good — but we have our own Jackie O today. It's called Melania. Melania. We'll call it Melania T.""
""By the way, people love her, people love her,"" he added. ""She gets no credit from the media, but she gets credit from the people.""

As Investor's Business Daily notes, while the design is in, the ""final decision on the plane's color won't be approved until 2021, and if Trump loses his re-election bid the change could be scrapped.""
Trump's Jackie O comments have inspired several headlines and a lot of responses online, many of which include risque photos of Melania from her modeling days and cheap shots at the first lady. While some agreed that both women are stylish and beautiful, others were incensed at the comparison. Some noted that Jackie Kennedy only became ""Jackie O"" after Kennedy was assassinated and she got remarried to Aristotle Onassis, a Greek shipping magnate. Others portrayed Melania in derisive terms. Here are some of the more PG-13 reactions:
""Both these ladies are very stylish, there have been comparisons since day one these are probably the two most fashionable first ladies the country has ever had!"" wrote one Melania fan. ""Very stylish,"" said one twitterer, who included some sensual shots of Melania. ""He ... refers to his wife as 'it?'"" one critic asked, a question several others posted. ""As a matter of fact, I see the comparison,"" one guy wrote, including some more hot pics of the first lady. ""Too bad he can't be more like Jackie's first husband,"" one critic quipped. ""Does he not realize that she became 'Jackie O' after her first husband was assassinated and she married a Greek billionaire?"" wrote another. (That post prompted one fellow critic to suggest she wanted Trump assassinated, writing , ""Let’s hope one of those things happen for Melania as well."") Both these ladies are very stylish, there have been comparisons since day one these are probably the two most fashionable first ladies the country has ever had!"
Steve Scalise Was Shot Two Years Ago Today. Why Is The Media So Silent On The Anniversary?,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48434/steve-scalise-was-shot-two-years-ago-today-why-josh-hammer,"DailyWire.com Steve Scalise Was Shot Two Years Ago Today. Why Is The Media So Silent On The Anniversary? Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Today marks the two-year anniversary of the nearly fatal shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) on a baseball field in Virginia. The shooter, who will not be named as a matter of Daily Wire company policy , was revealed to be a Bernie Sanders campaign- volunteering hard leftist who thought Republicans deserved to die for their alleged sins committed against the American people. This is not an exaggeration — it was all but made clear as an express motivation . To be sure, no one whatsoever was to blame for the shooter's actions other than the shooter himself — human beings are discrete actors and, absent direct incitement or agitation to violence, we each possess individual culpability and bear responsibility for only our own actions.
But perhaps because the shooter was a leftist and the target was a notable Republican, the media coverage today, on the two-year anniversary, seems rather ... sparse. CNN and The Hill have anniversary pieces, but a quick survey of the mainstream media landscape reveals not too many other entries. CNN's write-up is straightforward enough:
On June 14, 2017, a man who posted online about hating conservatives and President Donald Trump fired a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic handgun at Republican lawmakers, staff and coaches practicing for an upcoming charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia. The shooter fired at least 70 rounds before he was killed.
Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana was gravely wounded, and his determined recovery has been widely reported on, but for the four others who were struck by bullets and shrapnel, their road to recovery has been largely out of the spotlight in the years since the attack.
Scalise himself furthermore tweeted earlier today: ""Two years ago, my colleagues and I were attacked while practicing for a charity baseball game, simply because we’re Republicans. Thanks to countless heroes, miracles, and prayers, I’m still here today getting to do the job I love in Congress—and play a little baseball."" Two years ago, my colleagues and I were attacked while practicing for a charity baseball game, simply because we’re Republicans. Thanks to countless heroes, miracles, and prayers, I’m still here today getting to do the job I love in Congress—and play a little baseball. pic.twitter.com/4DWeeFrc76 — Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) June 14, 2019
Still, fully accepting the premise of individual culpability for one's own actions, the inescapable reality of the facts surrounding this shooting is that a deranged socialist went on a kamikaze mission to go shoot up as many Republicans as he possibly could. Against that backdrop, and surveying the relative paucity of media coverage today on the shooting's two-year anniversary, one must naturally wonder: How differently would this anniversary be covered if the shooter had been wearing a MAGA hat and had specifically targeted not Republicans, but Democrats?
The thought experiment seems to answer itself. It goes without saying that our myopic fourth estate, which is comprised of 90+% registered Democrats , is ultimately but one of many instruments wielded by our broader bi-coastal clerisy — our supercilious ruling class that deigns to govern the misbegotten heartland yokels. Alternative history speculations are ultimately just that — speculations. And, to be sure, we can never know for sure how exactly subsequent media coverage would have transpired had the political and partisan identities of the involved actors been reversed. But we can make an educated guess that there would surely be more mainstream media coverage on the two-year anniversary of a brazen attempt to assassinate a sitting U.S. congressman if the identities had been reversed. And the fact that we can so easily make such an educated guess ought to be distressing."
Local Anytime Fitness Blasted For This Fat-Shaming Promotional Email,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48430/anytime-fitness-blasted-body-shaming-promotional-paul-bois,"Local Anytime Fitness Blasted For This Fat-Shaming Promotional Email ""I want to call it what it is… FAT."" Gilles Mingasson / Contributor / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
A Connecticut location for the gym Anytime Fitness has been taking a good deal of heat on social media for sending out a promotional email that fat-shamed people into working out.
According to Fox News , a woman was ""horrified"" to receive an email from the gym that urged her to ""pinch"" and ""grab"" her body's love-handles to shame her into joining the gym just in time to get her summer bikini bod going.
""I...am horrified by this promotional email from @AnytimeFitness ,"" said Mora Reinka on Twitter. ""I just don’t even know where to begin.""
Reinka shared the email earlier this week, titled ""Be comfortable in your skin this summer."" Her post has since gone viral with 1,300 likes and 260 comments. I...am horrified by this promotional email from @AnytimeFitness . I just don’t even know where to begin pic.twitter.com/6DOBq9sfiI — Mora Reinka (@MoraReinka) June 12, 2019
""Mora, I need you to do me a favor,"" the email began. ""Think about the warm days of summer ahead. Warm summer night breezes. Lake or beach time. Seeing family (the ones you like). Spending more time with the kiddos (also the ones you like.). Listening to music. Shorts, bathing suits, flip flips. The smell of suntan lotion.""
“And LOTS of pictures of you that will be posted online forever,"" the email continued. ""LOTS of sucking in, side turns, skinny arm posts, and God forbid, a side [picture] while sitting down. Do me a second favor: Take your hand, and grab the excess you have on your waist (front/back/sides). Can you pinch it? Or can you grab it? Well, I want to call it what it is… FAT.""
""Apparently nowadays I gotta be politically correct. Maybe I should say 'adipose tissue,'"" the email concluded.
Yahoo Lifestyle reports that the owner of the gym's Manchester location sent the email to Reinka, who had stopped attending Anytime Fitness two years ago.
After serious backlash on social media, a spokesperson for Anytime Fitness later told Fox News that the company found the email both appalling and ""insensitive.""
""We are appalled by the message that an Anytime Fitness franchisee sent to several former members of his gym. The message was the polar opposite of how we coach our franchisees to communicate with the public,” Mark Daly, national media director of Anytime Fitness, told Fox News. ""We’re proud of the fact that Anytime Fitness has rightly earned a reputation as a gym that supports and encourages its members. The owners and staff at thousands of Anytime gyms worldwide genuinely care about the well-being of their members and strive to assist them in improving their quality of life.""
Daly asserted to Fox News that the individual franchisee sent the email in jest to people urging them into joining the gym and did not have corporate backing.
""This particular franchisee thought he was being clever in motivating former members to re-join his gym. He was wrong. He was insensitive,"" Daly continued. ""We told him so, in no uncertain terms, and he apologized – promising not to repeat his errors. Our corporate staff spent much of the day yesterday apologizing to those who were offended by the franchisee’s message. I imagine we will continue to do the same today."""
Alyssa Milano Releases Abortion Map On Where Hollywood Should And Should Not Film,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48427/alyssa-milano-releases-abortion-map-where-paul-bois,"Alyssa Milano Releases Abortion Map On Where Hollywood Should And Should Not Film ""Those in our industry need to be able to make informed choices."" Rich Fury / Staff / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Since her proposed ""sex strike"" failed to keep pro-life states from passing several bills either banning or strictly limiting the cruel practice of abortion, actress Alyssa Milano has now created a tool that will help filmmakers determine where they should and should not film potential projects.
In a mission statement exclusively shared with Variety , Alyssa Milano and fellow activist Ben Jackson said the new survey will enable production companies to select states and locations that give helpful tax credits while being supposedly ""safe"" places for women to work.
""Following the passage of a number of draconian attacks on a pregnant person’s right to choose in 2019, including those in states in which the motion picture and television industries conduct significant business, it has become apparent that those in our industry need to be able to make informed choices,"" the mission statement said.
The state-by-state abortion map took a month for the actress to assemble in cooperation with the National Assn. for the Repeal of Abortion Laws and the political encyclopedia Ballotpedia. The states have been color-coded according to the threat-level of anti-abortion laws, ranging from ""most threatened"" to ""under threat"" to ""least threatened."" From Variety:
In Colorado, for instance, productions get a 20% tax credit on qualified expenditures as long as 50% of crew members are state residents. Colorado also has no major pending abortion laws or existing bans, so that state gets a “least threatened” grade. Florida, on the other hand, has introduced the notion of a six-week abortion ban and currently has no tax incentive for film and TV. The survey looks exclusively at abortion law, though other human rights issues like LGBTQ equality have previously threatened production in places like North Carolina.
Milano will also be working in concert with Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms to develop a mobile app that will enable film location scouts in Georgia to avoid conservative areas, or places that the actress says will ""fund voter suppression, inequality and the stripping away of anyone’s rights.""
""I asked if there was a version we could create with maps to the block of people that support a progressive policy, versus homes that are supporting a hurtful policy,"" Milano said. ""Can we use these to pinpoint in red states where it is safe for productions to spend their money? She thought it was a brilliant idea.""
Milano claims her idea for the app came while shooting the show ""Insatiable"" this past month outside of Atlanta, where producers rented a house from a conservative homeowner.
""I walk into this house that someone owns and rents out for production, and in front of the sink is a ‘Brian Kemp for Governor’ kitchen mat,’"" she said. ""So I think to myself, every time we shoot on location outside of Atlanta, we are funding a hurtful policy.""
""The original idea was to prevent Gov. Kemp from signing this bill,"" she said of her efforts. ""We in the entertainment industry pride ourselves on inclusivity, equality and choice. All of these really symbolic, important things that we understand become a beacon for the country to follow suit,” she concluded, noting that her research helps serve “this very tricky balance of not wanting to ever cause families harm in the state of Georgia, but being aware enough to know that the only thing that changes the state of policy is usually money."""
Dershowitz Would ‘Enthusiastically’ Endorse Biden Over Trump,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48421/dershowitiz-would-enthusiastically-endorse-biden-paul-bois,"Dershowitz Would ‘Enthusiastically’ Endorse Biden Over Trump ""You’re not going to vote for Donald Trump, are you?"" John Lamparski / Stringer / Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Despite spending the past three years defending President Trump from calls for impeachment by leftists, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz would still ""enthusiastically"" support Joe Biden in 2020 race.
Speaking with Dan Abrams on SiriusXM , Dershowitz said his support for President Trump in 2020 depends on who gets the Democratic nomination. In the case of Bernie Sanders, the Harvard Law professor admitted that he would be in ""a real dilemma.""
""You’re not going to vote for Donald Trump, are you?"" Abrams asked Dershowitz, according to Fox News .
""It depends who runs against him,"" Dershowitz said. ""If Bernie Sanders is nominated, that would present a real dilemma for me.""
""And what if the candidate is Joe Biden?"" Abrams shot back.
""I’m a strong supporter of Joe Biden,"" Dershowitz responded. ""I like Joe Biden. I’ve liked him for a long time and I could enthusiastically support Joe Biden.""
""Over Donald Trump?"" asked Abrams.
""Over Donald Trump, yeah,"" Dershowitz concluded.
The fact that Dershowitz would still support a Democrat over President Trump in 2020 illustrates the Harvard Law professor's commitment to liberal ideas over party politics. Throughout the entire Mueller investigation, as Democrats were calling for the president's impeachment over alleged Russian collusion, Dershowitz stood firm in his conviction that every American deserves civil liberties, including and especially Americans with whom he disagrees. Just by merely sticking up for President Trump's rights as an American, Dershowitz claimed he faced intense scrutiny and ostracization from his liberal friends.
""I am a liberal Democrat in politics … but that is not good enough for some of my old friends on Martha’s Vineyard. For them, it is enough that what I have said about the Constitution might help Trump. So they are shunning me and trying to ban me from their social life on Martha’s Vineyard,"" he wrote in an op-ed last year.
Later, Dershowitz would go on to say that his social ostracization was actually a blessing, referring to it as a ""red badge of courage.""
""The idea that some of these people aren’t talking to me is not a punishment, it’s a great reward. I am so pleased,"" he said on WABC in July of last year as the Mueller investigation kicked into high gear. ""It’s a red badge of courage for me that there are some people who prefer to shut down debate and not talk to me.""
""These are people who have asked me for help over the years, who have asked me for support when their kid gets busted on a marijuana charge, or on possession of alcohol, I’m the first one they call,"" he continued. ""But as soon as I defend the rights of Donald Trump or anybody else they disagree with, I’m am a pariah.""
Just recently, when the Mueller investigation finally came to a close, Dershowitz severely criticized the special counsel for having a bias toward President Trump.
""Until today, I have defended Mueller against the accusations that he is a partisan,"" Dershowitz wrote in an op-ed. ""I did not believe that he personally favored either the Democrats or the Republicans, or had a point of view on whether President Trump should be impeached. But I have now changed my mind. By putting his thumb, indeed his elbow, on the scale of justice in favor of impeachment based on obstruction of justice, Mueller has revealed his partisan bias. He also has distorted the critical role of a prosecutor in our justice system."""
"VIDEO: Deputy 'Pushed, Struck In Face' By Raptors President; Online Response Turns Racial",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48432/video-deputy-pushed-struck-face-raptors-president-james-barrett,"June 14, 2019 views
A post-game confrontation caught on video involving the Toronto Raptors president and a Sheriff's deputy has triggered an investigation. In a statement Friday morning, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office confirmed that it is pursuing a misdemeanor complaint against the president of the Toronto Raptors.
""We can confirm our deputy was pushed and struck by a Raptors executive after he asked him for his credentials to go on the court at the end of the game,"" Sgt. Ray Kelly with the Alameda County Sheriff's Office said in a statement first reported by NBC Bay Area. ""We are working with the Oakland Police Department to file a report and contact witnesses and review video.""
The incident between the officer and the executive, identified as Raptors President Masai Ujiri, took place after the Raptors defeated the Golden State Warriors in Game 6 in Oracle Arena Thursday night, a victory that secured Ujiri's team the championship. Law enforcement says Ujiri shoved and struck an officer in the face after he was stopped from joining the team on the court for the championship celebration. Ujiri, they say, failed to show them the required credential.
Video published by NBC Bay Area's Kristofer Noceda shows Ujiri appear to shove an officer, which results in a chaotic moment where a man, who presumably works with the team, attempts to keep the officers from taking action against Ujiri.
""Sheriff's deputy reportedly pushed and struck in the face by a man believed to be a Toronto Raptors executive after Game 6 of the #NBAFinals at Oracle Arena, @ACSOSheriffs says,"" Noceda tweeted Thursday night. NBC's Raj Mathai added in a follow-up post: ""Raptors exec (believed to be Team President Masai Ujiri) involved in courtside altercation after the game. @ACSOSheriffs say he hit a deputy in the face. We're waiting response from @NBA."" #BREAKING : Sheriff's deputy reportedly pushed and struck in the face by a man believed to be a Toronto Raptors executive after Game 6 of the #NBAFinals at Oracle Arena, @ACSOSheriffs says. https://t.co/fobdK9iWEq pic.twitter.com/a4X0IysY5Z — Kristofer Noceda (@krisnoceda) June 14, 2019 #EXCLUSIVE : #Raptors exec (believed to be Team President Masai Ujiri) involved in courtside altercation after the game. @ACSOSheriffs say he hit a deputy in the face. We're waiting response from @NBA . #NBAFinals https://t.co/iCIXWuPjqi — Raj Mathai (@rajmathai) June 14, 2019
Ujiri appears to be holding what may be his credential in his right hand; another video showing Ujiri waiting in the tunnel before the incident also appears to show him holding the credential, USA Today reports. The outlet notes, however, that NBA rules specify that ""only personnel with specially designated gold armbands were allowed on the court after the conclusion of the game, and it's unclear if Ujiri was wearing one or had one in his possession.""
Response online to Noceda's post of the video online immediately became racially charged, with several responders assuming the deputy's actions were racially motivated. ""If the sheriffs have a clue, they will back the hell down, chalk it up to a mistake on both sides and move along. No doubt they laid hands first, and I bet it was because they could never fathom a black man was the president of a team,"" wrote one responder. ""Black man with an African accent...cop probably still doesn’t believe it,"" wrote another.
Some came to the officer's defense. ""Switch it up tho, say he’s just some rando in a suit and gets into it with, or assaults, a player out there and then cop says 'oh I saw him but he said he was the team prez and had a nice suit on so I let him through.' Then where we at?"" tweeted one defender. But most weren't so willing to give a white officer the benefit of the doubt. ""But how can he not know who the opposing team's president is, especially knowing the possibility of an on court celebration of the Raptors win?? That would just be gross negligence on the staff at Oracle to have not been prepared for that regardless!"" one person fired back ."
HAMMER: Don’t Let Kim Kardashian Fool You. America Has An UNDER-Incarceration Problem.,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48431/hammer-dont-let-kim-kardashian-fool-you-america-josh-hammer,"June 14, 2019 views
Kim Kardashian was back at the White House this week to peddle her pernicious ""criminal justice reform"" agenda. While Kardashian's passion about helping ex-felons reintegrate into society may be well-intentioned, the cold truth is that an absolutely staggering 83% of state prisoners are re-arrested within nine years of their release. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), furthermore, the so-called ""low-level drug offenders"" that Kardashian and much of the weak-on-crime/jailbreak cartel so aggressively promote are, in fact, also huge recidivism risks for acts of violent crime :
Overall, 68 percent of released state prisoners were arrested within three years, 79 percent within six years and 83 percent within nine years. The 401,288 released state prisoners were arrested an estimated 2 million times during the nine years after their release, an average of five arrests per released prisoner. ...
More than three-quarters (77 percent) of released drug offenders were arrested for a non-drug crime within nine years, and more than a third (34 percent) were arrested for a violent crime.
The risk of recidivism is not just a fantasy concocted by law-and-order conservatives — it is very, very real.
But the broader reality is that weak-on-crime political operatives often operate under misleading or disingenuous premises. As Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) pointed out at National Review in the debate leading up to a vote on the White House-supported ""First Step Act"" criminal justice reform jailbreak bill, this ""low-level drug offender""-centric law actually allows for early prison release for a veritable hodgepodge of thugs — everyone from dangerous weapon-wielding robbers to law enforcement officer assaulters to violent carjackers to traffickers of fentanyl, a narcotic so potent that a sugar packet-sized dose could kill a whole room. The general profiles of these miscreants would more readily resemble MS-13 brutes than they would the ""low-level drug offenders"" that the weak-on-crime sycophants would have you believe are the true target of ""reform.""
Far from having a general over-incarceration problem, the United States in the year 2019 actually has an under -incarceration problem — especially for violent criminals and mid-high level drug traffickers. As Sen. Cotton argued in 2016, the actual percentage of violent criminals even arrested — let alone prosecuted and subsequently convicted — is harrowingly low: ""Law enforcement is able to arrest or identify a likely perpetrator for only 19 percent of property crimes and 47 percent of violent crimes. If anything, we have an under-incarceration problem."" Indeed, according to 2017 FBI Uniform Crime Reporting statistics , the number of cases uncleared by law enforcement in a given year is astonishing: 6,013 murder cases, 79,310 rape cases, 206,091 robbery cases, and 349,190 aggravated assault cases in 2017 alone.
The good news, from a broader perspective, is that crime in America has indeed dramatically plummeted over the past few decades. According to Pew , citing FBI statistics, violent crime fell 49% between 1993 and 2017. That is outstanding news and ought to be applauded. But as Pew also notes , violent crime actually recently rose from 2014–2016. Furthermore, BJS's 2017 National Crime Victimization Survey showed a ""statistically significant increase"" in violent crime victims from 2015–2017.
Distressingly, this recent increase in violent crime has coincided with a continued hollowing out of America's prison population. As psychology professors Keith Humphreys and Richard Lane observed in April, in focusing solely upon the black subset of our prison population, ""the African American male imprisonment rate has dropped by a third since its peak and is now at a level not seen since 1991. African American women’s rate of imprisonment has dropped 57 percent from its peak and is now at a 30-year low."" Amazingly, Pew actually noted last year that America's total incarcerated population is now at a two decade -low :
At the end of 2016, there were about 2.2 million people behind bars in the U.S., including 1.5 million under the jurisdiction of federal and state prisons and roughly 741,000 in the custody of locally run jails. That amounts to a nationwide incarceration rate of 860 prison or jail inmates for every 100,000 adults ages 18 and older.
The nation’s incarceration rate peaked at 1,000 inmates per 100,000 adults during the three-year period between 2006 and 2008. It has declined every year since then and is now at its lowest point since 1996, when there were 830 inmates per 100,000 adults.
The generally tough-on-crime policies of the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton presidencies blessed this country with decades of relative tranquility. Why on earth would we risk throwing that away to satisfy law enforcement officer assaulters and MS-13 fentanyl traffickers? Why on earth would we now be further hollowing out the nation's prison population, amidst a two-decade low in the prison population and recent increases, contrary to the longstanding trend, of increased violent crime?
On the contrary, now is the time to double down on giving law enforcement the resources they need to arrest more violent criminals and on giving prosecutors the resources they need to charge and ultimately convict more violent criminals. There are far, far too many violent criminals and drug traffickers who get off scot-free.
Now is not the time to be hoodwinked by perhaps well-intentioned, but nonetheless naive, promoters of the weak-on-crime and jailbreak agenda. And as for President Donald Trump, he should stop appeasing weak-on-crime libertarians within his White House and quickly retreat to his 2016 campaign-era rhetoric on drugs and crime. He had it right back then. This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou — Donald J.

She Claimed He Raped Her In A Public Place Yet No One Heard. An Appellate Judge Just Saved His Life.,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48426/she-claimed-he-raped-her-public-place-yet-no-one-ashe-schow,"First Amendment DailyWire.com She Claimed He Raped Her In A Public Place Yet No One Heard. An Appellate Judge Just Saved His Life. Gorfer June 14, 2019 views
In 2016, a male West Point cadet was accused of raping a female cadet in her sleeping bag while the two – and others – were participating in summer field training.
The male cadet, who will not be identified by The Daily Wire, was convicted in a West Point star chamber of three counts of sexual assault and sentenced to 21 years in prison. Last week, while his attorneys argued for a reduced sentence, a military appeals court completely reversed the ruling against him, released him from prison, and returned him to the academy.
The reason was that the alleged rape was so improbable, and the evidence so thin, that a conviction should not have occurred.
The woman claimed the male cadet raped her while she was in her sleeping bag. Others were around, but she said she froze in fear (a widely used claim by those making sexual assault accusations these days) when she awoke to find the male cadet assaulting her. He allegedly assaulted her despite how easily it would have been to be caught by nearby squad members. That’s what the judges found so difficult to comprehend.
“It is hard to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant could complete the charged offenses without cooperation or detection,” the panel of three judges wrote, according to The Associated Press. “It is even harder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant would anticipate that (the woman) would not make any reflexive noise or movements upon being awakened, which would have alerted multiple others to his criminal activity.”
The male cadet had said the encounter was consensual and that both he and the female cadet took steps to conceal their affair by remaining quiet.
The appeal panel further wrote that a rape was implausible because of how easily the woman have been able to identify the male cadet.
“Furthermore,” the judges wrote, “appellant left his semen on (the woman’s) bivy cover, and there is no evidence that he tried to remove this evidence.”
Cadets are barred from having sex during field training.
Attorney Scott Greenfield wrote that each side presented competing narratives at trial, and that “Given the conflicting testimony, it would be fair to assume that the cadet was acquitted, as even under the civil preponderance of the evidence standard, there was nothing to suggest one side outweighed the other.”
But we are in a world where an accusation holds more weight than evidence (or lack thereof) or common sense, so the man was convicted.
The male cadet served 25 months of his sentence before the appellate court reversed an earlier court’s decision.
Naturally, activists like Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who’s never seen an accusation she didn’t believe, called the appeals court’s decision loss for “survivors.”
“I am extremely concerned that the panel’s reasoning reflects an outdated understanding about the nature of sexual assault and may deter reporting by survivors,” she said.
Gillibrand’s claims reflect an absurd reading of reality, insisting that any action an accuser takes (whether its lying or conveniently “freezing” or sending thankful text messages after the encounter) is evidence of sexual assault merely because the accusation exists."
Trump Gives Classic Trumpian Assessment Of Democratic Presidential Field,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48418/trump-gives-classic-trumpian-assessment-democratic-joseph-curl,"Trump Gives Classic Trumpian Assessment Of Democratic Presidential Field MANDEL NGAN / Contributor / Getty Images
One thing President Trump is not is a word mincer.
The president appeared Friday on his favorite morning TV show, ""Fox and Friends,"" and gave his very blunt assessment on some of the candidates currently running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
First up was Joe Biden. Trump questioned the former vice president's ""mental capacity"" and declared Biden ""doesn't have what it takes.""
Host Steve Doocy asked Trump what he meant that Biden ""doesn't have what it takes.""
""It means mental capacity, it means a lot of different things. He never did have what it takes,"" said Trump, adding that he has referred to Biden as ""one percent Joe"" after his two previous failed bids for the Democratic nomination.
""Everybody knows that Joe Biden does not have what it takes,"" Trump said. ""He ran two or three times. I used to call him '1% Joe' because he never got more than 1%. Then Obama came along and, surprisingly, took him off of, I say, the trash heap.""
Trump then moved on to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whom he called ""Pocahontas"" for her longtime false claims to be a Native American. The president said she's finally starting to move up in the polls — from single digits to barely double digits — and added he'd ""love to run against her.""
""I see that Pocahontas is doing better. I would love to run against her, frankly,"" Trump said.
Trump also mentioned Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist from Vermont. ""I see that Bernie Sanders is not doing well at all,"" Trump summed up.""I would've frankly liked to have run against—"" Trump began before breaking off.
But he said Biden, Warren, and Sanders are the top contenders. ""I think it’s probably those three. I don’t see the other ones. I really don’t see it.""
Then, as he does, he went through a few of the other wannabes anyway, like California Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana.
""They talk about Kamala, I don't see Kamala. ... Mayor Pete, I don't see at all, I think that's a joke, Mayor Pete,"" said Trump.
The president, who formally kicks off his re-election campaign Tuesday in Orlando, Florida, dismissed polls that show him trailing in some key states.
""Well, the polls I see, we're doing great in Pennsylvania, we're doing really good in North Carolina, and in Florida I'm winning by a lot. Ohio I'm winning by a lot. I just left Iowa, we're winning that by a lot. And every poll that I see and every poll that we have, we're doing well,"" Trump said. He added that he's also polling well in Michigan and Wisconsin, two states that have traditionally voted for Democrats but went Republican in 2016.
Democrats will hold their first debates on June 26 and 27 in Miami. There are 23 candidates and each had to achieve at least a 1% score on three specific polls. That left three Democrats out of the debates — Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam."
DeSantis Follows Through: Will Sign Bill Today Banning Sanctuary Cities,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48423/desantis-follows-through-will-sign-bill-today-hank-berrien,"DeSantis Follows Through: Will Sign Bill Today Banning Sanctuary Cities Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
Fulfilling a promise he made when he successfully campaigned for governor in 2018, on Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will sign into law a bill that will ban sanctuary cities in Florida. The bill, which was passed on May 2 by both the Florida House and Senate, was sent to DeSantis on Thursday.
The Orlando Sentinel reported that DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Ferre sent the Sentinel an email stating: ""Earlier this year, Governor DeSantis asked the Florida Legislature to present him with meaningful legislation to uphold the rule of law and ensure that no city or county jurisdiction can get in the way of Florida’s cooperation with our federal partners to enforce immigration law. Public safety is paramount and local law enforcement agencies can and should work with the federal government to ensure that accountability and justice are one in our state.""
The Sentinel noted that supporters of the bill have urged local governments and law-enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration detainers and share information with federal immigration authorities once illegal immigrants have been detained.
The bill, SB 168 , flatly states, “A state entity, law enforcement agency, or local governmental entity may not adopt or have in effect a sanctuary policy.”
The bill explains exactly what that entails:
“Sanctuary policy” means a law, policy, practice, procedure, or custom adopted or allowed by a state entity or local governmental entity which prohibits or impedes a law enforcement agency from complying with 8 U.S.C. s. 1373 or which prohibits or impedes a law enforcement agency from communicating or cooperating with a federal immigration agency so as to limit such law enforcement agency in, or prohibit the agency from:
(a) Complying with an immigration detainer;
(b) Complying with a request from a federal immigration agency to notify the agency before the release of an inmate or detainee in the custody of the law enforcement agency;
(c) Providing a federal immigration agency access to an inmate for interview;
(d) Participating in any program or agreement authorized under section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s. 1357; or
(e) Providing a federal immigration agency with an inmate’s incarceration status or release date.
In May, DeSantis warned the U.S. Border Patrol not to transfer illegal immigrants to Broward and Palm Beach counties. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and Broward Mayor Mark Bogen had stated that U.S. Border Patrol said that two planeloads of immigrants would be transferred to those counties each week, roughly 500 per month to each county. DeSantis said he was going to communicate with President Trump, according to the Orlando Sentinel , asserting, “Nothing’s concrete. There’s been no migrants brought, released, in Florida. This was not something that came down from the White House. This is something that came out of the agency. Sometimes this stuff happens. Ultimately this is something I’m going to have to talk to the president about. We cannot accommodate in Florida just dumping unlawful migrants into our state. I think it’ll tax our resources, schools and health care, law enforcement, state agencies.”
Fox News noted, “Nine states -- they are Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas -- have passed laws requiring law enforcement to cooperate with ICE.”"
Britain Bans Ads Containing ‘Harmful Gender Stereotypes’,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48422/britain-bans-ads-containing-harmful-gender-ashe-schow,"Britain Bans Ads Containing ‘Harmful Gender Stereotypes’ Jacobs Stock Photography Ltd June 14, 2019 views
Scenes in commercials that could offend the most sensitive of Britons are now banned in Britain.
The Agence France-Presse reported that a ban took effect Friday that keeps “harmful gender stereotypes” out of ads, including scenes depicting a woman who can’t park or a man who can’t change a diaper. Other potentially “harmful” stereotypes, such as women cleaning or men fixing things around the home, will remain, the Presse reported.
“Our evidence shows how harmful gender stereotypes in ads can contribute to inequality in society, with costs for all of us,"" said Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) chief executive Guy Parker in a statement . ""Put simply, we found that some portrayals in ads can, over time, play a part in limiting people's potential.”
“It's in the interests of women and men, our economy and society that advertisers steer clear of these outdated portrayals, and we're pleased with how the industry has already begun to respond,"" Parker added.
ASA, the U.K’s regulator of advertising, identified a 2017 ad for Aptamil baby milk formula as “problematic” because it depicted a little girl growing up to be a ballerina and little boys growing up to be engineers and mountain climbers, according to the Presse.
ASA’s new guidelines list a number of scenarios “likely to be problematic,” including: An ad that depicts a man with his feet up and family members creating mess around a home while a woman is solely responsible for cleaning up the mess. An ad that depicts a man or a woman failing to achieve a task specifically because of their gender e.g. a man’s inability to change nappies; a woman’s inability to park a car. Where an ad features a person with a physique that does not match an ideal stereotypically associated with their gender, the ad should not imply that their physique is a significant reason for them not being successful, for example in their romantic or social lives. An ad that seeks to emphasise the contrast between a boy’s stereotypical personality (e.g. daring) with a girl’s stereotypical personality (e.g. caring) needs to be handled with care. An ad aimed at new mums which suggests that looking attractive or keeping a home pristine is a priority over other factors such as their emotional wellbeing. An ad that belittles a man for carrying out stereotypically ‘female’ roles or tasks.
Other gender stereotypes are not considered problematic, according to ASA, including: A woman doing the shopping or a man doing DIY. Glamorous, attractive, successful, aspirational or healthy people or lifestyles. One gender only, including in ads for products developed for and aimed at one gender. Gender stereotypes as a means to challenge their negative effects.
If some of these scenarios seem contradictory or confusing, too bad. ASA has “evidence” of harmful effects.
Rules like this inherently treat all people as idiots who can’t think for themselves. It assumes girls are too dumb or easily brainwashed to determine they can become an engineer or that men are too ignorant to believe they can do the dishes.
The Committee of Advertising Practice, which works with ASA, will review the effects of the new policy in 12 months to see if it has had any success."
WATCH: Cuba Gooding Jr. Arrested For Alleged Groping. Here's Footage Of The Incident.,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48408/watch-cuba-gooding-jr-arrested-alleged-groping-amanda-prestigiacomo,"June 14, 2019 views
Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was arrested Thursday for allegedly groping a woman at a Manhattan bar on Sunday. The actor pleaded not guilty to one misdemeanor account of forcible touching and was released without bail.
Attorney Mark J. Heller, representing Mr. Gooding, told reporters that his client is ""completely confident” and ""will be totally exonerated,” according to The New York Post .
""There is not a scintilla of criminal culpability that can be attributed to Cuba Gooding Jr.,"" Heller said, adding that he was ""shocked and horrified"" about the prosecution of Gooding even after police were provided surveillance footage of the alleged incident.
On Tuesday, Gooding told TMZ that the surveillance video from the bar would exonerate him; it will show ""what really happened, and that's the most important thing,"" he said.
The surveillance video in question was obtained by TMZ. At around 10:15 p.m. the accuser (whose face has been blurred to keep her anonymity) sits down next to Gooding and his girlfriend Claudine De Niro at the Magic Hour Rooftop Lounge New York City. ""Almost immediately you see Gooding reach over Claudine and place his hand on the woman's left thigh,"" the outlet reported (video, below). ""A few seconds later his hand moves up to her breast, and the accuser puts her hand on his. What happens next is open to interpretation -- she either pushes his hand back toward him, or he pulls her hand to his mouth and kisses it.""
Then an unidentified man walks over and talks to Gooding, De Niro, and the accuser; the group soon talks seemingly without any argument.
""However, about 30 minutes later ... Cuba and Claudine were downstairs lounging on a couch and making out. A man, who we're told works security for the bar, was standing next to the couch when the accuser approached him and started arguing,"" TMZ noted. ""We've blurred her face to protect her identity, but she appears to say, ‘Yes, he did.’ She repeated that after the security guard shook his head. It's unclear if Cuba heard their conversation, but he got up, stumbled and then walked right past the accuser and left.""
In 2017, Gooding responded to accusations of sexual misconduct after he lifted the skirt of actress Sarah Paulson, a friend and ""American Horror Story"" colleague of the actor’s, at a promotional event with a live audience.
""I love the lady that is Sarah Paulson,"" Gooding responded, according to HuffPost . ""We have a banter like brother and sister, which is how the spirit of that whole panel was.""
""Yet that image was taken out to represent some kind of sexual misconduct, and that wasn’t my intent,"" he continued. ""The first person, when I heard about the fervor, I called Sarah, I said, 'I love you, I see you as my sister,' and she said, ‘I feel the same way about you.’ And so I let it go.""
The Oscar winner described the mishap as a ""'teachable moment' for his sons, who are in college, about how images can be misinterpreted on the internet,"" noted HuffPost."
KNOWLES: Trump's Foreign Government Comment A 'Bad Political Look'; Democrats Actions Far Worse,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48414/knowles-trumps-foreign-govt-comment-bad-political-daily-wire,"June 14, 2019 views
On Thursday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,” the host discusses President Donald Trump’s answer on whether or not he would turn over documents from a foreign government regarding political opponents. Video and partial transcript below.
It's a bad look to say, ""Yeah, I want foreign governments to give me dirt on my opponents."" You don't want to encourage them to give you dirt on your opponents because then you owe the foreign governments. And by the way, Trump didn't do this. He's putting himself into this hypothetical situation that he's going to be criticized for that he didn't even do. It's just a bad political look.
Now the left and the anti-Trump right are in hysterics and they're saying he's not a patriot and he's a traitor to his country. That's not the issue. The actual thing he's talking about isn't even the issue. Every country interferes in every other country's elections. Countries interfere with each other. They do it all the time. During the Obama administration, Barack Obama sent his senior campaign aides to Israel to try to oust Benjamin Netanyahu from power. He sent $350,000 of U.S. taxpayer money to a front organization to oust Bibi Netanyahu from power in Israel. We all interfere in each other's elections.
Still, what you don't want is for the President of the United States to accept this sort of thing and premises publicly. Because what it does, invariably, is create the impression of disloyalty to your country. That's the impression that President Trump is giving off. He's saying, yeah, I would totally accept the help of foreign governments I would incentivize foreign governments to give me dirt on American politicians.
He's not actually doing it, but actually, Democrat politicians have done this. They have gone and colluded with foreign governments to try to win elections. Ted Kennedy colluded with the Soviet Union to try to win the presidency. He was negotiating with the Soviet Union to help him get elected. So, it does happen. But why don't you say it? You don't say it because hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue. Because you don't want to create incentives. Publicly speaking, you don't want to put out on your bullhorn and say ""hey foreign governments of the world give me dirt on my opponents. Please spy on American citizens, spy on American politicians."" It's just a bad look.
The good thing you can say for President Trump in this interaction is something that I've said for a long time. Which is that President Trump is the most honest president that we've ever had. He is. Call him honest Donald. You have Honest Abe and now you can have honest Donald. Why is he the most honest president? Because President Trump brags about doing all the bad things and thinking all the bad things that all the other presidents have also done but they've hidden. He's open about it. He's honest about it. What he said is practically true. If you're the president or you're running a campaign, and someone comes up to you and says, ""We got dirt on your opponent"". Let's say it's some Norwegian lawyer.
Maybe he's got ties to the Norwegian government. He says, ""I've got a ton of dirt on your opponent"". One hundred percent of political campaigns take that meeting and take the dirt, they hear him out. As Trump said, maybe they call the FBI after maybe they don't - who knows. One hundred percent of campaigns do it.
Only this guy would actually admit to wanting to do that or to actually doing that. In some ways this is refreshing. I actually do think this has some positive effect on our political discourse because it just knocks away so much B.S. so much preening, falsehood. However, what this also means is then we need to articulate that it's bad. You don't want to incentivize foreign governments to spy on American citizens, even if they're awful American citizens like Hillary Clinton. You don't want to incentivize that. You don't want it to seem like the President of the United States is encouraging you to do that or offering you something in return. That's not a good idea. It's refreshing to hear a guy speak honestly but then it's incumbent on all the rest of us to say right that's true and that is honest, but we shouldn't do that ... don't do it."
Trump Responds To Calls To Fire Kellyanne Conway After Report She Violated Federal Law 'Numerous' Times,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48415/trump-responds-calls-fire-kellyanne-conway-after-james-barrett,"Trump Responds To Calls To Fire Kellyanne Conway After Report She Violated Federal Law 'Numerous' Times Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg via Getty Images June 14, 2019 views
A new report by a federal government watchdog issued Thursday determined that White House adviser Kellyanne Conway violated the Hatch Act — which limits political activities of federal employees — on ""numerous occasions"" by repeatedly blasting Democratic presidential candidates. For the violations, the watchdog recommended that Conway be removed. But in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" Friday, Trump made clear that's not going to happen.
""I'm not gonna fire her. I think she's a terrific person. She's a tremendous spokesperson,"" Trump told the hosts, in comments reported by Fox News.com . Trump went on to criticize the Office of Special Counsel — an independent office tasked with government oversight (unrelated to the Robert Mueller investigation) — with ""trying to take away her right of free speech"" and suggesting that he wouldn't ask her to dial back her rhetoric, saying he believes government employees should be allowed ""to express themselves.""
On Thursday, the Office of Special Counsel Henry Kerner issued a letter recommending the dismissal of Conway, citing ""numerous violations of the Hatch Act.""
""Attached to this letter is a copy of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel's (OSC) investigative report detailing numerous violations of the Hatch Act by Counsellor to the President Kellyanne Conway,"" the letter reads. ""Ms. Conway's disregard for the restrictions the Hatch Act places on executive branch employees is unacceptable. If Ms. Conway were any other federal employee, her multiple violations would almost certainly result in removal from her federal position by the Merit Systems Protection Board. As a highly visible member of the Administration, Ms. Conway's violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act's restrictions. Her actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system — the rule of law.""
The accompanying report goes on to cite examples of Conway ripping Trump's potential political opponents.
In response, White House deputy press secretary Steven Groves argued that the Special Counsel ""violate[d] her constitutional rights to free speech and due process,"" CNN reports. ""Others, of all political views, have objected to the (the office's) unclear and unevenly applied rules which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees. Its decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations — and perhaps (the Office of the Special Counsel) should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, non-political manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act,"" he said.
Counsel to the President Pat Cipollone also responded to Kerner's recommendation, which he blasted in a letter as ""a product of a fatally flawed process.""
""I write to submit an initial response to the draft Office of Special Counsel report concerning Assistant to the President and Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway...,"" the letter reads. ""The OSC's draft Report is based on multiple fundamental legal and factual errors, makes unfair and unsupported claims against a close adviser to the President, is the product of a blatantly unfair process that ignored statutory notice requirements, and has been influenced by various inappropriate considerations. As a result, the current Report would serve only to undermine public confidence in OSC and its procedures. At 5:00 pm on May 29, 2019, OSC provided the White House with a 17-page report raising numerous unsubstantiated allegations spanning many months, many of which had never been raised by OSC through the appropriate procedure. OSC then demanded a response by 9:00 a.m. the following morning. As you later acknowledged, OSC's actions were prompted by your desire to respond to press questions concerning a media report that day about comments that Ms. Conway had allegedly made and by the purported personal 'offense' that you took to those comments­ even though you made no effort to investigate before rushing to judgment. OSC's patently unreasonable demand for an overnight response, standing alone, shows that the Report was the product of a fatally flawed process."""

As CNN reported :
Perdue announced earlier Thursday morning that the Economic Research Service, which provides research and statistical analysis for lawmakers, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which allocates federal research funding, will be relocated to Kansas City from Washington, DC, the final announcement in a process that began last year.
In a letter to employees , Perdue stated:
As you all know, we have evaluated 136 expressions of interest from parties in 35 states, based upon objective criteria and mission operational needs, and conducted site visits to three areas – Kansas City, North Carolina, and Indiana. The Kansas City Region takes into account the expectations that employees wanted in a new location.
The Kansas City Region has proven itself to be a hub for all things agriculture and is a booming city in America’s heartland. There is already a significant presence of USDA and federal government employees in the region. Boasting not only a low cost of living, with high-quality, affordable housing, it has an excellent public school system and a community filled with family-oriented activities. The city itself is extremely livable, with access to arts, culture, and a thriving food scene. Our belief is that this relocation will give USDA the opportunity to attract a staff with training and interest in agriculture.
Perdue has stated that the move will save taxpayers roughly $20 million a year. He had asserted, according to Politico , “The Kansas City Region will allow ERS and NIFA to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and bring important resources and manpower closer to all of our customers. This agriculture talent pool, in addition to multiple land-grant and research universities within driving distance, provides access to a stable labor force for the future.” He added that the saved funds would permit more funding for “critical needs like rural prosperity and agricultural competitiveness,” saying that it would also allow the agencies to prosper “even in the face of tightening budgets.” He acknowledged that state and local governments had offered $26 million in incentives.
The employees turned their backs on Perdue as he tried to offer some comfort, saying:
I know that you probably already know that we announced this morning that Kansas City region’s been selected as the new home for ERS and NIFA; and throughout the process I’ve emphasized that this should never be construed in any way, shape fashion, or form as a decision based on the jobs that are being done by our ERS and NIFA employees. In fact, I often publicly and privately brag to our colleagues that USDA have the best workforce in the federal government. So this is a strategic and long-term decision for USDA as an agency.
While this is a strategic and long-term decision for USDA, I know that it’s not so much for you all. I realize that this is a real-time immediate and major change for many of you. I know that your primary concern, as expected, at this moment, is for you and your families, and I absolutely understand that. I know that you’ve been feeling a lot of stress since we announced, I think about ten months ago, our strategic plan to move ERS and NIFA out of the national capital region. I want you to know that this decision was not entered into lightly, and having recently undergone a major relocation of my own, I understand the decision creates personal disruption for some of you as well as your families.

WATCH: O'Keefe To Klavan: Big Tech Colluding To Silence Conservative Voices,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48409/okeefe-klavan-big-tech-colluding-silence-daily-wire,"June 14, 2019 views
On Thursday’s episode of “The Andrew Klavan Show,” the host speaks with James O’Keefe about how social media has been quietly censoring conservative and Christian voices, particularly O’Keefe’s revelations about Pinterest's actions to limit conservative posts. Video and partial transcript below.
James O'Keefe: A whistleblower comes to us inside of a company called Pinterest, which is a big tech company. It's a 13-billion-dollar company who had a recent IPO. And this is a whistleblower. This is someone who was willing to lose his job. He knew the risks. He gave us secret documents and since I'm on the Daily Wire one of the pieces of information in this document, I have the document in front of me. Internal employees at Pinterest were calling Ben Shapiro a ""white supremacist."" And they put Ben Shapiro, the words ""Ben"" space ""Shapiro"" space ""Islam"" or ""Muslim"". Any of those combinations of words on what they call an S.T.L. or a sensitive terms list. He shared screenshots of employees working at a high level in the company talking about how they would censor any content mentioning Ben Shapiro.
So, there's this information. There's also information that Live Action, the largest pro-life organization, the biggest pro-life media organization, they actually consider them to be ""pornography."" And also, other websites; PJ Media, Zero Hedge, all ""porn."" So, we reach out for Pinterest to comment on Monday afternoon. And Pinterest scrambles to try to cover this information up and removes Live Action from the porn domain blacklist before we published the story. We published the story. The story blows up. Drudge links to the video, and then Pinterest then places Live Action back on to the porn domain blacklist. And then after that happens Pinterest just bans Live Action. And then what happens is YouTube, which Drudge has just linked to the video of all of these exposés, YouTube bans the video, claiming that we violated a privacy violation of Pinterest and then what happens is Twitter censors us publishing the video. So, YouTube bans the video and then Pinterest informs this young man who blew the whistle that he's been placed on administrative leave. So, they didn't actually fire him. ... I think the reason why they didn't fire him is because they know that they have a lawsuit on their hands. If they fire him for blowing the whistle on what has occurred. So, an extraordinary series of events.
Andrew Klavan: That is absolutely amazing. It is absolutely amazing that social media is ganging up on you to keep you from exposing social media from ganging up on conservatives. I mean it's George Orwell, it really is. They've gone ... they've lost their minds but really not. I mean it's a strategy, right? They are trying to silence us before the 2020 election. They want Conservatism to (be silence).
James O'Keefe: This is the, his name is Eric Cochran. I mean he is a hero. We just published an interview with him. He did go on the Tucker Carlson show last night. And what's extraordinary, you listen to this guy Eric, he says I don't care about ... He was making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year working and he just gave it all up. Because he wants to draw out a dozen people like him to do what he did. And if you listen to Eric talk, Eric says this is the watershed moment. He says this is the moment. He says it's all happening. I've been doing this for 10 years. I've never had YouTube take down one of my videos. And I covertly film people, I leak documents. That's what investigative journalists do. But now what's happening is that the public, the tech companies are putting down the gauntlet and saying no, no this is a bridge too far, you're throwing the stone in Goliath's eye and it's hurting us too greatly. They would never do this to the New York Times. They would never do this to The Washington (Post). Those guys publish secret documents all the time. They publish secret documents into state secrets they publish. I don't know the documents on you and I that they have.
But that does that's not what this is about. This is about putting the line in the sand. And this young man has made the extraordinary decision to give it all up. To basically ruin his career for a cause greater than himself. I think that what's going to happen next is there's going to be a dozen people like him to blow the whistle. I don't think big tech is going to be able to stop them all.
Andrew Klavan: Well this is the thing, I mean, first of all just to unpack it just a little bit. What you exposed was they were putting Ben Shapiro but also Lila Rose and her fight against abortion, they put her as a porn site. I mean that's an amazing thing. So porn sites [are] legitimately banned from Pinterest. And they put her on a porn site. You expose that and they shut you down. I mean it's amazing.
James O'Keefe: Truth is stranger than fiction. If you wrote, you're from Hollywood, if you wrote a screenplay about this, the executive producer would throw it in the trash. That's too ridiculous. That's too cliché. I know this sounds crazy but, it's all happening. This is the moment in time, I'm not exaggerating.
Pinterest put pressure on Google. Pinterest put pressure on YouTube corporate and said this is too true. Just like from that movie The Insider. That's a metaphor for what's happening because this guy's an insider. When Al Pacino says the more true it gets the worse it gets. He sits. He talks. He courageously blows the whistle. We published the information in a responsible way. I'm not an opinion guy I'm not a pundit. I just published facts that the public had a right to know and I can't go to the New York Times, The Washington Post, because those guys hate my guts so much that they put their hatred and their passion for politics and party over the First Amendment. And the only place I have to go is YouTube and YouTube takes me down. And do you see those blue checkmark guys on Twitter giving a crap about this? No. They say off with his head. The Intercept, which is the entire purpose of The Intercept, is to publish secret documents. He's saying Facebook needs to ban O'Keefe. This is the moment, and this is the moment in time."
Oberlin Hit With $33 Million In Punitive Damages After Calling Local Baker A Racist,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,06-14-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48416/oberlin-hit-33-million-punitive-damages-after-ashe-schow,"Oberlin Hit With $33 Million In Punitive Damages After Calling Local Baker A Racist Ohio law will cap the damages at $22 million mgkaya June 14, 2019 views
Jurors awarded the family owners of a bakery maligned by Oberlin College a whopping $33.2 million in punitive damages after the school accused them of racism in 2016. The same jurors had previously demanded the school pay the owners $11.2 million in compensatory damages.
Three years ago, a black Oberlin student tried to use a fake ID to purchase a bottle of wine at Gibson’s Bakery. The store employee, the grandson of the owner and descendant of the original 1885 bakery founder, refused to sell the alcohol and noticed two more bottles of wine under the student’s shirt. When the employee, Allyn Gibson told the student, Jonathan Aladin, that he was calling the cops, Aladin knocked the phone out of Gibson’s hand and ran from the store. Gibson chased Aladin down. Aladin and the other two students with him — Cecelia Whettstone and Endia Lawrence — began hitting Gibson.
The three students were charged for their crimes and admitted in court that racial bias did not play a role in the altercation.
Oberlin students and administrators, including interim vice president and dean of students Meredith Raimondo, protested the bakery and called the owners racist. The school even broke ties with the bakery, which it had purchased goods from previously.
The Gibsons sued and were awarded $11.2 million in compensatory damages last week . In response, Oberlin’s vice president, general counsel and secretary for the college, Donica Thomas Varner, sent a community-wide email disparaging the jury and its decision, writing the jurors missed “clear evidence” that Oberlin was innocent and that the school was in fact “held liable for the independent actions of their students.”
Jurors were not allowed to see the full email , but the Gibson family’s attorney was able to get them to hear parts of it through legal maneuvers. While trying to avoid paying millions more in damages, Oberlin filed a motion for a mistrial because the jury didn’t specifically portion out the compensatory damages to each member of the Gibson family. The school also claimed it was poor and that being forced to pay the Gibson family for defaming them would hurt students.
Jurors didn’t buy the sob story and demanded Oberlin pay the Gibson family an additional $33.2 million in punitive damages. Ohio law, however, caps the amount of punitive damages to twice that of the compensatory damages, so Oberlin actually only has to pay $22 million more to the Gibsons.
“All they ever asked from the beginning, from Oberlin College, was to use its power and influence and might to tell the truth, and that letter never came,"" said the Gibson family's attorney , Lee Plakas, according to The Chronicle-Telegram. ""But the jury sent the letter that was louder and more visible and more public. I think the Gibson family is grateful for that and grateful for the jury to have the courage to be able to send a letter that no one else would send for the last almost three years.”
While Oberlin argued this judgment hurts free speech, it must be noted that there are legal consequences for free speech that involves defaming people based on knee-jerk reactions and extremist social justice views that deem any action against a black person by a white person as racist."
LIMBAUGH: Mark Levin's 'Unfreedom Of The Press' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,David Limbaugh,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47920/limbaugh-mark-levins-unfreedom-press-david-limbaugh,"June 1, 2019 views
With his latest blockbuster, ""Unfreedom of the Press,"" Mark Levin presents a unique indictment of the liberal media today — something I doubted could be done, given the plethora of material already written on this subject.
It is sweepingly comprehensive, covering the history of the American press from before the nation's founding through modern times, yet accessibly succinct — 226 pages, excluding the acknowledgments and notes.
It is tough on the mainstream media but is anything but a ranting screed. A passionate patriot, Levin says this book's purpose ""is to jump-start a long-overdue and hopefully productive dialogue among the American citizenry on how best to deal with the complicated and complex issue of the media's collapsing role as a bulwark of liberty, the civil society, and republicanism ...""
With his formidable background in constitutional law and history, Levin provides a fascinating tour of the American free press, from its indispensable role in the establishment of this republic, to its evolution through various phases that culminate in an ideologically possessed institution that is firmly aligned with one political party and is mostly hostile to America's founding principles.
The media's alliance with a political party (the Democratic Party) is not the first time we've seen this phenomenon in our history. Levin notes that from the 1780s to the 1860s (the party-press era), most newspapers aligned themselves with a politician, a campaign or a political party. But there were at least two critically important differences.
During the party-press era, ""newspapers lined up fairly evenly behind one party or the other or one candidate or the other,"" so balanced competition alone served as a safeguard against manipulation of the citizenry by a monolithic media. Also, and perhaps more important, newspapers ""transparently proclaimed their partisanship.""
Today's liberal media are wholly in the tank for the Democratic Party, but they steadfastly deny it, which facilitates their ability to deceive and indoctrinate the public. They are not on the party's payroll or subsidized by it, as some of yesterday's newspapers and journalists were, but today there is no denying ""the revolving door of journalists and/or their family members serving primarily in Democratic administrations, Democratic congressional offices, and Democratic campaigns — and vice versa.""
Levin traces the notion of objectivity in reporting to the Progressive Era in the early 1920s when the ""scientific approach to journalism"" spread through newsrooms. Journalists were urged to adopt objectivity by developing a consistent method of testing information so that personal and cultural biases would not undermine the accuracy of their reporting.
Whether there was ever an era when journalists pursued objective truth, by the 1950s, the media began to abandon that goal in favor of ""interpretive reporting"" through their progressive lenses. They don't even try to separate fact from opinion anymore; rather, they infuse every aspect of the profession with their liberal biases, including the selection, gathering and reporting of the news. There is no ideological or intellectual diversity in their newsrooms. They're all in disgraceful lockstep.
The media are so ensconced in the progressive worldview that it's sometimes difficult to tell whether they are intentionally deluding the public or deluding themselves — as they are convinced that their biased reporting meets their warped standard of objectivity. If you believe that only one political viewpoint is worthy of airing (because all other viewpoints are objectively sinister and dangerous), then you might, in a twisted way, think you are being objective by reporting only one side.
Besides, today's self-righteous liberal media elites have graduated from such trifling concerns as pursuing objective standards, while pretending to adhere to them. They have fully embraced the philosophy of progressive intellectual John Dewey, that the Progressive Movement must not squander ""the most important tool of mass communication for advancing its ideological program — a radical break from America's heritage, culture, and founding, particularly the principle of individual freedom and market capitalism."" In other words, progressives must commandeer the media and enlist their key players and soldiers to harness the incomparable power their positions afford them, engage in full-throated activism and fundamentally transform America.
Today's media would make Dewey proud. The purpose of a free press ""is to nurture the mind, communicate ideas, challenge ideologies, share notions, inspire creativity, and advocate and reinforce America's founding principles — that is, to contribute to a vigorous, productive, healthy, and happy individual and to a well-functioning civil society and republic,"" writes Levin. But today's newsrooms ""do not promote free speech and press freedom, despite their self-serving and self-righteous claims. Indeed, they serve as societal filters attempting to enforce uniformity of thought and social and political activism centered on the progressive ideology and agenda.""
Instead of pursuing these lofty goals, the media are doing the exact opposite: functioning as a propaganda tool for the Democratic Party and its ideology, thereby destroying their reason for existence and ""threatening the existence of a free republic.""
While the media and their Democratic Party colleagues breathlessly warn that President Trump is a threat to the free press, they are just projecting. Trump is simply defending himself and issuing a clarion call to Americans, warning us that the partisan media are the real threat — both to the institution of a free press and to the republic.
Levin isn't calling for government action against the press, but he is calling on us to inform ourselves of the threat they pose to our liberties and exhorting us to ""demand a media worthy of our great republic.""
Unlike the liberal media elite, I proudly admit my bias in favor of my friend Mark Levin. But trust me: You'll learn tons and be greatly enriched by this book.

"O.J. Simpson Turns Up On Twitter, Promises To 'Set The Record Straight,' 'Get Even' | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48465/oj-simpson-turns-twitter-promises-set-record-emily-zanotti,"O.J. Simpson Turns Up On Twitter, Promises To 'Set The Record Straight,''Get Even' Photo by Jason Bean-Pool/Getty Images June 16, 2019 views
Twitter got its latest controversial inhabitant Saturday; O.J. Simpson joined the social media network late last week, promising to use his new, as-yet-unverified account to ""set the record straight.""
CNN reports that Simpson kicked off his Twitter experiment with a video explaining that he believes the time has come to respond to his ""critics"" and ""set the record straight,"" though he didn't specify exactly what criticisms he hopes to address. He also suggested that he may use his newfound connection to a social media audience to ""get even.""
""You know, for years people have been able to say whatever they want to say about me with no accountability. But now I get to challenge a lot of that B.S. and set the record straight,"" Simpson says in a video, apparently shot at the home he's made for himself after leaving prison in Las Vegas, Nevada nearly two years ago.
""More importantly, I'll be able to talk about everything, especially sports and fantasy football, and even politics,"" Simpson added. ""But for now let me just say, to my fellow fathers out there: happy Father's Day.""
In the same video, Simpson claims that he's ""got a little getting even to do"": ""Coming soon to Twitter, you'll get to read all my thoughts and opinions on just about everything.""
""It should be a lot of fun,"" Simpson says. — O.J. Simpson (@TheRealOJ32) June 15, 2019
The videos are tagged as being shot in Las Vegas, even though Simpson was briefly rumored to be considering a move to Florida. And although the account, ""@TheRealOJ32"" is unverified, Simpson's attorney, Malcolm LaVergne, confirmed that the account belongs to THE O.J. Simpson and not an imposter. LaVergne was, reportedly, involved in the decision to allow Simpson onto social media.
""Mr. Simpson is the most positive person I've ever met,"" LaVergne told CNN. ""He's also very well informed on current events. He will not be negative. Nor will he comment on the LA thing. It will be one of the best accounts on Twitter to follow.""
The ""LA thing"" LaVergne is referencing is, of course, the gruesome murder of O.J.'s former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her acquaintance, Ronald Goldman. Simpson was famously acquitted of the murders, even though public opinion had largely settled on Simpson as the killer.
The murders, oddly, happened on June 12, 1994 — almost exactly 25 years before Simpson decided to ""speak out"" to a new audience. CNN adds that Monday, June 17, is the 25th anniversary of the famous slow-speed police chase where Simpson tried to run from the Los Angeles Police Department in a white Ford Bronco.
Although Simpson was ultimately found not guilty in his criminal trial, he was found responsible for Brown Simpson's and Goldman's deaths in a subsequent civil trial. Years later, Simpson was arrested and charged with kidnapping and attempted burglary for taking part in an armed robbery of a sports memorabilia store in Las Vegas. He was sentenced to up to 33 years in prison for the crime but was given parole in 2017, after serving around 9 years.
Simpson's lawyer told CNN that the former football star has spent his days since earning parole playing golf on courses in and around Las Vegas since he isn't allowed to leave the state as a condition of his early release. Now, of course, Simpson is going to have another pastime: speaking his ""truth"" on Twitter."
Catholic Nun Says Katy Perry Has ‘Blood On Her Hands’ In Convent Sale Battle | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48212/catholic-nun-says-katy-perry-has-blood-her-hands-paul-bois,"Catholic Nun Says Katy Perry Has ‘Blood On Her Hands’ In Convent Sale Battle ""I really didn’t like Katy Perry. I’m sure she doesn’t like me."" Jeff Kravitz / Contributor / Getty Images June 10, 2019 views
Katy Perry apparently had a role to play in the death of a Catholic nun over disputes regarding a Los Angeles convent, alleges the nun's best friend.
Speaking to the New York Post , Sister Rita Callanan said the legal battles with Katy Perry have yielded nothing but hell in her life, leaving her ""paralyzed, penniless and without a home.""
""I really didn’t like Katy Perry. I’m sure she doesn’t like me,"" the 81-year-old nun told the outlet.
Rita Callanan belonged to Order of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary and is now the Order's last surviving member. In 1972, the Order purchased a 30,000 square-foot Spanish/Gothic home for which it had pooled money — raising most of the funds by allowing Hollywood production companies to film on the property.
In 2011, however, the sisters claim that the Los Angeles archdiocese forced them to move and then sold the property to none other than pop singer Katy Perry in 2015. The diocese was seemingly unfazed by the fact they were selling a piece of Catholic real estate to a woman who has opposed the Church on every single cultural issue, from abortion to homosexuality to witchcraft . Since the nuns believed they should have a say as to who should inherit the property they had cultivated for nearly 40 years, they sold the property to businesswoman Dana Hollister — thus sparking a multi-year legal battle.
In 2016, a judge sided with the Los Angeles archdiocese and Katy Perry by declaring invalid the nuns' sale of the property to Hollister. Despite that, the nuns persisted until March of last year, when Sister Callanan's best friend, 89-year-old Sister Catherine Rose Holzman, collapsed and died in a Los Angeles court as they prepared to face Perry for another round of legal battles. ""Katy Perry. Please stop,"" were reportedly Sister Holzman's last words.
Sister Callanan claims the ordeal with Perry essentially killed her best friend, boldly declaring the pop icon has ""blood on her hands."" Since then, Callanan says her life has only gotten worse and that the Los Angeles archdiocese has only poured salt on an open wound. Though the nuns have made appeals to the Vatican, Callanan claims the archdiocese has been interfering through nefarious means. From the report:
Callanan claims that employees of the archdiocese then got access to Holzman’s apartment at St. John of God Retirement Home in LA.
She believes they were after correspondence between the Sisters and the Vatican about the convent.
“They took the hard drive from her personal computer, which had all the stuff from Rome on it,” Callanan said. “The following day, we learned that attorneys for the archdiocese tried to break into [Holtzman’s] mailbox and storage unit.”
A rep for the Archdiocese said that Holzman’s “family had primary responsibility for her belongings and documents, and the Archdiocese coordinated directly with them on all decisions.”
Callanan claimed the archdiocese demanded her laptop as well. “I had to get a friend to hide it,” she said.
A source told the outlet that Callanan's bank account has been under control of the archdiocese since 2011 and that the money has not been paid to her on time.
""Medical insurance, TV, her credit cards, there were always late charges, but she was too scared to speak about it. She had to borrow money from friends,"" the source said. ""She had to go to the Sister Christian Service Group to get bags of food. She had nothing in the pantry as she wasn’t getting enough money.""
""The Archdiocese doesn’t understand what they have done to these women, [or] just how devastated [the nuns] were when they kicked them out and really destroyed their community,"" the source continued.
The Los Angeles archdiocese has disputed this claim, asserting that Archbishop Gomez has seen to it these women have been cared for. ""More than 10 years ago, the Archbishop of Los Angeles undertook responsibility for their future care and well-being [at the Vatican’s behest],"" said the archdiocese. ""Since then, the Archdiocese has continuously provided ... for all the living, medical and other costs for the care of Sister Rita and all remaining [Immaculate Heart of Mary] Sisters.""
As for Katy Perry, she no longer wants the property and has put it back on the market for $25 million. The Los Angeles archdiocese told the New York Post: ""While the formal legal option on the property has expired, the Archdiocese and Ms. Perry continue to be in communication concerning her continued interest in the property.""

New Denver City Council Member: I Will Usher In Communism ‘By Any Means Necessary’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.dailywire.com/news/48468/new-denver-city-council-member-i-will-usher-ryan-saavedra,"June 16, 2019 views
Newly elected far-left Denver City Council member Candi CdeBaca has stated that she is ""excited to usher"" in communism ""by any means necessary.""
CdeBaca, who won in an upset runoff election earlier this month, said in late March during a candidate forum for City Council District 9:
I don’t believe our current economic system actually works. Um, capitalism by design is extractive and in order to generate profit in a capitalist system, something has to be exploited, that’s land, labor or resources.
And I think that we’re in late phase capitalism and we know it doesn’t work and we have to move into something new. And I believe in community ownership of land, labor, resources, and distribution of those resources.
And so, whatever that morphs into I think is what will serve community the best and I’m excited to usher it in by any means necessary. [Emphasis added]
Encyclopedia Britannica defines communism as a ""political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production (e.g., mines, mills, and factories) and the natural resources of a society.""
CdeBaca, who is a democratic socialist, also drew intense criticism for saying that she will ""usher"" in communism ""by any means necessary.""
While it's not exactly clear what CdeBaca meant when she said ""by any means necessary,"" PBS notes that Malcolm X used the phrase and it meant ""up to and including the use of violence.""
The American Mirror added that ""by any means necessary"" also happens to be a radical far-left organization. Influence Watch reports on By Any Means Necessary (BAMN):
BAMN employs aggressive “militant” direct action and litigation to support its cause. [3] BAMN protests of official government bodies have resulted in flipping tables and other disruptive outbursts. [4] BAMN demonstrators have been arrested for inciting riots, [5] throwing rocks at police, [6] and destruction of property. [7]

Amid a series of reports touting negative 2020 presidential polls for Donald Trump — including that the Trump campaign fired internal pollsters after leaks of polls showing former Vice President Joe Biden beating the president in key states — Trump has issued a series of 2020-themed tweets displaying his usual optimism about his chances. One of those tweets included a true rarity: the president agreeing with democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
""Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. 'I think we have a very real risk of losing the Presidency to Donald Trump.' I agree, and that is the only reason they play the impeach card, which cannot be legally used!"" he wrote Sunday night.
The trolling tweet followed another tweet about impeachment and the 2020 election. ""Almost 70% in new Poll say don’t impeach,"" Trump wrote. ""So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side. They can’t win the election fairly!""
When the president woke up Monday morning, he clearly still had 2020 and ""fake polls"" on his mind. In a pair of tweets, Trump brought attention to the huge crowds continuing to come to his rallies, one of the features of his 2016 campaign that pollsters downplayed.
""Big Rally tomorrow night in Orlando, Florida, looks to be setting records,"" he tweeted early Monday. ""We are building large movie screens outside to take care of everybody. Over 100,000 requests. Our Country is doing great, far beyond what the haters & losers thought possible — and it will only get better!""
Those polls showing him getting trailing the Democratic frontrunners — whom he dubbed ""the Motley Crew"" —he suggested, are about as reliable as the ones showing Hillary Clinton defeating him easily in 2016.
""Only Fake Polls show us behind the Motley Crew,"" he wrote. ""We are looking really good, but it is far too early to be focused on that. Much work to do! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" Rep.

The Trump campaign is reportedly shaking up its internal polling staff after leaks of negative polls taken back in March. On Sunday, NBC News provided a summary of the data the release of which has apparently gotten some folks fired.
""In Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan — states where Trump edged Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by narrow margins that proved decisive in his victory — Trump trails Biden by double-digits. In three of those states — Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida — Biden’s leads sit outside the poll’s margin of error,"" NBC reported Sunday. ""Trump is also behind the former vice president in Iowa by 7 points, in North Carolina by 8 points, in Virginia by 17 points, in Ohio by 1 point, in Georgia by 6 points, in Minnesota by 14 points, and in Maine by 15 points. In Texas, where a Democratic presidential nominee hasn’t won since President Jimmy Carter in 1976, Trump leads by just 2 points.""
As NBC notes, Trump dismissed the polling news in his Oval Office interview last week, saying they're ""winning in every single state that we've polled,"" including in Texas, Ohio and Florida, where they are winning ""very big.""
""Those are fake numbers,"" he said of the leaked data from March. ""But do you know when you’re going to see that? You’re going to see that on Election Day.""
Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale has dismissed the numbers breathlessly reported by ABC, the New York Times and NBC as ""ancient"" and said that the Democrats' increasing embrace of ""far-left policy"" has triggered ""huge swings"" in polling numbers since. The Trump campaign has also issued a statement addressing the leaked data from March. ""All news about the President’s polling is completely false,"" the campaign asserted. ""The President’s new polling is extraordinary and his numbers have never been better."" "

Actor Kevin Sorbo's name was trending on Twitter on Monday due to comments the ""Hercules"" and ""God's Not Dead"" star posted over the weekend concerning sex, abortion, and immigration.
Sorbo, an open Christian, set the Internet ablaze with these three controversial tweets, which quickly went viral:
""If women are upset at Trump’s naughty words, who in the hell bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray?"" the actor wrote on Sunday. If women are upset at Trump’s naughty words, who in the hell bought 80 million copies of 50 Shades of Gray? — Kevin Sorbo (@ksorbs) June 16, 2019
Here, Sorbo is rehashing President Trump’s comments made in the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, which were leaked right before the 2016 presidential election. Bragging about how many women he gets to have relations with because he’s famous, Trump boasted to then-host Billy Bush that women let him “grab ‘em by the p****.” The conversation took place off-air.
""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is an erotic novel released in 2011 centering around BDSM .
Later in the day, Sorbo hit on illegal immigration and gun control: ""68 people were killed in mass shootings in 2018. Did you know that about 2000 were killed by illegal aliens? Just saying. Build the wall. #BuildTheWall #BuildThatWall."" 68 people were killed in mass shootings in 2018. Did you know that about 2000 were killed by illegal aliens? Just saying. Build the wall. #BuildTheWall #BuildThatWall — Kevin Sorbo (@ksorbs) June 16, 2019
Sorbo’s claim that some 2,000 Americans are killed by illegal immigrants was widely decried online, but seems to be legitimate, according to Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review (emphasis added):
“Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released its annual report on deportations and the numbers are startling. In FY 2018, ICE made 158,581 administrative arrests, of which 138,117 had a prior criminal record. The total of 542,798 criminal convictions and arrests accrued between these aliens is simply astounding. … Every one of these crimes, by definition, is avoidable because the perpetrators shouldn’t be here in the first place, and indeed, wouldn’t be here if not for the magnets, lack of a border wall, and sanctuary cities and courts . Two thousand twenty-eight homicide offenses, 5,562 robberies, 11,766 weapons offenses, 50,753 assault charges, 76,585 dangerous drug charges, 80,730 DUIs, and over 12,000 sexual offenses.”
And on Sunday night, Sorbo followed up with a tweet about “morals,” including the issue of abortion.
""A party that supports abortion over Life, illegals aliens over its citizens, and refugees over its veterans is going to lecture me on morals. Don’t think so,” he wrote. A party that supports abortion over Life, illegals aliens over its citizens, and refugees over its veterans is going to lecture me on morals. Don’t think so. — Kevin Sorbo (@ksorbs) June 17, 2019
Sorbo has condemned abortion many times. In 2018, for example, the actor and his wife Sam Sorbo denounced abortion as “evil.""
“Secular humanists have made the word abortion sound like a woman’s right, synonymous with health care, female empowerment, standing for women’s issues, a choice, a solution; anything but the truth,” the couple wrote in a op-ed for CNS News. “The truth is, however, abortion is the termination of life. It is just a euphemism for murder because the only reason to get an abortion is to avoid the potential of birth – a human birth.”
“We dress it up with 'my body, my choice,' but it is still a life inside of a woman’s womb, and that life is still extinguished by the brutal procedure of abortion,” the duo added.
The three tweets from Sorbo, which are far outside the Hollywood norm, garnered nearly 100,000 “likes” in total and generated thousands of replies in less than 24 hours."
Democrats To Debate Their Complete Agreement With One Another [Satire],www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,06-17-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48479/democrats-debate-their-complete-agreement-one-andrew-klavan,"Democrats To Debate Their Complete Agreement With One Another [Satire] John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images
The following is satirical.
The rules for the first Democrat debates are now being made public. The 476 candidates have been divided into two separate debates by random lot, meaning frontrunners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will be in one debate while eventual nominee Elizabeth Warren will be in the other.
Since all the candidates agree that the long traditions of American success and freedom should now be ended in favor of the slow economic and cultural death of socialism, debaters plan to compete in other categories such as Trying to Appear Normal While Violating Every Precept of Decency and Propriety; Trying to Appear Fiery and Passionate While Being Deeply Corrupt and Utterly Cynical; and Offering Voters Free Stuff that Would Cost the Combined Gross National Products of the U.S., Europe and Asia to Actually Supply.
Debaters will also compete to show just how committed they are to the strongly held beliefs of the Democrat base. So for instance the subject of abortion will be covered by a joint ceremony in which one candidate sacrifices a six-month-old child while the other candidates gather around in black robes chanting the Latin mass backwards. In the event the abortion ceremony actually conjures a demon out of hell, he will immediately be declared the new frontrunner.
Since the candidates have refused to be questioned by any reporter who might embarrass or even disagree with them, there are also rules defining what questions the moderators will not be allowed to ask. Among the banned questions are:
Do you have any plans to clean up the cities that Democrat policies have transformed into hellholes, or do you plan to turn the entire country into one big hellhole so no one will notice the difference?
How long do we have to pretend to believe this nonsense in order to feel good about ourselves?
And: Instead of electing a Democrat government, wouldn’t it be easier if we all just moved to Venezuela?"

Buttigieg Says It's 'Almost Certain' We've Had Gay Presidents,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,06-17-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48474/buttigieg-says-its-almost-certain-weve-had-gay-joseph-curl,"Buttigieg Says It's 'Almost Certain' We've Had Gay Presidents SOPA Images / Contributor / Getty Images
Pete Buttigieg says America has probably already had a gay president.
The South Bend, Ind., mayor told "" Axios on HBO"" that ""we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""
Buttigieg is striving to become the first openly gay person to win the presidential nomination of a major political party.
Here's the exchange:
Axios on HBO : ""Republicans claimed that John Kerry was a traitor in Vietnam. That Barack Obama was a Muslim. If you were to win the nomination, they'll say you're too young, too liberal, too gay to be commander-in-chief. You are young. You are a liberal. You are gay. How will you respond?""
Buttigieg : ""I'll respond by explaining where I want to lead this country. People will elect the person who will make the best president. And we have had excellent presidents who have been young. We have had excellent presidents who have been liberal. I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""
Axios : ""You believe that we've had a gay commander-in-chief?""
Buttigieg : ""I mean, statistically, it's almost certain.""
Axios : ""In your reading of history, do you believe you know who they were?""
Buttigieg : ""My gaydar even doesn't work that well in the present, let alone retroactively. But one can only assume that's the case.""
It wasn't clear what Buttigieg meant by ""statistically"" certain, but a 2017 Gallup poll found that 4.5% of adult Americans identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT). That means nearly 5 people per 100 are gay, and America has had 45 president, so the notion is not far-fetched.
""Overall, 5.1% of women in 2017 identified as LGBT, compared with 3.9% of men. The change among men over time has been minimal, with the LGBT percentage edging up from 3.4% in 2012 to 3.7% both last year and this year. On the other hand, the percentage of women identifying as LGBT has risen from 3.5% in 2012 to 5.1% today, with the largest jump occurring between 2016 and 2017,"" Gallup wrote.
The Washington Post has pushed this idea as well. In March, the paper published a piece headlined ""America has already had a gay president.""
“If elected, you would be the first openly gay president of the United States,” Stephen Colbert said to Pete Buttigieg after the mayor of South Bend, Ind., declared his candidacy. While the characterization of being openly gay or “out” is relatively new, the fact is the United States has already had a gay president whose contemporaries knew it: James Buchanan. Indeed, the United States has also had a gay vice president and, maybe more surprisingly, a gay senator from Alabama.
If students taking U.S. history classes are taught anything about Buchanan, they learn that he was “our only bachelor president.” How quaint. But, by using euphemisms, we falsely educate students — indeed all Americans — about the realities of this country’s history. We also distort how and why Buttigieg’s sexual identity matters today.
The writer, Ezekiel Emanuel, also speculated that perhaps Buchanan was bisexual.
Skeptics will note that in 1819, at age 28, Buchanan was engaged to Anne Coleman, daughter of a rich Pennsylvania ironmaster. Ultimately, she canceled the engagement and shortly thereafter apparently committed suicide. A rumor in the 1850s had Buchanan involved with Sarah Childress Polk, the widow of President James Polk, but it was never substantiated. In all, there is no evidence that he ever was intimately involved with another woman. At most it could suggest Buchanan was bisexual."
"WATCH: Video Of Police Drawing Guns On Couple After Shoplifting Call Goes Viral, Prompts Apology From Mayor",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,06-17-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48472/watch-video-police-drawing-guns-couple-after-james-barrett,"DailyWire.com WATCH: Video Of Police Drawing Guns On Couple After Shoplifting Call Goes Viral, Prompts Apology From Mayor Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto via Getty Images June 17, 2019 views
An incident in Phoenix, Arizona involving a stolen doll and arrest at gunpoint that was caught on video has the mayor apologizing to the family involved and vowing to take action.
An internal investigation has been launched into an arrest of an African-American couple on May 27 after Phoenix police responded to a report of a shoplifting incident at a Family Dollar store. An officer said he approached the vehicle that Dravon Ames, 22, his pregnant fiancée Iesha Harper, 24, and their two daughters London Drake, 1, and Island Drake, 4, were in just as they were exiting the parking lot, Phoenix New Times reports. When the vehicle failed to stop, officers followed it to an apartment complex where the situation escalated rapidly, resulting in the officers — fearing that Ames and Harper were potentially reaching for weapons — drawing their guns on the couple, yelling that they're ""gonna get f***ing shot,"" forcefully arresting Ames, and at one point trying to take Harper's 1-year-old daughter from her arms.
Two videos of the arrest have drawn national attention to the incident. ""'My hands are up! My hands are up!' 22yo Dravon Ames says as a Phoenix police officer yells to 'get your f***ing hands up.' The same officer later says 'You're gonna f***ing get shot!'"" Phoenix New Times staff writer Meg O'Connor tweeted along with one of the videos Thursday. ""Another angle of the incident filmed by a different resident of the apartment complex where Ames and his pregnant fiancee were dropping off their kids with a babysitter show a Phoenix police officer trying to yank the child from the mother's arms,"" she wrote in a tweet featuring the second angle on the incident. ""My hands are up! My hands are up!"" 22yo Dravon Ames says as a Phoenix police officer yells to ""get your fucking hands up."" The same officer later says ""You're gonna fucking get shot!""

The incident report states that on May 27 officers were called to a Family Dollar store for a different shoplifting call when they were told that two women, Harper and her aunt, had stolen ""a bunch"" of items. ""The officer approached the vehicle, but it backed out of the parking space and headed out of the lot,"" the Phoenix New Times reports. ""Police followed, and the vehicle stopped to let Harper's aunt out. One officer stopped the woman, questioned her, checked her ID, and found she had warrants out for misdemeanors; she was then arrested."" Police say surveillance footage shows that Harper's aunt put items down when she initially saw police approach.
Other officers then tracked Ames and Harper to an apartment complex. ""The driver pulled into a parking space and I made contact on the driver side of the vehicle, as the driver's door opened. I gave loud verbal commands for the occupants of the vehicle to get their hands up,"" Officer Christopher Meyer wrote in the incident report. ""Dravon began to yell at me that he did not do anything wrong and began to reach toward the center of the vehicle between the front seats. I drew my handgun to contact ready and continued to give him loud commands. Dravon began to comply and put his hands up above the steering wheel.""
""I could see at least two other people in the backseat,"" he wrote. ""I gave commands to Iesha to raise her hands in the air. She refused to get her hands up and stated, 'I have my child in here, I am not putting my hands up.' She continued to refuse to put her hands in the air and continued to keep them down by the seat. I feared that she was hiding something or reaching for a weapon.""
No weapons were found and the sole stolen item in the vehicle turned out to be a doll. ""The doll was returned to Family Dollar, officials said,"" NPR reports. ""And though nobody faced charges stemming from the alleged shoplifting, authorities issued Ames a traffic ticket for driving on a suspended license and impounded his car.""
Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego has since issued a statement on the incident, which has ""prompted an internal police probe, a $10 million civil rights claim and a chorus of fury on social media.""
""I, like many others, am sick over what I have seen in the video depicting Phoenix police interacting with a family and young children,"" Gallego said. ""It was completely inappropriate and clearly unprofessional. There is no situation in which this behavior is ever acceptable. As a mother myself, seeing these children placed in such a terrifying situation is beyond upsetting. I am deeply sorry for what this family went through, and I apologize to our community,"" Gallego said on Twitter Saturday evening. ""This is not who we are, and I refuse to allow this type of behavior to go unchallenged.""
She goes on to outline actions taken by the city, including requiring bodycams and a community meeting about the incident. My statement on the May 27th Phoenix Police incident: pic.twitter.com/1mYHQQbhWv — Mayor Kate Gallego (@MayorGallego) June 16, 2019"
"Mother and Female Partner Rip Off Young Boy's Penis, Then Behead Him, Police Say",www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,06-17-2019,2019,6,http://www.dailywire.com/news/48475/mother-and-female-partner-rip-young-boys-penis-hank-berrien,"Mother and Female Partner Rip Off Young Boy's Penis, Then Behead Him, Police Say Photo by AMA/Corbis via Getty Images June 17, 2019 views
A Brazilian woman with a nine-year-old son allegedly conspired with her female partner roughly a year ago to use “rudimentary tools” to tear the penis off the boy because he supposedly wanted to be a girl, then recently murdered him by reportedly stabbing him over a dozen times and removing all the skin from his face before they beheaded him.
According to The Sun , the mother, Rosana Cândido, 27, and her partner Kacyla Pessoa, 28, of Brazil, “were said to have even used a knife to try to gouge out the boy’s eyeballs to prevent possible recognition.” The Sun added that the women tried to burn the boy’s body on a barbecue, but that failed, so they stuffed parts of his body in a suitcase and deposited it in a sewer. Other parts of the body were found in two backpacks at their home.
Regarding the surgery the women performed on the boy, The Sun noted, “Local reports say: ‘After removing his penis, the women said they sewed an improvised version of the female organ onto the mutilated area.’”
Cândido allegedly said the boy was a “burden” and interfered with the women’s relationship; she also reportedly said she ""felt hatred and no love"" for him because he resembled her father, whom she claimed had abused her. The boy’s father reportedly told police that Cândido absconded with the boy five years ago. He allegedly added Cândido went to live with Pessoa and her daughter, who is now nine and has been taken into care.
The Daily Mail reported that police chief Guilherme Melo said police were sickened by what they found, telling O Tempo, “She killed her son, quartered, decapitated, plucked the skin and tried to get rid of the body. It was a very terrible case.”"
