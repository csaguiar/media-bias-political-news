SNUBBED: Queen Declines To Invite London Mayor Sadiq Khan To Trump State Dinner | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47091/snubbed-queen-declines-invite-london-mayor-sadiq-emily-zanotti,"May 12, 2019 views
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said last week that he didn't believe President Donald Trump was worthy of a state banquet hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. It turns out, though, he won't have to suffer through seeing Trump honored by the royal family.
Queen Elizabeth has declined to invite Khan to Trump's state dinner, snubbing London's top administrator, apparently over fears he'll be inappropriately aggressive toward the American leader, Express.co.uk reports .
The Daily Wire's Paul Bois reported on Saturday that Khan has been an outspoken critic of Queen Elizabeth's decision to host Trump for an official state visit, even going so far as to say that Trump doesn't deserve the honor, despite being president of the United States.
""Of course we should have a close relationship with the president of the United States, but we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet; we shouldn’t have a state banquet,"" Khan told a radio program last week. ""History tells us only two presidents have had a state visit. I think President Trump is certainly not in the same class as those two.""
Sunday, the mayor's office admitted that he was not asked to join in the celebration, meant not just to commemorate Trump's first official visit to the United Kingdom, but also to memorialize the ""special relationship"" forged between the two nations during the Second World War II on the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.
""The mayor has not been invited to the state banquet,"" Khan's spokesperson told media.
Invitations were instead sent to Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, both of whom declined to attend the banquet. Cable told media that his RSVP should be considered a ""boycott.""
""We should not be beguiled by pomp and circumstance into hobnobbing with a man who is on record as a misogynist and a racist,"" Cable said.
There is no love lost between Khan and Trump; the pair have been at odds before Trump was even elected in 2016. Khan has repeatedly criticized Trump over his treatment of women and minorities, and lashed out at Trump over his domestic policies, particularly Trump's attitude toward Islam. Khan is Muslim and is the first Muslim mayor of London.
Trump has, in turn, critiqued Khan over his ""knife control"" policies, meant to keep stabbings and random knifings down in London's city center, and was especially perturbed last year when Khan approved a ridiculous ""Baby Trump"" balloon to fly over downtown London during the president's last visit.
It is not known whether ""Baby Trump,"" which has been on something of a ""tour"" of protests in the United States, will reappear as part of the protests expected to mark the president's second trip to the U.K. and his first official state visit, but at least Khan won't get the opportunity to sneak Baby Trump into dinner in his suit pocket.
President Trump is due to arrive in the United Kingdom on June 4 or 5, and he will attend not just a state banquet hosted by the Queen and other members of the British royal family at Buckingham Palace, but a host of other meetings with leaders of the U.K.'s conservative party. He will also participate in several events in the U.K. commemorating the role the British military played in hosting, training, and partnering with the American military ahead of the D-Day landings, June 6, 1944.
The president will then travel to France to participate in the official D-Day 75 celebration on Omaha Beach in Normandy. "
Beto O'Rourke Set To 'Reintroduce' His Campaign As 2020 Effort Fizzles | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47093/beto-orourke-set-reintroduce-his-campaign-2020-emily-zanotti,"Beto O'Rourke Set To 'Reintroduce' His Campaign As 2020 Effort Fizzles Drew Angerer/Getty Images May 12, 2019 views
In the latest 2020 Democratic primary polls, Beto O'Rourke registers. In some cases, he commands less than 1% support, down significantly from just a month ago, when, right out of the gate, O'Rourke out-raised Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders within the first 24 hours of his campaign.
It seems Beto O'Rourke has noticed, and after trying to reconfigure his platform to appeal to far-left voters, he's now pledging to completely rehabilitate his image, ""reintroducing"" his 2020 campaign in a last ditch effort to move back up in the polls, the AP reports .
""O’Rourke plans to step up his national media appearances after skipping most of that kind of exposure in recent months. He is scheduled to appear on MSNBC’s 'Rachel Maddow Show' on Monday night and ABC’s 'The View' the next day,"" the AP says. ""He’s also set to offer more concrete policy plans on top issues. So far, he’s issued just one, on climate change.""
Even his climate change proposal met with swift condemnation; it is merely a stripped-down version of the ""Green New Deal"" offered in Congress last month, by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA).
Other than his two scheduled appearances, AP reports, O'Rourke will remain in a ""quiet period"" for the next week, taking an active role in reassessing and reconfiguring his presidential campaign ahead of the Democratic primary debates, which are slated to take place in late June or early July.
Although his campaign aides aren't admitting that there's a ""Beto 2.0"" in the works, as the AP calls it, O'Rourke acknowledged, at a sparsely attended campaign stop in Iowa last week, that his presidential campaign hasn't been one for the record books.
“I think, in part, I was just trying to keep up when I first started out,” he said. “I really feel like I’ve found my rhythm and my pace, and I just feel comfortable, and I feel like this is what I’m supposed to be doing.”
O'Rourke's campaign has reportedly suffered from ""disorganization,"" but there are also clear problems with the candidate. He was considered a breath of fresh air in Texas, when he ran against Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), but on the national stage, he was quickly eclipsed by rising star, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose resume and platform are far more polished than O'Rourke's, even if Buttigieg is less experienced.
O'Rourke has also struggled with exactly where he falls on the ideological divide. Although he initially marketed himself as a moderate, he's lately embraced positions associated with the very far left, including impeachment. In just the last week, O'Rourke has announced support for forcing non-union workers to pay union dues, has pledged not to take any more money from businesses and donors associated with the fossil fuel industry, has claimed that 60 million Americans are currently without clean water, and injected himself into Buttigieg's campaign by ""defending"" the newcomer from anti-LGBT protesters.
After all that, O'Rourke fell to less than 2% in the Monmouth University poll. By Sunday, O'Rourke had fallen further. He is not, according to CNN, polling above 3% in any of the early primary states.
He clearly has a lot of work ahead."
"Parents Who Fed Infant Vegan Diet Arrested After Police Discovered Child Malnourished, Suffering From Rickets | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46987/parents-who-fed-infant-vegan-diet-arrested-after-ashe-schow,"Parents Who Fed Infant Vegan Diet Arrested After Police Discovered Child Malnourished, Suffering From Rickets Ollie Millington/Getty Images May 9, 2019 views
A Sydney couple who fed their children a vegan diet were arrested a year ago after their youngest child suffered a seizure. The couple, in court on Thursday, now face up to five years in jail.
When the child had her seizure and emergency services were called, doctors discovered the 20-month-old was severely malnourished, had no teeth, and suffered from rickets. She also had not been vaccinated or taken to the doctor since she was born, nor had she received a birth certificate or a Medicare number.
The Centers for Disease Control suggests that children around the baby girl’s age should weigh around 17 to 30 pounds. The little girl in question weighed barely 11 pounds, less than what a 3-month-old should weigh.
Neither the father nor mother are named in news reports, for legal reasons.
The Australian news outlet news.com.au reviewed court documents , which showed the parents fed their child “one cup of oats with rice milk and half a banana in the morning, and a piece of toast with jam or peanut butter for lunch.” For dinner, the mother told the court she would serve the baby tofu, rice, or potatoes, but since her daughter was a “fussy eater,” she might just eat oats for dinner as well.
“This diet resulted in severe deficiencies in nutrients across the board for the infant, including a lack of calcium, phosphate, vitamin B12, vitamin A, iron and zinc,” news.com.au reported. “Her levels of vitamin D — which can cause bone disease if found to be too low — were ‘undetectable.’”
The calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D deficiencies led to rickets, which weakens the bones.
The mother’s attorney claimed in court documents that she was severely depressed after the child’s birth. The attorney claimed the woman suspected the girl’s father was cheating on her and questioned her skills as a mother. The attorney claimed the mother wouldn’t even leave the house to get groceries.
A psychologist disputed these claims, telling the court on Thursday that medical records showed no evidence of the depression and her own interview with the mother revealed otherwise. The psychologist, Dr. Yvonne Skinner, said the mother had actually bonded with her child and enjoyed spending time with her.
An attorney for the girl’s father said the accused man was not vegan nor anti-vaccination but was being subjected to a “witch hunt” based on that belief. The attorney for the man claimed his client was essentially helpless to save the child, as the mother “dictated” her care. The attorney said the father was the family’s sole provider and did everything – from cooking to driving to shopping.
Judge Sarah Huggett of Downing Centre Court in Sydney dismissed the attorney’s claims, instead reprimanding the father because he is an “educated man” who “could have picked her up and taken her to a doctor.” She said he should have noticed something was wrong because the child, at 20 months, couldn’t walk or talk and “wasn’t hitting milestones.”
After the baby’s seizure, the child spent a month in the hospital and was taken in by a foster caregiver, who said the little girl couldn’t even roll over. After six months away from her parents, the baby was able to crawl and stand and put on 13 pounds. "
The Sex Was Consensual But The Condom Fell Off And He Was Accused Of Sexual Assault. Yale Suspended Him. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47002/sex-was-consensual-condom-fell-and-he-was-accused-ashe-schow,"The Sex Was Consensual But The Condom Fell Off And He Was Accused Of Sexual Assault. Yale Suspended Him. Christophe Gateau/picture alliance via Getty Images May 9, 2019 views
A student who was suspended by his university after a condom incident “during an otherwise consensual encounter” is suing his former school.
The student, referred to in court documents as John Doe, said in his lawsuit that he met his accuser, referred to as Ann Roe, on Tinder. The two met up in the early morning hours of December 9, 2018. They eventually returned to John’s room for what both students described as a consensual sexual encounter. After about 45 minutes, however, there was a condom mishap (Ann gave different versions of what happened) and John had to put on a new one.
John claimed he asked Ann for consent “before the unprotected contact” and twice during the “short time” where he wore no condom. Ann would eventually tell campus investigators otherwise.
For the rest of December, John claimed in his lawsuit, the two continued to chat online in a friendly manner, but in January, Ann started expressing concern over the brief, unprotected portion of their encounter. On January 16, 2019, to wrote to John:
I wasn’t comfortable with like being penetrated without protection HAHA it like happened briefly but it left me pretty confused … I’m not like mad or gonna like idk try to get you in trouble or anything I was just confused.
Ann wrote again the next day, saying she was “not trying to smear you or anything but I need some time to think about how I feel about this situation.”
She now also claimed to have been “actually sexually assaulted multiple times.”
Two weeks later, Ann would tell Yale investigators that the unprotected sexual intercourse was nonconsensual.
Ann, according to the lawsuit, gave a different version of the events to each of three male friends. She told one that John removed the condom and she then performed oral sex on him. She told another that it was she who removed the condom. She told the third that John removed the condom without telling her, an act referred to as “stealthing.”
She told a Yale investigator that the “condom came off,” they briefly continued to have sex, and then John put on a new condom and they continued again.
John said in his lawsuit that he was not treated fairly at his hearing. He said the panelists questioned him in a “demeaning tone” while they were “very polite and conciliatory” with Ann, with whom they even joked. Meanwhile, multiple panelists at various times glared at John “with a look of disgust.”
The panel asked John about his drinking the night of the encounter and his past sexual history. They did not ask the same of Ann.
John said in his lawsuit that he thinks Ann was pressured into filing a formal complaint against him by Yale investigators looking to claim that reporting is up. If true, he would be in a situation similar to that of Jack Montague, whose accuser appears to have been tricked into filing a report by Yale officials who falsely claimed Montague had been accused of sexual assault before. That case is heading to trial .
The College Fix, which first reported the story , said John is seeking at least $75,000 in damages in addition to physical, emotional, and psychological damages he suffered as a result of Yale’s biased adjudication process. "
WATCH: Jim Jordan Hurls Searing Condemnation Of Democrats Targeting Bill Barr | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46994/watch-jim-jordan-hurls-searing-condemnation-hank-berrien,"May 9, 2019 views
On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee discussed possibly holding Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt, prompting a searing condemnation from Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH), who snapped, “I think it’s all about trying to destroy Bill Barr because Democrats are nervous he is going to get to the bottom of everything. He is going to find out how and why this investigation started in the first place.”
Jordan’s blistering speech included noting that Barr had stated there was a failure of leadership in the upper echelon of the FBI, that spying on the Trump campaign in 2016 did indeed occur, and that there may have been unauthorized and political surveillance.
Jordan began:
Bill Barr is following the law, and what's his reward? Democrats are going to hold him in contempt. I don’t think today’s actually about getting information. I don’t think it’s about getting the unredacted Mueller report. I don't think last week’s hearing was actually about having staff question the Attorney General. I think it's, as my colleague said earlier, I think it’s all about trying to destroy Bill Barr because Democrats are nervous he is going to get to the bottom of everything. He is going to find out how and why this investigation started in the first place.
Jordan then segued to what really frightened Democrats:
Never forget what Bill Barr said a few weeks ago, three and a half weeks ago when he testified in front of the Senate Finance Committee: he said a lot of important things but he said three, excuse me, four very interesting things. First he said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon, terms he used, upper echelon of the FBI. We all know that’s the case: Director Comey’s been fired; Director McCabe fired, lied three times under oath according to the Inspector General, FBI counsel Jim Baker demoted and left, currently under investigation by the Justice Department; Lisa Page, demoted and left; Peter Strzok, deputy head of counter intelligence, demoted and fired, Peter Strzok, the guy who ran the Clinton investigation and the Russia investigation. There was certainly a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI.
Second thing the Attorney General said three and a half weeks ago in front of the Senate Finance Committee: Spying did occur. Said it twice. Yes, spying did occur.
Third: He said there’s a basis for my concern about the spying that took place. Maybe the most interesting thing: two terms he used that, frankly, I find frightening. He said there was – in his judgment he thinks there may have been unauthorized surveillance and political surveillance. Scary terms.
We gotta go back to January 3, 2017: Senator Schumer on the “Rachel Maddow Show” talking about then President-elect Trump says this: “If you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.”
Now, I don’t know if the FBI went after President Trump in six ways, but I sure know they went after him in two ways. The first one is the now-famous dossier. On October 12, 2016, the FBI used one party’s opposition research document as the basis to go to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on the other party’s campaign. That happened. Democratic National Committee, the Clinton campaign, paid Perkins Coie law firm who hired Fusion GPS, who then hired a foreigner, Christopher Steele, who did what? Talked to Russians and put together this salacious, unverified document that became the basis to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. They did it. And when they went to the court, they didn’t tell them important things like who paid for it; they didn’t tell them that Christopher Steele had already told the FBI, the Justice Department, that he was “desperate to stop Trump.” And they didn’t tell the court that Christopher Steele had been fired by the FBI cause he was out talking to the press. They did that.
And second, just last Thursday, just last Thursday, New York Times story: “FBI investigator, posing as assistant, to meet with the Trump aide in 2016.” FBI sent someone in, pretending to be somebody else, to talk with George Papadopoulos, who was with the Trump campaign. You know what they call that? You know what they call that? It’s called spying. They did it. They did it. They did it twice, and who knows how much more. And what I know is that Bill Barr has said he’s going to get to the bottom of it, and think about the term he used, again. This is important: political surveillance. The United States of America —
Another member of the committee asked, “Will the gentleman yield?”
Jordan, fiercely, “I will not yield.”
He continued:
Think about that term. He said he’s going to get a team together and investigate all this. This is critical. And never forget: the guy who ran this investigation, Peter Strzok, ran the Clinton investigation and then launched and ran the Trump/Russia investigation, never forget what he said: “Trump should lose a hundred million to zero. We need an insurance policy.” He told Lisa Page, “Don’t worry, Lisa; we’ll stop Trump.”
This is what Bill Barr wants to investigate. As my colleagues have said, this is the House Judiciary Committee, with the history this committee has in protecting fundamental liberties and protecting the Constitution. Last week there was another important document , document Emmet Flood (Special Counsel to the President) to the Attorney General. I just want to read a couple of sentences: “Under our system of government, unelected executive branch officers and intelligence agency personnel are supposed to answer to the person elected by the people, the president, and not the other way around. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue; it’s a matter of having a government responsible, to ‘We The People.’ In the partisan commotion surrounding the Mueller Report, it would be well to remember that would can be done to a president can be done to any of us.”
And this committee is supposed to look out for that fundamental fact more than anything else. And we are not doing that today.

Democrat State Rep. Who Offered $100 To Have Pro-Life Teens Doxxed Goes Into Hiding | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47097/democrat-state-rep-who-offered-100-have-pro-life-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Democrat State Rep. Who Offered $100 To Have Pro-Life Teens Doxxed Goes Into Hiding Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Family Equality Council May 13, 2019 views
Democrat State Rep. Brian Sims made waves last weekend when he live-streamed himself harassing an elderly pro-life sidewalk counselor and three teenage girls praying outside a Philadelphia-based Planned Parenthood abortion clinic. Sims hurled insults at the women and girls, mocking their Christianity and their skin color, and tried to find out personal information about them, such as their addresses, so they could be harassed at home. In one of the videos, the Democrat even offers up $100 for the identities of the three teenage girls praying for unborn babies outside the clinic.
But now that pro-lifers have responded to Sims’ harassment, such as inviting the Democrat to a pro-life rally in response to his antics, he’s nowhere to be found. The elected official has locked his Twitter account, was a no-show at the rally, has security outside of his office building, and is not allowing constituents in to engage in dialogue.

Sims’ legislative account appears to still be open to the public, though it has been inactive since May 6.
Some of the latest tweets from Sims’ personal account before closing it off to the public were directed at pro-lifers. ""Bring it, Bible Bullies! You are bigots, sexists, and misogynists and I see right through your fake morals and your broken values. #BeReal,"" read one message from the Democrat. Another mockingly said, ""'Don’t discriminate against our discrimination. Don’t bully our bullies. Don’t hate our haters.' - P**** Grabbers and Baby Cagers.""
He also posted what was an ""apology"" video regarding his behavior, though the only apology he offered was one to Planned Parenthood, not those whom he harassed.
Also, the representative’s Instagram account has been inactive since May 1.
On Friday, when pro-lifers gathered in response to Sims outside the same Planned Parenthood abortion clinic where he harassed women and teens, the Democrat was not in attendance, though he was invited. This was expected. And when pro-life media attempted to speak with Mr. Sims at his office, the representative declined. His office building was also manned with a security guard. It’s just shameful that a publicly-elected representative, guarded by the police, is attacking the citizens of this great state and isn’t even allowing his own constituents to come to meet with him. -Americans United for Life
""We came over to Representative Sims’ office; you’ll see right behind me there is a police officer guarding the building, which is a little bit ironic because we didn’t have guards for the children and the elderly woman who he harassed and threatened outside the Planned Parenthood facility, but he himself, as a public servant, is getting protected by this police officer,"" reported Americans United for Life, adding: ""When we tried to go in the building and go up to his office to meet with him, we found out that he is not allowing the public to go into the building; he is not allowing the public to go up to his office; we couldn’t even find out where his office was, what floor it was on.

'Empire' Canceled Amid Ongoing Smollett Turmoil | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47100/empire-canceled-amid-ongoing-smollett-turmoil-james-barrett,"'Empire' Canceled Amid Ongoing Smollett Turmoil Report: Season 6 will be the last season; ""no plans"" for Smollett's return. FOX via Getty Images May 13, 2019 views
A few weeks after several of the stars of Fox's hit television series ""Empire"" wrote a letter to executives and producers demanding the return of embattled actor Jussie Smollett, Fox Entertainment announced that this upcoming season will be the scandal-damaged show's last.
""Just two weeks after the Charlie Collier-run Fox Entertainment renewed Lee Daniels and Danny Strong’s hip hop drama for a sixth season and showed controversy ladened Jussie Smollett towards the exit door, it was announced today on Fox’s Upfront call that the self described 'groundbreaking cultural phenomenon' of Empire will be canceled once Season 6 s done,"" Deadline reports.
Collier told the press in a call announcing the end of the series that they plan to ""go out guns a blazing."" However, when asked about the prospect of Smollett returning, the CEO said that while they have ""an option"" to reinstate him, they have ""no plans"" for that. ""There’s an option to have Jussie in the series but we have no plans for that,"" said Collier, Deadline notes.
The announcement of the show's demise follows a series of ratings setbacks and ugly headlines starring the former star Smollett. The actor and singer was initially charged by Chicago prosecutors with multiple felony counts for allegedly faking a hate crime against himself that he blamed on Trump supporters before the Cook County State's Attorney inexplicably dropped all charges, prompting more outrage from the public as well as key Chicago officials, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Police Chief Eddie Johnson.
Though Chicago prosecutors have made clear that the evidence against Smollett is convincing and the City of Chicago is currently suing Smollett for the $130,000, Smollett's fellow ""Empire"" cast members wrote a letter on April 24 to showrunners and studio execs declaring the actor ""innocent and no longer subject to legal uncertainty"" and demanding his reinstatement.
""Together, as a united front, we stand with Jussie Smollett and ask that our co-star, brother and friend be brought back for our sixth season of Empire,"" Smollett's fellow ""Empire"" stars Terrence Howard, Taraji Henson, Bryshere Gray, Trai Byers, Gabourey Sidibe, and Nicole Ari Parker wrote. ""We understand the past months have been difficult to process—sometimes the headlines brought more confusion than clarity, yet we now have a conclusion to this ordeal. Throughout Empire’s five seasons working with Jussie and watching how he has conducted himself throughout this traumatic event, we have come to know not just the character Jussie portrays, but also truly come to know Jussie’s personal character. He is kind. He is compassionate. He is honest and above all he is filled with integrity. He is also innocent and no longer subject to legal uncertainty with the criminal charges against him having been dropped. We are confident in his lawyer’s assurance that the case was dismissed because it would not have prevailed.""
The letter was sent just days after the City of Chicago's Law Department filed a civil lawsuit against Smollett for $130,106.15 for resources they say he wasted by filing his false ""hate crime"" report. ""This follows his refusal to reimburse the City of Chicago for the cost of police overtime spent investigating his false police report on January 29, 2019,"" a spokesman told the press.
The lawsuit stems from Smollett's claim that on January 29, 2019, he was attacked by two white Trump supporters who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him, assaulted him, threw an unknown substance on him, and tied a rope around his neck. But after police gathered overwhelming evidence indicating that Smollett had ""orchestrated"" the fake ""hate crime"" against himself with the help of his two personal trainers, a grand jury slapped the actor with 16 felony counts for filing the false report.
Though the state's attorney's office says the evidence against Smollett was solid, prosecutors abruptly dropped all charges in late March, accepting his $10,000 bond and past community service as part of a ""modified plea bargain."" Smollett, who was not required to admit responsibility in the highly unusual deal, has since proclaimed the decision as evidence that he is innocent.
But Chicago's Law Department says otherwise in its complaint against the actor, whom officials say ""knew his attackers and orchestrated the purported attack himself.""
""Later, when police confronted him with evidence about his attackers, he still refused to disclose his involvement in planning the attack,"" reads the complaint filed in mid-April. ""On the evening of January 28, 2019, Defendant's flight into Chicago was delayed, and he called Abel (Osundairo) telling him he needed to delay the staged attack, and Abel agreed,"" the city says, citing evidence gathered by investigators. The Osundairo brothers told investigators Smollett wanted to stage the attack because ""he was unhappy with the way his employers handled the racist and homophobic letter he had allegedly received and as a result wanted to stage an attack,"" the city says.

Amazon Offers Employees Startup Cash To Quit Their Jobs And Start Delivery Business For Company | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47114/amazon-offers-employees-startup-cash-quit-their-ashe-schow,"Amazon Offers Employees Startup Cash To Quit Their Jobs And Start Delivery Business For Company Bloomberg/Contributor/Getty Images May 13, 2019 views
Amazon is working to increase delivery speeds and will now offer employees up to $10,000 in startup costs who quit their jobs and start their own business helping the company deliver packages.
The Associated Press reported that Amazon made the announcement Monday as the company is looking into how it can offer one-day delivery for Prime members, down from the current delivery time of two days. From the AP:
Amazon says it will cover up to $10,000 in startup costs for employees who are accepted into the program and leave their jobs. The company says it will also pay them three months' worth of their salary.
The offer is open to most part-time and full-time Amazon employees, including warehouse workers who pack and ship orders. Whole Foods employees are not eligible to receive the new incentives.
Amazon is trying to get away from relying on others to deliver its packages. Last year, it began allowing people to “apply to launch an independent Amazon delivery business and provided $10,000 in reimbursements to military veterans,” the AP reported. This latest announcement is an expansion of that program, which resulted in the creation of more than 200 delivery businesses opened to deliver for Amazon.
The AP spoke to Milton Collier, who opened one such business in Atlanta, GA, eight months ago. His company now has 120 employees, a fleet of 50 delivery vans, and makes up to 200 deliveries a day. Collier told the AP he was hiring more people to prepare for the one-day shipping goal, saying his company is “ready.”
Also on Monday, Reuters reported that Amazon is looking to automate part of its boxing process by installing machines at warehouses that would cut 24 jobs per warehouse.
“The company started adding technology to a handful of warehouses in recent years, which scans goods coming down a conveyor belt and envelopes them seconds later in boxes custom-built for each item, two people who worked on the project told Reuters,” the media outlet reported.
Each machine costs around $1 million, but the company expects it will recover those costs within two years, Reuters reported.
“We are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network,” a spokeswoman told Reuters in a statement. “We expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created.”"

Capping off a wonderful week for the pro-life movement, which featured a six-week abortion ban in Georgia and a hugely successful pro-life rally in Philadelphia, a group of feminists decided to put the icing on the cake by making a retaliatory celibacy vow . As the leader of this movement, Alyssa Milano, explained it:
Our reproductive rights are being erased. Until women have legal control over our own bodies we just cannot risk pregnancy. JOIN ME by not having sex until we get bodily autonomy back. I’m calling for a #SexStrike. Pass it on.
Let's leave aside, for the moment, the intellectual bankruptcy of a phrase like ""reproductive rights."" Nobody is trying to infringe on anyone's right to reproduce. As I explained in my speech at the rally, the child killed by abortion has already been produced. Reproduction occurs at conception. If feminists choose not to conceive, they will find no opponents to that decision among conservatives. But if they do conceive, creating a unique and separate human person in the process, they should not then be able to kill the person they conceived. Abortion is a parenting decision, not a reproductive decision. The abortive parents have chosen to kill their baby rather than care for him. The radical suggestion we pro-lifers make is that murder is not an acceptable childcare technique.
In any case, though I take issue with the way this abstinence pledge is framed, I fully support the pledge itself. For one thing, it's no skin off my nose. My wife, praise God, is not a feminist. As a general rule, conservative men are not looking to date or marry hectoring feminists scolds. As we are choosing from an entirely different pool of potential mates, a sex boycott among the precise sorts of women we are determined to avoid does not cause us any real pain. A sex strike among feminists is, to us, like a kale shortage at the local vegan restaurant. Ironically, only the pro-abortion men, who have already sacrificed their man cards and their souls in submission to their feminist overlords, are being punished here. And it's a punishment they well deserve, even if it wasn't intended for them.
More to the point, Milano is finally conceding to an argument we've been making for decades. She says that women should avoid sex because they ""cannot risk pregnancy,"" thus admitting two crucial points: 1) Sex is a procreative act. 2) If you aren't in an ideal position to procreate, you shouldn't engage in said procreative act. Put another way: sex makes babies. Don't want baby? Don't have sex. It shouldn't have taken feminists 60 years to have this epiphany, but better late than never.
It seems we now agree. The best way to avoid an unwanted pregnancy is to avoid sex. There are other methods, but none as effective, simple, and cheap as the newly feminist-endorsed method of abstinence. The advantage of saving sex for marriage is that marriage creates the ideal context for conceiving human life — whether or not the conception is intended. Indeed, married couples conceive unintentionally all the time, yet almost all of the women who get abortions are single. Why is that? Because a married couple is automatically going to be far more prepared to welcome a new baby into the world than an unmarried person. So, wait for marriage to have sex and you won't have to worry about the abortion laws. It's a simple strategy, really. I'm thrilled that Alyssa Milano and her friends are starting to see the wisdom in it."
"San Francisco Police Go After Journalist Who Revealed Public Defender’s Affair, Overdose | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47132/san-francisco-police-go-after-journalist-who-ashe-schow,"San Francisco Police Go After Journalist Who Revealed Public Defender’s Affair, Overdose Caspar Benson/Getty Images May 13, 2019 views
San Francisco police can’t seem to crack down on drug users or public poopers, but they can certainly bring out the force when they see a real threat: Journalists.
Journalist Bryan Carmody had obtained a confidential police report showing that public defender Jeff Adachi died not from a sudden heart attack, as initially reported, but after a drug-fueled night in an apartment with a woman other than his wife, named “Caterina.” The medical examiner eventually ruled Adachi died from an overdose of cocaine and alcohol. The news was difficult to read because Adachi was a champion of civil rights, the Los Angeles Times reported .
“The citizens and leaders of the City of San Francisco have demanded a complete and thorough investigation into this leak, and this action represents a step in the process of investigating a potential case of obstruction of justice along with the illegal distribution of confidential police material,” police spokesman David Stevenson told the Times.
Adachi’s former office also released a statement saying, “All of the criminal justice and City Hall leaders agree that the release of police reports in this fashion is wrong and we hope that the truth of who leaked the police report will emerge so that it doesn’t happen again.”
After Carmody reported the truth about Adachi’s death, he told the Times that two police officers “cordially” asked him to reveal who had provided him the confidential police report.
“Of course, I politely declined,” Carmody said of the police visit in April.
On Friday, more police showed up at Carmody’s home — this time with guns and a sledgehammer. He told the Times he was awoken by the sound of police trying to break down his front gate with the sledgehammer. He said there were eight to 10 officers whom he wouldn’t allow into his home without a search warrant.
But the police came prepared. A judge had signed off on a warrant allowing police to search Carmody’s residence. They did so, with guns drawn and wearing bullet-proof vests.
“I knew what they wanted,” the journalist told The Times. “They wanted the name.”
Police handcuffed Carmody for six hours and seized his “notebooks, computers, cameras, phones and even his fiancee’s iPod from her college days,” the Times reported.
The search warrant, reviewed by the Times, said it pertained to “stolen or embezzled” property. While in custody, a second warrant was issued — this one for Carmody’s newsroom. There, “police seized a thumb drive, CDs and, inside a safe, the sought-after police report about Adachi’s death,” according to the Times.
Carmody refused to give up the source and told the Times that the document could not be traced back to the person who gave it to him. He was even interviewed by two FBI agents.
Thomas Burke, Carmody’s attorney, told the Times that in these kinds of situations journalists would normally receive a subpoena for specific information, but the way this case was handled was “designed to intimidate.”
“It’s essentially the confiscation of a newsroom,” Burke told the Times.
Carmody said police seized about $30,000 to $40,000 worth of equipment, crippling his business."
"Democrats Double Down, Demand Trump Apologize To Rep. Rashida Tlaib | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47175/democrats-double-down-demand-trump-apologize-rep-emily-zanotti,"Democrats Double Down, Demand Trump Apologize To Rep. Rashida Tlaib Chip Somodevilla / Staff / Getty Images May 14, 2019 views
Top Democrats are firing back at President Donald Trump for criticizing Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) over her horrifying comments entirely rewriting the history of Israel, by calling on Trump to apologize for ""misrepresenting"" Tlaib's comments.
Trump tweeted at Tlaib on Monday, taking her to task for claiming that her ancestors had given up their land to accommodate and shelter Jews fleeing the Holocaust, saying that their sacrifice gives her a sense of ""peace"" and justifies her crusade to end the Jewish ""occupation"" of Palestinian land.
""There's kind of a calming feeling I always tell folks when I think of the Holocaust, and the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the fact that it was my ancestors, Palestinians, who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways, have been wiped out, and some people's passports,"" Tlaib said on the Yahoo podcast, ""Skullduggery.""
""I mean, just all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time,"" she added.
In reality, Jews have existed in what is now modern Israel for thousands of years and were not ""given"" land by others already living there at the time. Worse, the Palestinian Grand Mufti at the time, Muhammad Amin al-Husayni, was an ally of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany and an admirer of the Nazi ""final solution."" Jews fleeing to their homeland from Nazi-occupied territory faced dramatic and often violent opposition from Palestinians, and more than 400 Jewish refugees — some of whom were Holocaust survivors — were killed while attempting to make their home in Israel.
Tlaib's statements aren't simply anti-Semitic, they're a re-imagination of history designed to erase the Jewish claim to Israel as a homeland.
“Democrat Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust,” Trump tweeted. “She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people.”
Democratic leaders Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) rushed to Tlaib's defense.
“If you read Rep. @RashidaTlaib’s comments, it is clear that President Trump and Congressional Republicans are taking them out of context,” Hoyer tweeted late Monday. “They must stop, and they owe her an apology.”
He later added, in an interview with The Hill , that he'd read and understood Tlaib's comments differently from the president.
“If you read Rep. Tlaib’s comments, it is clear that President Trump and Congressional Republicans are taking them out of context,” Hoyer said. “They must stop, and they owe her an apology.”
Pelosi added her own commentary Monday evening, as well, demanding that Republicans recant their ""gross misrepresentations"" of Tlaib's comments.
""Republicans’ desperate attempts to smear @RepRashida & misrepresent her comments are outrageous. President @realDonaldTrump & House GOP should apologize to Rep. Tlaib & the American people for their gross misrepresentations,"" the Speaker said on Twitter.
Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, (I-VT) tossed in his own two cents Monday as well, calling attacks on Tlaib ""ugly,"" but failing to condemn Tlaib's own ugly attacks on the Jewish people: ""Mr. President: Stop dividing the American people up by their religion, their race or their country of origin--and stop your ugly attacks against Muslim women in Congress. You are taking Rep. @RashidaTlaib's comments out of context and should apologize.""
Tlaib, of course, fired back in her own defense, accusing Republicans of ""twisting her words.""
""Policing my words, twisting & turning them to ignite vile attacks on me will not work,"" she said. ""All of you who are trying to silence me will fail miserably. I will never allow you to take my words out of context to push your racist and hateful agenda. The truth will always win,"" she tweeted."
"Staggering: Border Agents In Texas Claim 5,500 Illegal Aliens Cross The Texas-Mexico Border Every Day | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47194/staggering-border-agents-texas-claim-5500-illegal-josh-hammer,"May 14, 2019 views
Here is one more staggering number to put into perspective the all-encompassing crisis currently transpiring at our beleaguered southern border: According to Texas-based border agents, an astonishing 5,500 illegal aliens cross the border every day in South Texas alone.
Fox News reports :
New Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan toured the border in South Texas on Saturday with Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.
""We're not going to leave until the border is secure,” said Shanahan, who is trying to transfer $1.5 billion from numerous defense projects to secure the Southwest border.
In South Texas, border agents the last several days apprehended 229 migrants an hour, or 5,500 a day, forcing the agency to set up tents in parking lots and hiring jets at $16,000 a flight to send adults to nearby Del Rio just for processing.
Pictures released by the Rio Grande Valley sector show migrants piling up in makeshift tents in parking lots as agents struggle to handle the surge.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) numbers continue to show the inundated migrant influx affecting America's 1,900-mile-long border with Mexico. The Daily Wire reported last week on CBP's April border numbers:
Per CBP's official data release , total border apprehensions between points of entry in April rose 6.62% over March's already-record-shattering pace. Astoundingly, April's apprehension total of 98,977 is a full 94.04% higher than the monthly total from the beginning of the federal government's fiscal year, in October 2018. In other words, apprehensions between points of entry along the border have nearly doubled in just the first seven months of the current fiscal year. As Daniel Horowitz observes , the combined total for points of entry inadmissibles and apprehensions between points of entry is 109,144, which is the highest monthly total since the second term of the George W. Bush administration. Furthermore, as Horowitz states, ""it is very likely the highest number of unique individuals of all time, given that many in the past were the same individuals deported multiple times within the same week, while almost all of these are first-timers.""
As The Daily Wire has also noted before, part of the reason for the influx is the dissemination in Central America's ""Northern Triangle"" region of transparently false claims pertaining to America's asylum statute. Our asylum statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) , is operative for those who are persecuted in their native countries for ""race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."" For instance, ethnic Yazidis persecuted in Islamic State-overrun Iraq should qualify — but purely economically motivated migrants simply hoping to ""seek a better life,"" in the abstract, should not.
CBP has sounded the alarm on Twitter, tweeting last week: ""#CBP is experiencing an unprecedented and unsustainable situation at the Southwest border. In April, CBP apprehended or deemed inadmissible 109,144 individuals along the SWB."" #CBP is experiencing an unprecedented and unsustainable situation at the Southwest border. In April, CBP apprehended or deemed inadmissible 109,144 individuals along the SWB. Details here: https://t.co/ru9AsalgPb pic.twitter.com/kzfTpfPNP8 — CBP (@CBP) May 8, 2019
One unanswered question is why the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has aborted its unilateral rewriting of the much-ballyhooed and highly flawed Flores consent decree, which the Trump administration cites as hamstringing much of its detention and enforcement efforts at the border. "
Stanford University Deans 'Deeply Troubled' By Visit From Daily Wire's Andrew Klavan | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47197/stanford-university-deans-deeply-troubled-visit-emily-zanotti,"Stanford University Deans 'Deeply Troubled' By Visit From Daily Wire's Andrew Klavan The Andrew Klavan Show May 14, 2019 views
The Daily Wire's Andrew Klavan will be speaking at Stanford University on Tuesday evening as part of his ""Klavan on the Culture"" tour, in collaboration with Young America's Foundation. But not everyone at Stanford is thrilled to get a visit from podcaster and ""Another Kingdom"" author.
Two Stanford admins, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Susie Brubaker-Cole and Dean for Religious Life Tiffany Steinwert say they are ""deeply troubled"" by Klavan and the ""views [he] has expressed in the past in relation to Islam"" — particularly that some members of the Muslim faith have a tendency towards violence.
According to a statement posted to Stanford's website the pair, who claim to support free speech but seem to want heavy limits on what sort of ""free speech"" is acceptable in their general vicinity, say they understand that Stanford students may suffer emotional and psychological distress at the mere thought of Klavan speaking on campus.
""We understand it can be deeply frustrating and painful to see speakers invited to campus whose ideologies disparage members of our community,"" they say. ""Acknowledging this pain, we nonetheless encourage you to look beyond the sensationalism of speakers whose currency is controversy to the examples of people joining together across difference and standing in solidarity even in the face of hatred and slander.""
They cite a handful of poor examples for their twin charges of ""hatred"" and ""slander,"" including that “Klavan distorts the tenets of the Muslim faith, equating Islam with violence and barbarism,"" and that the event was planned during ""the holy month of Ramadan.""
As if that weren't enough, Brubaker-Cole and Steinwert also took aim at YAF students on Stanford's campus, accusing the group of ""publicity tactics that have targeted Muslim students.""
YAF's crime? Hanging posters promoting the event, some of which made their way to the campus's Muslim community center. As YAF points out , their publicity efforts pale in comparison to those of the Students for Justice in Palestine Club, who papered the campus with anti-Semitic posters in response to an appearance from Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro.
The pair of administrators conclude their plea with their own ... interesting ... interpretation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, seemingly proposing that the guarantees of free speech be tempered by considerations of propriety — thought they don't specify whose definition of propriety.
We are committed to free expression of diverse opinions,” the administrators wrote. “At the same time, as a campus we aim to model responsible use of free speech … just because speech is protected does not mean that it is ethical, moral, and/or responsible.”
Free speech, as YAF notes, is simply too free, and Stanford's administration would prefer a modicum of self-censorship, or, as they put it, a commitment to “aspire to a higher set of standards than the bare minimum letter of the law.”
Andrew Klavan himself pointed out the problem with their ""commitment"" to Constitutional principles: “As we learned on Game of Thrones,"" Klavan said in a statement Tuesday afternoon, ""nothing you say before 'but' really matters. If you believe in free speech but ... you don’t believe in free speech.”
Klavan's speech will take place Tuesday evening at 7 pm PST at Stanford's Geology Corner Auditorium. Tickets are free of charge, but first come, first served."

Disney made headlines last year when it was revealed that an upcoming film starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, ""The Jungle Cruise,” will feature an openly gay character.
According to a report from The Sun, British comedian Jack Whitehall was named to play the openly gay role.
""This is a huge gig for Jack and has landed him his biggest ever pay cheque,"" the source told the outlet. ""But, more excitingly, he is playing a gay man - one who is hugely effete, very camp and very funny. It's a dream role. Disney’s always been incredibly supportive of the LGBTQ community. This latest script, set at a time when it wasn’t socially acceptable to be gay, is another significant turning point.”
In 2017, Disney turned heads for the Emma Watson-starring film “Beauty and the Beast.” A character played by actor Josh Gad, LeFou, struggled with his sexual attraction for Gaston, according to director Bill Condon. The director championed a “nice, exclusively gay moment” in the film.
""LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston,"" Condon said to Attitude magazine. “He's confused about what he wants. It's somebody who's just realizing that he has these feelings.”
It was also first reported in 2017 that The Disney Channel was looking to include an LGBT angle in their TV shows, too, such as the introduction of a storyline of a gay 13-year-old boy on the hit show “Andi Mack.”
“An Andi Mack character has made history by seemingly being the first character on a Disney show to say ‘I’m gay,’” reported Pride in February. "" Cyrus Goodman came out in the second season of the tween show, but didn’t actually label himself at the time. He came out to his two closest friends, Andi and Buffy, separately, but both with the admittance that he had a crush on Andi’s boyfriend, Jonah.”

CA Bill Would Eliminate Single-Family Home Zoning In Most Of The State | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Jeffrey Cawood,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47205/ca-bill-would-eliminate-single-family-home-zoning-jeffrey-cawood,"CA Bill Would Eliminate Single-Family Home Zoning In Most Of The State Co-Author claims existing land use regulations exclude people “for economic reasons and race reasons.” Photo by halbergman/GettyImages May 14, 2019 views
A California housing bill targeting upscale communities would eliminate single-family home zoning across most of the state, transferring the authority to shape neighborhoods away from local governments to remote politicians in Sacramento.
Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), the lead author of Senate Bill 50 (SB 50), says the practice — known as “upzoning” — is necessary to address problems such as housing affordability and homelessness, which he claims have reached “crisis” levels statewide. To justify his bold proposal, Wiener references a report that found California needs 3.5 million more homes.
“The fundamental problem is that we have a massive housing shortage, which explodes housing costs and which puts enormous pressure on tenants in particular because the rents go so high,” Wiener told Mother Jones. “We have to lessen that pressure by adding more housing of all varieties at all incomes.” In the bulk of CA, it’s illegal to build any type of housing other than single family homes. #SB50 , the #MoreHOMES Act, ends this prohibition. If we’re serious about ending CA’s 3.5M home shortage & doing so without sprawl, we need to legalize apartments. https://t.co/fL2HS7A3vf — Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) May 13, 2019
In the Golden State, nearly two-thirds of all residences are single-family homes. A recent survey determined that most of the developable land is currently zoned strictly for single-family dwellings.
SB 50 is supported by mayors in San Francisco and Oakland but overwhelmingly opposed by municipalities further south. A Los Angeles Councilman described the bill as a “handout for developers” that aims to “destroy single-family home neighborhoods in Southern California.” Remarkable. Just moderated a panel where the mayors of San Jose, Oakland and Sacramento all said they were in favor of eliminating single-family only zoning in their cities — Liam Dillon (@dillonliam) May 11, 2019
“I feel that overreach by Sacramento politicians is a threat not only to our community but to every community in the state,” said Beverly Hills Mayor John Mirisch.
The complicated measure recently underwent significant changes that allowed it to advance from a Senate committee. More revisions were created earlier this month which establish different rules for rural and urban areas. Some lower income “sensitive communities” at risk of displacement and gentrification would be exempt for five years.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the proposal’s current language “would require California cities and counties to permit duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes on much of the residential land now zoned for only one house,” and “would allow midrise apartment construction near mass transit and small apartment complexes and townhomes in wealthy communities in large counties …”
The Times went on to report : As it stands, the bill has limits on where developers could build fourplexes. Under the legislation, developers would not be able to demolish a single-family house to build a fourplex without local government approval, but a single-family home could be remodeled into a fourplex if it doesn’t increase in size by more than 15%. The bill also places restrictions on building fourplexes in single-family areas that are in floodplains, communities at high risk of wildfire and some historic zones. These limitations would blunt the bill’s ability to spur construction of fourplexes in single-family-only neighborhoods, says Mott Smith, a principal at Civic Enterprise Development in Los Angeles. But he still expects a significant number of property owners to be able to take advantage. “I wish that it were less restrictive,” Smith said. “But at the same time, this is quite momentous: the abolition of single-family zoning in California.”
Sen. Nancy Skinner, a Democrat representing the East Bay Area who co-authored SB 50, said single-family zoning policies were deliberately crafted to exclude people “for economic reasons and race reasons.”
“That’s the poster child for discriminatory zoning,” Skinner said on a recent episode of “Gimme Shelter: The California Housing Crisis Podcast.”
“I love this inclusion of the fourplex because it allows us to get at some of that exclusion and gives other people the same type of access to the neighborhoods to have the great parks, the great schools, and other great assets,” she continued.
Last month, the Times wrote that Wiener “intended for his bill to push high-income neighborhoods zoned only for single-family homes to make room for apartments as redress for historical wrongs.” Again, the most important aspect of #SB50 is not density near transit, it’s opening exclusionary and wealthy urban communities to much-needed housing development near jobs. https://t.co/zAVrvm8EzS — Brendan Dentino (@BrendanDentino) May 10, 2019
SB 50 must go to the Senate floor for a vote by the end of this month. If passed, it will advance to the Assembly for consideration. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has not taken a position on the proposed law.
“If this does pass it will be a big smack in the face to local government by our California electeds,” said West Hollywood Mayor John D’Amico.

CNN's Chris Cuomo ran a segment later that day that also used misleading statistics, which at least came from a report, unlike most of Baldwin's random numbers.
Of the 15 shootings that CNN counted as school shootings: Reports only listed handguns as the weapon used, no ""assault rifles"" 1 shooting was an accident 4 were on college campuses, including one near a restaurant 1 shooting was on a bus - the student was struck in the hand by a bullet that came from outside the bus 1 shooting involved a BB gun 1 shooting occurred when a man, who did not go to the school, was running on the school's track after school and confronted someone who was breaking into his car 2 shootings happened late at night at basketball games 1 shooting happened during a drug deal in a parking lot 1 shooting involved a man who showed up to a school and shot a family member, who worked at the school This list includes drug deals, accidental shootings, incidents that happened near schools but aren't related to them, as well as a BB gun injury. Just to be clear about what's being counted here. https://t.co/plNB78njVV — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) May 9, 2019
Cuomo mentioned none of this to his viewers and instead presented the information in such a way as to make it seem like all 15 incidents were the same type of incident as what occurred in Colorado — a mass shooting where there were multiple victims. 15 shootings, 19 weeks of school... @ChrisCuomo asks: Why is this new reality OK? We're not attacking the problem. We sit and watch. We reward those who do something to save themselves or others while we refuse to do a damn thing... Look at these stolen souls. We've done nothing pic.twitter.com/ktZUBiASSF — CNN (@CNN) May 9, 2019
On Tuesday, Baldwin and CNN's Alisyn Camerota pushed the Left's agenda of seeking to ban all semi-automatic firearms from the U.S. and having the government confiscate them from citizens.
Camerota said ""we don’t have to live this way...we don't have to send our kids off to school every day just crossing fingers and hoping that they’re not sitting ducks for gun violence. We can fix this. Australia had a mass shooting. They fixed it. Other places have given us actually a blueprint on how to do this.""
Camerota was referring to Australia confiscating firearms from their law-abiding citizens. Reminder that @CNN doesn't really deliver the news anymore. Supposedly straight news anchors offer opinions (such as floating gun control measures) as if they were CNN political commentators....except they're not. They're ""anchors"" or ""hosts."" pic.twitter.com/xemfbTvfUE
Through all of CNN's political activism, the left-wing network failed to mention that the fact that studies have found that schools are actually safer now than they were before the infamous Columbine shooting happened in 1999.
CNN also did not mention any of the following statistics compiled by The Heritage Foundation that debunk most gun control narratives: Violent crime is down and has been on the decline for decades. The principal public safety concerns with respect to guns are suicides and illegally owned handguns, not mass shootings. A small number of factors significantly increase the likelihood that a person will be a victim of a gun-related homicide. Gun-related murders are carried out by a predictable pool of people. Higher rates of gun ownership are not associated with higher rates of violent crime. There is no clear relationship between strict gun control legislation and homicide or violent crime rates. Legally owned firearms are used for lawful purposes much more often than they are used to commit crimes or suicide. Concealed carry permit holders are not the problem, but they may be part of the solution.

Limbaugh: Here's Why The Deep State Is Freaked Out About Durham Investigation | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47231/limbaugh-heres-why-deep-state-freaked-out-about-james-barrett,"Limbaugh: Here's Why The Deep State Is Freaked Out About Durham Investigation Photo by George Gojkovich/Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
On his radio program Tuesday, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh kicked off one lengthy segment by offering up what he said was only a ""half-joke"": ""Let me tell you the next thing to keep a sharp eye out for, folks, and that is people fleeing the country. If you see James Comey in Argentina, or if you see James Clapper somewhere where they can’t be extradited, then you will know that we are getting close,"" said the host.
Attorney General William Barr's decision to appoint prosecutor John Durham — a U.S. attorney from Connecticut with a history of exposing government corruption — to look into the highly suspect origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, suggested Limbaugh, has the Deep State ""very nervous,"" and it should.
For some background on Durham's ""long history"" of taking on government agencies, Limbaugh read a quote from the Times report on Barr's appointment of Durham: ""Mr. Durham has a long history of serving as a special prosecutor investigating potential wrongdoing among law enforcement and national security officials. He was appointed to the federal bench in 2017 by President Trump. Mr. Durham has even investigated the use or misuse of FBI informants.""
""In fact, one of his best-known investigations was an investigation of the FBI’s handling of the mass murderer and Boston mobster Whitey Bulger,"" Rush pointed out (transcript via RushLimbaugh.com ). ""This is very significant. It was Robert Mueller III … Mr. Integrity, Mr. Honorable, who kept four innocent people in prison for decades in order to keep Whitey Bulger from being exposed as an FBI informant. Four people. Four people who were innocent were kept in jail for years in order to protect the status of Whitey Bulger as an FBI informant.""
Durham was named special prosecutor in 1999 to look into the case and in December 2000, ""'Durham revealed secret FBI documents that convinced a judge to vacate the 1968 murder convictions of four other FBI informants because they’d been framed by Robert Mueller’s FBI,"" Limbaugh said, partly quoting the Times.
""So if you ask me, Barr could not have picked a man with better experience,"" said Limbaugh. ""Not only has Durham gone up against the FBI and won before and even Mueller, he has investigated the FBI’s use of informants, which played a larger role in the inception of the FBI’s case against the Trump campaign.

""So this has a lot of people very, very nervous,"" he said after reading a quote from the Fox report . ""In addition to this, the just recently retired deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, is out making speeches, and he is unloading on James Comey. Just unloading on him.""
Rosenstein's condemnation of Comey, said Rush, highlights just how clearly the forrmer FBI director was in ""violation"" of FBI decorum in his ""now-famous press conference on July 5th where he went out there and listed everything they had discovered in their investigation of Hillary Clinton, her server and her emails, and then announced they weren’t gonna charge her and that no prosecutor would because they couldn’t find any intent.""

""This has been a political operation from day one,"" Limbaugh said later of the Trump-Russia investigation. ""The Steele dossier is all they had. It’s a political opposition product, and there’s never been anything… This has never been a criminal investigation, and even they admit that. They called it a counterintelligence investigation. It’s always been nothing but political. The Justice Department has been weaponized, or was weaponized, by agents opposed to Donald Trump. The criminal justice system was used as a political operation, and it was hidden under the disguise of a legitimate intelligence investigation."""
Chick-Fil-A Charity Chief's Grace-Filled Response To Critics | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47216/chick-fil-charity-chiefs-grace-filled-response-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Chick-Fil-A Charity Chief's Grace-Filled Response To Critics Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
Chick-fil-A has offered a response to critics constantly protesting their establishment over claims that the company is anti-LGBT: The restaurant’s mission in helping others is bigger than partisan attacks or the culture war in general, and they will not be deterred in their work.
Rodney Bullard, the head of Chick-fil-A's charitable foundation and the restaurant chain’s vice president of corporate social responsibility, addressed left-wing backlash in an interview with Business Insider on Tuesday.
""There's a calling to help people, and I think at times that has been confused with a calling, somehow, to exclude,"" explained Bullard, according to The Blaze. ""And that's not the case. The focus, the phrase 'every child' — we're very intentional about that. We do have programs and we look for programs that are inclusive as well to help every child.""
As noted by Business Insider, Chick-fil-A has received backlash for donating to Christian organizations like the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Salvation Army; far-left outlets have labeled such charities anti-LGBT for their stance on same-sex marriage.
Bullard, who formerly served as a White House fellow under the Obama administration, highlighted that the Chick-fil-A Foundation ""works with more than 300 partners, primarily focusing on lower-income and underserved youth,"" the report states. ""He also said he believes reporting on the Chick-fil-A Foundation's donations has failed to dig into what the funds have gone towards,"" such as children in need and not any specific religious sect.
""Under Bullard, Chick-fil-A has focused on low-income youth and economic inequality. Bullard said a child born into poverty in Atlanta has just a 4% chance of achieving self-sufficient wealth,"" Business Insider notes.
""Regardless of where you may find yourself on any particular issue, this is our collective problem and that we all can be a part of the solution,"" said Bullard. ""At the end of the day, the calling for us is to ensure that we are relevant and impactful in the community, and that we're helping children and that we're helping them to be everything that they can be.""
The executive made it clear that the company’s charitable mission will not be slowed down by unfair criticism.
""For us, that's a much higher calling than any political or cultural war that's being waged,"" emphasized Bullard. ""This is really about an authentic problem that is on the ground, that is present and ever present in the lives of many children who can't help themselves.”
The charity head said Chick-fil-A has ""to do more of telling the story of our need, and we have to do more of doing the work. Because, at the end of the day, this is about the work. It can't be about me personally and it can't be about anything other than doing the work for these kids.""
""That's why I'm here,"" he said. ""That’s why we're all here, and I love that about Chick-fil-A. There really is a sincerity in our employee base, sincerity that comes from the top down, that it really is about the mission.""
As reported by The Daily Wire last week, Chick-fil-A has chugged along to massive success in the face of the fringe opposition, becoming the third-largest restaurant chain in the nation and tripling their sales over the last ten years. "
The Manufactured Constitutional Crisis | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ben Shapiro,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47220/manufactured-constitutional-crisis-ben-shapiro,"May 15, 2019 views
Over the past several weeks, Democrats have spent their time defending the absurd notion that America is in the midst of a constitutional crisis. What, pray tell, has initiated this crisis? The supposed unwillingness of Attorney General William Barr to turn over to Congress unredacted sections of the Mueller report, plus underlying grand jury materials. Barr, for his part, correctly points out that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure bar him from revealing grand jury testimony. That rule was put in place by Congress itself. Nonetheless, Democrats, seeking to manufacture a feeling of Nixonian chaos, have claimed that the Trump administration is now seeking to block the release of a report that Barr himself released. The Mueller report is, indeed, public.
Playing politics with our institutional health is a dangerous game. Here's the truth: Our system of checks and balances is working just fine. Our politicians proclaim that the messy friction between the legislative, executive and judicial branches demonstrates that our politics is unworkable. But that friction is a feature of the system, not a bug. As James Madison explained in Federalist No. 51: ""the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. ... Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.""
The founders worried greatly that the supremacy of the legislature would make the executive a mere footstool, propping up legislative authority. To that end, they created a unitary executive with control over law enforcement. And they gave a check against the power of the executive to Congress, which has the ability to defund departments or impeach officials.
Democrats know this. They have the power to impeach William Barr. They're choosing not to do so, because they recognize that their complaint is itself corrupt. Democrats have the power to impeach Donald Trump. They're choosing not to do so, because they recognize that their grounds for such activity are weak in the extreme.
Instead, they participate in a cynical game in which they attack the system of checks and balances itself. That's far more dangerous than any action taken by the Trump administration to date. The same Democrats who claim today that they are deeply concerned about the system of checks and balances are proclaiming from the rooftops that they would be happy to shatter the system to facilitate their agenda. We've heard from Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., that as president, she'd simply use executive authority to set gun law. We've heard from a bevy of Democrats that they'd consider packing the Supreme Court, or abolishing the Electoral College. A few leftist commentators have even suggested abolishing the Senate, given its non-popular representation. We've heard from failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, and her Democratic allies, that her failures were the fault of election fraud; we've heard the same about Andrew Gillum in Florida.
And now Democrats say that Barr's adherence to law is somehow violative of the constitutional order. Undermining the constitutional order publicly, supposedly in order to save it, is nothing but cynical partisanship. But here's the good news: The founders designed a durable system to withstand such nonsense. It continues to work, even if Democrats would prefer it collapse.

Trey Gowdy Says FBI Corroborated Steele Dossier Using News Articles And Info From Clinton Ally | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47224/trey-gowdy-says-fbi-corroborated-steele-dossier-ashe-schow,"Trey Gowdy Says FBI Corroborated Steele Dossier Using News Articles And Info From Clinton Ally Zach Gibson/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
Appearing on Fox News Tuesday evening, former Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) claimed to have seen an FBI spreadsheet that used news articles and information from an ally to Hillary Clinton to corroborate the infamous “dossier” compiled by ex-British Intelligence officer Christopher Steele.
Gowdy made the explosive claim on “The Story With Martha MacCallum,” but didn’t elaborate, according to The Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross, who first reported the former congressman’s claims.
“I’ve seen the spreadsheet, Martha, I have seen each factual assertion listed in that dossier, and then I’ve seen the FBI’s justification. And when you’re citing newspaper articles as corroboration for a factual assertion that you have made, you don’t need an FBI agent to go do a Google search,” Gowdy said.
“When the name Sidney Blumenthal is included as part of your corroboration, and when you’re the world’s leading law enforcement agency, you have a problem,” the former congressman added.
Reminder: the news articles about the dossier were based on either information from Steele himself or from government officials “leaking” information they had been provided by Steele.
Another way the government “corroborated” the Steele Dossier was by using an eight-page document compiled by another Clinton operative — Cody Shearer. Parts of Shearer’s document appeared to be copied and pasted from the Steele Dossier — as the fonts change suddenly at times within the document.
As Ross reported, Blumenthal was responsible for spreading the Shearer document to media outlets and the federal government in an effort to corroborate Steele’s salacious report.
“Blumenthal provided Shearer’s reports to Jonathan Winer, a State Department official who was Steele’s main contact to the agency. Winer gave Shearer’s document to Steele, who in turn gave the document to the FBI. The Guardian reported Jan. 30, 2018, that Steele gave the FBI the Shearer information because he was asked to turn over any intelligence he had about Trump that might corroborate his own reporting,” Ross reported.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of investigators were not able to corroborate the core claims of the Steele Dossier, but that hasn’t resulted in any media outlets who reported on the dossier or information they received from Steele himself acknowledging they had been conned.
If what Gowdy says is true, it would confirm what skeptics of the Steele Dossier have long claimed: That circular reporting was used to justify spying on Trump’s 2016 campaign, and the whole thing was orchestrated by the Clinton campaign.
As Ross further noted, Gowdy left a few unanswered questions in his interview on Fox. Gowdy did not explain how the spreadsheet was used by the FBI or how the Blumenthal information, specifically, was used. He also didn’t explain whether this spreadsheet was used to justify the FBI’s surveillance warrant for Trump aide Carter Page or if it was created later, as part of the agency’s investigation into alleged Russian collusion by the Trump campaign.
Perhaps the investigation into the investigators will be able to unearth the spreadsheet and answer the questions left unanswered by Gowdy. Hopefully, the investigation will finally determine definitively that the Russia collusion narrative was a hoax. "

Wade Photo by Kei Uesugi/GettyImages May 15, 2019 views
On Tuesday evening, the Alabama State Senate passed House Bill 314, the ""Human Life Protection Act,"" which bans all abortions except if the mother’s life is in danger. No exceptions are made for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.
If Republican governor Kay Ivey signs the bill, which passed in a vote of 25 to 6 and had already passed in the Alabama House, it will become law. Before the vote was taken, Alabama Sen. Clyde Chambliss opened the debate by saying, “When is a person a person? When does a life become a life? I believe that if we terminate the life of an unborn child, we are putting ourselves in God’s place.” Proponents of the bill hope to challenge Roe v. Wade with the bill.
The bill states that “a woman who receives an abortion will not be held criminally culpable or civilly liable for receiving the abortion.”
The bill explains what it means for the mother’s life to be considered in danger:
In reasonable medical judgment, the child's mother has a condition that so complicates her medical condition that it necessitates the termination of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function. This term does not include a condition based on a claim that the woman is suffering from an emotional condition or a mental illness which will cause her to engage in conduct that intends to result in her death or the death of her unborn child.
However, the condition may exist if a second physician who is licensed in Alabama as a psychiatrist, with a minimum of three years of clinical experience, examines the woman and documents that the woman has a diagnosed serious mental illness and because of it, there is reasonable medical judgment that she will engage in conduct that could result in her death or the death of her unborn child.
Although the bill states that an “abortion performed in violation of this act is a Class A felony and an attempted abortion performed in violation of this act is a Class C felony,” it also states, “This act shall not apply to a physician licensed in Alabama performing a termination of a pregnancy or assisting in performing a termination of a pregnancy due to a medical emergency as defined by this act.”
Lieutenant Governor Will Ainsworth expressed his approval after the bill passed, tweeting, ""With liberal states approving radical late-term and post-birth abortions, Roe must be challenged, and I am proud that Alabama is leading the way.”
Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, threatened Ivey in an email to CBS News, writing, ""We will not stand by while politicians endanger the lives of women and doctors for political gain. Know this, Governor Ivey: If you sign this dangerous bill into law, we will see you in Court.""
Representative Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill, made it clear last week the intention of the bill was indeed to challenge Roe v. Wade , asserting, ""The heart of this bill is to confront a decision that was made by the courts in 1973 that said the baby in the womb is not a person. This bill addresses that one issue. Is that baby in the womb a person? I believe our law says it is."" After the bill passed Tuesday night, she stated , “This bill is about challenging Roe v. Wade and protecting the lives of the unborn because an unborn baby is a person who deserves love and protection. I have prayed my way through this bill. This is the way we get where we want to get eventually.” "
Actress Jameela Jamil Suggests Kids Are Better Off Killed By Abortion Than Placed In Foster Care | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47211/actress-jameela-jamil-suggests-kids-are-better-amanda-prestigiacomo,"DailyWire.com Actress Jameela Jamil Suggests Kids Are Better Off Killed By Abortion Than Placed In Foster Care “So many children will end up in foster homes. So many lives ruined. So very cruel.” Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic May 15, 2019 views
On Monday, NBC’s “The Good Place” actress Jameela Jamil suggested children are better off being killed by abortion in the womb than living a life that would include placement in foster care.
The actress, who is consistently promoting social justice causes, made the statement while criticizing Georgia’s new pro-life legislation, commonly known as the “heartbeat bill.” The law bans abortion after an unborn baby’s heartbeat can be detected, which is typically around six weeks gestation.
“This anti-abortion law in Georgia is so upsetting, inhumane, and blatantly demonstrative of a hatred of women, a disregard for our rights, bodies, mental health, and essentially a punishment for rape victims, forcing to carry the baby of their rapist,” claimed the 33-year-old.
This is incorrect, however, as the law has an explicit caveat for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.
Jamil continued, revealing that she had an abortion when she was younger, which she called “the best decision” she’s ever made, and suggesting death-by-abortion is more optimal than placement in foster care:
“I had an abortion when I was young, and it was the best decision I have ever made. Both for me, and for the baby I didn’t want, and wasn’t ready for, emotionally, psychologically and financially. So many children will end up in foster homes. So many lives ruined. So very cruel.” I had an abortion when I was young, and it was the best decision I have ever made. Both for me, and for the baby I didn’t want, and wasn’t ready for, emotionally, psychologically and financially. So many children will end up in foster homes. So many lives ruined. So very cruel. — Jameela Jamil (@jameelajamil) May 13, 2019
After swift backlash over the comments, Jamil added a third tweet to her thread some 20 minutes later to clarify her remarks — sort of . According to the actress, only some kids would be better off being killed via abortion than living in foster care, because not “ALL” foster parents are bad.
“Ps.. this isn’t any diss at ALL to foster homes. I’m in awe of people who take in children in need of a family and a home: but if Georgia becomes inundated with children who are unwanted or unable to be cared for, it will be hard to find great fostering for them all,” she wrote. Ps.. this isn’t any diss at ALL to foster homes.

Jamil posted her controversial comments captioning a piece from Slate, titled “Georgia Just Criminalized Abortion. Women Who Terminate Their Pregnancies Would Receive Life in Prison.”
This is also untrue, as outlined on Tuesday by The Daily Wire. The law applies to third parties committing the abortion. For example, an abortionist providing an illegal abortion, or a man beating a woman and killing her baby, would be in deep legal trouble for murder; not the woman so-called “self-terminating.”
“The heartbeat bill did not repeal a number of Georgia criminal statutes that explicitly apply to abortions and unborn children, and it does not overrule controlling legal authority holding that these statutes bar prosecution of a woman for terminating her own pregnancy,” explained conservative columnist David French at National Review.
And, again, the law provides exemptions in cases of rape, incest, and the life of the mother: "

Barr reportedly approached Pelosi after the National Peace Officers Memorial Service in Washington, D.C., and asked her: ""Madam Speaker, did you bring your handcuffs?""
""Today at a law enforcement ceremony at Capitol: AG Barr approached Pelosi, shook her hand: 'Madam Speaker, did you bring your handcuffs?'"" The New York Times' Nicholas Fandos reported.

""The quip was a reference to the calls from some rank-and-file Democrats for Barr himself to be arrested, amid the fight over access to Russia probe documents,"" Fox News reported . ""The House Judiciary Committee voted last week to hold Barr in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted Russia report and underlying materials, as President Trump asserted executive privilege to protect those same files from release.
Fox News' Jake Gibson confirmed the report, tweeting: ""Attorney General Bill Barr spoke to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in person today, after the National Peace Officers Memorial Service at the Capitol. A source close to Barr says he asked Pelosi if she had brought her handcuffs. There was laughter but no word on Pelosi's response.""

ABC News' John Parkinson also confirmed the report, tweeting: ""Source confirms AG Barr approached @SpeakerPelosi at National Peace Officers Memorial Service, shook her hand + said loudly 'Madam Speaker, did you bring your handcuffs?'

""He lied to Congress. And if anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime,"" Pelosi claimed without evidence last month. ""Nobody is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not the attorney general.""
But as Fox News noted, The Washington Post later reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller contacted Barr about Barr's letter to Congress and said that while he was concerned about the media coverage, he did not believe that Barr's summary of the report was inaccurate.

REPORT: Former NXIVM Sex Cult Member Claims Leaders 'Curried Favor' With Hillary Clinton By Donating To Her Presidential Campaign | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47261/weird-former-nxivm-sex-cult-claims-leaders-curried-emily-zanotti,"May 15, 2019 views
In a bizarre turn of events Tuesday, a former member of the notorious NXIVM sex cult, whose founder, Keith Raniere, is currently on trial, testified that one of the cult's benefactors raised thousands of dollars from cult members for Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign.
The New York Post reports that Mark Vicente, who used to be a high-ranking member of the cult, testified in court that another high-ranking NXIVM devotee, Seagram's rum heiress Clare Bronfman, demanded cult members donate the maximum individual amount — then $2,300 — to Clinton's 2008 primary campaign against then-Illinois senator, Barack Obama.
Vicente claims that Bronfman would then reimburse cult members for their donations, creating ""straw donors"" — a practice that is illegal under Federal Elections Commissions rules.
The group thought that the donations might help to “curry favor with the Clintons"" and to deter any future federal investigations into the ""self-help group"" that operated largely in upstate New York.
NXIVM itself allegedly operated as a sort-of pyramid scheme, luring in potential members with ""personal development programs"" that eventually progressed into cult-like indoctrination. The federal government alleges that, not only did its leaders — Raniere and actress Allison Mack — fleece members out of thousands of dollars, but that they were also operating the group as a cover for a ""secret society"" that revolved around sexual intercourse and sexual slavery, and a sex trafficking operation.
Until a 2015 ABC News expose on the group, it operated largely under the radar and out of the public eye, and, like Scientology, used the courts to silence critics, former members, and journalists who investigated the group's practices.
Mack and Raniere are standing trial on federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. Bronfman, who is accused of trying to ""curry favor"" with the Clintons, took over the cult in 2018 and is facing federal racketeering charges. Other high-level members of the group have already taken plea bargains.
“Clare Bronfman approached other people and said she would like to make a campaign contribution but she couldn’t make it above a certain amount,” Vincente told the court during his testimony. Although he did not name the politician recipient, nor how much each member was asked to contribute, federal authorities believe the fundraising was for Clinton, and that each member was asked to max out at $2,300.
Vincente also noted that the donations had a secondary effect: they introduced NXIVM higher-ups to a whole new group of professionals possibly in need of their personal development services.
“There was a strong desire to meet people within politics,” Vincente said.
Althogether, it appears the group raised close to $30,000 for Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.
The leaders of NXIVM were, of course, only some of many shadier figures associated with Clinton's early efforts at winning the White House.
It seems, at the time, though, the Clintons did know that the $30,000 in donations were coming from what was likely a cult. When confronted about the money by New York Post reports, the Clinton campaign responded that, “Over 100,000 people from across the country have contributed to Sen. Clinton’s campaign for change, and regardless of who supports her, she will always continue to stand up for what she feels is right.""
At least three members of the cult, including Bronfman, are also donors to the Clinton Global Initiative. "

According to a new Zogby poll, President Trump is killing it. His job approval has climbed over 50%, (51%) the highest of his tenure as president, higher than Barack Obama’s (48%) was at the same time in his presidency.
Additionally, the majority of millennials (18-29) approve of the president (51%); even more of the age group from 25-34 approves of him (53%), and even more of those aged 35-54 (59%). 58% of men approved of Trump, a slim minority of women (48%) approved of him.
48% of suburban voters approved of Trump and a whopping 60% of rural voters approved.
Zogby wrote, “President Trump's job approval rating has seen a post Mueller report boost! We called it a few weeks ago. But that's not the complete story as to why the president has reached a peak in his job approval rating. Trump is also riding high on positive economic news-a record high stock market, low unemployment, and solid GDP growth at home.”
Zogby added, “One of the demographics to give Trump a very good job performance rating were self-identified social networkers (59% approve/40% disapprove-people who engage with social media) …The president also made strides with college educated voters (55% approve/45% disapprove), and saw support increase slightly with non-college educated voters (47% approve/50% disapprove).” "

"Things Are Getting So Desperate At The Border, They're Deploying The TSA | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47250/things-are-getting-so-desperate-border-theyre-emily-zanotti,"Things Are Getting So Desperate At The Border, They're Deploying The TSA Photo by Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
The Department of Homeland Security is ""retasking"" hundreds of Transportation Security Administration employees to the United States-Mexico border to assist with the frontline immigration process in an effort to relieve some of the pressure on United States Customs and Border Patrol, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
CNN reports that 175 of the TSA's ""law enforcement officials"" and up to 400 of its ""security ops"" personnel, including a number of air marshals, are being sent to the southern border ""to help with efforts to deal with migrant inflows.""
Luckily for our national security, the 600 or so TSA employees being retasked to immigration will not be from the TSA's airport screening segment, so the border will be better protected and the domestic United States will still be safe from 4 oz water bottles. But some parts of the TSA will be expected to commit up to 10% of their work force to border security efforts.
""There is now immediate need for more help from TSA at the SW border,"" a TSA spokesperson wrote in a statement to employees. ""TSA has committed to support with 400 people from Security Ops"" who, the official added, will be ""deployed in waves"" similar to how they are deployed in an emergency situation.
The TSA says it hopes that airport security will be only minimally affected, even though the summer is the busiest time for public-facing members of the TSA.
The Department of Homeland Security admitted that the situation is not ideal, but that each department within Homeland Security is expected to contribute when one department is under water, as is the case with border patrol, and that they're trying their best to select the appropriate people for the job, which will involve a temporary deployment to Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, or California.
""TSA, like all DHS components, is supporting the DHS effort to address the humanitarian and security crisis at the southwest border. TSA is in the process of soliciting volunteers to support this effort while minimizing operational impact,"" a DHS spokeswoman told CNN.
DHS and other government entities are doing what they can to help alleviate the illegal immigration crisis developing on the southern border. Illegal border crossings set a record in the first quarter of 2019, and the number of monthly crossings have reliably topped 100,000 since February; most of these crossings are not at official border security checkpoints. Of the 110,000 immigrants apprehended in the month of April, only 10,000 were caught trying to sneak through official points of entry.
The crisis is fueled by migrant caravans, bringing thousands upon thousands of people from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, through Mexico to the southern border. Most of the ""migrants"" who follow the caravans are part of family units, and most are seeking asylum in the United States, not temporary work.
DHS reported last week that the majority of migrants making the journey are ""family units,"" making things even more difficult for CBP and ICE. Family units cannot be held together in custody for more than 21 days, and the public is largely opposed to separating family units. The number of border crossers has put a strain on resources and backed up asylum courts.
CBP isn't capable of holding massive numbers of migrants for extended periods of time — they simply don't have the facilities — but the Trump administration also doesn't want immigration authorities to engage in the practice of ""catch-and-release,"" that is, giving immigration court hearing dates to family units requesting asylum and then releasing them into the U.S. without supervision.
DHS is experimenting with a number of solutions, including allowing CBP officials to make early determinations as to whether an immigrant family fits some of the basic criteria for claiming asylum. They're also deploying National Guard units, other DHS employees, and now the TSA to the border to help handle the overflow and conduct investigations."
Oregon Republicans Find Way To Get Democrats To Give Up On Gun Control Bill | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47264/oregon-republicans-find-way-get-democrats-give-gun-james-barrett,"Oregon Republicans Find Way To Get Democrats To Give Up On Gun Control Bill Julie Dermansky/Corbis via Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
Though Republicans in the Oregon State Senate hold a super-minority status in the deep blue state, they recently managed to strong-arm the Oregon Democrats into giving up on a gun control bill that the majority party appeared to have the votes to pass.
Willamette Week reported Monday that four days after Senate Republicans staged a walkout in response to two bills they vehemently opposed — ""Senate Bill 978, which strengthens gun laws and House Bill 3063, which ends non-medical exemptions for families who choose not to vaccinate their children"" — Democrats caved to their demands because they were unable to achieve a quorum without GOP legislators and thus couldn't pass a $1 billion tax bill endorsed by the governor and Senate leaders.
Senate Bill 978 would have increased the legal age to purchase a firearm to 21, implemented a strict ""safe storage"" law, and also banned 3D-printed firearms, Bearing Arms reports. The decision by Senate Democrats to drop the bill comes after Senate Majority Leader Ginny Burdick declared last week that the bill would go down ""over my dead body.""
""Though Republicans are in the minority this session, their walkout denied Democrats the quorum needed for a vote on the $1-billion-a-year business tax package pushed by legislative leaders and Gov. Kate Brown,"" Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. ""Senators approved the tax plan to raise money for Oregon’s public schools by a 18-11 vote just hours after the GOP deal became public.""
Among other Democrat priorities, the deal with Republicans allows the majority party to work on their big cap and trade program intended to fight climate change, OPB explains. While Democrats are clearly steering the ship on the agenda, the Republicans' walkout is a ""sizable win"" for the minority party, the outlet notes.
House Majority Leader Jennifer Williamson expressed frustration about the Republicans' ultimately successful stunt. ""It is disappointing that the Senate Republicans walked off the job, went into hiding and held ransom legislation addressing public safety and public health,"" she said in a statement Monday.
In press release Tuesday, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action cheered the Senate Republicans for playing hardball, but warned that the Oregon Democrats are playing the long game. ""Last week, a pro-Second Amendment group of Senators took a stand against Senate Bill 978 by refusing to participate in floor sessions until the omnibus gun control bill was withdrawn from consideration. Yesterday, Oregon Senate Leadership reached an agreement that anti-gun legislation, which includes SB 978, will not be moving forward this year and is defeated for the session,"" the NRA-ILA announced. ""While Senate Bill 978 will not be moving forward this session, anti-gun legislators have already announced they intend to reintroduce a similar version next year or potentially file a ballot initiative in 2020.""
The other shelved bill, House Bill 3063 , would ""remove [the] ability of parent[s] to decline required immunizations against restrictable diseases on behalf of child for reason other than child's indicated medical diagnosis,"" thus eliminating the potential for parents to decline immunization for philisophical or religious reasons.
It wasn't only Democrats who lamented the demise of the vaccination bill, OPB notes; Republican Rep. Cheri Helt, a co-sponsor of the bill, said it is ""disappointing that once again the loudest, most extreme voices in our politics prevailed and the sensible-center and thoughtful policy-making lost."" The bill was submitted after a dangerous outbreak of the measles in Washington."

ABC's ""The View"" slammed Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday for cowering out of a Fox News interview and claiming that she did so because the network promoted ""racism"" and ""hate.""
""It may be a minority opinion, but I think that it's being very dismissive of so many Americans for her not to go on Fox News,"" leftist co-host Sunny Hostin said. ""I think if you want to be the president of the United States, for everyone, then you need to speak to everyone.""
Conservative-leaning co-host Meghan McCain said: ""You've got to go to spaces that are uncomfortable.""
Even left-leaning co-host Whoopi Goldberg joined in on criticizing Warren, saying: ""If you can't face the Fox audience, you can't face the U.S. It's that simple.""
The Washington Examiner reported that Warren's decision to not go on the network, where she will undoubtedly face the toughest questions, may be a major mistake for the far-left Democrat.
""There is an audience for authentic, left-wing politicians at the infamously right-wing cable network, according to new Morning Consult polling data,"" the Examiner reported. ""In fact, seriously progressive politics are received better by 'potential Democratic primary voters' who watch Fox News than those who watch CNN or even MSNBC, according to the group.""

Warren made the announcement on Tuesday in a multi-tweet thread attacking the network, which is consistently ranked as the most-watched cable news network in the United States.
""I love town halls. I’ve done more than 70 since January, and I’m glad to have a television audience be a part of them.

Chicago Alderman Arrested For Filing A False Police Report. Will He Get The 'Smollett Deal'? | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47254/chicago-alderman-arrested-filing-false-police-emily-zanotti,"Chicago Alderman Arrested For Filing A False Police Report. Will He Get The 'Smollett Deal'? Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
A Chicago alderman was arrested Tuesday night for filing a false police report about the theft of a car, leaving many Chicago city officials wondering if he'll be given the same generous deal for his alleged crimes that ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett received for his.
Alderman Proco ""Joe"" Moreno was arrested Tuesday evening on charges of insurance fraud and obstruction of justice/filing a false police report for ""mistakenly"" — he claims — reporting his Audi stolen by an unknown female, Block Club Chicago reports .
Moreno filed a police report for the stolen vehicle with the Chicago Police Department and, apparently, made a claim for the missing car to his insurance. The woman who ""stole"" the car, a single mother who had been on a date with the alderman, says Moreno allowed her to borrow the car to run errands but instead reported it stolen while it was in her possession.
Moreno claims the incident was a ""misunderstanding.""
“On May 14, 2019, offender Moreno was placed in custody on charges of insurance fraud and obstruction of justice in relation to a police report Moreno filed on January 4, 2019 in which Moreno claimed his vehicle had allegedly been stolen,"" Chicago police said in a statement. ""Offender was charged accordingly and will appear in Bond Court today. No further information.”
Moreno was released on his own reconnaissance Wednesday morning.
Since ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett received a ""plea deal"" for his alleged role in a fake hate crime, Chicago residents and city officials have been wondering how similar cases of defendants charged with filing a false police report would play out. Smollett, of course, was charged with obstruction of justice for his role in allegedly orchestrating a hate crime attack against himself and then giving seemingly false information to police officers investigating the crime during two separate interviews, one directly after the hate crime occurred, and one a day later.
Smollett was able to discharge those 17 felony counts of obstruction of justice by agreeing to forfeit a $10,000 bond payment and do around 16 hours of community service at Jessie Jackson's Rainbow PUSH headquarters on the city's south side. Although the Cook County State's Attorney's office claimed the ""deal"" did not grant Smollett innocence, Smollett repeatedly told press that he'd been proclaimed innocent of all charges.
The incident triggered an investigation into Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office, and how the progressive Foxx handles criminal cases. Just a week after the Smollett deal was inked, a violent criminal, allowed to go free by Foxx's office after destroying his home monitoring ankle bracelet, shot two off-duty Chicago police officers, killing one and putting the other into critical condition.
Last week, a suburban Chicago woman made her own case in court that she should be treated for her minor crime the way Jussie Smollett was treated. The argument earned her the sympathy of the judge, who denounced the unofficial Smollett plea deal in open court, and earned her free representation from a noted Chicago criminal defense attorney.
Moreno's case may be the best test case to see if prosecutors extend the same courtesy to high profile defendants who aren't television stars."
AOC Gets Called Out Over Abortion Law LIE.

Her Excuse Is Pathetic. Photographer: Yana Paskova/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
On Wednesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was called out for propagating a bald-faced lie about the newly-passed Alabama abortion ban. And instead of correcting her lie, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made a pathetic excuse to cover up her deceit. It was, in a word, embarrassing.
“Alabama lawmakers are making all abortions a felony punishable w [jail time], [including] women victimized by rape+incest,” claimed AOC. “Of course, no added punishments for rapists. It’s going to [Governor Kay Ivey’s] desk. She will decide the future of women’s rights in Alabama.” Alabama lawmakers are making all abortions a felony punishable w jailtime,incl women victimized by rape+incest.

She will decide the future of women’s rights in Alabama. https://t.co/IRR0EtsxHp — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 15, 2019
Of course, this is untrue. Third-party abortionists would be prosecuted under the new law, not mothers. One America News Network’s Liz Wheeler called out the 29-year-old: “This is a lie,” she replied. “Under no circumstances would women be jailed for abortions. The abortionist would be penalized.”
“Tell the truth, [AOC],” Wheeler continued. “You're trying to scare women into supporting abortion. Why don't you tell the truth & see if women support your extreme abortion agenda then?” This is a lie. Under no circumstances would women be jailed for abortions. The abortionist would be penalized. Tell the truth, @AOC . You're trying to scare women into supporting abortion. Why don't you tell the truth & see if women support your extreme abortion agenda then? — Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) May 15, 2019
What Wheeler tried to explain to Ocasio-Cortez somehow still did not register with the socialist, who replied: “It’s a felony punishable by jail, [including] cases of women pregnant by rape or incest. Twitter is 280 [characters] - read the context clues in grammar of the tweet.”
“But good to know you’re here to promote criminalizing medical providers aiding victims of rape and incest! good job,” she added.

But good to know you’re here to promote criminalizing medical providers aiding victims of rape and incest! good job — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 15, 2019
Wheeler pushed back: “280 characters is plenty of room to tell truth. It’d never be a felony for women. Period.”
“It’s despicable to use victims of child rape as justification for 1M abortions every year... because you Dems aren’t seeking exemption for rape/incest, you want all abortion legal always,” the conservative host noted. 280 characters is plenty of room to tell truth.

Here’s where Ocasio-Cortez gets downright pathetic in her cover-up. The elected Democrat claims Wheeler is playing a “semantics” game (she is not) and says women providers of illegal abortion would be charged, somehow making her initial lie about mothers being prosecuted not a lie (it’s still a lie).
""Actually it *would* be a felony for women - if those women are medical providers. See? According to your own semantic standard, you ‘lied,’” wrote Ocasio-Cortez. “We can fact-check obvious semantics all day and make absurd bad faith claims if that’s how you want be. But I have better uses for my time.” Actually it *would* be a felony for women - if those women are medical providers. See?

But I have better uses for my time. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 15, 2019
As noted by The Daily Wire’s Michael Knowles on Wednesday, Alabama’s Human Life Protection Act — a mere three-and-a-half pages long — was too long for Ocasio-Cortez to bother reading. Under Section 5, the legislation expressly states:
“No woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be criminally or civilly liable. Furthermore, no physician confirming the serious health risk to the child's mother shall be criminally or civilly liable for those actions.""
This absurd misinformation was likewise spread wildly about Georgia’s new pro-life law, known as the “heartbeat bill.” As highlighted on Wednesday by The Daily Wire, the law does not criminalize mothers, either:
The law applies to third parties committing the abortion. For example, an abortionist providing an illegal abortion, or a man beating a woman and killing her baby, would be in deep legal trouble for murder; not the woman so-called “self-terminating.”
National Review’s David French explained : “The heartbeat bill did not repeal a number of Georgia criminal statutes that explicitly apply to abortions and unborn children, and it does not overrule controlling legal authority holding that these statutes bar prosecution of a woman for terminating her own pregnancy.”"
"HAMMER: Yes, The Alabama Legislature Is Right To Openly ‘Defy’ Roe V. Wade | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47249/hammer-yes-alabama-legislature-right-openly-defy-josh-hammer,"May 15, 2019 views
So the great state of Alabama has officially passed the strongest pro-life bill in the country. The bill, which bans all abortions except for those deemed truly necessary to save the life of the mother, now awaits Republican Gov. Kay Ivey's signature. The bill contains no exceptions for pregnancies resultant from rape or incest, and has already induced a general state of meltdown from large swaths of the rabidly pro-abortion cultural Left.
Let us first state the obvious, from a pro-life perspective: Good for Alabama.
But what is particularly interesting about the Alabama bill is that, by the lead draftsperson's own admission, it is designed as a direct legal challenge to the constitutional travesties and moral abominations that are 1973's Roe v. Wade and 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey .
""This year after much discussion, prayer and thought as a caucus, we decided we would have one pro-life bill, and we’ll try to make one that counts,"" explained State Rep. Terri Collins (R-Decatur), according to Yellowhammer News . ""We aimed for language that addresses the language of Roe v. Wade . The decision was based on someone in utero, someone pregnant so we don’t get into conception.""
Let us make a blanket assertion that Roe and Casey are wholly fabricated, legally erroneous decisions that concocted and augmented a so-called constitutional ""right"" to murder an innocent fellow biological member of the homo sapiens species. As left-leaning constitutional law scholar John Hart Ely once famously said of Roe , it ""is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be."" It is possible that, until ( Republican judicial nominee ) Justice Anthony Kennedy came along in 2015's Obergefell v. Hodges , that there was never a more hubristic, risible, and constitutionally vacuous black-robed naked power grab than what ( Republican judicial nominee ) Justice Harry Blackmun regurgitated in the kid-killing Roe diktat.
The higher-level question, instead, is this: Is the Alabama legislature justified to pass a state-level piece of legislation that expressly ""defies"" and sets in its crosshairs an erroneously decided U.S. Supreme Court ruling?
The answer to this question is simple: Yes . But it is important to explain why .
The legislators of the State of Alabama take an oath to (amongst other things) ""support the Constitution of the United States"" — not to support the Constitution as it is egregiously misinterpreted, as happened in Roe and Casey , by a majority of the lawyers on the U.S. Supreme Court. Such political tugs-of-wars between the federal government’s branches, and indeed as between federal and state governments, is how the ultimate question of who interprets the Constitution has historically been settled . There is nothing at all inherently wrong with passing legislation that violates current U.S. Supreme Court precedent, so long as fellow constitutional actors — here, Alabama state legislators — earnestly believe they are acting soundly within the confines of the Constitution as they independently construe it, in accordance with their oaths of office.
Judicial supremacy — the fallacious notion that the constitutional prognostications of a bare majority of the U.S. Supreme Court are equated with the Constitution itself and thus trigger Article VI’s Supremacy Clause — is textually and structurally specious. As I have explained numerous times for The Daily Wire , it is simply not the system that the Constitution's Framers devised. In fact, two and a half years ago, I explained why then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions should also not think of Roe v. Wade as the much-ballyhooed ""law of the land"":
[O]pposition to ... judicial supremacy was commonly understood by the Founding generation. James Madison, in describing the tripartite separation of powers construct he helped codify in the Constitution, wrote in The Federalist No. 49 that ""[t]he several departments being perfectly coordinate by the terms of their common commission, neither of them, it is evident, can pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the boundaries between their respective powers."" Thomas Jefferson, moreover, wrote in an 1804 letter to Abigail Adams that ""[to] give[ ] to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional, and what not, not only for themselves in their own sphere of action, but for the legislature and executive also, in their spheres, would make the judiciary a despotic branch.""
But it is the textual nature of the oath of office itself — by which Alabama state legislators swear to ""support"" the written text of ""the Constitution of the United States"" — that is so important. Here is how constitutional law scholar Michael Stokes Paulsen phrased it at National Review last year:
[T]he Constitution specifies that ""this Constitution"" — the written text — is binding on judges and all other government officials. Right after designating the Constitution supreme law, Article VI provides that ""the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby."" It further specifies that all federal and state officers, of every branch, ""shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution."" All who exercise authority under the Constitution’s auspices swear an oath of fidelity to abide by the supremacy and binding nature of the Constitution’s text.
Yes, that includes ""all ... state officers, of every branch."" And it is ""the Constitution's text"" — not a judicial (mis)interpretation of that text — that binds constitutional actors who swear such an oath.
It is erroneous to think of an idiosyncratic (let alone wrongly decided) Supreme Court edict, such as Roe , as the ""law of the land"" which is binding on all fellow constitutional actors. There is nothing in the Constitution's text, structure, or original understanding to indicate that. And in fact, the Alabama state legislators' oath of office emphatically contradicts that line of thought.
Assuming Gov. Ivey signs the bill into law, it will be interesting to follow its trajectory as it is inevitably appealed throughout the legal system. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which has federal appellate jurisdiction over Alabama, is one of the more conservative circuit courts. Although, to be sure, I am skeptical that the Supreme Court would presently grant a writ of certiorari to hear the case.
Regardless, good for Alabama for standing up for unborn children and for sticking its thumb in the eye of judicial supremacy."

Before she signed the strongest anti-abortion bill in the nation on Wednesday, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey faced down a hostile question from a CBS reporter and immediately flattened her. CBS reporter Jericka Duncan asked, “Where is the money coming from to support people who aren't ready to be mothers or aren't financially stable to take care of a child?” Ivey fired back, “You simply cannot defer protecting the lives of unborn children because of costs.” CBS's @JerickaDuncan to Alabama @GovernorKayIvey before she signed the #AlabamaAbortionBan bill: ""Where is the money coming from to support people who aren't ready to be mothers or aren't financially stable to take care of a child?"" Ivey fired back you can't put a $$ on life. pic.twitter.com/wHMCNsOsGJ — NewsBusters (@newsbusters) May 15, 2019
Ivey served as Alabama State Treasurer from 2003 to 2011, then served as lieutenant governor from 2011 to 2017. She became Alabama's second female governor and first female Republican governor after the resignation of Governor Robert Bentley; she won a full term in 2018.
Ivey has not flinched from holding staunchly conservative positions; in April 2017 she signed into law a bill stating that juries that imposed capital punishment could not be overruled by judges. Frank Knaack, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, asserted, ""We should all agree that if we have a death penalty then the process should be fair and accurate. SB 16 will help minimize unreliable and arbitrary death sentences and move Alabama one step closer to ending its outlier status. We commend Senator Brewbaker, Senator Sanders, and Representative England for their leadership in this effort. And, we thank Governor Ivey for her quick action to finally put an end to judicial override in Alabama.""
In May 2017, Ivey signed into law a bill that prevented voters from voting for one party in a primary and another party in its runoff elections. State Sen. Tom Whatley commented, “It helps the Democrats choose Democratic candidates, it helps the Republicans choose Republican candidates. It just prevents the cross-over voting so you get a pure general election with a Democrat and a Republican.”
Also in May 2017, Ivey signed the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, which prohibited the “relocation, removal, alteration, renaming or other disturbance of any architecturally significant building, memorial building, memorial street or monument located on public property which has been in place for 40 or more years.” Republican State Sen. Gerald Allen of Tuscaloosa commented, “Contrary to what its detractors say, the Memorial Preservation Act is intended to preserve all of Alabama’s history ― the good and the bad ― so our children and grandchildren can learn from the past to create a better future.”
In June 2018, Ivey signed a memo to implement the Alabama Sentry Program, which would “permit a school administrator, in a school without a school resource officer (SRO) who voluntarily secures the approval of his or her superintendent, school board and county sheriff to use lethal force to defend the students, faculty, staff, and visitors of his or her school from the threat of imminent bodily harm or death by an armed intruder.”"
President Donald Trump's Approval Rating Is The Highest It's Been In Two Years | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47238/president-donald-trumps-approval-rating-highest-emily-zanotti,"President Donald Trump's Approval Rating Is The Highest It's Been In Two Years SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
President Donald Trump's average approval rating has been steadily climbing these last few weeks and has now reached its highest peak in over two years, according to Real Clear Politics' polling average .
The average, which puts Trump at about a 45% approval rating, is the president's highest average approval rating since February of 2017, and includes several polls that put Trump above the halfway point. One Zogby poll released this week shows Trump hovering at 51% approval — a surprise considering that Zogby is not a polling company that leans rightward.
The 51% approval is Trump's highest rating ever in the Zogby poll, according to the Washington Examiner .
The Daily Caller reports that Trump's numbers are a ""significant improvement"" for the president, who has generally hovered in the low-to-mid 40s for most of his tenure: ""Since the infancy of his presidency, Trump’s approval ratings have sat at about 40% but have recently begun to tick up into the mid-to-high 40 percentage points — a significant improvement less than 18 months out from the 2020 presidential election.""
Trump has also always been a polarizing figure, making high approval ratings difficult to achieve. Several factors, though, are now working in Trump's favor. The Russian collusion probe is now largely behind him, and Trump's supporters are more likely to favor the president when he's under seige by political enemies, hence why instituting impeachment proceedings is such a gamble for Democrats this close to an election cycle.
But he's also made some positive inroads on issues like the economy, jobs, and even among Millennials, Zogby reports. Americans feel more confident than ever in the direction of the American economy, and as the Washington Examiner points out, while Trump may not be entirely responsible for the success, Americans are more than happy to give him credit — even Millennials and Independents, two groups that are soundly anti-Trump in most polls.
A Gallup poll released last week seems to reinforce these conclusions. The Caller reports that a Georgetown poll, which falling squarely in the middle of Trump's approval average — around 46% of those polled approve of the president's job — shows a heavy margin of people favor Trump's performance on the economy.
""[Trump's] economic policies have received strong support from the American people, with 58% approving of the president’s handling of the economy,"" according to The Daily Caller.
This may be good news for Trump, but it's better news for his campaign.
“With a solid economy, a potentially long and drawn out primary season for Democratic presidential candidates, plus solid gains with independents, millennials, urban voters, college educated voters, and minorities, Trump could be very hard to defeat in 2020,” Zogby's chief pollster said in a statement accompanying the poll. “In addition to his base of supporters, Trump might be able to piece together another coalition and produce another improbable victory, as long as everything goes as planned, but we still have a lot of time left on the game clock.""
Democrats, particularly those competing for the 2020 presidential nomination, seem to have recognized this. Not a single one is currently waging war on Trump's economic decisions, preferring instead to discuss whether Trump is a legitimate president in the first place, whether impeachment is on the table for ""obstructing justice"" in the Russian collusion probe, and whether healthcare should be extended to all Americans through a Medicaid-like public plan.

But The Crime Is Not Being Treated As Motivated By Anti-Semitism. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47266/swedish-jew-was-stabbed-repeatedly-crime-not-being-josh-hammer,"DailyWire.com A Swedish Jew Was Stabbed Repeatedly. But The Crime Is Not Being Treated As Motivated By Anti-Semitism. JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images May 15, 2019 views
As The Daily Wire has reported numerous times, anti-Semitism in Sweden has been on the rise for years.
For example, The Daily Wire in December 2017 reported on how 20 masked men firebombed a synagogue in Gothenburg, Sweden — the nation's second-largest city. Only one night prior to that firebombing, protesters in Sweden’s third largest city, Malmö, were heard chanting , ""we want our freedom back and we’re going to shoot the Jews."" That would be the same city of Malmö that The Daily Wire separately reported , in January 2017, was being turned into a dilapidated crime capital:
Malmo, this once quiet city, is now overrun with violence. The culture of fear is so palpable that parents are no longer comfortable sending their children out to play.
""You have to look over your shoulder when you go out at night now. I don't let my little brother go out at night any more,"" said one high school student at Monday’s protest in front of city hall. ""I hope that the politicians actually view this as a serious problem and start to solve this in Malmö."" ...
What Johansson failed to mention, however, was the fact that the bulk of the violence stems from one community.
Now, The Jerusalem Post reports how a Jewish woman who was ""stabbed multiple times and suffered severe injuries"" is not having her case investigated and prosecuted by Swedish law enforcement as an anti-Semitic hate crime. The stabbing occurred in Helsingborg, which is near Malmö.
Per the Post:
The stabbing attack against a woman from the Jewish community in Helsingborg, Sweden, on Tuesday was not a hate crime, local police said they believe at this time.
The woman, who is a member of the board of the Helsingborg Jewish community, was stabbed multiple times and suffered severe injuries.
She underwent surgery for her wounds on Wednesday and has now awoken following the operation and is in stable condition.
A spokesman for the police stated that the prime suspect, a man in his 30s, was arrested Tuesday night in Denmark, and has now been brought back to Sweden and handed over to Swedish police.
The incident in Helsingborg brings to mind a deeply troubling incident in Germany (of all places!) in 2017, in which a German court amazingly found that a firebombing of a local synagogue was not an inherently anti-Semitic hate crime — but was instead merely an act to ""criticize Israel."" Per the Post :
A German regional court in the city of Wuppertal affirmed a lower court decision last Friday stating that a violent attempt to burn the city’s Bergische Synagogue by three men in 2014 was a justified expression of criticism of Israel’s policies.
Johannes Pinnel, a spokesman for the regional court, explained the court’s decision regarding the three German Palestinians who sought to firebomb the Wuppertal synagogue in July 2014. The court said in its 2015 decision that the three men wanted to draw ""attention to the Gaza conflict"" with Israel and deemed the attack not to be motivated by antisemitism.
Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in the summer of 2014 to stop Hamas rocket attacks into Israeli territory
""Anti-Zionism,"" of course, is here, there, and everywhere a ruse for anti-Semitism: It was ""a legitimate academic debate in the half-century between Herzl's initial formulation and Ben-Gurion's ultimate declaration, but ... now serves as the thinnest of all thinly veiled ruses for genocidal aspirants who want to throw all the Juden into the Mediterranean,"" as I referred to it in March."
Popular British Talk Show Canceled After Guest Found Dead. Rumors Of Suicide. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47287/popular-british-talk-show-canceled-after-guest-hank-berrien,"Popular British Talk Show Canceled After Guest Found Dead. Rumors Of Suicide. British government announces investigation of reality shows Photo by Stuart Wilson/Getty Images May 16, 2019 views
On Wednesday, a famous British daytime talk show was canceled after a 14-year-run after a guest who failed a lie detector test was found dead, with rumors that he had killed himself. After the announcement of the show’s cancellation, the British government announced it would pursue an investigation into reality shows.
British broadcaster ITV canceled ""The Jeremy Kyle Show"" after Steve Dymond, 63, who had appeared on the show where he failed a lie-detector test that was intended to prove to his fiancée, Jane Callaghan, that he had not cheated on her, was found dead by his landlady on May 9. The show has not been aired. Although police said Dymond’s death was not suspicious, there were reports from media that Dymond had committed suicide.
After the show was canceled, The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport Committee (DCMS) announced it was launching an investigation into reality television, according to The Daily Mail . DCMS committee chairman Damian Collins stated:
ITV has made the right decision to permanently cancel the Jeremy Kyle Show. However, that should not be the end of the matter. There needs to be an independent review of the duty of care TV companies have to participants in reality TV shows and the DCMS select committee has decided to hold an inquiry this summer into these issues. Programmes like The Jeremy Kyle Show risk putting people who might be vulnerable on to a public stage at a point in their lives when they are unable to foresee the consequences, either for themselves or their families.
This kind of TV featuring members of the public attracts viewing figures in the millions but in return for ratings, the broadcasters must demonstrate their duty of care to the people whose personal lives are being exposed. With an increasing demand for this type of programming, we'll be examining broadcasting regulation in this area - is it fit for purpose?'
According to The Sun , Callaghan said that she and Dymond had dissolved their relationship after the show. The Sun reported, “Just before his death Steve texted Jane to say he could not face life without her. In desperate messages he wrote: ‘I can’t live without you. I just wanted to come and see you. I just wanted to say sorry before I go. My life is not worth living without you.’”
Callaghan said Dymond suffered from depression, and obtained a note from a doctor confirming he was medically fit just so he could appear on the show. She stated, “He wanted to go on. He was really excited and confident. But it was all a front and I knew it. He wasn’t well at all.”
Callaghan added:
He had lied and lied all through the relationship. I did think he was sleeping with someone else. I did some digging and found out he was a compulsive liar. I pulled him up on it. But just before we went on the show he convinced me that he hadn’t cheated. He was making all these plans and he was so confident.”
I know we split up a week ago but we were together for two years. He was still my fiancé. I still loved him. As much as he was a pig to me I still loved him. We got engaged Christmas Day 2017. He was crying, the love was real. He was the most generous and loving person. He was quietly struggling, and we didn’t know at the time. He cheated on me, I know he did. I can’t forgive but I just want him to be alive.
Callaghan defended the team from Kyle’s show, saying, “They were brilliant. They were there when he needed help. They were really persistent in offering him help. Steve liked to be a comedian and he could be very funny. He liked the attention.”
Dymond’s landlady offered her perspective, according to Metro :
It has now been claimed by his landlady Shelley that he had returned from the show “sobbing and distraught,” and he told her ‘”it’s all gone wrong,” after failing a lie detector test on the show. She told the newspaper: “Four days later he was dead. I really believe it was the show that tipped him over the edge.”
ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall said the show was canceled ""given the gravity of recent events."" CBS News reported:
ITV was already under pressure following the deaths of two former contestants, Sophie Gradon and Mike Thalassitis, on reality show ""Love Island."" Gradon's 2018 death was ruled a suicide at an inquest. An inquest has not yet been held for Thalassitis, who died in March.
Simon Wessely, who once was head of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, called daytime talk shows like ""Jeremy Kyle"" ""the theatre of cruelty,” adding, “And yes, it might entertain a million people a day, but then again, so did Christians versus lions.” Recommended For You"
De Blasio Announces He's Running For President; Trump Has Some Thoughts | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47273/de-blasio-announces-hes-running-president-trump-james-barrett,"De Blasio Announces He's Running For President; Trump Has Some Thoughts Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 16, 2019 views
Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio finally made it official on Thursday: He's running for president, making him the 24th candidate vying for the Democratic presidential nomination to take on Donald Trump in 2020 — and the president welcomed the ""beauty"" to the crowded field in classic Trump fashion.
""The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group,"" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. ""Bill de Blasio of NYC, considered the worst mayor in the U.S., will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he’s your man. NYC HATES HIM!"" The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC, considered the worst mayor in the U.S., will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he’s your man. NYC HATES HIM! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2019
Trump's comments about residents of New York City ""hating"" de Blasio is an apparent reference to some problematic polls for the progressive mayor, as the New York Post highlights:
De Blasio has the dubious distinction of being the only candidate or potential candidate out of 23 contenders to earn a negative rating among national Democrats in a March Monmouth University survey. A total of 24 percent gave him a thumbs down while just 18 percent had a favorable view of him. At home, the numbers are even worse. A staggering 76 percent of Big Apple voters don’t think he should run , according to an April Quinnipiac University Poll.
In his announcement video released Thursday, de Blasio actually jokes about New Yorkers being ""really pissed off at you."" ""Good thing about New Yorkers is they look the same whether they’re really pissed off at you or they like you,"" he says while riding through the city in the back of a vehicle with the window down.
The mayor tweeted out the video — which is a bit more upbeat and creative than most of his competitors, at least for the first half — by underscoring the theme of his campaign: ""Working People First."" Today I am proud to announce my candidacy for president of the United States of America, because it's time to finally put working people first. https://t.co/p7LYipgAPg — Bill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio) May 16, 2019
Some of the ways he suggests he has proved that he will ""put working people first"" is by implementing the magical $15 minimum wage, guaranteeing sick leave, expanding health and mental health coverage — because ""healthcare is a human right"" — and offering free pre-K programs. He's also pushed his climate change agenda, as he recently attempted to promote in the lobby of Trump Tower to rather disastrous results .
And, of course, de Blasio presents himself as the guy most capable of taking on the big ""bully"" in the Oval Office. ""I'm a New Yorker. I've known Trump's a bully for a long time. This is not news to me or anyone else here,"" he says. ""And I know how to take him on.""
After touting various ways he's fought back against Trump, including insisting on sticking with the Paris climate change agreement after the U.S. pulled out, de Blasio declares his anti-bully motto: ""Don’t back down in the face of the bully — confront him, take him on.""
He also vows to ""take on the wealthy"" and the corporations to redistribute wealth, saying, ""There’s plenty of money in this world. There’s plenty of money in this country, it’s just in the wrong hands.""
As The Daily Wire noted Wednesday, one of Trump's sons also recently offered his rather low opinion on de Blasio. After de Blasio tweeted, ""You and your dad have spent decades evading taxes and stiffing your workers,"" Eric Trump responded: ""First you have never created a job in your life. Second, our great city has gone to shit under your leadership. Crime is up, the men & women of the NYPD detest you, homelessness is rampant, our streets are dirty and people are leaving our city in record numbers."""
WATCH: Joy Behar Suggests Alabama Senators Who Voted For Anti-Abortion Bill ‘Get A Vasectomy’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47289/watch-joy-behar-suggests-alabama-senators-who-hank-berrien,"WATCH: Joy Behar Suggests Alabama Senators Who Voted For Anti-Abortion Bill ‘Get A Vasectomy’ Heidi Gutman/ABC via Getty Images May 16, 2019 views
On Wednesday, Joy Behar of “The View” offered her nuanced opinion of the 25 men in the Alabama Senate who voted for the new anti-abortion bill that is the strongest such bill in the nation, snapping, “Maybe they should make it a law that they should all be required to get a vasectomy.”
Behar was prompted by host Whoopi Goldberg, who asked if the Alabama law could overturn Roe v. Wade.
Co-host Sunny Hostin answered:
I think it will certainly reach the Supreme Court, and I’ve said it before, I think by the end of 2019 that abortion will be either severely restricted or illegal in about 20 states, but this has always been the plan; it’s always been the plan, at least since 1973, to challenge Roe v. Wade, and remember, abortion is now not illegal, but the Supreme Court even in ’73 said that you could still restrict it once the fetus is viable. So there are restrictions that are in place, and can be in place, but completely overturning it, I think now is the first time since 1973 it is possible because of the five conservative justices on the court.
Behar: Can we look at a picture of the panel of men who did this? There it is. Gee, what do they have in common? They’re all men. All white guys. Maybe they should make it a law that they should all be required to get a vasectomy, that group in particular. That would solve the problem.
Hostin: There are only four women in the Alabama Senate.
Behar: And they didn’t vote for it.
Hostin: No.
Behar: No.
Of course, Behar is either unwilling to admit or completely ignorant of the fact that it was a huge majority of seven men on the Supreme Court who voted for Roe v. Wade , and six of them were white: Harry Blackmun, William Douglas, Potter Stewart, Lewis Powell, Warren Burger, and William Brennan. With the exception of Douglas, who was nominated by FDR, the other five justices were all appointed by Republicans.
Roe was slammed by legal scholars after it was decided; American legal scholar John Hart Ely, who was considered liberal and was reputedly the fourth most frequently cited legal scholar of all time, said, “It is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be … What is frightening about Roe is that this super-protected right is not inferable from the language of the Constitution, the framers’ thinking respecting the specific problem in issue, any general value derivable from the provisions they included, or the nation's governmental structure."" Fellow liberal Harvard professor Laurence Tribe admitted, ""One of the most curious things about Roe is that, behind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found.”
Behar does have problems with Christianity; she later apologized after saying in a conversation about Vice President Mike Pence, ""It's one thing to talk to Jesus. It's another thing when Jesus talks to you. That's called mental illness, if I'm not correct, hearing voices."" She mocked, “My question is can he talk to Mary Magdalene without his wife in the room?”

HAMMER: Pro-Lifers Must Focus More Broadly Than Simply Banning Abortion. Here’s Why. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47288/hammer-pro-lifers-must-focus-more-broadly-simply-josh-hammer,"May 16, 2019 views
So Alabama has passed the strictest pro-life law in the nation, amounting to a full-on abortion ban with a lone exception for abortions deemed truly necessary to save the mother's life. The law has an overtly anti- Roe v. Wade footing , which may or may not be a sound idea as a matter of both litigation strategy and public relations tactics. The reality, as I expressed to Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro on his radio program yesterday , is that the U.S. Supreme Court, as presently constituted, is highly unlikely to do anything more on the abortion front than possibly tighten the ""undue burden"" constitutional standard that was fabricated in the 1992 Roe follow-up case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey . For that reason, it is exceptionally difficult to see a world in which the Supreme Court would even grant a writ of certiorari to hear argument on the Alabama law, after it wends its way up through the federal judiciary. Thomas is only current SCOTUS justice who is a lock to overturn Roe/Casey. Roberts and Kav will not do it. Gorsuch *probably* would, but not obvious. Alito didn't join Thomas’s 2016 Hellerstedt dissent! At *best* three votes to overturn. So SCOTUS would deny cert. to GA/AL laws. — Josh Hammer (@josh_hammer) May 15, 2019
But the passing and signing into law of the Alabama legislation ought to raise some additional concerns for pro-lifers. My sympathies on this highly contested issue are not a secret: I resuscitated my law school's moribund pro-life student group, have marched in marches for life, and have more generally been engaged in pro-life public discourse for years. I am proudly and unapologetically pro-life : Of the belief that the combination of rudimentary biology/embryology and basic Western ethical/moral norms compels the belief that every innocent human life is worthy of legal protection.
But laws that severely restrict or (ideally) outright ban abortion, such as Alabama's, must be viewed as but one aspect of a more comprehensive pro-life strategy.
To begin with, pro-lifers ought to always strive for empathy, grace, and charity in their engagement on this issue in the public discourse. Large swaths of the "" shout your abortion! "" hard Left — especially the activist wing that is disproportionately loud on Twitter — often tend toward unhinged slander and vapid sloganeering . But it is incumbent upon conservatives to rise to the occasion and be better than the Left . This issue arises intense passions all across the spectrum — and while it may be satisfying in the short term to merely scream ""baby killers!"" at our ""pro-choice"" political foes, that (biologically and legally accurate) sort of talk accomplishes extremely little in the realm of persuading hearts and minds to move toward the pro-life side. And it is that cultural persuasion — including but hardly limited to discussions about birth control and blunt conversations about sex itself — that is ultimately an upstream prerequisite for achieving the sort of society that pro-lifers so earnestly and rightfully seek: One which values in heart, deed, and under law alike, a culture of life.
How tragic, in the words of Justice Antonin Scalia's prescient Casey dissent , that the Court's constitutionalization of such a divisive issue has ""merely prolong[ed] and intensifie[d] the anguish"" surrounding it. But pro-lifers still must always strive to be happy warriors and understand, in our post-sexual liberation culture and with oral contraceptives unfortunately still not widely available over-the-counter , that we have a culture to change. We can, and should, support morally correct legislation such as Alabama's — personally, I also support a ""personhood amendment"" to the U.S. Constitution that would ensure that unborn children are protected under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clauses. But our legal battles must not encompass our movement's entire strategy.
Second, there are any number of ancillary policies and rhetorical strategies that we ought to deploy. There is truly no compelling reason why oral contraceptives ought to be captive to Big Pharma and the insurance cartels: They should be de-politicized, removed from the HHS mandate wars, and made available over-the-counter. This is particularly important with respect to poorer states, such as Alabama, in which many lower-income women may simply lack the time, resources, and money to proactively seek OB/GYN medical assistance on a recurring basis. Pro-lifers also must accompany their (proper) talk of defunding Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion mill, with talk of replacing that with funding for women's health clinics that do not perform abortions. For example, a 2015 study by the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Charlotte Lozier Institute identified across the country a startling ratio of 20 comprehensive women's health care clinics for every one Planned Parenthood clinic in the country: 13,540 to 665, in total. Additionally, as I argued in February, the pro-life movement must place a greater substantive monetary investment and rhetorical emphasis on pro-life crisis pregnancy centers:
[I]t ought to be much easier for centrists and moderates on the abortion issue to come around to our side when they know that pro-lifers have a firm interest in helping the very best they can the invariably depressed, scared, lonely single women who suffer through unwanted pregnancies. ... Churches, synagogues, and the various other mediating institutions of civil society need to do a better job than they already are of funding and supporting pro-life crisis pregnancy centers across the country. Pro-lifers are not just pro-unborn baby, but also pro-woman — but we need our actions to consistently match our beliefs in demonstrating that.
Finally, pro-lifers should not be scared to discuss the frank reality that, no matter how morally correct and legally proper laws such as Alabama's are, that there will naturally be some real, tangible costs to such legislation. This is, of course, especially true for poorer states such as Alabama. Erick Erickson has a good piece at The Resurgent today in which he observes that, ""[s]hould [pro-lifers] be successful, there will be women carrying children they do not want and there will be women who bear costs with no fathers around to help them."" It is wholly appropriate — indeed, I would argue proper, as a matter of human empathy — for committed pro-lifers to acknowledge these costs. Acknowledging and openly discussing these costs in blunt terms ought to only further catalyze pro-lifers' willingness and eagerness to advocate for the above policies and engage in the difficult task of changing our culture via the one-by-one persuasion of hearts and minds. Erickson concludes:
Restricting abortion is a good thing. It is killing a human being. But restricting abortion without helping mothers and children is cruel. A healthy pro-life community will step up and move beyond restrictions on abortion towards greater social and community support for mothers with nowhere to turn.
Amen and Godspeed to my fellow pro-lifers. "
James Gunn Opens Up About Disney Firing: 'I Wasn't As Compassionate As I Should Be' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47291/james-gunn-opens-disney-firing-i-had-lot-anger-paul-bois,"May 16, 2019 views
Nearly one year ago, Disney fired director James Gunn from the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" franchise over resurfaced tweets filled with pedophilia and child rape jokes. Now that he's been hired back, Gunn has opened up about the whole experience, reports Bounding Into Comics .
Speaking with Deadline , Gunn said that his firing from Disney was an ""incredibly intense"" day in which he thought his entire career had been sabotaged.
""There have been other difficult days in my life, from the time I got sober when I was younger, to the death of friends who committed suicide,"" he said. ""But this was incredibly intense. It happened, and suddenly it seemed like everything was gone. I just knew, in a moment that happened incredibly quickly, I had been fired. It felt as if my career was over.""
The nearly 10-year-old Tweets had a number of sexually offensive references. ""I like when little boys touch me in my silly place"" was just one of many shocking examples.
At the time, Gunn said his jokes were from a different era of his life, when he fancied himself a shock jock and provocateur.
""My words of nearly a decade ago were, at the time, totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative,"" he said in a statement last year. ""I have regretted them for many years since — not just because they were stupid, not at all funny, wildly insensitive, and certainly not provocative like I had hoped, but also because they don't reflect the person I am today or have been for some time.""
James Gunn revealed that he came to Hollywood to ""be rich and famous, to have people love them"" and that his firing dashed his ""hope for feeling love."" Despite that, he appreciated all the support that the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" cast showed him, including kind words from Chris Pratt and Sylvester Stallone.
""That amount of love that I felt from my friends, my family, and the people in the community was absolutely overwhelming,"" said Gunn. ""In order for me to have fully felt that love for the first time, the thing that needed to happen was the apparatus by which I was feeling falsely loved had to be completely taken away.""
Gunn elaborated on feeling angry at himself for his past wrongdoing, adding that he now realizes that he has to do better in life. ""The truth is I had a lot of anger at myself and I really had to try to put that aside,"" he told Deadline. ""Because in the same way where I know what I’ve done wrong, I know that I’ve done a lot of wrong things in my life, things that led to this moment. I had to realize what I needed to do differently in my life. That was a part of all of this.""
Now that he has his job back, Gunn said he will not be gloating or seeking vengeance upon the people who made his firing possible. ""But in the same way I needed to not be lashing out at whoever fired me, or whoever spread links online, or cut up pictures to look like this or that, I also had to let go of some of that rage towards myself as well,"" he said .""Otherwise, I just wasn’t going to be able to make it through.""
Supporters of Gunn's firing pointed out that he himself had called for firings and boycotts of other people, including Roseanne Barr and Laura Ingraham. Though Gunn did not address either of those incidents directly, he admits that he regrets ways he ""spoke publicly"" and wishes he had been more compassionate.
""I feel and have felt bad for a while about some of the ways I spoke publicly; some of the jokes I made, some of the targets of my humor, just the unintentional consequences of not being more compassionate in what I’m putting out there,"" Gunn said. ""I know that people have been hurt by things that I’ve said, and that’s still my responsibility, that I wasn’t as compassionate as I should be in what I say. I feel bad for that and take full responsibility.""
In the end, Gunn did conclude that Disney had the absolute right to fire him. ""Disney totally had the right to fire me,"" he concluded. ""This wasn’t a free speech issue. I said something they didn’t like and they completely had the right to fire me. There was never any argument of that."""
Trans Individual Gets New Vagina. It's Made Using Fish. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47307/trans-individual-gets-new-vagina-its-made-using-hank-berrien,"Trans Individual Gets New Vagina. It's Made Using Fish. Photo by Fabio Pagani/EyeEm/Gettyimages May 16, 2019 views
A man who believes he is a woman, whose constructed vagina began to constrict, had a new vagina created by using a rather different piece of equipment: the skin of a fish.
A tilapia, in fact, according to the New York Post .
The trans individual, named Maju, 35, recalled, “I was the fourth person in Brazil in 1999 to have, what was then, experimental surgery. But ten years ago I developed vaginal stenosis. The opening of my vagina started to get narrower and shorter and the canal collapsed.” Maju and partner later divorced.
The procedure, called neovaginoplasty, “used a tubular-shaped acrylic mold wrapped with the skin of the freshwater fish in the form of a biological prosthesis to rebuild and extend the vaginal canal in a three-hour operation on April 23,” according to the Post, which added, “The process involved inserting two separate molds to create the new vagina. The first device, mounted with the marine membrane, was incorporated inside the vagina over a period of six days. … The tilapia membrane attached to and recoated the walls of the vaginal canal acting like stem cells.”
The fish is reportedly odor-free. Gynecologist Leonardo Bezerra, who performed the surgery, one of at least 10 he has done, told FocusOn News: “We were able create a vagina of physiological length, both in thickness and by enlarging it and the patient has recovered extremely well. She is walking around with ease, has no pain and is urinating normally. In a couple months we believe she will be able to have sexual intercourse.”
The first surgery that Bezerra performed using the tilapia was done in April 2017 on a biological woman, Jucilene Marinho, who was discovered in her teens to have no cervix, uterus, ovaries or womb. Marinho recalled of discovering her problem, “I cried a lot when I found out. I thought my world had ended. I’d always dreamed of having a baby of my own now I had to accept that wouldn’t be possible.” Post-surgery, after she had sex with her boyfriend for the first time, she stated, “At first I was very scared to do it because I thought it would hurt and I was worried it might damage the opening. But it was a wonderful moment because everything worked perfectly. There was no pain, just a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction.”
Bezerra explained the problems with man-made vaginas constricting: “This is because, in the traditional procedure, most of the inside parts of the penis are removed and the penile skin is folded into the space between the urethra and the rectum. The outside skin of the penis then becomes the inside of the vagina. But because the patient has had hormonal treatment to develop female characteristics, there is penile and testicle atrophy resulting in shrinkage in the size of the penis caused from the loss of tissue. This means the vagina can also be small.”
Bezerra noted that the original vagina constructed for Maju had problems, as erectile structures were left inside. He stated, “The presence of these leftovers of the penis aggravated the closure of the vaginal tract, worsening the symptoms.” Recommended For You "

Turning Point USA's Benny Johnson traveled to socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D) 14th congressional district in New York and asked numerous people what they thought about socialism.
Johnson told The Daily Wire that he stood in an area in Ocasio-Cortez's district for 90 minutes and spoke to 12 random people and asked them their thoughts on socialism.
One man, from Yugoslavia, told Johnson: ""I was born in a socialist country and I came to this country to get away from socialism."" When asked if he thought socialism ""sucked,"" the man said ""yes.""
Another man told Johnson: ""Socialism is the worst. It doesn’t work. It doesn’t work.""
A woman, who was featured multiple times throughout the video, told Johnson: ""I like capitalism, I like the fact that I earn my bucks and I spend them on [myself], which I’m going to now.""
""I work because I choose to,"" the woman later added. ""I give to my church, again, because I choose to. Nobody tells me what to do.""
A restaurant chef, who said that he wanted to open up his own restaurant someday, told Johnson: ""I don’t agree with socialism. Socialism is supposed to be like where everybody gets the same amount. I want to do better than people if I work harder and stuff like that.""
Another man told Johnson: ""If you give everything, you give everybody anything, they could just stay home and then what's the point? What's the drive? And that's why socialism is not right for America.""
A man standing next to him chimed in, ""All socialism does is just encourages people just to sit back and do nothing. Eventually, it's gonna go broke. You know, how you gonna pay for free stuff? I'm against freeloaders. You got to work. You got to earn it.""
When shown the Green New Deal, including the part where it mentioned the idea of taking care of people who were unwilling to work, the man said: ""Yeah, we have plenty of freeloaders in society today. They think that they can just print money and it will solve the problem, it doesn't work that way.""
The man had the following message for Ocasio-Cortez: ""If you love it so much, go to all these other countries that have socialism. See how it will work. Look at what happened in Venezuela.""
One man, who drove a Mercedes, told Johnson that he ""loved"" socialism.
Another man, when asked about his thoughts on socialism, walked off and refused to answer.
WATCH: Do People Living In @AOC ’s District Actually Like Socialism? AOC is America’s most popular socialist. So what do her constituents think about the socialist ideology?

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from March found that being a socialist was the most undesirable quality that a presidential candidate could have in the eyes of voters.
""Of socialism in general, only 18% of respondents approved, while 50% of respondents disapproved,"" The Daily Wire reported . ""Conversely, 50% of respondents approved of capitalism with only 19% disapproving.""
Ocasio-Cortez's social media incidents, childish antics during hearings, and policy ideas have all contributed to her poll numbers being devastated. Left-leaning Vox reported :
A Quinnipiac poll released on Thursday morning found that 23 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the member of Congress, while 36 percent had an unfavorable view — a -13 overall approval rating...
...This new poll isn’t a one-off finding. Three prior surveys — one in January from Morning Consult, one in February from Fox, and a third in mid-March from Gallup — all found that more Americans had negative views of AOC than had positive ones.
Another poll found that Ocasio-Cortez's sabotaging of the Amazon deal in New York City had greatly damaged her image among New Yorkers. The Daily Wire reported :
The findings of the Siena College poll of New Yorkers taken between March 10-14 prompted Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg to say, “Only 12 percent call her hero, while 38 percent label her a villain.”
""Ocasio-Cortez, with a negative 31-44 percent favorability rating, is as well known to statewide voters after three months in office as Gillibrand is after ten years as senator,"" Greenberg said . ""While Democrats view Ocasio-Cortez favorably, independents view her unfavorably more than two-to-one and Republicans view her unfavorably, 68-6 percent. She is viewed slightly favorably in New York City but strongly unfavorably upstate and in the downstate suburbs."""

A question directed at pro-lifers tweeted out by an author critical of Alabama's ""heartbeat bill"" prompted a flood of responses that ended up demonstrating the personal, proactive generosity of many in the pro-life movement.
In a tweet pointed out by Twitchy , ""blue-check"" author and Times of Israel blogger Sarah Tuttle-Singer wrote: ""Dear Pro-Life friends: what have you *personally* done to support lower income single mothers? I’ll wait:"" Dear Pro-Life friends: what have you *personally* done to support lower income single mothers? I’ll wait: — (((TuttleSinger))) سارا تاتل سينجر שרה טאטל-סינגר (@TuttleSinger) May 15, 2019
Her question followed a previous tweet criticizing Alabama's new ""heartbeat bill.""
""The new Alabama laws won’t stop women from having abortions,"" she wrote. ""They’ll find alternatives. Many women will go under the knife of back alley butchers, or use metal hangers in dirty rooms, or drink toxic herbs until they bleed out. Does that make you cringe? Do something about it.""

Tuttle-Singer didn't have to wait long for responses to her question to pro-lifers. The answers came flooding in. Some excerpts from responses below:
I've spent the last 15 years serving breakfast once a month at a homeless shelter and making lunches for the same shelter once a month on a separate weekend...
I'm the president of the board of directors for our local domestic violence shelter...
Donated to crisis pregnancy centers. Volunteered with the Sisters of Life (highly recommend: you can be helpful just by holding a baby while mama gets food at the potluck, for instance) Offered to meet with anyone in a crisis pregnancy to talk about arranging to adopt their baby.
Applying for an open adoption, to take care of a child whose mother doesn't think she can raise the baby, and to keep mother and child in each other's lives. And I'd also add: donating to @prisonculture's Black Mama Bail Out to pay the bails of black mothers and send them home to be with their children.
The Mennonite community in our small town runs a huge foster care program, funded by their thrift store, in association with the prisons (our county has something like 14 prisons). They foster kids where they can be near their mothers and visit them with the aim of reunification.
We adopted our two boys, after we already had two girls.
Yeah, we are foster parents, and adopted our youngest, to add to the three we already had. Seems the left doesn't realize that its the right that actually volunteers & gives of themselves, all while the left are trying to get the gov't to force everyone to help who they want.
supported crisis pregnancy centers and donated shitloads of diapers to the local diaper bank[.] also, I'm in favor of generous monthly child allowances, single payer health care, universal free school lunches, and other policy measures that make raising a family easier.
Adopted 1 and took in 3 foster who are now staying permanently. In addition to my 6 natural children.
After the overwhelming response, the author and blogger issued some follow-up tweets praising the personal generosity of pro-lifers, while suggesting the government needs to step in to do more.
""I am delighted to see that there are good people out there supporting struggling single moms:) wish our government did more, too!"" she wrote.

Internet Implodes Amid Reports New Batman Is Twilight's Robert Pattinson | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47330/internet-implodes-amid-reports-new-batman-james-barrett,"/ Internet Implodes Amid Reports New Batman Is Twilight’s Robert Pattinson – The Daily Wire Internet Implodes Amid Reports New Batman Is Twilight’s Robert Pattinson – The Daily Wire 05/17/2019 by admin
On Thursday, Variety reported that “Twilight” star Robert Pattinson is “going from sex symbol to bat symbol.”
According to the outlet’s sources, Pattinson is in negotiations to play Bruce Wayne/Batman in the next installment in the DC series that will be helmed by Matt Reeves, who took over the franchise after Ben Affleck officially stepped away. The film, which is expected to begin pre-production this summer, is tentatively scheduled to hit theaters June 2021.
“While sources say it’s not yet a done deal, Pattinson is the top choice and it’s expected to close shortly,” Variety reports, noting that he has been chosen “even as Reeves continues to polish a final version of the script.”
“It’s very much a point of view-driven, noir Batman tale,” Reeves said of his take on the next Batman film in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in January. “It’s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it’s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional. It’s more Batman in his detective mode than we’ve seen in the films. The comics have a history of that. He’s supposed to be the world’s greatest detective, and that’s not necessarily been a part of what the movies have been. I’d love this to be one where when we go on that journey of tracking down the criminals and trying to solve a crime, it’s going to allow his character to have an arc so that he can go through a transformation.”
Variety provides some more details about Pattinson and his current collaboration with Warner Bros and upcoming projects (formatting adjusted):
Pattinson is about to shoot another film for WB: Christopher Nolan’s event movie co-starring John David Washington, which is set to open July 17, 2020. Pattinson has a total of four films opening this year, beginning with Claire Denis’ “High Life.” He also appears in Robert Eggers’ “The Lighthouse,” which bows at the Cannes Film Festival, “The King” for Netflix and “Waiting for the Barbarians.”
While Variety left the door open on the casting of Pattinson, the report was enough to send social media into one of its familiar spirals, with outrage, mockery, celebration, and actually some reasoned arguments every now and then. Below are various responses to the announcement that the former sparkling vampire is likely to be the next caped crusader, starting with a few skeptical posts:
So, that petition to fire Robert Pattinson from the Batman role should be posted in a few minutes.

— Michael Ruiz (@TheMichaelRuiz) May 17, 2019
Most of the reaction appears to be positive, with many fans stressing that Pattinson has starred in a lot more than the “Twilight” series and has proven himself a capable and hardworking actor:
Let’s not pretend that Ben Affleck, Christian Bale or Michael Keaton didn’t do some silly, not-so-good movies before putting on the cape and cowl if we’re going to try and use Twilight as basis for Pattinson not being a good choice for Batman.
Michael Keaton, Heath Ledger, Grant Gustin..If we’ve learned ANYTHING from unique superhero castings, it’s that immediate reactions are often wrong.Robert Pattinson is a bold choice for Bruce Wayne & I can’t wait to see him in action.(This is coming from a lifelong Batman fan)
I can’t wait for all the people who don’t know Robert Pattinson from anything other than Twilight to be stunned at how great he’s gonna be as Batman. Ridiculously excited about this casting

Tomi Lahren Blasts Alabama 'Heartbeat Bill' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47332/tomi-lahren-blasts-alabama-heartbeat-bill-james-barrett,"Tomi Lahren Blasts Alabama 'Heartbeat Bill' Greg Doherty/Getty Images May 17, 2019 views
Conservative commentator and FOX Nation host Tomi Lahren, who was fired by TheBlaze back in 2017 for calling it ""hypocritical"" to both support limited government and pro-life abortion laws, criticized Alabama's ""heartbeat bill"" on Thursday as ""too restrictive.""
""I will be attacked by fellow conservatives for saying this but so be it, this Alabama abortion ban is too restrictive,"" said Lahren. ""It doesn’t save life, it simply forces women into more dangerous methods, other states or countries. You don’t encourage life via blanket government mandate!""

It doesn’t save life, it simply forces women into more dangerous methods, other states or countries. You don’t encourage life via blanket government mandate! — Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) May 16, 2019
After some of the pushback she expected online, Lahren followed up her post by replying to a tweet slamming her stance as ""anti-Christian, anti-family, and anti-freedom.""
""If you think banning abortion with no exception for rape or incest will stop women from terminating pregnancy, you’re not being honest with yourself,"" wrote Lahren, adding: ""P.S. you’re not God so don’t you dare evaluate my Christian faith based on your moral superiority complex."" If you think banning abortion with no exception for rape or incest will stop women from terminating pregnancy, you’re not being honest with yourself. P.S. you’re not God so don’t you dare evaluate my Christian faith based on your moral superiority complex. https://t.co/TUbRPqudkm — Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) May 16, 2019
Lahren caused a stir on the right back in March 2017 when she voiced her pro-choice perspective during an appearance on ""The View."" At the time, Lahren hosted her own show on Glenn Beck's TheBlaze TV, but her comments drove a wedge between herself and her employer resulting in her suspension and a wrongful termination lawsuit.
""I'm pro-choice, and here's why,"" Lahren told the hosts of ""The View."" ""I am a constitutional, you know, someone that loves the Constitution. I'm someone that’s for limited government. So I can't sit here and be a hypocrite and say I'm for limited government but I think the government should decide what women do with their bodies. I can sit here and say that, as a Republican and I can say, you know what, I'm for limited government, so stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well.""
In response, Beck suspended Lahren and engaged in a back and forth with her on Twitter, as noted by Variety . ""Rule another label out. I am NOT a 'constitutional.'"" Beck tweeted. ""I believe in LIFE, liberty and property. Just an old fashioned 'constitutionalist.'""
""I have moderate, conservative, and libertarian views,"" Lahren tweeted the next day. ""I'm human. I will never apologize, to anyone, for being an independent thinker."" In response, Beck wrote: ""Wait, libertarian views? Help me out on Trumpcare, stimulus, and executive orders. Trump is anything but libertarian.""
Lahren eventually sued TheBlaze and Beck for wrongful termination, the parties ultimately settling in May 2017.
""The deal allows the 24-year-old pundit to be freed from her employment contract — which was to expire in September — and pursue new work that competes with The Blaze,"" The Dallas Morning News , which broke the story, reported. ""She also gets to keep the Facebook page that The Blaze created for her, and on which she has amassed 4.3 million followers. Lahren will 'promptly' return The Blaze's 'intellectual property' that was posted to the Facebook page, said her lawyer, Brian Lauten. In court hearings, Lauten had offered to delete all of the videos produced by The Blaze off the Facebook page, which would include some of Lahren's most popular posts. Some had been watched more than 67 million times."""

Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) made her disdain for conservative Christians clear this week with multiple attacks she made on social media about people of faith.
Ocasio-Cortez's attacks were sparked by Alabama outlawing nearly all abortion in the state this week, which led to freshman congresswoman claiming without evidence that ""US religious fundamentalists"" are trying to ""outlaw sex that falls outside their theology.""
""Abortion bans aren’t just about controlling women’s bodies. They’re about controlling women’s sexuality,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Wednesday. ""Owning women. From limiting birth control to banning comprehensive sex ed, US religious fundamentalists are working hard to outlaw sex that falls outside their theology."" Abortion bans aren’t just about controlling women’s bodies. They’re about controlling women’s sexuality. Owning women. From limiting birth control to banning comprehensive sex ed, US religious fundamentalists are working hard to outlaw sex that falls outside their theology. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 16, 2019
Ocasio-Cortez continued her attacks on Christianity on Thursday, mocking conservative Christians in a tweet in order to push her political agenda.
""Usury - aka high interest - happens to be explicitly denounced in the Bible (& in many other religions),"" Ocasio-Cortez claimed. ""Looking forward to having the religious right uphold their principles + sign onto my bill. Unless of course they’re only invoking religion to punish women + queer people."" Usury - aka high interest - happens to be explicitly denounced in the Bible (& in many other religions). Looking forward to having the religious right uphold their principles + sign onto my bill. Unless of course they’re only invoking religion to punish women + queer people. https://t.co/h7FxTaMxKb — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 17, 2019
In a statement to The Daily Wire, Pastor Mark Burns noted Ocasio-Cortez’s claims were not accurate, highlighting that she lacked key context about scripture.
""In context, usury in the Old Testament was when a fellow Jew would charge interest to a fellow Jew. There was no requirement set for interest on a loan to those outside the household of faith,"" Burns said. ""For example, after the Babylonian captivity, the Jews were rebuilding their homes and needed money. There were wealthy Jews who allowed their brothers to borrow money yet charged them interest, which was forbidden in the law God gave Moses. Thus, Nehemiah and Ezra informed the lenders they must remove the interest charges, which they did.""
""This would be similar to a son or daughter borrowing a thousand dollars and the mom or dad charging interest,"" Burns continued. ""It is something that most families would never do. This is the same principle God established for the Jews among their brothers. They were all in a covenant family.""
""Even Christ said in a parable to take money and invest it to have more income and thus use interest or gains from profit to your benefit,"" Burns added. ""It is normal, however, if there is interest charged on someone who is an associate that borrows for his business. This also assists in motivating the borrower to pay back the loan back as delayed payments can increase the charges.""
On Friday, Ocasio-Cortez attacked Republicans' Christian beliefs, calling them ""far-right"" and ""creepy.""
""What angers me about the GOP’s attempts to turn the United States into a far-right Christian theocracy is how dishonest they are about it,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. ""At least be forthright about your desire to subvert and dismantle our democracy into a creepy theological order led by a mad king."" What angers me about the GOP’s attempts to turn the United States into a far-right Christian theocracy is how dishonest they are about it. At least be forthright about your desire to subvert and dismantle our democracy into a creepy theological order led by a mad king. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 17, 2019
Last month, Ocasio-Cortez was criticized for completely ignoring the Easter day Islamic terrorist attacks on Christian churches in Sri Lanka, which left hundreds dead.
Ocasio-Cortez's silence came after many prominent figures in the media had called her out over her silence after she rushed to politicize the New Zealand mosque attacks in March.
British news personality Piers Morgan tweeted: ""Twitter-obsessed @AOC posted 14 times about the terror attack on Muslims in New Zealand, but has posted nothing about the terror attack on Christians by Muslim extremists in Sri Lanka. Very odd."" Twitter-obsessed @AOC posted 14 times about the terror attack on Muslims in New Zealand, but has posted nothing about the terror attack on Christians by Muslim extremists in Sri Lanka. Very odd. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) April 23, 2019
Senior White House Adviser Kellyanne Conway also called out Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter for ignoring the attacks, which led to this response from Ocasio-Cortez: ""Hello Ms. Conway, On Easter I was away from tech visiting my grandmother in Puerto Rico, which continues to suffer from the White House’s incompetent disaster response. Are you trying to imply that I am less Christian? What was the point of you bringing this up on national TV?""
Conway noted that Ocasio-Cortez's claim was bogus because she was busy tweeting about her new documentary and promoting herself.
""Hi Congresswoman @AOC. My best to your grandmother. My grandmothers are irreplaceable; miss them every day,"" Conway responded. ""Good that you now condemn Sri Lanka massacre. Some found it odd a prolific tweeter was silent. Following day you tweeted about your movie"" 1/2: Hi Congresswoman @AOC . My best to your grandmother.

Ocasio-Cortez then played the victim card, claiming that Conway was trying to ""stoke suspicion"" around her ""Christianity.""

If you’re so moved, let’s do more to welcome immigrants fleeing religious persecution. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 28, 2019
Republican strategist Andrew Surabian said that Ocasio-Cortez's excuse was a ""lie,"" tweeting: ""Weird, because it looks like the day after the Sri Lanka attack occurred you had enough time & tech to send out a tweet promoting your upcoming @netflix documentary...But nothing for hundreds killed in Sri Lanka?

Following the tragic white supremacist terrorist attack on mosques in New Zealand, Ocasio-Cortez mocked people of faith while championing extreme gun control measures, including banning all semi-automatic firearms .
Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: ""At 1st I thought of saying, 'Imagine being told your house of faith isn’t safe anymore.' But I couldn’t say 'imagine.' Because of Charleston. Pittsburgh. Sutherland Springs. What good are your thoughts & prayers when they don’t even keep the pews safe?""

Here are some of the notable responses Ocasio-Cortez's tweet elicited online:
""Saying thoughts and prayers do nothing in the immediate aftermath of people murdered while **praying** in their house of worship is the single dumbest f***ing nuclear take I’ve ever seen on this website. Ever,"" Stephen Miller tweeted. ""I don’t care who it came from. She’s an over exposed child. But *of course* it came from *that* person. Of course it did. Do yourselves a favor and mute her.

""This is incredibly insensitive to my Muslim brothers and sisters who were slain in cold blood while they were literally praying because they want to be closer to their creator and they want to become better people,"" Siraj Hashmi tweeted.

This 'Woke Harry Met Sally' Screed Is Just Everything | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47379/woke-harry-met-sally-screed-just-everything-paul-bois,"This 'Woke Harry Met Sally' Screed Is Just Everything ""As a parting gift, she buys Harry a wagon wheel coffee table."" Hulton Archive / Handout / Getty Images May 18, 2019 views
Is it a genuine satire of woke sensibilities or an actual woke fantasy of what should be? Either way, it's knee-slapping hilarious, though for entirely different reasons.
A recent entry over at McSweeney's by Amanda Recupido re-envisions several famous scenes from the iconic romantic comedy ""When Harry Met Sally"" if the title character Harry (previously played by Billy Crystal) had turned his woke-factor dial up to 11, all of which pack quite a mirthful punch.
For the scene when Harry and Sally drive from the University of Chicago to New York City, Harry's hilarious observations about male/female differences (""men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way"") have been replaced by his acknowledging that ""gender is a construct.""
""I respect the opinions and achievements of all people without sexualizing them for my own personal conquest,"" the woke Harry tells Sally. ""Also, gender is a construct.""
Later, when Sally tells Harry she will be pursuing journalism, he is entirely supportive instead of derisive. ""I know you know this, but don’t let them pay you any less than what you’re worth,"" the woke Harry tells Sally. ""Even though you have a degree from a competitive school, I understand I have a natural advantage in my career because I’m a cis white hetero man, and I would hate to see your talent be undervalued.""
Of course, Recupido's reworking of the iconic ""I'll have what she's having"" scene gets the biggest laughs of all. From the piece:
Harry and Sally have a heated discussion at a diner about enthusiastic consent. “I recognize it’s not your place to teach me,” Harry confesses. “But now I understand how to listen better to my partner’s needs. I recognize orgasms happen in many different ways, and sometimes a sexual encounter doesn’t even have to have a goal.” A woman seated nearby orders whatever she damn pleases without worrying what anyone else thinks.
No ""I can still smell your perfume on my clothes"" moment on New Year's Eve for this gender-studies-professor-sanctioned rewrite of the Rob Reiner classic. Instead, Harry tells Sally that he will respect her ""space"" by not performing any ""public grand gestures"" while giving her time to think about their relationship. Eventually, Sally leaves Harry behind by going to Rome for an international fellowship and gives him a ""wagon wheel coffee table.""
After their fight, Harry leaves Sally just one heartfelt message that says, “Hey, I’m sorry I’ve been pushing my emotional labor onto you, and I’ll be right here when you’re ready to talk, but otherwise, I’m going to respect your space. Don’t worry, I won’t pressure you with any public grand gestures or anything.” Sally takes her time to respond, especially since she’s so busy writing investigative pieces on the #MeToo movement.
Sally has an epiphany, and tells Harry how once you realize what you want for the rest of your life, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible, and that’s why she applied for that international fellowship and is moving to Rome. As a parting gift, she buys Harry a wagon wheel coffee table.

ERICKSON: No Room For Honesty | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Erick Erickson,05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47384/erickson-no-room-honesty-erick-erickson,"May 18, 2019 views
Listen to various abortion activists and Hollywood-faded stars and you might be under the impression that Georgia, Alabama and other states have just passed laws that could give women the death penalty for having abortions. In fact, some news outlets have run stories that these states would arrest women for having abortions.
Sadly, at a time when the news media and progressive activists lament the President's dubious relationship with the truth, these are not just misstatements but outright lies. Last week, Alabama passed a law that would prohibit abortion except for situations where the mother's own life is at risk. News outlets faithfully reported that under this law, women could be jailed for having an abortion.
Section 5 of the new Alabama law states, and this is a direct quote: ""No woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be criminally or civilly liable. Furthermore, no physician confirming the serious health risk to the child's mother shall be criminally or civilly liable for those actions."" One need never get to that section, however. The synopsis of the legislation that precedes the actual legislative language states, ""This bill would provide that a woman who receives an abortion will not be held criminally culpable or civilly liable for receiving the abortion."" Perhaps reporters could read the legislation instead of taking abortion activists' statements as truth.
The same is true in Georgia. Actress Alyssa Milano claimed on social media that ""The Georgia bill states that a woman can be investigated for miscarrying and that women who travel to another state to get an abortion can spend up to ten years in prison."" This is actually a lie. The law does not say that.
Georgia has, since 1876, prohibited the prosecution of a woman for the death of her unborn child for any reason. In May 1997, Jacquelyn Aretha Hillman was indicted for allegedly shooting herself in the abdomen to kill her unborn child. She was eight months pregnant, 18 years old, and the child's father was nowhere to be found. The child died.
Because Georgia law prohibits prosecuting a woman for the death of her unborn child, prosecutors sought to charge Hillman with unlawfully performing an abortion. The Georgia Court of Appeals ruled in Hillman v. State of Georgia that no woman could be charged for the death of her own unborn child for any reason. In fact, the court said if a woman could be charged for the death of her unborn child, ""any woman who suffers a post-viability miscarriage could be subject to scrutiny regarding whether or not she intentionally acted to cause the miscarriage.""
One need only read the text of Georgia's new fetal heartbeat law to see this has not changed. When given the opportunity to overrule the Hillman decision by legislation, the legislature declined. When given the opportunity to repeal the 1876 statute that clearly prohibits prosecuting women for the death of their unborn child, no matter the cause, the legislature refused.
One would never know this by listening to news coverage of these pieces of legislation. One would never know it from the fundraisers being held by progressives using these laws as political causes. Those who think the media should have some level of honesty in how they report these issues are going to again be disappointed. The supposed champions of truth in the press have embraced a party line that is wholly dishonest.
There is also a necessary moment of honesty for the pro-life movement. While the movement pours its energy into banning abortion, many abortions are the result of desperation on the part of women who view themselves as out of options. The pro-life community needs to expand options.
Working to ban abortion is good. It is taking a human life at its most vulnerable stage of development. Working to make adoption easier and less expensive is also necessary. Providing support and safety for pregnant women is also necessary. The pro-life cause has science on its side. It also needs to make sure pregnant moms know the pro-life movement is on their side.

Elton John: It’s ‘Bulls***’ To Criticize A Heterosexual Man For Playing A Homosexual Man In A Film | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47390/elton-john-its-bulls-criticize-heterosexual-man-ashe-schow,"May 18, 2019 views
Legendary musician Sir Elton John has come to the defense of the straight actor who plays him in the forthcoming film “Rocketman.”
Taron Egerton was chosen to play the musical icon despite being heterosexual, and many people are complaining that John, who is gay, should have been played by someone from the LGBT community. John himself pushed back on such criticism in an exclusive interview with The Sun’s Dan Wootton.
John, when asked about the criticism Egerton received, apparently waved his hand “dismissively” and told Wootton: “That’s all bulls***, I’m sorry.”
“If people don’t like it, review-wise, or it doesn’t make one dollar, it’s the movie I wanted to make and that’s all that counts,” John added. “I can look back and say, ‘You know what, I love it. I can live with it.’”
Before being asked about the criticism, John had praised Egerton.
“I was very emotional just now as well. The movie floored me. But I’m very high. Taron is beyond belief. It’s like watching me. It’s quite extraordinary, he’s so me-like. He’s a megastar,” the famed singer said. “He was schooled by George Martin's son Giles and he’s done the most amazing job. I wanted it to be a movie where the actor sang — and he sings.”
The film takes a hard look into John’s meteoric rise and battles with alcoholism, drugs, and sex addiction. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival Thursday night.
John told Wootton he wasn’t nervous about a film which highlighted some of the “darkest moments” – Wootton’s phrase – of his life.
“No, I’m pretty open about things like that,” he said. “When Tantrums And Tiaras came out, it was the most honest documentary you could watch.
“Tantrums and Tiaras” is a 1997 documentary directed by John’s husband David Furnish. It contains footage from John’s 1995 world tour and behind-the-scenes footage.
In another interview , with Variety, John said it was difficult to watch the parts of that film that dealt with his family life.
""It's hard to watch the family stuff. The drugs stuff I can handle because I did it, but the family stuff is touching,"" he said.
In that same interview, John opened up about the self-doubt that he has even though he is an international superstar.
“I think every artist does [have self-doubt],” he said. “Every creative artist does have doubt and has moments of, ‘Am I doing the right thing? Am I good enough?’ And that’s what turns us into monsters as well because I think you become unreasonable and of course the chemical substances and the alcohol doesn’t help anything, and you lose touch with reality.”"
PRAGER: Should The Liberty Bell Leave Philadelphia? | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Dennis Prager,05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47387/prager-should-liberty-bell-leave-philadelphia-dennis-prager,"PRAGER: Should The Liberty Bell Leave Philadelphia? Photo by Joe Sohm/Visions of America/UIG via Getty Images May 18, 2019 views
When most Americans think of Philadelphia — although probably fewer today than ever before, given the low level of history education in American schools — they probably think of the founding of the United States, the Liberty Bell and the city's nickname, the City of Brotherly Love.
Having been to Philadelphia at least 20 times, I am among the many Americans who have warm feelings toward America's founding city. My daily radio show has a large and enthusiastic listener base there, and I have a son who lives nearby.
So, it is with no joy that I write about the transformation of Philadelphia into something far removed from the principles of the country it helped birth. Philadelphia's leading institutions — such as the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Philadelphia Flyers — provide depressing evidence.
We'll begin with the Philadelphia-based University of Pennsylvania, one of the country's Ivy League colleges. When Harvard Professor Steven Pinker, a liberal and an atheist, recently described American universities as a ""laughingstock,"" he could have been referring specifically to the University of Pennsylvania, which, among other Philadelphia institutions, is committed to dismantling American and Western civilization.
For decades, a portrait of William Shakespeare, the greatest English-language playwright who ever lived and the most widely read playwright in the world, hung over the main staircase of Fisher-Bennett Hall, home to Penn's English department.
Given Shakespeare's stature as an English-language writer, what other writer would an English department so honor? But that question only makes sense to those who believe that excellence should dictate what writer's portrait should hang in a university English department. The idea that excellence is all that matters in assessing artists is fundamental to Western civilization and is a primary reason for its ascent. It took a long time for humanity to transcend ethnic, racial, tribal and economic criteria for assessing art.
But the English department at the University of Pennsylvania, dominated as it is by those who equate Western civilization with ""white supremacy"" (aka leftists), voted to remove the Shakespeare portrait. As reported in The Daily Pennsylvanian, the university's student newspaper, ""The English Department voted to relocate and replace the portrait ... in order to represent a more diverse range of writers, according to an emailed statement from (Department Chair Jed) Esty, who declined to be interviewed.""
A few years later, in December 2016, students took down the portrait.
In its place they put up a portrait of Audre Lorde, a black feminist lesbian poet who died in 1992.
Equally nihilistic is a story out of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. On Aug. 9, 2017, tenured Penn Law professor Amy Wax and University of San Diego School of Law professor Larry Alexander co-authored an opinion piece titled ""Paying the price for breakdown of the country's bourgeois culture.""
Its thesis was that the rejection of American bourgeois middle-class culture is the primary reason for most social ills in America today:
""(American) culture laid out the script we all were supposed to follow: Get married before you have children and strive to stay married for their sake. Get the education you need for gainful employment, work hard, and avoid idleness. Go the extra mile for your employer or client. Be a patriot, ready to serve the country. Be neighborly, civic-minded, and charitable. Avoid coarse language in public. Be respectful of authority. Eschew substance abuse and crime.""
Within a few weeks, a petition was signed by 4,000 people calling for Wax's dismissal, and the dean of Penn Law, Ted Ruger, wrote an op-ed in The Daily Pennsylvanian, ostensibly about Charlottesville but really about Wax, in which he implied her views were ""divisive, even noxious."" Most significantly, he wrote, ""It is important that I state my own personal view that as a scholar and educator I reject emphatically any claim that a single cultural tradition is better than all others"" (referring to Wax's position that those bourgeois values are superior values).
After hundreds of her colleagues demanded Wax be fired, Ruger forbade her from teaching any first-year required courses at Penn Law.
Now to the Philadelphia Orchestra, one of the world's greatest. The orchestra recently received more than 500 applications for the position of assistant conductor. According to my Philly sources, the four finalists included only one male (a black male, for the record), despite the fact that males make up the overwhelming majority of orchestra conductors in the world and therefore the overwhelming majority of the applicants for the Philadelphia Orchestra position. There is little reason to believe that, as talented as they may be, the four were chosen on the basis of artistic excellence alone. The orchestra's gifted conductor, Yannick Nezet-Seguin, has declared this the year of the woman conductor and the year of the woman composer.
Most musicians are on the left, but Nezet-Seguin makes it more obvious than most. In a recent concert, the Philadelphia Orchestra featured the premiere of Philadelphia Voices, ""a political rant put to musical garbage,"" as some Philadelphians associated with the orchestra described it to me. In the fifth movement, named ""My House Is Full of Black People,"" the black teen narrator chants: ""The county is full of black people/ All wanting to be heard/ While old white men draw lines on maps/ To shut all of them up."" Later in the movement, he yells, ""If you would all just f—-ing listen!""
And this year, the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team removed the statue of American singer Kate Smith that the team had erected in 1987. Her rendition of ""God Bless America"" was played at every Flyers home game since 9/11, and she herself sang it for the Flyers in the 1970s. But last month, the team learned that Smith had sung a song with racist lyrics — ""That's Why Darkies Were Born"" — in 1931. That Paul Robeson, the great black singer — and enthusiastic supporter of Josef Stalin — also recorded the song doesn't matter. To the Flyers (and New York Yankees), Smith's whiteness undid all the good she did for America.
Will Philadelphia next remove the Liberty Bell? After all, it was commissioned by slave owners and inscribed with a verse from the Bible.

PARTY BREAK: Louisiana Abortion Bill Poised To Be Signed By Democrat Governor | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47394/party-break-louisiana-abortion-bill-poised-be-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 18, 2019 views
Making a major break with his party’s extreme stance on abortion, a Democratic governor has signaled his support for pro-life “heartbeat” legislation which would ban abortions after the unborn baby’s heartbeat is detected (around six-weeks gestation).
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards identifies as a rare pro-life Democrat, and apparently has personal ties to the issue.
“When I ran for governor, I said I was pro-life and so that’s something that’s consistent,"" he said when asked about heartbeat legislation making its way to his desk, reported Fox News.
“My position hasn’t changed. In eight years in the Legislature, I was a pro-life legislator,” Edwards said. According to Fox News, the Democrat says his faith directs him in supporting life, but that he also holds “personal significance” to the cause: “Nearly three decades ago, he and his wife decided to have his daughter, diagnosed as a baby with spina bifida, against the doctor's advice to abort.”
“I know that for many in the national party, on the national scene, that’s not a good fit. But I will tell you, here in Louisiana, I speak and meet with Democrats who are pro-life every single day,"" Edwards noted during his monthly radio show.
The governor’s position is far from his Democratic counterparts. For example, in January, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo celebrated a bill permitting abortion up to the moment of birth in the state for essentially any reason.
That same month, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam endorsed abortion-til-birth and infanticide during a radio interview.
“When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of the mother, with the consent of physicians, more than one physician by the way, and it’s done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus which is non-viable. So in this particular example, if the mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen, the infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if this is what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physician and the mother,” Northam said .
And during the 2016 presidential election, the party’s nominee, Hillary Clinton, supported abortion up until the moment of birth without restriction and said she’d work to end the Hyde Amendment, which currently stops the federal government (your tax dollars) from funding abortion.
“I will always defend Planned Parenthood. And I will say consistently and proudly: Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported, and appreciated; not undermined, misrepresented, and demonized. I believe we need to protect access to safe and legal abortion, not just in principal but in practice,” Mrs. Clinton said in 2016.
Conservative legislators have been teeing-up a showdown at the Supreme Court with a slew of pro-life legislation in the past few months. The Alabama Human Life Protection Act, signed into law on Wednesday by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, serves as the nation’s strictest anti-abortion law. The law totally outlaws abortion, save an exemption for the life of the mother, and targets third-party abortionists with life in prison for carrying out illegal procedures."
CAMP: How Progressives Use Logical Fallacies To Change The Abortion Debate | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47400/camp-how-progressives-use-logical-fallacies-change-frank-camp,"May 18, 2019 views
With the recent passage of anti-abortion bills in states like Georgia and Alabama, many progressive politicians and commentators have taken to social media in protest. These individuals rarely argue on the merits of the issue at hand, but pivot to peripheral debates, set up straw men, or employ other logical fallacies.
Such is the case with author and commentator Matthew Dowd, who sent out the following tweet on Wednesday: One of my younger brothers sent this to out to his nine living siblings today. He is a doctor by the way. And we all grew up Irish catholic. And i agree with him totally. pic.twitter.com/bQdNe6i7ZC — Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) May 15, 2019
One of my younger brothers sent this out to his nine living siblings today. He is a doctor, by the way. And we all grew up Irish Catholic. And I agree with him totally: ""We should pass a woman’s heartbeat law: if a woman has a heartbeat, you can’t tell her what to do with her g**damn body, ever.""
Dowd’s tweet is what’s known as an ""appeal to false authority."" Logically Fallacious has perhaps the best definition of this particular fallacy:
Using an alleged authority as evidence in your argument when the authority is not really an authority on the facts relevant to the argument.
Dowd’s tweet contains two appeals to false authority.
First, Dowd mentions that his brother, who sent the message, is a doctor. This is meant to imply that his brother is an authority regarding all things having to do with the human body. Therefore, if Dowd’s brother states that a law pertaining to abortion is bad, immoral, or otherwise unacceptable, who has the medical and social credentials to challenge him?
Second, Dowd notes that his family ""grew up Irish Catholic."" This is meant to imply that he and his siblings have more experience with pro-life apologetics than most others. Therefore, if Dowd and his siblings oppose the new laws from Georgia and Alabama, what argument could a pro-life individual possibly present that they haven’t already heard and discredited?
Both of these appeals sidestep the actual arguments at the heart of these laws, which are: When does life begin? Is a fetus less human than a post-birth infant by virtue of the fact that it’s developing inside another person? Does development dictate humanity? Is abortion ethically acceptable?
These are questions that abortion supporters don’t like to answer.
While the pro-life movement believes that life begins at conception (and science backs that up), the pro-abortion movement often sets the arbitrary standard of ""viability."" Such a standard is indeed arbitrary because ""viability"" not only changes where technology changes, but it can vary from person to person.
The ""viability"" argument is linked to the next question. If a fetus is less human because it is dependent on another for survival, there are numerous children and adults who are also less human. Infants and young children depend on their parents or guardians to feed them, clothe them, and keep them safe. Those with moderate to severe physical and mental disabilities depend on caretakers, doctors, and sometimes machines to survive. Those in a coma also survive only with the help of others.
Further, if development dictates humanity, if a fetus is less human because it is less developed physically and mentally than an infant, a toddler, a teenager, or an adult, where does the right to terminate end? Does a 35-year-old have the right to call for the termination of a teenager because the teenager is not as far along in their life cycle? Is the 35-year-old justified in calling a teenager ""less human,"" and therefore of less value to the species? It may seem farcical, yet that’s what’s being said of the pre-born.
Considering the above points, how can one claim that abortion is ethically acceptable? They cannot.
These are the arguments that those in the pro-abortion movement do not want to have. Instead, they pivot, or indulge in feel-good logical fallacies such as appealing to false authority in order to protect their glass castle.
When debating those in the pro-abortion movement, do not let them pivot. Do not let them engage in fallacious arguments. Keep them on point, and you will have a chance to alter their perception."
"Pete Buttigieg Wants Thomas Jefferson's Name Stripped Off Buildings, Honors | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47405/pete-buttigieg-wants-thomas-jeffersons-name-emily-zanotti,"Pete Buttigieg Wants Thomas Jefferson's Name Stripped Off Buildings, Honors Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images May 19, 2019 views
Upstart candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, told radio host Hugh Hewitt that that he supports efforts to remove acclaimed president Thomas Jefferson's name from buildings, honors, and events -- specifically the annual Democrat fundraiser, the ""Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.""
“Yeah, we're doing that in Indiana. I think it's the right thing to do,” Buttigieg said, according to the Washington Free Beacon , though he also offered a fairly neutral, half-hearted defense of the iconic president and author of the Declaration of Independence.
“Over time, you develop and evolve on the things you choose to honor, Jefferson is more problematic,” Buttigieg said. “There's a lot, of course, to admire in his thinking and his philosophy, but then again if you plunge into his writings, especially the notes on the state of Virginia, you know that he knew slavery was wrong. We are all morally conflicted human beings.”
Buttigieg stopped short of saying Jefferson's role in the founding of the United States should be wiped out of history books, but does support the idea that Jefferson should be stripped of visible honors, including his name on buildings and Federal institutions, because those visible tributes have an effect on people's emotional and psychological well-being.
“The real reason I think there is a lot of pressure on this is the relationship between the past and present that we're finding in a million different ways that racism isn't some curiosity out of the past that we're embarrassed about but moved on from,” Buttigieg explained.
He ultimately added that he sees it as his responsibility to make protect the affected from further harm: “It's alive. It's well. It's hurting people and it's one of the main reasons to be in politics today is to try to change or reverse the harms that went along with that.”
Jefferson has a conflicted record on slavery. Although he owned 175 slaves over the course of his life, and did not free them upon his death as some other founders did, Jefferson did author a law prohibiting the importation of new slaves into the state of Virginia as early as 1778. He officially abolished the slave trade in the United States in 1807, though in many cases the practice continued, out of the eye of the Federal government.
But Jefferson is also the product of his time, and historical figures need to be assessed within the context of the era in which they lived. Jefferson, like all historical figures, is a person , and complex -- and his contributions to the formation of the United States are far too great to be ignored.
There is, however, a concerted movement within the United States -- and almost exclusively on the left -- to erase aspects of American history now considered unsavory. Statues of Confederate war heroes have been removed across the south, certainly, but beyond that, groups have tried to remove everything from statues of missionary priests in California (St. Junipero Serra, specifically) to the Natural History Museum's statue of former president Theodore Roosevelt, whom protesters claim is an emblem of “patriarchy, white supremacy and settler-colonialism.”
The state of Indiana did successfully change its Jefferson-Jackson Dinner to the ""Hoosier Hospitality Dinner,"" a vague name stripped of honors that the party claimed was a thumb in the eye of Vice President Mike Pence, who they considered ""unwelcoming"" while he served as governor of Indiana. "
"WATCH: Romney Talks About Trump’s Moral ‘Character,’ And Rep. Justin Amash’s Shocking Tweets | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Frank Camp,05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47406/watch-romney-talks-about-trumps-moral-character-frank-camp,"May 19, 2019 views
On Sunday, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) appeared on CNN’s ""State of the Union"" with host Jake Tapper.
At the beginning of the segment, Tapper quoted a series of tweets from Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) in which the congressman claims that President Trump ""has engaged in impeachable conduct.""
Amash is the first Republican to stake out such a position. Check out The Daily Wire’s coverage of Amash’s comments here .
Tapper first asked Romney why only he and Amash have spoken negatively of the president’s alleged conduct since the debut of the redacted Mueller report:
TAPPER: This is the first time you have appeared on a Sunday show since the Mueller report was released, and you said at the time in a statement: ""I'm sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the president. I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia.""
You and Congressman Amash are the only two elected Republicans, I think, to express any misgivings about the behavior of the president or his campaign team based on the Mueller report. First of all, are you surprised that you two are the only ones that have really said anything condemning of the president's behavior as laid out?
ROMNEY: Well, I think every individual has to make their own judgment.
Romney then spoke about having read the document himself, and expressed hope that other lawmakers would do the same. He added that he believes ""there are a lot of people that want to reserve judgment until this has all played out.""
The senator continued:
My own view is that Justin Amash has reached a different conclusion than I have. I respect him. I think it's a courageous statement. But I believe that to make a case for obstruction of justice, you just don't have the elements that are evidenced in this document. And I also believe that an impeachment call is not only something that relates to the law, but also considers practicality and politics.
And the American people just aren't there. And I think those that are considering impeachment have to look also at the jury, which would be the Senate. The Senate is certainly not there either.
Tapper then asked Romney about the case for obstruction of justice.
The senator offered a measured reply, stating that while he is indeed troubled by parts of the report, he simply doesn’t believe obstruction is a viable route:
I just don't think that there is the full element that you need to prove an obstruction of justice case. I don't think a prosecutor would actually look at this and say, ""Okay, we have here all the elements that would get this to a conviction.""
So, everyone reaches their own conclusion. As I read the report, I was troubled by it. It was very disappointing, for a number of reasons. But it did not suggest to me that this was time to call for impeachment.
Moving forward, Tapper pressed Romney on President Trump’s character:
TAPPER: Do you think it's evidence that the president has disgraced the office of the presidency.
ROMNEY: Well, I think a number of the things that were done were really, really troubling and unfortunate and distressing. Clearly, the number of times that there were items of dishonesty, misleading the American public and the media, those are things that really you would not want to see from the highest office in the land.
When asked about possible ""abuse of power,"" Romney again noted that he doesn’t think impeachment is the correct path. He then spoke about the difficulty of assembling an obstruction case without an underlying crime, which makes the search for intent rather punishing.
Tapper continued to seek the senator’s opinion on Trump’s character, or lack there of:
TAPPER: You personally are somebody who has conducted himself according to a certain set of religious and ethical and moral principles throughout your life. I know you think about this and you talk about this. You have written about it. Do you think that the president has failed, based on what's in the Mueller report, as a moral leader? If not engaging in criminal conduct, is there a moral lacking there?
Sen. Romney offered an indirect yet fairly clear answer:
Well, I have – through op-eds and through the things I have said, I have made it very, very clear that I will support the president on policies where we agree. I will disagree with him openly if there's something that I think is wrong for the country or for my state.
But I think he could substantially improve his game when it comes to helping shape the character of the country. I think young people, as well as people around the world, look at the president of the United States and say, ""Does he exhibit the kind of qualities that we would want to emulate?"" And those are qualities of humility, of honesty, integrity. And those are things where I think there's been some call where the president has distanced himself from some of the best qualities of the human character.
Romney has long been an outspoken critic of the president when it comes to his character.
In a now-infamous March 3, 2016 speech, Romney blasted Trump as an amoral and thoughtless candidate.
Below are select quotes from that speech:
...if we make improvident choices, the bright horizon I’ve described will not materialize. And let me put it very plainly. If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.
...Dishonesty is Donald Trump’s hallmark.
...Think of Donald Trump’s personal qualities. The bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third grade theatrics. You know, we have long referred to him as “The Donald.” He’s the only person in the entire country to whom we have added an article before his name, and it was not because he had attributes we admired.
...Here’s what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.
Romney briefly flirted with the position of Secretary of State once Trump was elected, but according to CNN , ""sources close to Romney"" claim that the former presidential candidate wouldn’t offer a public apology for his past criticism of Trump, and was therefore jettisoned.
Romney has since softened the way in which he critiques the president, but has continued to call him out on occasion, like in Sunday’s interview with Tapper."
Progressives Want Democratic Party To Purge Remaining Pro-Lifers | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47407/progressives-want-democratic-party-purge-remaining-emily-zanotti,"Progressives Want Democratic Party To Purge Remaining Pro-Lifers Mark Wilson/Getty Images May 19, 2019 views
Leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are demanding that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee abandon its support of the five remaining pro-life Democrats in Congress and allow abortion advocates to compete for their seats.
Newsweek reports that the CPC's co-chair, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) has now said, in no uncertain terms, that Democrats who do not support the practice of ending unborn life in the womb are no longer welcome inthe party, and that they should be primaried out of office by more reliable Democrats.
""I think we should allow for strong primary challenges, so that people can really put their Democratic chops on the line, if you will, and let the Democratic voters decide who they want,"" Jayapal told a press conference. ""You can't say you're a Democrat if you're against immigrants, if you're against abortion, if you're against gay marriage and LGBTQ rights. I'm not sure what it means to be a Democrat if all of those things are true.""
She then issued her challenge.
""I understand that the DCCC is funded by—we are a membership organization—it's funded by our members. And I understand that the DCCC is often going to try to protect the incumbent,” Jayapal concluded. ""But I do think we have to look at all of these issues and think about what it means to be a Democrat.”
Justice Democrats, the group that championed far-left progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Coretz (D-NY) in the last election cycle and is now challenging the DCCC and DNC for cutting openly progressive campaign workers out of official directories, agreed that pro-lifers now have no place in the Democratic party, and that they intend to fight for their exclusion.
""It's hypocritical for the Democratic Party leadership to continue to protect [pro-life Dems] while claiming to fight against the attacks on reproductive rights in states like Georgia and Alabama."" Waleed Shahid, Justice Dems communications director told the Daily Beast .
There are technically only five ""pro-life Democrats"" left:Rep. Dan Lipinkski (D-IL), Rep. Collin Peterson (D-MN) and Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) in the House, and Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Bob Casey (D-PA) in the Senate.
Democrats have long toyed with making abortion the central sacrament of their platform, and movement away from diversity of thought on the issue, for a party that now seems to support abortion through all three trimesters of pregnancy and up until the baby is descending through a woman's birth canal, ""pro-life Democrats,"" as consistent as the ethic might be, are an anachronism.
There are a couple of problems with leading a 'purge"" against pro-life Democrats, though. For starters, dropping pro-life people from the Democratic Party belies the insincerity of one of abortion advocates' favorite arguments: that a pro-life position might be more ""acceptable"" if it were pared with support for government programs like universal health care, welfare expansion, and free college. Clearly, you can support the full Democratic platform -- even to the point of being elected with a ""D"" after your name -- and departing from the party on a single issue will cost you your membership.
It's also ignorant of the political landscape. Progressives have been trying to oust Rep. Dan Lipinski from his berth representing the west side of Chicago and some of the city's southern and western suburbs for nearly a decade, to no avail. In 2018, one progressive came close, but failed to recognize that Lipinski's beliefs are in line with those of his constituents, and that he represents them, even on the issue of abortion.
This time around, challenging Lipinksi won't be so easy. The DCCC, headed by a longtime friend of Lipinksi, has pledged to support incumbents, particularly against primary challenges from the left, and Lipinski's seat is no exception. Its also unlikely that either Manchin or Casey are touchable, given that they, like Lipinski, represent moderate Democrat constituencies that lean pro-life."
