Fact is you're hating him because he made a ton. The scandal has made him stronger as he went on to make a ton without giving in to boos and jeers. Warner made a decent score too.
The pathetic thing is Smith banned from international cricket for a year came back and made a ton all whilst only facing club bowlers for a year... Yet the elite English are still struggling.
The BBC mocked Smith for a slow century, and a lot more. And ironically didn't open comments on their article. No wonder why.
Its ok for us Brits to brush it under the carpet like when Hales got banned for drug misuse... We label it as ""off the field incident"" - no he's an abuser!

He would not be able to secure any better deal from the EU (there is not even any time left for renegotiation, even if the EU wanted to go down this road) and he would proceed with no-deal hard Brexit and a hard border in Ireland, thus abrogating the Good Friday accords. He is not smart enough to have any reservations about the consequences of these actions. He would be heralded as a ""conquering hero"" by the right wing, as the embodiment of the ""Spirit of Dunkirk"", having saved Britain (at a price, of course) from the clutches of these dastardly Europeans!! The ""Sun"" would run double spreads celebrating his ""courage"" in rescuing the country from German domination. He would merge the Tory with Farage's Brexit party and purge it from any sensible fractions. In that, he would be assisted by Jeremy Corbyn, who would celebrate Brexit as the removal of the shackles that had inhibited the socialist transformation of Britain. The triumvirate would then have to try hard to keep the UK together, as a unified Ireland may become inescapable, and Scotland may finally find the guts to go on its own way (although I am not sure that the Scots would master that amount of courage outside the football pitch)."

It is quite disingenuous to criticise GetUp for getting behind the most vital issue if our times and sticking to it throughout the recent election..
Good on them for being the only altruistic group of voices speaking out for the common good. The problems faced by GetUp’s army of volunteers talking to individual voters on the ground are no different to those that the United Nations itself is experiencing in trying to convince the highest levels of government that the climate emergency requires the most rapid, full-scale global response. On each level the impediment to the message is a social era where public information is more centrally controlled than ever by vested interests purveying the false doctrine that selfish venality is gratifying and good.
Epitomising that contrast is the LNP’s call to deny GetUp’s presence around polling booths, yet no one is demanding a probity test to prevent wealthy individuals with dubious business histories from registering their own political party and saturating every level of mass communication for their own self-interested purposes.

Now on May 15 the Liberal leader was telling us that we had a 'strong economy' so 'strong' that we were assured of government surpluses until doomsday [which is just around the corner, of course, if you're SloMo].
Now, 45 billion dollars of tax cuts have to be passed immediately or the economy will tank.
Labor will [it's OUR policy] pass any tax cuts for lower and middle income earners straight away, but the Liberals are not really interested in tax cuts at all. They are only interested in playing politics [again].

Attacking the crony network has long been essential, yet virtually ignored.

“Morrison needs to look after Abbott” wrote a columnist in The Oz on the midnight of election day. As a typical example of the class war we're told we rejected, Newstart recipients need not apply.
Only when we break up the network of favours and rewards that allows the decision-makers to be so thoroughly controlled by the ruling clique, and so willing to serve its interests, can be expect more representative and responsive government.
Greens, for instance, can condemn under parliamentary privilege individuals whose rapid move from public to private office invites the question of corrupt use of contacts and knowledge, or in a move from private to public office the perversion of that office to serve private interests.

His beliefs originate in the Bronze Age Middle East where the weather was believed to be the machinations of a god who, like a stern father would at times withhold his blessings (i.e. a drought) and at other times be a generous provider (i.e. good seasons). Hence praying for rain - as recommended by the Deputy Prime Minister - was seen as an essential means of gaining God's favor and asking him to make the rains return.
These days rational people understand that the weather is a natural phenomenon controlled by multiple factors although primarily the result of the flow of solar heat from the equator to the poles coupled with the Coriolis effect produced by the rotation of the Earth. Large scale convection cells arise in the equatorial regions and after dumping large volumes of rain, dry air flow towards the mid-latitudes where the major deserts including those in Australia occur. Deflected by the Coriolis force that produces high pressure cells, global warming is increasing the size of those cells and pushing rain bearing winds further away from southern Australia and intensifying the drying of the continent. Of course Morrison and his dimwitted supporters deny that global warming is occurring or that if it is, humans are not responsible and anyway, according to the government, Australia always has been subject to droughts even if not as prolonged and extensive as the latest event.
So while parts of the country were subverted by Morrison's lies about the future of coal mining jobs, even though companies like BHP think there is no future, the replacement of coal, oil and gas fired electricity generation by renewables is ever accelerating. Even in Britain, the originators of the Industrial Revolution, coal fired plants continue to be shut down and coal mining has practically disappeared. The consumption of coal in Britain – mostly for electricity – fell from 157 million tonnes in 1970 to 18 million tonnes in 2016.
Who could doubt that the same changes will occur in Australia yet Morrison told people in regional seats that the ALP wanted to destroy their wonderful jobs in coal mines despite an abundance of evidence that the market, here and overseas, will continue to collapse.
Trump told the coal miners in the United States that "" “Hillary hates coal miners! She wants to destroy their lives!"" even though all she did was to acknowledge that millions of coal jobs aren't coming back.
Morrison used exactly the same lies in Australian election yet like Trump, he will not be able to reverse changes that are well underway even if he prays to his god to make it rain and save the coal miner's jobs.
As Abraham Lincoln said: ""You can't fool all of the people all of the time""."

Well done for all your efforts so far. I live in SE Asia and read the UK papers daily, and it is great that meaningfil things are finally starting to happen - I have been aware of climate change and the looming environmental crisis since the 80's so it has taken time for the masses to wake up.
However - my query to you is that however aware people in Europe have become thanks to people like you, in Asia nobody has a clue. Nobody cares about the environment. Plastic is everywhere, blowing around towns, covering riverbanks and roadsides. My neighbours burn all their plastic rubbish every evening (as do billions in Asia), and the rivers and oceans have been wrecked in the name of development.
How to get the message across where there is no free press or political awareness? No criticism of elders or government allowed (Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, China)?
Asia is the real problem and there doesnt seem to be a solution. Whilst someone in the UK starts recycling and using public transport, China builds another brown coal plant and the landfills across Asia burn out of control."

Jews in Germany warned of risks of wearing kippah cap in public | World news,www.theguardian.com,theguardian.com,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/26/jews-in-germany-warned-of-risks-of-wearing-kippah-cap-in-public,"Government commissioner says lifting of inhibitions and rise of uncouthness are factors behind rising incidence of antisemitism. Germany’s government commissioner on antisemitism has suggested Jews should not always wear the traditional kippah cap in public, in the wake of a spike in anti-Jewish attacks.
“I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere, all the time, in Germany ,” Felix Klein said in an interview published Saturday by the Funke regional press group. The remarks were criticised by the Israeli president as representing a “capitulation” to antisemitism.
In issuing the warning, Klein said he had “alas, changed my mind compared to previously”.
Antisemitic attacks are on the rise in a number of European countries, and a survey of Jewish people across the European Union carried out in December found 89% of Jews feel antisemitism has increased in their country over the past decade, while 85% believed it to be a serious problem.
Antisemitic hate crimes rose by 20% in Germany last year, according to interior ministry data, which blamed nine out of ten cases on the extreme right. There were 62 violent antisemitic attacks, compared to 37 in 2017. France has also seen a spike in violent incidents.
Klein, whose post was created last year, cited “the lifting of inhibitions and the uncouthness which is on the rise in society” as factors behind a rising incidence of antisemitism.
“The internet and social media have largely contributed to this, but so have constant attacks against our culture of remembrance.”
And he suggested police, teachers and lawyers should be better trained to recognise what constitutes “clearly defined” unacceptable behaviour and “what is authorised and what is not”.
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said on Sunday that Klein’s remarks “shocked” him, and while appreciating the German government’s “commitment to the Jewish community,” accused it of bowing to those targeting Jews.
“Fears about the security of German Jews are a capitulation to antisemitism and an admittance that, again, Jews are not safe on German soil,” said Rivlin. “We will never submit, will never lower our gaze and will never react to antisemitism with defeatism - and expect and demand our allies act in the same way.”
The US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, also criticised Klein’s advice. He wrote on Twitter: “The opposite is true. Wear your kippa. Wear your friend’s kippa. Borrow a kippa and wear it for our Jewish neighbors. Educate people that we are a diverse society.”
Antisemitism rising sharply across Europe, latest figures show Read more
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany welcomed the fact that government had recognised the seriousness of the situation. “It has for some time been the case that Jews in some cities potentially endanger themselves if they are visible as Jews”, Josef Schuster told news agency AFP.
The increased prominence of far-right parties in a number of European countries in the past few years has led to antisemitic and other extremist rhetoric that was previously confined to the fringes appearing more and more in the mainstream. In Germany, the arrival in parliament of the far-right AfD, whose leaders openly question the culture of atonement for second world war atrocities , has contributed to the change in atmosphere.
In Hungary, the nationalist government of Viktor Orbán has repeatedly been accused of anti-semitism, particularly in its campaigns against the financier and philanthropist George Soros, who is of Hungarian Jewish origin. Orbán has always denied the allegations and pointed out that, on the whole, Jews living in Hungary feel safe, unlike many living in western Europe. He has also criticised western Europe for accepting refugees and migrants from Muslim countries, claiming they bring antisemitism with them.
Klein acknowledged that the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers, many from Muslim countries such as Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq, has had an impact on the situation in Germany. Some were influenced by watching certain television channels “which transmit a dreadful image of Israel and Jews”, he said.
However, he emphasised that the far-right was to blame for the overwhelming majority of antisemitic crime.
“Antisemitism has always been here. But I think that recently, it has again become louder, more aggressive and flagrant,” Berlin’s top legal expert on antisemitism Claudia Vanoni said in a recent interview, adding the problem was “deeply rooted” in German society.
She also said the proliferation of online platforms that allow people to express extremist views without inhibition while hiding behind screens had fostered the rise in cases.
Justice minister Katarina Barley told the Handelsblatt newspaper the increase was “shameful for our country” but added that the police were “vigilant”.
Sabine Leutheuser-Scharrenberger, a former justice minister, said: “Everything has to be done to ensure that Jews can live their religion without facing danger and while relying on the rule of law”.

Judith Kerr was not scared to confront death in her stories. But she helped us savour the joy of life | Frank Cottrell Boyce | Opinion,www.theguardian.com,ClareLondon,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/25/she-took-delight-in-spreading-joy-because-for-judith-kerr-life-was-a-brilliant-adventure#129460742,"One of the most moving of the pieces that was written about her came from Nancy Banks-Smith, who recalled that when she interviewed Kneale he wanted mostly to talk about his wife. Maybe that’s why that little book means so much to us. Because it grew out of love – love which is as magnificent, dangerous and disruptive as an uninvited tiger.
This paragraph made me gulp, again.
I know why this has affected me so much. Yes, I loved Judith Kerr's writing, her trilogy, her wonderful wonderful Mog books.
But what makes me choke up is that she was a really good person, genuine and modest, generous, sweet-natured and loving. In a nasty world, as it mainly is, right now, with dangers on every side, with life on earth itself under severe threat, with societies stressed and many of us frightened, she stood for stability, the old ways of courtesy and gentleness and - goodness.
And now she's gone. She was very old, she reached back in history. She was a continuum. A reminder of where we've been and where we are now.
Damn that good people don't have some special genetic sequence that means they stick around for a lot longer than the rest of us, spreading their effect on more of us.
I remember the TM movement, back in the day. It seems to have died down now. I don't know how many people still practise; you don't hear about it much. There was one key conviction in that movement, which was the idea that if 1% of people meditated, that was sufficient to kind of imbue the rest of us, the meditative influence would spread, somehow. The effect would be felt overall by all of us, from that 1%.
And that, I guess, is what I feel about Judith Kerr dying. She was a one-percenter. She spread her radiance.
I was in a bookshop yesterday. There was a Mog book displayed on the counter, with a card which said RIP Judith Kerr. Oh yes, I said to the woman at the counter, my eyes filling immediately. Oh yes - oh yes. Judith Kerr. Lovely woman.
I wish I could have met her once and hugged her. I would simply have said - thank you."

Book clinic: What can I give a child to help them with losing a parent? | Books,www.theguardian.com,ClareLondon,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/25/book-clinic-what-can-i-give-a-child-to-help-them-with-grief#129460916,"11 and 7. That's very very young. Poor little things.
I was 22 when I lost my darling mother. It was the most momentous event that ever happened in my life. Devastating.
I'm not here to suggest a book. But I do think the most important thing above all else, all else , is to keep their mummy in the living daily conversation. Never loads the children up with the conviction that it is now 'time' to stop thinking about her, being upset. Talk talk talk.
When my mother died, the overriding feeling was the confusion and bewilderment that, as I walked the streets, everybody didn't stop me to say, I'm so sorry. That they didn't stop to talk about my wonderful mother. The world was going on, with her absent and never coming back. And people were not coming up to me in the street, not mentioning her.
I became accustomed to this, of course. After the initial few weeks of total shock, that the ultimate had happened, I adjusted. I adjusted my reality. My intellectual reality caught up with my emotional reality.
But my god I needed people to know, to care and to talk to me about her. Lacking the world knowing about her, I needed anyone I knew in my life to refer often to her. I needed to be able to talk about her.
I didn't get it. Yes, people ask, a tiny tiny bit, but just at the beginning.
It would have been healing if, for a very long time afterwards, the subject remained open, to some degree.
One of the most dislocating aspects of death is the fact that suddenly, not only the person, the human personality, is no longer there - but their body goes immediately, too. The transition from alive to dead is very blunt. I would have preferred a society which mourned collectively for their beloved dead, communal dance and singing and stories. Not a terrified, devastated funeral and then you all go home, utterly lost.
I would have liked singing, dancing, talking - and for many more people to be warm and speak of her. For that, one would need to live in a small, traditional community. In a big city, it's hard - I found it very very hard. Particularly the conversation shutting down so very quickly and finally afterwards, so - it was all gone. Everything.
I'm 68. I still think of my darling mother, very regularly, 46 years later. I still talk to her, in my mind. I remain aware of her. In that way, she's still with me.
So - my take on it is that books - you'd need to be an adult, in my view, to be able to take much reassurance from stories. Yes, of course, if there's something out there that helps, Judith Kerr's Mog book, obviously. But in the main, the best gift you can give two small children is simply to keep their mother in the conversation - all the time. So they understand that the enormity of the experience, to them, is understood and shared. That, in my view, will be healing."
Clare O'Neil rules herself out of Labor deputy leader race and endorses Richard Marles | Australia news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Paul Karp,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/26/clare-oneil-rules-herself-out-of-labor-deputy-leader-race-and-endorses-richard-marles,"Frontbencher says her party took a big risky policy agenda to the election that was hard to explain and easy to weaponise. Clare O’Neil has ruled herself out of the race for deputy Labor leader, leaving fellow Victorian rightwinger Richard Marles as the last candidate standing, who is likely to take the role unopposed.
The shadow financial services minister told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday she believed she could do the “front-facing” aspect of the role but Marles, the shadow defence minister, would be better at the internal aspect of “bringing the party together behind the leader”.
O’Neil also gave a blunt assessment of Labor’s policy offering at the 2019 election, describing it as the “wrong platform”, unwieldy and risky and suggesting the party will have to ditch or at least reconsider every policy to reconnect with voters.
With nominations set to close on Monday, Anthony Albanese will become Labor leader unopposed , avoiding the need for a lengthy members’ ballot.
'It's important to talk straight': how Labor turned to Anthony Albanese in its hour of need Read more
Now that O’Neil and Jim Chalmers have ruled themselves out it is likely Marles will have an uncontested run for deputy when the Labor caucus meets in Canberra on Thursday, barring a surprise nomination.
O’Neil said that Marles has the right skills, qualities and experience for the role and will be a “brilliant” deputy.
O’Neil said she had put herself forward because it was “core to [her] being as a feminist” that a woman should be in contention for a leadership role.
She said she had been given a “fair hearing” and nobody suggested as a 38-year-old woman she should not aspire to the job, but had bowed out after respectful and honest conversations with her colleagues about the need for the new deputy to bring the party together.
O’Neil defended the fact Labor will have a male leader and deputy, citing the fact Penny Wong will continue as leader in the Senate and Labor “will have senior women across the shadow cabinet and in leadership roles”.
Senator Kristina Keneally is expected to nominate for deputy Labor leader in the Senate, a role currently held by the South Australian Don Farrell.
“Labor is the party of Australian women … The stars have not aligned on this occasion to put a woman in one of those two positions.”
O’Neil said that 46% of Labor’s caucus are women – almost reaching its 50% target – compared with 22% on the Coalition side, which she branded “unacceptable”.
She said the Labor party had “fallen short” and will need to think about preselecting women in safe seats to give them the “longevity” in the parliament that will support a run for leader or deputy in future.
The opposition will also need to “redesign a policy platform that will be more targeted at the people that we need to vote Labor”, she said.

“We brought the wrong platform to the election and we need to reconsider every aspect of it and have a good look at why we got this one so badly wrong.
“When we are thinking about what went wrong, we took a big unwieldy, risky policy agenda to the election and it was hard to explain and it was hard to defend and very easy to weaponise.”
O’Neil said the electorate was “highly disillusioned” and marginal seat MPs had reported that voters had simply not believed Labor would deliver big ticket policies.
Labor proposed a swathe of new social spending including a $2.3bn cancer package and $2.4bn for seniors’ dental care funded by opposing tax cuts to middle and high income earners while reducing tax concessions for property investors.
O’Neil said Labor faces a higher bar to be elected to government, because it stands for “changing society and redistributing power and that offends some people” who then oppose Labor.
O’Neil said the party had to get “back to basics, showing we can do tangible things and we will be given permission by the Australian people to do some of the bigger and bolder things that we dream of”.
