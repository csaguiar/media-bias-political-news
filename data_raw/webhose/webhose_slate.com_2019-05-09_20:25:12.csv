Phoebe Waller-Bridge is helping Daniel Craig fix a James Bond script.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/phoebe-waller-bridge-james-bond-daniel-craig.html,"This Week’s Worst Person in Westeros: Jon Snow James Bond is getting the Fleabag treatment. The Guardian reports that Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the droll BBC hit’s creator, writer, and star, will bring her darkly funny eye to the world of James Bond on the script for the franchise’s anticipated upcoming film, which has the working title Bond 25. Intriguingly, the request for Waller-Bridge came straight from the top: from none other than 007 himself, Daniel Craig. According to the Guardian, Craig was dissatisfied with Bond 25’ s script, which was originally developed by John Hodge and then reworked several times over by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Scott Z. Burns. But when Craig still felt that the screenplay could use some “polishing,” he turned to Waller-Bridge, whose work he had admired on both Fleabag and the buzzy BBC series Killing Eve , which she created. The pair have reportedly already discussed potential revisions to the Bond script that would help inject some of the TV scribe’s trademark idiosyncratic humor. Waller-Bridge has been a rising star since the debut of Fleabag . But as of late, she’s become a fixture in the land of auteur TV with Killing Eve , which stars Sandra Oh as a bored spy opposite the fantastic Jodie Comer , who plays an assassin. The series, which has already earned somewhat of a cult following, returned to BBC America for its second season last weekend, while the long-awaited Season 2 of Fleabag is set to debut on Amazon Prime in May.

What Trump should have passed instead of the tax bill everyone hates.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/tax-day-trump-bill-everyone-hates.html,"My Sexually Generous Boyfriend Totally Avoids Me During My Period. Is This a Deal Breaker? Everybody hates Donald Trump’s tax law. OK. Not everyone. I’m exaggerating. But as of Monday, the first tax day on which Americans are filing their personal returns under the regime set up by the Tax Cuts and Jobs act of 2017, the bill is decidedly unpopular—less beloved, even, than the perpetually underwater president who signed it. According to Gallup, 40 percent of all Americans (and just 32 percent of political independents) approve of the thing. Pew, similarly, finds just 36 percent give the law a thumbs up. A big part of the problem, it seems, is that most people do not believe that Republicans actually cut their taxes, and in many cases are under the impression that they were on the receiving end of a tax hike. According to a survey by the New York Times and SurveyMonkey, only 40 percent of adults believe their taxes dropped under the new law. The number has been even lower in other polls. Gallup reports that only 14 percent of Americans think that their federal income taxes went down due to the statute, while 21 percent believe they rose, with 64 percent who were unsure or thought they’d stayed the same. CBS got a similar result : 25 percent believed their taxes were lower, 32 percent believed they were higher, and the rest thought there’d been no change. Most Americans are almost certainly mistaken about this. The Tax Policy Center has estimated that about 65 percent of taxpayers should have seen their liability drop this year, and just 6.3 percent should have seen a hike. The gap between reality and perception is so large that the New York Times felt compelled to run an article on Monday titled,” Face It: You (Probably) Got a Tax Cut .” Politically, this is an astonishingly bad outcome. According to the most recent forecasts, the GOP’s tax cut will ultimately cost $1.9 trillion over a decade. As I’ve written before, for about that much money, they could have sent a $1,000 check to every worker in America (and adjusted it for inflation) for the next ten years. Heck, they could have included an auto-signed picture of the president to go along with it; instead of a bunch of stories about how nobody realizes they got a tax cut, the headlines would be all about how Americans were spending their Trump Bux. Why is the public so ill-informed about the effects of the GOP’s tax bill? Conservatives would probably blame the media. But Republicans made a series of fateful choices that helped doom their legislation in the public eye. For starters, many initial versions of the GOP’s legislation did raise taxes on a surprisingly large share of middle and upper-middle-class Americans, which journalists naturally covered, and Democrats turned into a sticky narrative that the legislation was a broad, middle-class tax hike. 1 The bill’s benefits were also tilted toward high earners and corporations, which contributed to the impression that there was little for your typical family in the law. It also curtailed some especially popular bits of the tax code, such as the deductions for state and local taxes and mortgage interest, which caused an uproar in places like the Northeast where many voters have long relied on them. Later iterations of the bill created fewer losers. But Republicans were never able to shake away the impression that they had crafted legislation that hiked taxes on a bunch of homeowners in New Jersey and California in order to shave down Walmart’s IRS tab. But the bigger issue was seemingly much simpler than all that: For most Americans, the tax cut was just kind of small and easy to miss. The Tax Policy Center estimates that , among the middle 20 percent of households, the average tax cut amounted to just $1,050 on average. Strung out across a whole year, it amounts to just $40 per bi-weekly paycheck. That amount is not especially noticeable, especially since Americans often see their incomes change year-to-year (they get raises, their hours change, etc.). The administration probably made this problem a bit worse for themselves by tweaking the IRS withholding rules to maximize how much of the tax cut showed up in workers’ take-home pay, rather than giving families a bigger refund at the end of the year, where they may have actually picked up on it. (According to the IRS, the number and average value of tax refunds are both basically flat compared to last year). The fact that their tax cut has turned out to be widely despised does not mean it was a total political loss for Republicans. It handed large tax cuts to corporations and high-earners who will happily continue donating to the party’s coffers; the GOP scratched capital’s back, and capital will likely scratch theirs back. But there are lessons to be learned here. If you’re going to cut people’s taxes, don’t write a bunch of draft bills that make it look like you’re raising them instead. And once you do pass the legislation, make sure people realize they actually got a cut. In other words, give them Trump Bux.
1 Take the early Senate bill: Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that , by 2023, about 13 percent of all Americans, 20 percent of those earning $75,000 to $100,000, and 27 percent of those making $100,000 to $200,000, would have seen a hike under the legislation.

Why Nancy Pelosi Is So Comfortable Dismissing the Influence of AOC and Her Fellow Lefties,slate.com,Jim Newell,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/nancy-pelosi-aoc-lefties-congress.html,"The Supreme Court Divides Into Prudes and Cool Kids as the Justices Debate Naughty Trademarks During a 60 Minutes profile that aired Sunday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked a question that she doesn’t seem to love: Can she keep a caucus that has both more centrist members and more socialists from falling apart? “By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with,” Pelosi told interviewer Lesley Stahl, “they know that we have to hold the center, that we have to go down the mainstream.” When Stahl began another question about managing the “wings” of the party, including “[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and her group,” Pelosi interrupted her. “That’s like five people,” Pelosi said. It was the latest in a series of flip comments Pelosi and the Democratic majority leader, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, have made in recent months minimizing the influence that progressives like Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar have in the caucus. In February, Pelosi referred to the Green New Deal, a still-nascent resolution that excited Republican political operatives almost as much as it excited progressives, as “the green dream or whatever … nobody knows what it is but they’re for it, right?” She also has repeatedly taken impeachment off the table. Meanwhile, in a March speech at the AIPAC conference, shortly after much of the caucus had reprimanded Omar for comments that some perceived as anti-Semitic, Hoyer said to an appreciative audience that “by the way, there are 62 freshman Democrats. You hear me? 62. Not three.” The following day, his office issued a statement clearing up the remarks, which were interpreted as a slight to progressive members who’ve energized parts of the electorate. It’s not that complicated to understand why Pelosi isn’t obeying the will of the far left of her caucus. “Our Caucus has a dynamic freshman class of sixty-three new Members, all of whom are doing a great job and bringing unique perspectives and backgrounds to their work in the House,” the statement read. “In pointing out that much of the press attention has been on a few new Members in particular, I was lamenting that the media does not appear to be paying enough attention to other excellent new Members who are also bringing important new energy and diverse perspectives to our Caucus and to the Congress.” Taking questions at a Monday event in London, where she’s traveling during the current congressional retreat, Pelosi expanded further on her own view of the lefties who’ve been dominating news coverage but not necessarily the House floor agenda. While describing representatives like Ocasio-Cortez as “wonderful” members of the Democratic caucus, she said that districts like Ocasio Cortez’s—or Pelosi’s San Francisco district—could elect the glass of water from which she was drinking if there were a “D” next to it on the ballot line. Those members, and their more radical plans, are not majority makers. “But the 43 districts [we flipped from Republican officeholders] were right down the middle: mainstream, hold-the-center victories,” she said. “And if we’re going to be helping the 1 in 5 children in America who goes to sleep hungry at night, who lives in poverty in our country, we have to win .” It’s not that complicated to understand why Pelosi isn’t obeying the will of the far left of her caucus, and why she’s pursuing, say, a health care agenda more in line with tweaking Obamacare’s existing structure rather than something more disruptive like single-payer. Running a center-left agenda to protect “front-line” incumbents with big targets on their backs in 2020 is a path that just about any Democratic speaker would follow, especially in a divided government. The more interesting question is why, and for how much longer, the left wing of her caucus will allow her to pursue this course. Republican House leaders didn’t always feel it was electorally useful to pursue, say, a hard-line immigration strategy, but the right-wing bloc of the caucus used its leverage, often, to ensure they did. And the Republican “establishment” equivalent of any one of these comments— it’s just a few of them ; the green dream or whatever —would have sparked an incredible backlash from the GOP’s base and those backbenchers. Pelosi must not be feeling such a backlash, because she keeps casually tossing backhanded remarks the left’s way. For top Democrats, what passes for restraint is when aides use anonymity to crudely trash-talk the left wing of the caucus: “What we’re here to do is get something done, not introduce legislative proposals that are Bernie Sanders’ wet dreams,” one senior Democratic aide told Politico last week. Pelosi might only really consider changing her posture toward the emboldened left flank of the party if the left flank of the party emboldens. Progressives thought they might have had a victory last week when their opposition over spending cuts helped scuttle a House Democratic budget vote, but Pelosi and Hoyer found a procedural workaround that allowed them to proceed writing spending bills anyway. A couple of days later, at the House Democratic retreat, Progressive Caucus co-chairs Pramila Jayapal and Mark Pocan insisted that the spending negotiations were still in their early phase, and that there were still plenty of leverage points ahead in the budget process where they might gum up the works if they don’t get a boost in domestic spending. But does that mean they’re prepared to vote down a budget agreement on the floor? To vote down an appropriations bill? Until there’s a move like that, which would embarrass House Democratic leaders and likely earn the leftmost members of the party the enmity of their colleagues, we’ll continue seeing Pelosi giving them the dismissive flicks of the wrist as she works to “hold the center” ahead of 2020. And maybe that is, as Pelosi told Lesley Stahl, “fine” with them. Maybe those two or three green-dreamers, or whatever, understand that the central goal of the next two years is to unite the government: to defeat Trump, take the Senate, and then wage these ideological battles when their legislation has a chance of becoming law. Pelosi let on, in her London remarks, to this strategy of patience ahead of 2020, after which the full “exuberances” of the caucus could be properly channeled. “We must win,” she said. “When we win, and we have the White House and we have that, then we can expand our exuberances to some other things.” Support our journalism

Donald Trump's Ilhan Omar tweet might be the worst tweet in history.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/donald-trump-ilhan-omar-tweet-its-bad-folks.html,"On Friday, Donald Trump posted the following on Twitter: WE WILL NEVER FORGET! pic.twitter.com/VxrGFRFeJM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019 The video splices together footage from Sept. 11, 2001, and a clip of a March speech Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar gave to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)—a clip edited to suggest that Omar had flippantly described 9/11 as “something” perpetrated by “some people” rather than as an attack on the United States perpetrated by terrorists. Trump’s tweet about Omar might be the worst tweet ever. Let’s review everything that’s wrong with it. 1. It’s dishonest. It takes almost no research to understand that Omar’s wording, in the context of a speech that was actually about upholding American ideals , was meant only to distinguish the small group of (non-American) Muslim extremists who perpetrated the attack from the much larger group of (American) Muslims whom she believes were subjected to unwarranted scrutiny and harassment in its wake. What Omar said, emphases mine, was that “[CAIR] recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” 2. It’s racist. Trump has a history of blaming every Muslim in America for the actions of any individual Muslim. His tweet fits in this tradition by suggesting that Omar is on Team Terror and that the rest of “us” aren’t going to forget it. It’s a method of assigning group responsibility that he’s never applied to white Americans after the many acts of mass violence carried out in the U.S. by white people. Racist! 3. It arguably incites violence. A week before Trump’s tweet, a Trump supporter in New York was arrested for threatening to murder Omar , who is one of the first female Muslim American members of Congress. A number of prominent Democrats have suggested that Trump’s propagandistic, revenge-themed video constitutes an incitement to target Omar; at best, the video and tweet are reckless and cavalier about her safety. 4. It’s hypocritical, opportunistic, etc. On 9/11, Trump crassly (and incorrectly ) claimed in a radio interview that now that the World Trade Center towers were no longer standing, he owned the tallest building in lower Manhattan. He would later claim ( incorrectly ) that the state of New York sent him money to reimburse him for Ground Zero cleanup/recovery work that he claims (with no supporting evidence) his company helped with. His administration is now attempting to give secret nuclear power technology to Saudi Arabia, the country whose government—per a congressional investigation —may have helped provide “support and assistance” to a number of 9/11 hijackers. In sum, respecting 9/11 victims and holding their perpetrators accountable only seems to be important to Trump when it can be exploited to bully someone he doesn’t like. Not cool! 5. It’s in all caps. All caps makes everything 50 percent dumber. It’s a crowded field , but I think you could make an argument that, given the reach of Trump’s account and the stakes involved—him being, you know, president—the Omar tweet was objectively the worst one ever sent. Or at least you could have made that case until Monday afternoon, when Trump used Twitter to send firefighting tips to the nation of France. So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019 It turns out that this suggestion could have caused the total collapse of the entire structure . Truly, we may not live in the worst moment in history, but we certainly live in the one that most resembles being trapped inside a TV that an angry, racist crank is shouting at 24 hours a day."

"Game of Thrones: How bad is it to marry your aunt, as Jon Snow might do?",slate.com,Shannon Palus,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/jon-snow-daenerys-targaryen-game-of-thrones-aunt-nephew-marriage-genetic-risks.html,"The Problem With San Francisco’s Proposal to Ban Vaping Game of Thrones ’ audience has known that in indulging in a relationship with Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow was inadvertently sleeping with his aunt. In Sunday’s premiere, Jon himself learned of his true parentage, which presumably means that, somewhere off screen clad in furs and looking contemplative, he too connected the dots about his new fling. We all know that in the world of Westeros, twin siblings have procreated without genetic repercussions, but how bad, exactly, is a nephew-aunt relationship? Scientifically speaking, two people with overlapping genetic material increases the likelihood that their offspring will inherit two faulty copies of a gene and therefore experience a disorder, geneticist Tiong Tan writes in the Conversation: “For many genes, our body can cope with just a single working copy, but when both copies are faulty, the person gets an autosomal recessive disease,” like sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis. Even still, cousin-cousin couplings are common in many societies and have been throughout history—Einstein and Darwin both did it. And while the risk of genetic issues roughly doubles , the absolute risk is still very low (somewhere between 4 and 7 percent), meaning that the vast majority of babies from such unions will still be healthy. After evaluating the risk, Popular Science declared , “Go ahead, marry your cousin.” Incest laws don’t exist just to keep the likelihood of genetic disease down—they exist because of the deep power imbalances that can exist between older and younger family members. If cousin marriage is technically OK, how much does the risk increase with a closer genetic link? As Tan explains, while a pair of first cousins share just an eighth of their genes, parents and kids share half their genes, and an aunt and a nephew share a quarter. A 1971 study estimated that it’s four times as genetically risky for parents and kids to have offspring vs. first cousins, as the coefficient of inbreeding—a measure of genetic closeness —for the kid is one-fourth versus one-sixteenth. Extrapolating from there, an aunt-nephew baby would have an inbreeding coefficient of one-eighth, meaning reproduction would carry double the genetic risk compared with a cousin-cousin baby. Not great. (Another lesson: don’t google “aunt incest” at work. That yields porn.) In modern society, what’s more problematic than the risk of disease (present in many pairings that don’t involve folks who are related) and even the substantial taboo (we’ve come around on a number of sexual acts and couplings that were once taboo) are the interpersonal realities. In 2014, a New York court ruled that an uncle-niece marriage was allowed (New York is one of 20 states to also allow cousin-cousin marriage), partially on the grounds that the uncle in question was only half-siblings with the bride’s mother. But as one judge pointed out, incest laws don’t exist just to keep the likelihood of genetic disease down—they exist because of the deep power imbalances that can exist between older and younger family members. Even with cousins who are closer in age, the logistics are tricky. As Slate’s Dear Prudence, Daniel Ortberg, counseled one man who wanted to sleep with his first cousin, what happens if things don’t work out and then you have to keep running into each other at family gatherings? The previous Prudie ruled in the opposite direction in a separate case—when Emily Yoffe got the cousin question , there was an additional twist in that the two partners were unaware of their genetic links. Yoffe counseled the letter writer—who secretly fathered one of the kids via an affair—to stay quiet and let the couple be. Jon and Dany find themselves in different circumstances, of course. The Targaryens aren’t exactly getting together for holidays. Dany can’t bear (human) children. Still, the familial connection might still cause trouble if Snow’s parentage is more widely learned—it’s clear that at least some forms of incest are taboo in Westeros.

First GOP candidate announces primary challenge to President Trump.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/first-gop-candidate-announces-primary-challenge-to-president-trump.html,"""Jake, I'm announcing that I'm running for President... as a Republican against the President in 2020.""Former Gov. Bill Weld officially announces he is challenging President Trump for the GOP nomination. https://t.co/Q5z30Qjw8o pic.twitter.com/QBSwtdxPUx — The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) April 15, 2019 Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld announced he will run for the Republican nomination for president, marking the first GOP challenge to President Donald Trump’s reelection bid. Weld made his announcement on CNN Monday afternoon saying, “I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we’ve had out of the White House the last two years that would be a political tragedy and I would fear for the Republic, so I would be ashamed of myself if I didn’t raise my hand and run.” “Ours is a nation built on courage, resilience, and independence. In these times of great political strife, when both major parties are entrenched in their ‘win at all cost’ battles, the voices of the American people are being ignored and our nation is suffering,” Weld said in a statement on his run for president. “It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag. It is time to return to the principles of Lincoln—equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. There is no greater cause on earth than to preserve what truly makes America great. I am ready to lead that fight.” The former two-term Massachusetts governor is from a wing of the Republican Party that has been set adrift by the new Trumpy GOP, making his path to the nomination a remote one. Fiscal conservatism, some semblance of ethics, and a penchant for bipartisanism will certainly alienate the 73-year-old Weld from much of the new GOP, but it will provide a welcome relief from the Trump onslaught in 2020. Depending on who, if anyone, else gets in the race, Weld will likely command some substantial support from the portion of the party that hasn’t decamped and remains appalled by their party’s monstrosity of a figurehead. There are a handful of Republicans rumored to be mulling a similar primary challenge to Trump, like Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and former Ohio Gov.John Kasich, but both of those candidates have significantly more to lose than Weld if they choose to run. Weld has largely been on the periphery of his party and hasn’t held office in nearly two decades, such that he doesn’t have much of a career to ruin at this point. He can fight the good fight and bow out gracefully. Hogan and certainly Kasich harbor aspirations for higher office, which taking on the leader of the party—and losing—would surely decimate, barring another sudden shift in the GOP party dynamics away from rampant nativism and marauding jingoism. Weld is no stranger to Trump’s rearview mirror, as he ran as the vice presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party in 2016 alongside former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson."

"ICE Reportedly Deported Spouse of Army Solider Killed in Afghanistan, Leaving Their Daughter Parentless",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/ice-reportedly-deported-spouse-of-army-solider-killed-in-afghanistan-leaving-their-daughter-parentless.html,"Why Nancy Pelosi Is So Comfortable Dismissing the Influence of AOC and Her Fellow Lefties The spouse of an American soldier killed in action in Afghanistan was arrested by ICE on the way to his job and deported last week despite being the father of a 12-year-old daughter who is an American citizen, the Arizona Republic reported Monday. The story is as horrific as it is familiar under the Trump administration, and the reported details are a reminder of the arbitrary and callous administration of the country’s immigration laws. Jose Gonzalez Carranza, now 30, came to the U.S. illegally as a teenager. He later married Army Pfc. Barbara Vieyra and had a daughter Evelyn . Vieyra was 22 years old when she was killed in 2010 while serving in the Army in Afghanistan. After her death, Gonzalez was granted what’s called parole in place, allowing him to stay in the country. Given his protected status, and lack of a criminal record, a judge later ended deportation proceedings against Gonzalez. In 2018, however, the Trump administration reopened the case and ordered a court hearing. But Gonzalez didn’t show for the court date because, he says, he never got the notice that ICE sent to the wrong address. The missed court appearance prompted a judge, in December, to order Gonzalez to be deported, but again he didn’t receive news of the order to dispute or correct it until ICE showed up at his door last Monday. By then it was too late and two days later Gonzalez was deported to Nogales, Mexico and living in a shelter for deported migrants. “I feel so bad,” Gonzalez said of being taken away from his daughter. “I’m thinking about, I might never see her again.” Making matters worse, his lawyer said Gonzalez filed a motion to reopen the deportation case after his arrest, which should have meant an automatic stay to his deportation proceeding. But ICE deported him anyway. “After speaking to The Arizona Republic , [the lawyer] said he received a call from an ICE officer who told him the agency was making arrangements to allow Gonzalez back into the U.S.,” the paper reported."
A Piece of Paris Goes Up in Flames,slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/a-piece-of-paris-goes-up-in-flames.html,"Notre Dame Cathedral Is on Fire: The Spire Has Collapsed, but the Towers Will Survive I was there the day Notre Dame burned. Well, not therein Paris, but immersed in the live-stream at my computer, where video after video after video whisked me around to see the burning cathedral from every angle, all afternoon. Each one arrived with an outdated timestamp, a reminder that the destruction was just a little more advanced than what I could see. I had to keep reminding myself I was looking into the past, like an astronomer watching a star explode. At about 10 p.m. Paris time, as Parisians sang Ave Maria in the firelight , Junior Interior Minister Laurent Nunez announced that the stone structure could be saved—the facade, the bell towers, the flying buttresses. Miraculously, the interior was nearly intact, including much of the rib-vaulted ceiling. But the roof and spire were lost. The fate of the windows and the organ is unknown. In The Hunchback of Notre Dame , Victor Hugo observed that the pace of change in Paris threatened the city’s character. “Monuments are becoming rarer and rarer, and one seems to see them gradually engulfed, by the flood of houses,” he wrote. “Our fathers had a Paris of stone; our sons will have one of plaster.” That call for preservation is a big theme of the book , whose success helped prompt a mid–19 th century restoration of the cathedral. The sentiment seems ridiculous today: Our Paris is a city that changes more slowly than the people who love it. Some people find that stasis smothering; I’ve always found it pleasantly humbling. Paris was there before I arrived, and it will be there after I’m gone. The fire marked a rupture and a reminder that the present can rise up to overpower the past. Construction on Notre Dame de Paris began in the middle of the 12 th century and went on for approximately a hundred years before it opened. But like most 850-year-old buildings, it’s a pastiche. During the French Revolution, the building was converted into a “Temple of Reason” and then a warehouse for wine storage. Its treasures were pillaged and its statues destroyed. “This central mother church is, among the ancient churches of Paris, a sort of chimera,” wrote Hugo in his famous novel. “It has the head of one, the limbs of another, the haunches of another, something of all.” Architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc brought new statues, gargoyles, and the famous spire to the cathedral in his restoration in the 1850s, remaking the historic edifice with his own vision. The cathedral didn’t stop there. Much of the stained glass dated from the 1960s. The bells were brand new. A new reconstruction campaign had recently gotten underway. Hugo deplored the dilapidation of the structure but stood in awe of the palimpsest. There is “…often the universal history of humanity in the successive engrafting of many arts at many levels, upon the same monument,” he went on. “The man, the artist, the individual, is effaced in these great masses, which lack the name of their author; human intelligence is there summed up and totalized. Time is the architect, the nation is the builder.” In one way, then, the rebuilding that is surely to come is just one link in the long chain of additions and subtractions that preceded it. A big, big link that will take a long time to fill in. Late into the night in Paris, the lattice of scaffolding—part of ongoing work on the structure, and, perhaps, the source of the fire—stood high over the ruined church."

This month, the dance world is celebrating what would’ve been Merce Cunningham ’s 100 th birthday. For over a half-century, the American dancer and choreographer embraced innovation and expanded the frontiers of contemporary art, performing arts, visual arts, and music. Merce Cunningham dancers are famous for seeming to defy the laws of physics and gravity, leaping high into the air and then suddenly switching direction. “I always feel that my legs are like needles of a sewing machine when I’m doing Cunningham. They have to be very sharp and very articulate, and I feel that the torso has to be free on top of that,” says Daniel Roberts , who was a member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. “There’s a strain that comes along with doing the work and the technique and there’s a clarity about the work in general, the use of space, and the articulation of the torso and the limbs that I’ve never experienced before in any other dance form.” Cunningham’s legacy goes beyond dance and was seeded in his frequent collaborations with artists in other disciplines, such as musicians John Cage, Brian Eno, and Radiohead; artists Bruce Nauman, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein; and costume designer Rei Kawakubo, among others. These stories were produced by Trey Kay and Kerrie Hillman. (Originally aired June 9, 2001, and April 27, 2002.) Studio 360 plugs:"
"The boring, Arial-dominated internet of the big platforms.",slate.com,Jane C. Hu,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/internet-fonts-custom-colors-myspace-arial-facebook.html,"“Because Science” Won’t Persuade Anyone to Vaccinate Their Kids In the days of dial-up internet, I identified my online friends in two ways: by their screen names, and by their font. I frequented X-Files chatrooms with regulars whose fonts I still remember more than 20 years later, though I remember little else about them: Jeff from Colorado used a bolded Lucida Sans in army green, and Emily from Fort Myers, Florida, used a hot pink Verdana, which, at the time, I thought was understated and very sophisticated. (We later became pen pals, and she also wrote me letters in that font.) My font of choice during that period was decidedly less sophisticated. I typed in a cerulean blue Comic Sans with a neon green highlight. If I’m being honest with myself, my taste never really improved, and for better or worse, I was able to plaster whatever I wanted all over my digital spaces. My old AOL website is a mess of colors and Mark Wahlberg photos, and I spent hours tinkering with HTML so that my LiveJournal displayed custom text announcing my comment counts and music selection. It boasted a Hot Topic–esque black-and-white checker theme with hot pink accents. Years later, on Tumblr, I still couldn’t resist the urge to make things my own. I frequently toggled between themes based on the aesthetic I wanted to convey that month. After an era where customizability was the norm, we’ve now reached a period where everything we read online looks the same. Blogging is dead, and the current dominant social media platforms have settled on a unified look: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages largely look the same. While Slack offers themes to change its default colors, and there are third-party apps to modify WhatsApp, there’s little you can do to change the look of messages you send. So, too, do the baby pictures, links, crowdfunding campaigns, and rants blend together as you scroll. I frequently mistake NIMBY posts in my neighborhood group for parody posts from a pro–public transportation meme group , or an ad for a friend’s vacation photo. Perhaps that’s the point: It’s a marketer’s dream for their ads to blend in with everything else—that’s why native advertising came into being. Is this post talking up a meal delivery service from a friend, or is it just the same ad for the 40 th time? My brain doesn’t really differentiate between those things while just scrolling through. It just absorbs the fact that I’ve seen it. To break up that sameness, we could return to the era of custom fonts or colors. Just as marketers embrace fonts to promote brands, perhaps individual users, too, might embrace the opportunity to select a font online that conveys their personality, or even just the tone of what they’re posting. In a 2012 study , researchers polled 102 people on which emotional descriptions—rested, stimulated, concerned, agitated, amused, etc.—they associated with each of 36 fonts. Arial was ranked highly for being organized and focused. It also happens to be the most used font on the internet: the default on Google, Facebook, Amazon, China’s QQ, and Twitter. It’s unclear whether its “organized, focused” appearance drove its popularity or whether its popularity shaped our perception of it, but either way, it conveys officialness, which seems to have become the default mode of so many of our posts now. The authors of the font analysis also discuss our love/hate relationship with one particular font. “No discussion of typeface emotion would be complete without some mention of Comic Sans,” they write. “The typeface sends viewers in all major emotional directions at once: we’re both agitated and amused, but calmly concerned about it. This is a distasteful feeling for many but other enjoy it, much as some hate riding a roller coaster and enjoy it.” Its fellow black sheep, Papyrus, evokes similarly divergent emotions but on a smaller scale. With so few ways to convey tone online, font choice could provide context. There’s no sarcasm font, but posting in Comic Sans or Papyrus could fill that niche. Similarly, being able to control font size or color could add nuance. Officialness has become the default mode of so many of our posts now. A pair of Japanese researchers apparently had this same pet theory and published a paper last year to test it. They designed a texting app with custom fonts and observed conversations between users. They found that typeface did indeed give context to the emotions of the texters. Whereas Arial, their neutral font, “evoked formal and business-like feelings” and conveyed positive emotion, use of “dramatic” fonts felt more intimate. An incongruence in font type and message—say, a font that looks befitting of a metal band saying “I am happy these days!”—is taken as sarcastic and humorous, leading the authors to conclude that font “will expand channels of nonverbal signals.” Granted, the participants in this study, all between the ages of 24 and 34, might be more online than the average person given their age and more accustomed to chatting online. Surely, not all users would interpret fonts in the same way as these folks, but the study shows how fonts could allow for additional nuance in our text conversations. Whether people would actually use custom fonts is another question. For users, fonts’ sameness has become the status quo, and people who deviate from the norms of posting are weirdos. MySpace is still the butt of jokes, after all, and I admittedly still feel a bit suspicious when someone emails me using a colorful or serifed font. Even when Facebook introduced the option to add background colors or patterns to text posts, people— tech media , in particular—were quick to declare them ugly . Still, people are finding little ways to bend the constraints of social media platforms. On Twitter, folks tweak their display names to appear upside down or in different fonts , or use ASCII art to stand out from the usual format. ( Every Sheriff is a wonderful and silly example of this.) And of course, there’s Snapchat and Instagram stories, which are an oasis of creativity. There, people seem more playful, a little freer to lean into their own styles, thanks to the ability to choose between texts, colors, GIFs, emoji, and filters allow for novel creations. There’s the sex educator who takes nude selfies but covers them up with stickers, the designer who layers text in two colors to give certain words a pop-out 3D effect, the tech employee that posts one phrase at a time so you’re tapping to read the next message. These posts take no more time than one on any other social media site, but they instantly convey a thousand times more personality. According to a 2017 Mashable post , part of why Facebook added custom backgrounds to text posts was a bid for more personality. It wanted to make the platform more fun as it competed with Snapchat for users. In the end, it seems that emulating the creativity of Snapchat was the best way to compete: TechCrunch reported that as of January, the function had 500 million daily users. If its success is any indication, users could be receptive to ways to break up the sameness on big platforms. I’m not saying our Facebook pages and Twitter profiles need to autoplay custom songs and display our Top 8 friends, but a little freedom to make our pages our own could go a long way."

Dallas assault of transgender woman investigated as a hate crime.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/dallas-assault-transgender-woman-hate-crime.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant The story of a transgender woman in Texas who was allegedly attacked Friday by a “mob” shouting homophobic slurs over a minor traffic accident took another turn when the man arrested for attacking her claimed he was paid $200 to commit the assault, according to Dallas police. In a video that circulated over the weekend, the victim, 23-year-old Muhlaysia Booker, is hit repeatedly by a man as a large crowd gathers near an apartment complex. After what appear to be multiple blows to her face, she falls to the ground. As people in the crowd scream for them to stop, a few other men begin kicking her and stomping on her. After Booker stumbles away, a group of women lift her up and, according to police, carry her to a car to take her to the hospital. She sustained injuries to her face, as well as a fractured wrist and a concussion. The man who punched her, later identified as 29-year-old Edward Dominic Thomas, was arrested Sunday night on aggravated assault charges. Thomas admitted to the assault, police said. Police said on Monday they have also identified a suspect who stomped on Booker’s face, but they had not yet arrested him, according to the Dallas Morning News . Police say that just before the attack, Booker had accidentally backed into another car. The driver of that car told police he ran Booker off the road to prevent her from leaving the scene. Booker told police that that man had pointed a gun at her and warned her not to leave without paying for the damage to his car. At that point, police say, Thomas says he was offered $200 by someone in the crowd to beat Booker. At the hospital, Booker told police that some of her assailants had used homophobic slurs during the attack. Dallas police said on Monday they are investigating whether the assault met the criteria of a hate crime and that they have contacted the FBI. In the meantime, police are looking at recordings from the scene to try to determine who else participated in the assault and who, if anyone, offered Thomas $200. They said they expect to make more arrests soon. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings on Saturday morning condemned the attack as an act of hate . “I am extremely angry about what appears to be mob violence against this woman,” he said in a statement. “Those who did this do not represent how Dallasites feel about our thriving LGBTQ community. We will not stand for this kind of behavior.”"

How Katie Bouman Shook Wikipedia,slate.com,Stephen Harrison,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/katie-bouman-wikipedia-page-deletion-black-hole.html,"India Is Leading the World in Internet Shutdowns Welcome to Source Notes , a Future Tense column about the internet’s knowledge ecosystem. Katie Bouman is a 29-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose Wikipedia article was created last Wednesday, when astronomers released the first-ever direct image of a black hole to the world. Bouman was an influential member of the Event Horizon Telescope team that captured this extraordinary photographic evidence. She was widely covered by the press after MIT tweeted a photo of her excitement upon seeing the image for the first time on her laptop. The timing of Bouman’s Wikipedia page makes sense: Pages are often created after a figure bursts into the news. What is unusual, though, is how much Bouman’s entry has been modified in this short period—more than 100 times per day by nearly 160 contributors. The frantic level of editing reflects the rapid mobilization by members of the online encyclopedia community to rescue Bouman’s page from deletion. The debate also shows how a minority of internet encyclopedists are more concerned with disputing individual merit than creating a reference source that serves the public interest. British physicist Jess Wade created Bouman’s Wikipedia page on April 10, coinciding with the black hole photo announcement. Two days later, the page was nominated for deletion . The few editors who argued adamantly that Bouman’s page should be deleted mostly said she lacked sufficient notability as an academic to have her own article. On the other side were those who said Bouman was clearly notable because of the vast amount of press coverage following the black hole announcement. Biologist Maryam Zaringhalam summarized the pro-article position well by tweeting , “Katie Bouman’s—one of the scientists behind the image of the black hole—Wikipedia article has been flagged as ‘not notable.’ If she’s not notable, then who TF is?!” After discussion and voting , the arguments for retaining Bouman’s Wikipedia page carried the day. The whole crisis was resolved within about 80 minutes, what Wikipedians refer to as a “ speedy keep .” This happened against the backdrop of a larger discussion about Bouman. After MIT tweeted the famous photo of her looking delighted, the university posted further tweets clarifying that she was part of a global collaboration of more than 200 scientists who made the discovery possible. Bouman likewise posted on Facebook that “no one algorithm or person made this image” and included a photo of the larger team. It was a similar argument to the one she made in her 2016 TED Talk : Big scientific discoveries are the work of big teams , not lone geniuses. By this point, though, the internet trolls had descended. The Verge’s Mary Beth Griggs recounts the online harassment in grim detail. Trolls set up fake Twitter accounts and fake Instagram accounts in Bouman’s name and had the fake Bouman claim that her colleague Andrew Chael wrote 850,000 of the 900,000 lines of code that were written into the algorithm that found the black hole. That’s when Chael himself chimed in , tweeting, “While I wrote much of the code for one of these pipelines, Katie was a huge contributor to the software; it would have never worked without her contributions.” Chael added that he hoped the “awful and sexist attacks” on Bouman would stop. Back on Wikipedia, a few in the pro-delete tweet camp were nasty and sexist. One editor pointed out that “as a young good looking woman she was much more attractive to the media” than the low-resolution photo of the black hole, and that the MIT scientist should only be covered as a “media phenomenon” since “sex sells.” On Twitter, another user falsely claimed that the only thing Bouman contributed was “changing fonts” in the code, suggesting that this was secretarial work that a high school student could handle. But there’s another type of pro-delete comment that’s worth examining and debunking. During the discussion, one editor arguing to delete Bouman’s page said this : “I am in fact a scientist with more publications & citations than Katie (though she is younger, so it’s not a fair comparison). … Was her work that important?” This comment is, in fact, highly revealing about how this editor views their role on Wikipedia. Rather than grounding notability in the scientific community, the press, or popular culture, this individual editor is holding to their own standards of comparative merit. But this type of personal vendetta and probable jealousy does not advance Wikipedia’s goal to be the sum of all human knowledge , which has certainly been advanced for the more than 350,000 people who have now visited and learned from Bouman’s page. I’m not the first to observe that the deletion debates on Wikipedia and other internet knowledge platforms frequently seem unproductive. Perhaps instead of fighting to remove someone’s encyclopedia entry, people should instead do something useful like, I don’t know, help photograph a black hole. Or, since that’s been done, maybe make a movie of one . Either way, it is no doubt better to search for dark despair vortexes elsewhere in the universe than to create them with our behavior online."

Trump 2020 campaign: Why the past few weeks have been a perfect preview of the next two years.,slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-2020-reelection-campaign-preview-messaging.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant President Donald Trump suggested Monday that he will follow through on his threat to send migrants detained at the southern border to so-called sanctuary cities, a move he sees as a way to punish Democrats who disagree with his hard-line anti-immigration policies. The apparent executive-order-by-tweet came just days after he sent out a heinous propaganda video splicing images from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks into a speech by Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar. And that smear of one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress came about a week after Trump forced Kirstjen Nielsen out as secretary of homeland security, reportedly because she wasn’t cruel and lawless enough for his tastes. Taken together, Trump’s actions are xenophobic , dangerous , and possibly illegal . They also offer a particularly grim preview of what the next two years of his reelection campaign will look like. This sort of demagoguery has long been Trump’s default posture, but coming from a president with a, um, limited attention span, the recent burst almost looks like message discipline. Last month, Trump cut short his own “ Total EXONERATION ” victory lap by reigniting the debate over repealing Obamacare, much to the dismay of a Republican Party that got walloped on the issue in the midterms. He quickly retreated, promising to address the issue after the election. This month, he’s back to playing offense and to being more aggressively offensive. Instead of a bleak health care rematch, he’s focusing on what has worked before: claiming without evidence that the nation is under attack both at the border and from within it, stoking much of white America’s fear of the other while pitching himself as those Americans’ greatest defender. It would be a mistake to see this as a conscious shift to election mode by the president—Trump’s been campaigning for reelection on that theme since the moment he was sworn in—but the current barrage of nationalism is nonetheless a clear reminder of what’s to come. As president, Trump has a far bigger stage from which to air his race-based grievances than he did as a candidate. He will also have far more cash. Trump’s second presidential campaign won’t look exactly like his first one, but his team is already using the same brushes and paint : Make American Great Again will become Keep America Great . He’ll spend less time (but not no time) calling Hillary Clinton corrupt, and he’ll spend more time branding his possible Democratic challengers as reparations-loving socialists. His fans will chant, “Finish the wall,” instead of “Build the wall.” And he’ll once again smear Muslims, immigrants, Mexicans, and black Americans, but with a few fresh faces like Omar’s added to his cast of villains. As president, Trump has a far bigger stage from which to air his race-based grievances than he did as a candidate. He will also have far more cash. On the same day he delivered his “American carnage” inaugural address, he filed the paperwork to run for another term, an unprecedented move that allowed him to begin raising money immediately. He currently boasts a campaign war chest of $41 million, more than 20 times what Barack Obama had at this point in the 2012 cycle. Trump reported bringing in $30 million in the first three months of this year alone—or roughly the combined total of the two top Democratic raisers, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, GOP officials are doing all they can to clear the primary field, and while they haven’t been completely successful, it’s still a marked departure from four years ago, when Trump ran as an outsider and the establishment did everything in its power to derail him. Then, he told his base what he would do if he won the nomination and then the White House. Now, he’s pointing to those things he’s already doing with the GOP marching in lockstep behind him. The big difference between Trump 2016 and Trump 2020, then, isn’t the message, but the tense. There’s no reason to believe Trump will successfully stay on message between now and November 2020. Even amid this current xenophobic flurry, Trump hasn’t been able to stop himself from live-tweeting professional golf or playing armchair fire chief —and this week’s expected release of the Mueller report will attract his attention as well. But there’s also no reason to doubt that racial resentment will be the motivating force of his reelection effort. It has been the unifying theme of his politics since well before he cannonballed into the GOP primary four years ago this summer. This is the guy who laid the groundwork for his run by repeatedly claiming that the nation’s first black president had no right to be in the Oval Office, then kicked off his campaign with a jeremiad against Mexicans, and followed that up by calling for a Muslim ban . It should not have been a surprise that his inaugural address was littered with racism. Or that he proposed one version of a Muslim ban after another . Or that now he’s trying to twist the memory of 9/11 into an Islamophobic weapon against the nation’s first hijab-clad congresswoman. Trump told us who he was then, and he’s telling us who is he now. On this at least, we can believe him. Support our journalism

Trump's sanctuary cities threat recalls the language of Qaddafi and Erdogan.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trumps-sanctuary-cities-migrants-qaddafi-erdogan.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant President Trump’s plan to release immigrant detainees on the streets of American sanctuary cities as a form of retaliation against his political enemies was reportedly the brainchild of White House adviser Stephen Miller. The logic behind it would also have made complete sense to Muammar Qaddafi. Libya has for years been a departure point for African migrants seeking to reach Europe, a fact that the country’s late strongman leader was more than willing to exploit. During a 2010 visit to Italy, Qaddafi demanded the EU pay Libya $6.3 billion a year to stop African migrants from reaching Europe. Otherwise, he said, he would turn Europe “black.” In remarks perfectly pitched to capitalize on European anxieties over immigration, he added: “We don’t know if Europe will remain an advanced and united continent or if it will be destroyed, as happened with the barbarian invasions.” Qaddafi wasn’t the only leader to play this game. Six years later, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “ open the gates ” and allow the roughly 3 million refugees then living in his country to enter Europe. That came soon after the EU parliament voted to suspend talks on Turkey joining the EU. The EU had agreed to pay Turkeys billions of euros to prevent immigrants from entering the continent, but didn’t come through on other aspects of the agreement, including membership talks and visa-free travel for Turks in Europe, prompting Erdogan to accuse the Europeans of breaking their word. Now it is Trump who is trying to use migrant populations as leverage. On Tuesday, he tweeted , “Those Illegal Immigrants who can no longer be legally held (Congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be, subject to Homeland Security, given to Sanctuary Cities and States!” White House officials have denied that this is a form of political retribution, but Trump has made it pretty clear that the intention is to “trigger the libs,” tweeting earlier, “The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!” The Washington Post has reported that “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco was among those the White House wanted to target” and that the White House also considered “releasing detainees in other Democratic strongholds.” Even if it was Miller’s idea, this ploy probably makes sense to Trump, as he seems to believe it’s already what’s being done to the U.S. He famously claimed , early in his presidential run, that “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.” What’s striking here is not only the assumption that migration can only be a danger or a burden for the receiving country. It’s also that migrants and refugees in this view are not individuals, making decisions for the well-being or safety of themselves or their families. Instead, in this view, they are a collective quantity that governments “give,” “send,” or “release,” to each other. (It should be noted that even sympathetic advocates sometimes have a tendency to view global migration as a disembodied force or “human flow” to take the title of Ai Weiwei’s recent documentary .) Rather than addressing the political, economic, or environmental causes of migration, or crafting policies that would benefit both migrants and the communities that absorb them, leaders are opting instead to view immigration policy as a spigot to be turned on or off. These leaders sound less like they’re crafting social policy and more like they’re diverting a river to punish a town downstream. The spread of this kind of rhetoric doesn’t bode well for how governments will respond to a global population increasingly on the move. Support our journalism

"Trump’s 2020 campaign, Ilhan Omar, Pete Buttigieg and the Supreme Court, Notre Dame.",slate.com,Slate Copy Desk,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-2020-campaign-ilhan-omar-pete-buttigieg-supreme-court-notre-dame.html,"What Ilhan Omar’s Speech Really Meant The rest of the story: Rep. Ilhan Omar’s speech to the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Greater L.A. late last month has been the subject of much ire lately from Republicans like Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Donald Trump who say she was minimizing the memory of 9/11. Aymann Ismail looks past the sound bite to take in the speech in its entirety, finding a rousing assertion of Muslim American identity that’s only been elevated by the attacks. The brewing storm: In addition to his vitriolic tweet directed at Ilhan Omar, Trump has purged DHS staff members whom he thinks were too soft on immigration and threatened to flood sanctuary cities with detained migrants. All of this rhetoric is just a precursor to his 2020 campaign , Josh Voorhees predicts: With his elevated platform as president, Trump is likely hoping his xenophobia will register on a mass scale. Pete, my guy, do better: Many of the 2020 Democratic candidates have ideas for judicial reform, the most popular being court packing. The increasingly popular Mayor Pete has a different idea: an appellate rotation plan, which would mandate a relatively even partisan split and require judges to also pick fellow members from appeals courts. The problems with this? Well, it wouldn’t actually fix the problem the courts are facing right now , as Mark Joseph Stern explains, and also, it’s unconstitutional! From the ashes: Writer Lauren Collins, coincidentally, was on the roof of the Notre Dame Cathedral just last month reporting on its renovations. Today, she joined the Culture Gabfest to discuss the monument’s place in history, its evolution as a “living building” over the years, and how Monday’s fire will become a part of its vibrant palimpsest.

Cyberinsurance: Why won’t it cover many cyberattacks?,slate.com,Fred Kaplan,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/cyberinsurance-mondelez-merck-cyberattacks-hacks.html,"Mar-a-Lago Is a Foreign Spy’s Dream Come True You can buy insurance policies to cover damage from almost anything —dog bites, meteor showers, volcanic eruptions, stampeding cows. But if you’ve bought insurance against cyberattacks, which are among the most common and costly phenomena of our time, you may find it hard to collect on a claim. A few big corporations recently made this startling discovery, and two of them—Mondelez International and Merck Pharmaceutical—are suing their insurers. The cases may settle some uncertainties that no one has formally contemplated, much less resolved. If the court rules against the plaintiffs, the entire cyberinsurance industry—which was created 20 years ago but has only recently started to surge—may be abandoned by clients, and the already dismal state of cybersecurity may diminish still further. Here’s the background. In 2017, a piece of malware called NotPetya was inserted into a Ukrainian tax-software program, wiping out 10 percent of the country’s computers and shutting down vital infrastructure throughout the country before spreading to networks worldwide, crippling a host of multinational companies, including Mondelez, Merck, Maersk, FedEx’s European subsidiary, and Russia’s state oil company, Rosneft. That last one was ironic, as Western intelligence agencies concluded that the malware had been planted by the Russian government, as part of its harassment campaign against Ukraine. Mondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates, filed a claim for $100 million in damages with the Zurich Insurance Group. Mondelez hadn’t taken out cyberinsurance per se, but its policy with Zurich did cover , among other things, “physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software” as a result of “the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction.” If the court rules against the plaintiffs, the already dismal state of cybersecurity may diminish still further. However, Zurich denied the claim, citing intelligence agencies’ verdict that NotPetya was part of a Russian attack on Ukraine, and referring to a clause in the company’s policy exempting coverage of damage caused by “hostile or warlike actions in time of peace or war.” Mondelez’s case against Zurich is proceeding in an Illinois court. Merck has filed a similar suit in New Jersey.The trials are likely to drag on for years because several key issues will have to be answered. The first might be: What is cyberwar? In 2006 , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, alarmed by the incessant briefings he was receiving on cyberattacks against the U.S. military and defense companies, asked the Pentagon’s general counsel at what point these attacks could be considered “acts of war” under international law. It took two years for the counsel’s office to respond and, even then, only evasively: Yes, the reply read, such attacks might be acts of war—but the precise circumstances were left vague. Second, to what extent can an intelligence agency’s judgment—the basis of which is probably classified—be cited to establish liability in a civil court case? Third, Mondelez’s lawyers are arguing that the war exclusion cannot be applied because the company and its transactions took place far from the Russia-Ukraine battlefield. But what are the battlefield’s boundaries in cyberspace? Is there even such a thing as a battlefield? Finally, as more (and more damaging) cyberattacks appear to be directed by national governments or their proxies, what is the point of having cyberinsurance if such attacks are excluded from coverage? This is the question that many clients will ask themselves if the insurers win these two cases. In other words, a tactical victory for the insurers could spawn a strategic defeat. “There’s a mad rush for insurance companies to write cyber policies,” says Bob Gourley, co-founder and chief technology officer of OODA LLC, a strategic advisory firm. But even when cyberattacks are not offshoots of war, the coverage offered by those companies is thin. According to Richard Clarke, CEO of Good Harbor Security Risk Management (and the White House cybersecurity chief during Bill Clinton’s presidency), these policies cover direct costs of a breach—the interruption of business, unauthorized credit card charges—and pay for subsequent credit monitoring and forensic teams. But the policies generally do not cover the much bigger losses of intellectual property, reputational damage, or theft of trade secrets. One reason is that the cyberinsurance business began 20 years ago, when attacks were seen mainly as nuisances inflicted by malicious hackers rather than a threat to economic infrastructure and national security, much less a new “domain” of international conflict. As a result of its booming demand and its limited payouts, cyberinsurance is a highly profitable branch of the industry. However, from the standpoint of insurers, the proliferation of attacks and the size of the targets have started to outgrow their ability to reimburse the enormous damage that such attacks can inflict. If cyberinsurance is to become a serious piece of both insurance and cybersecurity, a total rethink is required. The model, up till now, has been hazard insurance, but a better model might be health insurance. When you buy hazard insurance, you’re insuring yourself against the slim possibility of a fire or a flood; when you buy health insurance, you’re insuring yourself against the near certainty of eventual injury or illness. If you run certain sorts of businesses, cyberattacks are a near certainty—and, in some cases, potentially fatal. This means that real cyberinsurance, like health insurance, is going to be expensive. But a real insurance market can also provide incentives for improving cybersecurity. Just as medical and life insurance policies offer discounts for people who don’t smoke or keep healthy regimens, cyberinsurance policies could do the same for corporations that maintain “good hygiene” or follow “best practices” in computer security. Back in the mid- to late 1990s, when senior U.S. officials became aware that the internet was catastrophically vulnerable, some of them (notably Richard Clarke) advocated mandatory cybersecurity requirements for firms and government agencies involved in “critical infrastructure”—finance, transportation, electrical grids, water supply, emergency services, and so forth. The companies lobbied feverishly against the proposals. Even some Cabinet secretaries, who didn’t yet grasp the full scope of the risks, worried that “excess regulation” would stifle innovation and competitiveness. The resistance won. Even subsequent presidential orders, which at first glance seem to impose security requirements, lack enforcement clauses; they’re, in effect, nonbinding finger wags and brow furrows. In the absence of regulations, maybe market incentives can take us part of the way toward cybersecurity. But if the insurance companies succeed in claiming war exemptions in the two cases on trial now, the last route toward even a partial solution might be closed off. Support our journalism

Beto O'Rourke and 2020 Democratic candidates need to give more to charity.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/beto-orourke-democratic-candidates-tax-returns-charitable-giving.html,"How Bad Is Aunt Incest, Really? Who would have guessed that Beto O’Rourke was a total Scrooge? The Democratic 2020 hopefuls have started releasing their tax returns in the name of transparency (how quaint!), and among other information about their finances, it’s giving us an opportunity to learn a bit about their charitable giving habits—which in some cases are frankly a bit stingy. Credit to the Washington Post for scouring the candidates’ returns for this info, which they published on Tuesday. First, here’s how much of their total income candidates gave away, from most generous to least. All numbers are for last year, unless otherwise noted. • Elizabeth Warren : 5.5 percent.The senator from Massachusetts and her husband gave $50,000 on $906,000 in income. • Jay Inslee : 4.1 percentThe Washington governor and his wife gave $8,295 on $203,000 in income. • Bernie Sanders : 3.4 percentThe Vermont senator and his wife gave $19,000 on $566,000 in income. Sanders told the Post that total did not include proceeds he gave away from his book but did not claim as deductions on his taxes. We’ll have to take him on his word. • Amy Klobuchar : 1.9 percentThe Minnesota senator and her husband gave $6,600 on $338,500 of income. • Kirsten Gillibrand : 1.7 percentThe New York senator and her husband gave $3,750 on $215,000 of income. • Kamala Harris: 1.4 percentThe California senator and her husband gave $27,000 on $1.9 million of income. • Beto O’Rourke: 0.31 percent.No, you are not reading that wrong. In 2017, the most recent return he’s released, the former Texas representative and his wife gave just $1,166 on $370,412 of income, less than 1 percent of what they earned. So, O’Rourke’s number is self-evidently terrible. I thought maybe it was just one bad year, but alas, no. In 2016 , he and his wife donated $857, or 0.25 percent of their income. In 2015 , they gave $867, or 0.24 percent of their income. Not great, Beto. But as for the other candidates? For their income, Sanders, Inslee, and Warren are all somewhat above average givers by U.S. standards. The others are a bit below average. Based on IRS data, the Tax Policy Center shows that Americans who earn between $100,000 and $500,000 contribute about 2.9 percent of their adjusted gross income to charity; those who earn between $500,000 and $2 million give about 3.1 percent. (The Post’s calculations are based on total income, not AGI, which is your income after subtracting away certain deductions. The candidates’ giving would probably be slightly higher as a percentage of AGI, but you still get the idea.) Tax Policy Center These figures do need a few caveats. First, they only cover people who itemize their taxes and took the charitable deduction, which is only about a quarter of taxpayers. There are lots of people who give to charity but take the standard deduction who won’t show up in these figures. Also, you might notice that people who make under $50,000 seem to donate the most in this table relative to their income. But the figures in that income bracket are probably a bit skewed, since it includes some relatively well-off business owners whose companies have a bad year, with the losses showing up in their personal taxes. So take that bit with a grain of salt. Point being: O’Rourke needs to up his giving game. I know. Maintaining a dual residence in Washington and Texas is probably expensive. But offer some money for your local food bank or homeless shelter, man. Also, in case you’re looking for a quick, more detailed guide to what you should give to charity each year, here’s a more detailed list of average charitable contributions by income bracket drawn from the IRS’s data. See if you measure up better than the O’Rourkes. Jordan Weissmann"
Fosse/Verdon fact vs. fiction Episode 2: What’s true in FX’s new series starring Michelle Williams and Sam Rockwell.,slate.com,Ellin Stein,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/fosse-verdon-fact-fiction-episode-2-historical-accuracy-fx-series.html,"What’s Fact and What’s Fiction in On the Basis of Sex The second episode of Fosse/Verdon offers a sophisticated, time-traveling, bittersweet depiction of a marriage from early rapture to late-stage battle-scarred disillusionment. To do this, it cuts between Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse’s incendiary affair during rehearsals for Damn Yankees and the end of the relationship on a beach in Majorca, where Fosse discovers that Verdon has finally had enough and the old tricks and manipulations won’t work anymore. While the show’s premiere focused on the more familiar, sex-and-decadence Fosse of Cabaret , this episode evokes the choreographer’s more exuberant 1950s style, when he worked on that vanished subspecies, the blue-collar Broadway musical. How closely does it stick to the real-life story of the couple’s first meeting and final dissolution? We break it all down below. Meeting on Damn Yankees In the episode, producer Hal Prince (Evan Handler) tells Verdon that he’s engaged Fosse as choreographer and that Fosse wants to go over some steps with her. Verdon, a hot star six months after winning the Tony for Can-Can , is furious that Fosse wants her to, in effect, audition, telling Prince, “If I don’t like him, you’ll be looking for a new choreographer.” At the studio, Fosse begins teaching Verdon the number , and over the course of working out the steps, the two discover their creative synergy, with Verdon adding her own quirky, humorous touches. She is shocked but intrigued by Fosse’s adding striptease moves and they exchange confidences about their time working in burlesque houses as teenagers. In reality, Verdon had already encountered Fosse socially a few times, although they had never worked together. Nevertheless, it is true that they were in fact wary of working together. “ I don’t know her. How do I know we can work together? ” Fosse asked Prince , while Verdon recalled that she had a reputation for being difficult. “I was difficult because I couldn’t stand bad dancing,” she told cable station CUNY TV in 1991. But, as in the show, her fears were allayed once he started showing her the number. “He was fantastic doing it. It was Lola,” she recalled. “It had such sex appeal and yet it was so funny.” A dance style that was at once very sexy and knowingly humorous became the team’s trademark. Fosse did work in burlesque theaters as a young teenager, as explored in last week’s episode , but it’s less clear that Verdon did so, although she was already dancing professionally in clubs and in movies at 11.

Photos by Bruno of Hollywood/Wikipedia and Pari Dukovic/FX. In the episode, the lithe and vibrant Verdon is contrasted with Fosse’s elegant but ailing wife, actress Joan McCracken (Susan Misner), who is trying to keep the debilitating effects of her diabetes secret lest producers be scared off. Verdon, meanwhile, is intimidated by McCracken’s reputation as a serious actress. At the opening night of Damn Yankees , McCracken runs into Verdon in a powder room and tells her that when she met Fosse, he was married to his first wife, another dancer, whom he left for McCracken. She also says she was the one who got Fosse his first job as a choreographer, although he’s never thanked her. Fosse, meanwhile, tells Verdon he can’t leave McCracken. But McCracken soon leaves him and he moves in with Verdon. Fosse’s second wife, Joan McCracken, was indeed a serious actress, and she did indeed try to keep her diabetes secret, but she was primarily known for her talents as a dancer and a comedienne—quite a lot like Verdon (she also mentored another performer with these same talents, Shirley MacLaine). She came to fame dancing in a featured ballet role in Oklahoma! , although she also established herself as a straight dramatic actress in Charles Laughton’s 1947 production of Bertolt Brecht’s Life of Galileo . It really was McCracken who got Fosse his first Broadway choreography job, recommending him for The Pajama Game to her friend George Abbott, the immensely successful and respected director. The couple had met when they were both appearing in a 1950 revue called Dance Me a Song , when Fosse was still married to his first wife, Mary Ann Niles, with whom he had a double act tap-dancing on various TV shows. Fosse and McCracken got closer when they appeared together in a touring company production of Pal Joey , and when Fosse subsequently got an MGM contract, it was McCracken who went with him to Hollywood. It was also McCracken who encouraged him to take acting classes at the American Theatre Wing. “I was very show biz, all I thought about was nightclubs, and she kept saying, ‘You’re too good to spend your life in nightclubs,’ ” Fosse told the New York Times. “She lifted me out of that, and I’ll always be grateful,” though not so grateful he didn’t leave McCracken on her own (she didn’t leave him) despite her suffering two heart attacks during the run of Damn Yankees . He didn’t move in with Verdon—they maintained separate apartments—but their relationship was an open secret until Fosse finally divorced McCracken in 1957. He had been waiting for her to be released from a facility where she’d gone to recover from a breakdown. The “Who’s Got the Pain?” Snit Fit Bob Fosse and Sam Rockwell. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Alix Jeffry/ Wikipedia and Craig Blankenhorn/FX. The episode shows Fosse having a complete meltdown when Abbott and Prince suggest cutting a number during Damn Yankees ’ New Haven tryouts, possibly because Fosse had given himself a part in the number. The situation is compounded when, listening through the thin walls of a hotel room, Fosse overhears the two saying the number has to go. He threatens to quit. The next day, composer Richard Adler comes up with a replacement number based on the mambo, a Latin dance craze then popular with the same middle-class audiences who went to Broadway musicals, and Fosse comes up with a comedic-but-sexy number that perfectly showcases Verdon’s talents. This is all true, including Fosse’s listening through the wall and his furious response to hearing Abbott and Prince say they thought the original number was terrible.

Many years later, after discovering her husband in flagrante with the Cabaret shoot’s translator, Verdon heads to celebrated playwright Neil Simon’s idyllic property in Majorca, where she has a heart-to-heart with her close friend Joan Baim Simon (Aya Cash), a former dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company who, like Verdon, has given up her dancing career to raise her family. Fosse pleads with Verdon to stay with him, even though, as he admits, he’s in love with the translator. This is all accurate. Fosse and Verdon did stop living together after the Cabaret shoot. The final straw was Verdon discovering him in bed with two German girls, although she had already received a letter from the translator’s furious husband revealing all. Moreover, even before Fosse got the Cabaret job in 1970, the marriage was in dire condition. “I think Bob outgrew me,” she told the New York Times in 1981. “Bob started writing and he was involved in all kinds of things, and I was so involved with Nicole [their daughter] I didn’t really care if I worked or not. … He began to think, ‘Oh, you’re my wife.’ I hated that.” According to Sam Wasson’s biography of Fosse , after the production wrapped, Fosse was spending a post-shoot week in Madrid with the translator when he started having second thoughts. He called Verdon, who agreed to come to Simon’s rented villa. Verdon and Joan Simon were indeed close, and Fosse and Simon had collaborated on Little Me in 1962 and then again on Sweet Charity in 1966, with Simon subsequently serving as Fosse’s unofficial sounding board on scripts. The reconciliation failed, with Verdon returning to New York and their daughter and Fosse to the translator."

Columbine High School and more than 20 other schools across Denver’s Jefferson County, which encompasses the western flank and suburbs of the city were put on “lockout” in response to reports that Pais was in the area and attempting to buy firearms. “Less serious than a lockdown, a lockout means that activity inside the schools will continue as scheduled, but entry and exit is restricted,” the Denver Post reports . “A bulletin sent to local police said authorities do not have probable cause to arrest Pais, but that she should be detained for a mental-health evaluation.” The Colorado Department of Education issued a recommendation that all schools in the Denver metropolitan area undertake similar lockout procedures. We are currently investigating what appears to be a credible threat possibly involving the schools. Children are safe. Deputies are at the schools.

On that day 12 students and one teacher was killed and 24 others were wounded, marking a new era in deadly school shootings in America that continues to this day. Even now, twenty years later, the high school is an object of morbid fascination for disturbed individuals and routinely receives threats of all sorts. As a result the Jefferson County school district has a highly trained security along with one of the most comprehensive security systems in the country to ensure that students and teachers remain safe. “As the district prepares for the day’s memorial events, it is fending off an onslaught of curious strangers who trespass in the school’s parking lot— sometimes more than 30 people in a single day,” the Washington Post reports . “The district has also seen an increase in threats and concerning messages, which often come in the form of emails to the school or phone calls to the 24-hour dispatch center run by the district’s security team.”"

Trump administration to allow for extended detention of certain asylum seekers as deterrent to others not to come.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/barr-trump-order-asylum-seekers-migrants-immigration-parole-bail-bond.html,"Is Brooklyn’s Gun Court Getting Weapons off the Streets—or Just Locking Up More Young Black Men? Attorney General William Barr issued an order Tuesday evening that will stop certain credible asylum seekers from being able to post bail while they await their asylum hearings, a process that can take months and sometimes years. The practical effect of the order directed at immigration judges is that it could keep thousands of asylum seekers detained for extended periods while they await a court ruling on their status. The move is the latest explicit effort by the Trump administration to discourage legal asylum seekers from attempting to come to the country by erecting administrative roadblocks and potentially jail time. “For more than a decade, migrants who are deemed to have a ‘credible fear’ of persecution in their home countries have been allowed to request a bond hearing so they can be released on bail while they wait for their asylum cases to be heard, sometimes months or years later,” the New York Times notes . This is an approach that has been affirmed by the judicial system as recently as this month when a federal judge in Washington State affirmed that credible asylum seekers must have the ability to seek bail within seven days of requesting it. The attorney general, however, oversees the immigration courts and Barr is restricting the class of asylum seekers that can rely on that week-long time frame. The order gives the Department of Homeland Security wide discretion over whether migrants who declared themselves as asylum seekers after entering the country illegally will be released on bail or not. The Trump administration, unsurprisingly, has dramatically curtailed the release of migrants awaiting immigration proceedings. The order restricting migrants’ access to parole does not apply to potential asylum seekers that declare themselves at a port of entry along the border. Given the difficulties that already overworked government agencies have had imposing stiffer immigration regulations, it’s doubtful the administration has the capacity to house thousands more migrants for extended periods of time. Barr, on Tuesday, acknowledged as much saying he will defer the implementation of the new rules. “I will delay the effective date of this decision for 90 days so that D.H.S. may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions,” Barr wrote in the 11-page order."

Showtime If we ever repair the damage former Fox News head Roger Ailes did to the United States, it will be decades from now, after time and actuarial tables slowly sweep the people whose minds he poisoned off the board. There’s some consolation in the fact that a man who made the world so much worse spent the last year of his life in disgrace , but that was a fate Ailes earned through his years of sexual misconduct in the workplace; it didn’t really address what the workplace he ran was designed to accomplish, or any of the work he spent his life doing. In some parts of the world, when someone who did well by doing bad dies, their statues get torn down, but Ailes doesn’t have any—and even if he did, we still haven’t managed to tear down the statues of people who lost a war fought to preserve slavery more than a century ago, so that’s not a promising avenue to pursue. Truth and reconciliation commissions aren’t really our thing either, nor are reparations, nor are repairs. But there’s one thing we do better than any other country: produce biopics in which A-listers dramatically transform their appearance to look just as terrible as the world’s greatest villains. Showtime released a teaser for their upcoming series The Loudest Voice on Tuesday, and it looks like it fits squarely in the tradition of wrecking-ball biopics of terrible presidents like Vice , Nixon , and Bedtime for Bonzo .

But the highlight was a back-and-forth he had about Australia’s deadliest animals with an Australian who just happened to be in the studio audience: The world needs more comedy that comes from Megan-Amram-style pun brainstorms , and it also needs more comedy in which artists create modern Jackalopes in Photoshop. This sketch has both! Even more importantly, however, it introduces the world to the concept of the kangarooaroo, a kangaroo with a kangaroo for a head. There probably wasn’t time in a single Conan sketch to mention kangarooarooaroos (either a kangarooaroo with a kangaroo for a head or a kangaroo with a kangarooaroo for a head, depending on how you look at it), much less wade into the centuries-long argument between recursive kangarooaroologistologists as to whether or not a kangarooarooarooaroo is best described as a kangaroo with a kangarooarooaroo for a head, a kangarooaroo with a kangarooaroo for a head, a kangarooarooaroo with a kangaroo for a head, or—the most controversial theory of all—an arooarooarooaroo with a kang for a body. Still, even in such a short timeframe, Conan gets his point across: Australia is deadly and terrifying and we are all better off leaving it alone.

Queer nightlife culture and chronic illness: How one lesbian made peace with the needs of her body.,slate.com,Jacy Topps,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/queer-nightlife-scene-chronic-illness-community.html,"“Leather” Usually Conjures Images of Butch Gay Men. But a Gender-Inclusive Scene in L.A. Is Creating Its Own Kinky Magic. You’ve probably heard of the idea of a queer “scene,” perhaps most often from people who don’t care for it. But what, exactly, is this scene? Who’s a part of it? Who isn’t? Who decides? Is there more than one? What happens when a scene evolves—or when it doesn’t? These are the questions we’ve gathered a group of writers to consider for an Outward special issue on “the Scene” in LGBTQ life today. You can read all of the stories in the issue here , and you can listen to a full episode of the Outward podcast covering more of the queer scene by subscribing on iTunes , Spotify , or wherever you get your audio . In my late 20s, on the brink of coming out as a lesbian, I did what most “baby queers” eager to connect to their people usually do: I turned my nascent identity into a research project. I read all the books on queer history, coming out essays, and articles on hookup culture in an effort to discover where to find other lesbians like me. The consensus: gay bars and dance clubs. In retrospect, this wasn’t exactly surprising. Bars and underground dance parties have historically played a pivotal role in the queer community and our culture, providing a safe space to meet and hook up with other queers. Constantly harassed, assaulted, and discriminated against in mainstream spaces, LGBTQ individuals needed raves, private parties, and gay bars in order to firm up their communities and escape societal persecution. When the community finally decided to fight back after decades of mistreatment and police brutality, the first punches were thrown in spaces like the Stonewall Inn, site of the famous 1969 riot that we’re now commemorating 50 years later as a milestone in the march toward equality. And it was in the literal debris of these clashes that queers gathered to organize the social movements that have yielded so much fruit today. So when I walked into my first divey queer bar, named My Sister’s Room, in Atlanta, it was a big moment. I went by myself, which was intimidating at first. But it quickly started to feel like home. I met women there who identified as butch, femme, and everything in between. I no longer had to hide who I was. It felt safe and magical. From those first steps, I grew to love socializing, dancing, and having a few cocktails with other queers, particularly queer women. There’s something special in knowing there’s a dedicated space to be your most authentic self, where you can give into your kinks, speak freely about your relationships, be entertained by fabulous drag performers, and openly express your gender and sexuality. West to East Coast, no matter where I’ve lived or visited, I have always been down for exploring the queer neighborhoods, bars, and dance parties. In Atlanta, it’s Mary’s in the East Atlanta Village. When I lived in San Francisco, I was a fixture in the Castro and also frequented the famous Lexington Club before it permanently closed.And when I moved to New York City, you could routinely find me dancing at Henrietta Hudson or enjoying drink specials at my favorite lesbian dive bar, Cubbyhole. It was in these spaces that I developed some friendships that lasted a short while and some that I believe will last a lifetime. At these queer bars, I kissed women, sang along to their jukeboxes, listened to my favorite DJs spin, and met a couple of one-night stands. These are memories that I will always cherish. But regrettably, I haven’t been able to go out as much as I would like recently, not to late-night parties anyway. On the surface, my queer friends probably assume it’s because I’m more settled in a relationship and celebrating my 40 th birthday in a few months. However, the truth is I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m not able to do some of the things I use to. On any given day, I suffer from chronic pain and fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, depression, and other mental illnesses; these overlap to affect every area of my life. My depressive periods heighten my anxiety, making large crowds and loud music unnerving. My chronic anxieties manifest physically, sometimes causing migraines, panic attacks, and debilitating pain throughout my body. And on most days, I’m completely exhausted due to my chronic insomnia. Sometimes I also worry about being condemned to a boring, heteronormative life. Despite all this, sometimes the mood does strike, and I feel like going out. But when I start thinking about the crowds, the two-day hangovers, the anxiety, fatigue, and pain I will inevitably feel later, I decide to stay in and watch a movie instead. To add insult to injury, my wife — who was also heavy into queer nightlife — suffers from some of these symptoms as well, and oftentimes, we’re not on the same page. When she feels healthy and wants to go out to a late-night dance party, those are usually the nights when I don’t. We don’t necessarily have to go out clubbing together. But if one of us isn’t up to it, we usually both stay in. And so my chronic illnesses hurt me in ways beyond their immediate symptoms. They leave me feeling isolated, left behind, and disconnected from the community, and the guilt of not actively supporting queer establishments can be hard to shake off, particularly since bars for lesbians and female-identified queers have been increasingly shutting down . Sometimes I also worry about being condemned to a boring, heteronormative life devoid of the loving, beautiful, diverse, and resilient community I’m proud to be a part of. While there’s nothing wrong with wanting a more traditional lifestyle—a house in the suburbs and children—my idea of queer culture has always been unapologetically radical. From the transgressive ways queer femmes express their identities to networks like the Radical Faeries, I appreciate the ways in which many in the queer community intentionally reject assimilating to straight culture. I try not to be too hard on myself about all this. After all, my fade from the scene is not just about my chronic ailments—there are structural factors in play too. As a black woman, my decision not to attend every party has an economic component. Research shows that not only do black women make less money than both white men and women, but we also suffer from depression at higher rates . And to make matters worse, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, black people have less access to quality mental health care due to stigma and the cost of health insurance. After insurance premiums, out-of-pocket payments, copays, and medication, sometimes there’s just not enough money for me to go out even if I felt up to it. So how do I find a way to keep queer community in my life that puts my body and mental health first? A couple of years ago, I started attending queer potluck dinner parties, yoga, pop-up pool parties, brunches, tea parties, reading and writing groups, fashion shows, community BBQs, and art exhibitions on a more regular basis. These types of events and places are nothing new as activities. But what makes them special is their intentional queerness, prioritizing and celebrating queer-identified people and their allies. For me, these events and queer spaces are usually more intimate, less crowded, more inclusive to femmes and people of color, less anxiety-inducing, generally earlier in the day, and easier on my body. From time to time, when I’m feeling relatively healthy, I do venture out to support my favorite queer bars, DJs, drag performers, and promoters, paying my respects to our sacred institutions and their place in our extraordinary history. But I’ve learned to let go of the guilt when I can’t make it and to embrace gratitude for the growing diversity of queer scenes, especially for the people within our community living with chronic illnesses and other disabilities. Because when it comes to being with chosen family, it’s the people, not the time of day or the venue, that matters. "
India is leading the world in internet shutdowns.,slate.com,Subhodeep Jash,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/india-internet-shutdowns-digital-authoritarianism-democracies.html,"This article originally appeared in the New America Weekly . The past decade has seen a staggering decline around the world in digital freedom, as the human rights nonprofit Freedom House underscored in a report last year. China has largely taken center stage in this decline narrative, thanks to tools like its social credit system and facial recognition technology , which allow the country to shrink personal freedoms, especially those of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang . Not to be left behind, Russia also has recently announced its plan to “unplug” the country from the internet. And in March, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a “fake news” law that will severely limit online speech for its citizens. But while observers have kept a steady eye on these admittedly unsurprising curbs on digital rights in countries like China and Russia, an overlooked method of digital repression—internet shutdowns—is most rampant not in an authoritarian regime, but in the world’s largest democracy: India. According to a Software Freedom Law Center tracker , there have been more than 300 reported shutdowns in India over the past six years. (And these are just the incidents that have been reported; it’s likely that there have been more.) This data point makes India the leading country for internet shutdowns globally, even surpassing countries like Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It challenges the prevailing assumption that digital authoritarianism is only a problem in authoritarian countries. The government grounds its shutdown authority in a statutory relic from the colonial era. First, though, it’s important to understand what, exactly, an internet shutdown is. Per the international nonprofit Access Now, an internet shutdown “happens when someone—usually a government—intentionally disrupts the internet or mobile apps to control what people say or do.” Put another way, these shutdowns—or “blackouts” or “kill switches”—represent an extreme form of network control and government censorship of a country’s own population. Some of the earliest and most prominent cases of internet shutdowns across the planet arose during explosive political events. In 2005, Nepal shut down its entire telecommunications network during a coup d’état. In 2011, Egypt witnessed shutdowns in the thick of the Arab Spring protests. And in India, some of the first reported cases of shutdowns occurred in the conflict-torn regions of Jammu and Kashmir, where mobile services were jammed as a security measure prior to Republic Day celebrations in January 2010. But it’s been since 2012 that regional governments in India have really ramped up efforts to rein in the digital freedoms increasingly fueled by technology. This has stemmed at least in part from the number of internet users surging to more than 100 million, with many first-time users, especially users of mobile internet, quickly picking up on its potential as a source of information. In this light, the rapid increase in the number of shutdowns in India over the past several years speaks to a deeper state desire to exercise control over a medium that has dramatically increased citizens’ connectivity and access to information within and beyond the country’s borders. More broadly still, the shutdowns point to the fact that democracies and hybrid regimes—the latter of which feature elements of both democratic and autocratic governments—aren’t immune to internet blackouts. In 2017 alone, India accounted for about 70 percent of shutdowns globally , and this phenomenon has had corrosive effects on Indian society. (It’s important to mention here that, given its size compared with countries like Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, India also has a lot more internet to shut down.) The government metes out shutdowns via executive orders and decrees (sometimes issued verbally), which local or regional authorities initiate. This legal maneuvering is often directed at telecommunications companies, and administrators see it as a quick fix (even preemptively) to what they deem a law-and-order or national security issue. Importantly, the government also grounds its shutdown authority by referencing the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 , a statutory relic from the colonial era. While initially intended to regulate India’s telegraph system, over the decades it has been expanded to encompass the entire sphere of telecoms, and it now includes a provision to impose “curfews” for both physical and online spaces in the event of an emergency. Further, in 2017, the state introduced the Internet Shutdown Rules , which grant regional and federal governments temporary suspension powers for mobile services during emergencies. As mentioned above, these shutdowns are sometimes justified on the grounds of security. This was true for shutdowns in Kashmir in the wake of violent protests after the death of a separatist leader, Burhan Wani, in 2016, and in Gujarat that same year following civil agitation over affirmative action quotas on education and public jobs. But too often, flimsy or rash reasoning guides the decision to trigger a shutdown, as was the case with several incidents in Rajasthan last year to prevent cheating on examinations . In terms of the proportionality principle under international law—which, in this particular case, means that any restriction on internet access must also be the “least intrusive instrument”—these irresponsible kill-switch responses reveal regional governments’ penchant for overreaction, rather than a willingness to reasonably deal with an issue. This disproportionate state response matters because it can come with costs, both social and economic. Observers can see the former because misused internet shutdowns can affect individuals’ ability to express even unpopular opinions freely—a right enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed in a 2012 Human Rights Council declaration , which extended protections to both offline and online spaces. Consider how, in September 2012, after a viral video began to anger Muslims in the Kashmir Valley, the regional government of Jammu and Kashmir ordered telecommunications companies to restrict access to YouTube and Facebook there. But the telecom operators chose to overcomply, and they disrupted access to the entire internet, rather than to specific websites. While done for the sake of security—protests erupted as the video circulated—it isn’t a stretch to see how this overly broad latitude could be used to censor any opinion perceived as unpopular. As for the economic cost, a recent study on shutdowns in India—conducted by the think tank ICRIER —finds that, from 2012 through 2017, 16,315 shutdown hours cost the country’s economy approximately $3.04 billion. This is hardly ideal for a country that yearns to cement its place as a major power on the international stage. On top of that, a shutdown goes directly against the government’s Digital India initiative, which attempts to promote a cashless economy. This is because a cornerstone of the e-commerce industry is access to open and reliable internet. (Notably, an Indian ride-hailing operator, Ola Cabs, has created an “ offline ” variation of its app for areas that experience intermittent internet connectivity.) While India’s internet shutdowns may not be the worst instances of the phenomenon, the blackouts there raise concerns about where the country might be going in the years ahead. As the government looks to expand preexisting telecoms regulation, it’s prudent to ask whether it will eventually craft internet-specific legislation, as well as what that legislation may look like. After all, India’s dalliance with regulations that seek to control the free flow of information online doesn’t seem to be ending with shutdowns. Recently, it floated a new set of intermediary guideline rules that look to curb the misuse of social media platforms and the spread of fake news. A February New York Times report called this a “Chinese-style internet censorship” approach. More than ever, it’s become increasingly clear that this sort of “ networked authoritarianism ” is on display in India. Indeed, though India may be an outlier among the usual shutdown suspects, it may also offer a crucial warning of how blackouts can occur in other fragile and hybrid democratic regimes."

Beyonce's Homecoming live album has two new songs.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/beyonces-homecoming-new-songs-coachella-album.html,"The Only Good Thing Left About Game of Thrones Is Its Fan Theories Fans were already prepared for Wednesday to be an unofficial Bey-day. We knew that April 17 marked the release of Beyoncé’s new documentary Homecoming , which would include a full version of the singer’s 2018 Coachella performance (aka Beychella) along with a behind-the-scenes peek to let us revel a little more in the historic headlining show. But Beyoncé has always been a master of the surprise release, and we should’ve known that she’d have an extra gift up her sleeve this time, too. Early Wednesday morning, Bey capped off the Netflix debut with an accompanying live album, also called Homecoming , that includes two fresh bonus tracks: “Before I Let Go” and “I Been On.” Neither track is totally new—”Before I Let Go” is a cover of a 1981 song by Frankie Beverly and Maze, and “I Been On” is an alternate studio version of the Beychella song—but for fans, new Beyoncé is a cause for celebration. As it turns out, “Before I Let Go” isn’t totally new to Beyoncé’s orbit—nor to, as Essence put it , any “cookout, not a wedding or family reunion in Black America”. Variety reports that the song was once included on the Instagram of Bey’s mother, Tina Knowles, in a video post featuring Bey and Jay-Z dancing to the R&B song at a family gathering. The post was reportedly taken down in December 2017. On top of that, a different cover of the song was recorded by Destiny’s Child in 1997, though the track was never released and bootlegged versions have only become available in the years since the group broke up. In addition to being included on the album, Beyoncé’s new rendition of “Before I Let Go” also plays over the closing credits of the Homecoming documentary. The full Homecoming album divides Beyoncé’s two-hour-plus Coachella concert into 40 tracks, including older hits like “Baby Boy” and “Crazy in Love” alongside Destiny’s Child songs “Soldier” and “Say My Name,” which she performed with former bandmates Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland. Though in the past some Beyoncé releases have at first become exclusively available on Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal, Homecoming: The Live Album was released across major streaming platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.

The U.S. government’s lackluster response to Yahoo and Equifax data breaches.,slate.com,Josephine Wolff,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/equifax-data-breach-aftermath-canada-united-states.html,"New Details From the Mueller Report About Don Jr.’s Interactions With WikiLeaks When the Canadian Privacy Commissioner’s office released the results of its investigation into the Equifax breach last week, it only served to highlight how little the U.S. government has done to address the 2017 incident, which affected the data of 146 million people. So far, the United States’ attempts to rectify the weak security at Equifax or compensate victims of the breach have been relatively local and lackluster. Eight state banking regulatory authorities issued a consent order that required Equifax to conduct more risk assessment and internal audit programs for consumers’ personal data. The Government Accountability Office released two reports, one on the response to the Equifax breach and another on the need for better oversight of consumer reporting agencies . But at the federal level, neither the Federal Trade Commission nor the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken any steps yet to fine Equifax or force it to ramp up its security moving forward. Equifax is apparently anticipating that both agencies may soon impose penalties , according to its SEC filings. But in February, the CFPB wound down its investigation of the breach. The U.S. government may yet take strong action against Equifax, but it’s been a year and a half since the breach. The current federal government has shown repeatedly that it cares little about this incident, in particular, and data security in general—creating a void that the courts may be stepping in to fill. In Canada, meanwhile, the government has recommended in its recent report that Equifax Canada “identify Canadians’ personal information that should no longer be retained by Equifax Inc. according to its retention schedule and delete it” and provide a third-party security assessment and audit to the Canadian government every two years for the next six years. Data minimization and third-party audits are both important steps for strengthening security, and it’s significant that the recommendations came from a regulator, especially since individuals don’t choose to directly hand over their information to credit bureaus and therefore can’t vote with their feet by deciding not to do business with Equifax anymore. Those provisions only apply to Equifax Canada and personal information held by the company about Canadians, unfortunately. But another massive breach from the recent past suggests there may be a way forward for the U.S. to take similar steps, even without the federal government’s intervention. Also last week , Yahoo reached a $117.5 million settlement in a class-action suit brought by victims of three data breaches that affected roughly 3 billion accounts between 2013 and 2016. The settlement has garnered a lot of attention for creating the “biggest common fund ever obtained in a data breach case,” according to the plaintiffs’ lawyer John Yanchunis , but the fund money allocated to the breach victims and their attorneys isn’t the most important thing here. Essentially, the settlement does the work of the Federal Trade Commission by requiring substantial changes to Verizon’s security practices and investment, all without the FTC actually having to lift a finger. (The FTC may yet take further action against Verizon for the Yahoo breaches, but so far the only government penalties in that case have been a $35 million fine issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for keeping the breaches secret from investors.) The settlement includes a section on “business practice changes” that will be implemented by Verizon, which acquired Yahoo in 2017. (Verizon decided to buy Yahoo before the full scope of the data breaches was revealed, though Verizon did end up getting a $350 million discount when more information came to light.) According to the settlement, Verizon has committed to investing $234.7 million in improving security from 2017 through 2019, as well as maintaining an annual information security budget of at least $66 million and an information security team totaling at least 200 full-time employees through 2022. According to the settlement, those investments are four times what Yahoo was previously spending on security The Yahoo settlement makes clear just how much by way of security investments and improvements it is possible to extract from a company in court. The settlement also details that the company has aligned its security program with the widely used National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST is the agency that sets technical standards for government cybersecurity that are often implemented in private industry as well). Beyond using the NIST framework, Verizon also agreed to third-party security assessments for four years beginning in 2019. It even includes references to the new intrusion and anomaly detection tools and penetration testing implemented since the breaches. The Yahoo settlement should be a clear warning for Equifax, which still faces major class-action lawsuits in the U.S. It’s a sign that even in the absence of serious regulatory intervention, there may still be ways for it to be held accountable for its actions and—much more importantly—be forced to strengthen its data security efforts moving forward. A class-action settlement can’t necessarily do all the things that a regulator can. For instance, the recent report from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada recommends that Equifax Canada report on its security to the Canadian government every two years—an analogous requirement in the U.S. would probably require the insistence of a government agency. Similarly, it’s not clear that a court could order Equifax to go through the data held on U.S. people and delete any unnecessary information. I’m still hopeful that the FTC may choose to take meaningful regulatory action against Verizon for the Yahoo breaches, but the Yahoo settlement makes clear just how much by way of security investments and improvements it is possible to extract from a company in court. The $117.5 million figure may scare Equifax—it’s a large sum by data breach settlement standards and Equifax’s revenue in 2018 was $3.4 billion , so a comparable settlement would total roughly 3.5 percent of the company’s annual revenue (close to the max fine of 4 percent annual revenues allowable under Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation). But that figure pales in comparison to the investment that Verizon has agreed to make in security moving forward: It will put nearly twice as much money toward security as it will toward that settlement just by the end of 2019. And it’s committed to spend nearly another $200 million on security in the three years after that. Those are the changes that have the potential to make a real difference for consumers’ security moving forward and they will be vastly more expensive and more meaningful than the settlement fund. They’re also the type of changes that, in the U.S., we have long relied on the FTC to drive, but that may be increasingly less necessary."
Alan Dershowitz Sued for Defamation By Alleged Jeffrey Epstein Sexual Abuse Victim,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/alan-dershowitz-defamation-lawsuit-jeffrey-epstein-abuse-case.html,"Don’t Rebuild Notre Dame The prominent lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz is being sued for defamation in connection with the sexual assault allegations against well-connected multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein, whose extraordinarily lenient plea deal for allegedly operating a sex trafficking ring of teenage girls made news in the fall, the Miami Herald reported Tuesday. The suit, filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York by one of Epstein’s alleged victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, charges that Dershowitz, as one of Epstein’s lawyers, was aware of and participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls but still spread false information about Giuffre and other victims in order to silence them. The suit focuses on Dershowitz’s assertions that the alleged victims fabricated their accusations. In the suit, Giuffre claims that she was coerced into having sex with Dershowitz and other wealthy and powerful men when she was a teenager. Dershowitz has maintained his innocence and asserted that he has proof that Giuffre’s allegations are false. He has claimed he never met Giuffre, and he has said he will at some point give the Herald exculpatory evidence from some of his documents. In a filing for that lawsuit, another woman also came forward to add her story to the growing list of sexual assault allegations against Epstein, the Herald reported. Maria Farmer, now 49, says Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, sexually assaulted her in 1996, when she was a 26-year-old art student. She also alleges that Epstein molested her then–15-year-old sister repeatedly. Farmer claims she reported her assault to the FBI and New York police—which would make her the first person to report them to the FBI—but that the FBI took no action against Epstein. Farmer, in the filing, added that she frequently saw underage girls come into his New York mansion and head upstairs. She was told they were auditioning for modeling work, according to the affidavit. She also alleges in the filing that she saw Dershowitz head upstairs while there were underage girls present. Dershowitz has publicly criticized the Herald, which first published a series about Epstein and the role of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, then the U.S. attorney in Miami, in brokering a plea deal for Epstein that gave him federal immunity, kept his victims in the dark, and protected any other potentially guilty parties. It was in the paper’s investigation, which identified 80 potential victims of Epstein’s abuse, that Giuffre’s accusations against Dershowitz were first published. Since then, another woman, Sarah Ransome, has said when she was 22 she was “lent out” by Epstein to have sex with Dershowitz . “No sensible person looks forward to litigation,’’ Giuffre said in a statement. “And I know that standing up for myself and others will cause Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Epstein to redouble their efforts to destroy me and my reputation. But I can no longer sit by and not respond. As my complaint shows, my abusers have sought to conceal their guilt behind a curtain of lies. My complaint calls for the accounting to which I, and their other victims, are entitled.”"
Mueller report: Will not be read in full before I start writing.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-cautious-reporting-no-thanks.html,"Don’t Rebuild Notre Dame From media critics to national security reporters to public radio and beyond , a consensus has emerged: News organizations will be committing a disastrous betrayal of the public trust if they are anything less than extraordinarily cautious, deliberate, nuanced, and judicious in their coverage of the partially redacted version of Robert Mueller’s special counsel report, set to be released by the Department of Justice Thursday. The Washington Post’s Margaret Sullivan writes, for example, that the media needs to “resist the temptation” to let pundits “who haven’t read the report become instant, would-be experts on it” and approvingly quotes a scholar who says that the press needs to “put the opinionators to the side for a good long while” after the release; ProPublica’s Eric Umansky promises that his colleagues at the Trump, Inc. podcast will be reading the report in full without access to their phones (!) before emitting any “takes.” These warnings are being made by smart , thoughtful journalists, and they are a well-intentioned response to what may have been premature mediawide credulousness regarding Attorney General William Barr’s tightly hedged summary of Mueller’s findings. Here at Slate, though, we’re making our readers a promise nonetheless: If you want to find out what’s in the Mueller report after it’s released and before the Washington Post and ProPublica have finished their six-hour Talmudic considerations of its motifs and footnotes, you can tune in to our live blog, where we (I) will be posting about its wildest, most sensational, collusion-adjacent, and/or exoneration-tastic sections the very second that we read them and no later. Why the indiscretion? First, Slate is a for-profit business, and we need to be ruthless about exploiting clicks and eyeballs for advertising dollars so we can pay for our lattes, Volvos, and arugula. But also, the release of the Mueller report is going to be a newsworthy and fluid event that, like all such events, can in fact be covered and interpreted both accurately and in real time so long as it’s done with the right amount of transparency and self-awareness about uncertainty. The only pundits you really shouldn’t pay attention to Thursday are those who immediately declare that they know definitively what the report means. (Sullivan sort of acknowledges this, but only while asserting that the media broadly is probably going to do a bad job and that even appropriately hedged real-time report reading isn’t “great journalism.”) The assumption that readers don’t understand that Mueller’s top-line conclusions might take some time to unpack, and that certain elements of the special counsel’s work will ultimately be viewed differently by different political factions, seems like it sells readers a little short. (It’s a cousin of the liberal-Twitter insistence that media outlets need to add “AND HE MIGHT BE LYING, WHICH IS BAD” every time they quote Donald Trump .) The reality is that in the United States on Thursday everyone is going to be extremely interested, for good reason, in finding out about what seem like the most interesting bits and pieces of the Mueller report even before any individual person has finished reading all 400 pages of it. Here at Slate, we aren’t going to pretend otherwise, and we will absolutely let you know what our Ctrl-F search for “pee tape” brings up as soon as we make it."
What Happened to Winter on Game of Thrones ?,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-winter-what-happened-grrm.html,"What’s Fact and What’s Fiction in Fosse/Verdon Episode 2 Winter finally struck Westeros at the end of Game of Thrones ’ sixth season, as Jon Snow returned home to recruit soldiers in the fight against the white walkers, Arya Stark fed Walder Frey his children in meat-pie form, and Cersei Lannister ascended the throne after massacring a sizable fraction of King’s Landing, including her daughter-in-law Margaery Tyrell, which led to the suicide of the blond matriarch’s last living child, Tommen Baratheon. Winter came in many forms in the Season 6 finale: the Night King and his zombie army; the mighty, and long, memory of the Starks (here, revenge is a dish served hot); and as a spreading general misfortune. But in its literal form, the winter that Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon worried about in the first season—the harsh, extra-long cold season that would follow, per the rules of Westeros’ climate, the near-decade of summer they’d just enjoyed—has been all but forgotten by the TV adaptation. It’s a decision that, while perhaps necessary, tops the list of the show’s payoff-less setups and plays into one of the series’ most frustrating aspects. The variable seasons in George R.R. Martin’s books, which can last anywhere from a few months to a few decades, are one of the series’ most novel sources of conflict as well as one of the most concrete ways—other than the dragons, of course—that Westeros differs from our own universe. The long winters were noteworthy enough that numerous critics mentioned them in their initial reviews of the show , and many commentators since have attempted science-based explanations for how such irregular seasons might work, astronomically or ecologically . Martin, for his part, has pooh-poohed such efforts, stating that the reason is magical in origin and that it will eventually be revealed. ( Sure, George. ) But this fascinating feat of imagination now feels like a mere factoid, as insubstantial as the life of Rickon Stark. In the Song of Ice and Fire books, lengthy winters are feared in part for their association with supernatural threats. According to Westerosi legend, the white walkers first appeared 8,000 years before the events of Game of Thrones ,during the Long Night—an icy season so severe it shut out daylight and stretched on for a generation. That’s cool. But unpredictable weather is more interesting as a factor for what it can illustrate about the characters we’re already invested in, and how it might affect the melee for the crown.

Westeros’ changeable climate is a particularly intriguing lens through which to view the strengths and weaknesses of the nobles and pretenders. But years-long winters suggest a theme that Game of Thrones , a series rather obsessed with power-through-violence and too indifferent toward governance, tackles with a lot less finesse than its source material: the responsibility of leaders to their peoples. (Winter could hit the powerful and wealthy hard, but it always hits the common folk harder.) As the lord of a region affected much more harshly by winter, the books’ Ned Stark was preoccupied with preparing for the inevitable cold and famine, especially compared to the ne’er-do-well King Robert Baratheon and his mutually unhappy relations, the Southern-dwelling Lannisters, whose more Mediterranean homeland necessitated less preparation and therefore less concern for their citizenry’s needs. Daenerys’ continent-spanning abolitionist movement is the closest we come to any of the surviving contenders caring about how a ruler should rule, but, as the Season 8 premiere demonstrated, her colonial ambitions and rule-by-fire tactics have her poised perfectly for a fall. In the aftermath of the War of the Five Kings, with the Iron Throne heavily in debt and a grain store probably nowhere where it should be, Cersei’s defeat should be a foregone conclusion. No screen adaptation could rival Martin’s books in their detail and complexity, but as the final season contracts to focus on the boldface winners and losers, it seems increasingly less likely that we’ll get a firm sense of how the next (or current) occupier of the Iron Throne will influence the lives of the masses, who must see even the most necessary wars as calamities they have little to no control over. A stronger grasp of how much each house has stored, and how various lords consider their people’s immediate needs (in the wars against the white walkers, or fellow Westerosi) versus future uncertainties would provide a much-needed grounded-ness to battles that take increasingly in the sky, while developing themes introduced in the first season. (Thus far, Sansa Stark is the only one to raise the issue of what exactly the largest army the world has ever known is supposed to eat.) Instead, we’re left to debate which among the brittle claims to the throne are most legitimate, and witness how military chieftains gather and distribute force. From its title onward, Game of Thrones has made plain its near-exclusive interest in the governors, rather than the governed. But it seems well on its way to miss an opportunity to make us fully understand what a truly great leader, or a terrifying tyrant, would mean for the unseen people who make up most of Westeros."
Even if Democratic Leaders Wanted to “Stop Bernie” … Could They?,slate.com,Jim Newell,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/stop-bernie-sanders-democratic-establishment-campaign-2020.html,"Thanks to Mueller, Democratic Leadership Has a Clear Path to the One Thing It Doesn’t Want Bernie Sanders’ strong early position for the Democratic nomination is giving powerful Democratic players who dislike him all sorts of feelings, none of them good. Sanders’ fundraising prowess and base of support have surfaced what the New York Times this week referred to as the “What to Do About Bernie” question. But the Democrats who don’t want to see him win the pennant—a collection of donors, operatives, and national officials who find Sanders’ politics too far left for their personal taste, and presumably the electorate’s—feel boxed in as to how they should respond. If they do nothing to stop Sanders, then they will have done nothing to stop Sanders. But if they put together some coordinated effort to stop him, then Sanders will channel those efforts into his “anti-establishment” messaging. It’s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t moment for leading anti-Sanders figures. It’s not particularly complicated, though, why they feel so powerless: Essentially, they are. This is something to keep in mind when reading about supposed “establishment” plots to “stop Bernie”—or when Sanders himself is advantageously fundraising off of supposed “establishment” plots to sabotage his candidacy. When I was reporting my recent feature on Sanders’ second run, I asked several current and former aides whether they expected any coordinated anti-Bernie strategy from party leaders, professional Democrats, or Clinton loyalists still seething over Sanders’ 2016 campaign. The typical response was: Yeah, those people exist, but what can they do about it? “I don’t think they’re in a position to move pieces around the chessboard here,” Tad Devine, Sanders’ 2016 chief strategist, told me. (Devine is not working on the current campaign.) “If Bernie Sanders starts winning in Iowa and New Hampshire, and has a bunch of resources, and goes in and wins some of these big states and gets 300 or 400 delegates ahead by mid-March, I don’t think they’re going to stop him, you know?” What, after all, would a coordinated strategy from such a contingent even look like? David Brock, the Clinton loyalist who established a pro-Clinton super PAC in 2016, “has had discussions with other operatives about an anti-Sanders campaign,” according to the Times, and “believes it should commence ‘sooner rather than later.’ ” Other vague references are made to consideration of a “heavy-handed intervention” or “rallying the party’s elite donor class” against him. So are we talking … attack ads? What else? Members of the party’s elite donor class are not afforded magical powers, and David Brock is not, in fact, a wizard. What elites could do is rally their resources around a single alternative to Sanders early in the race—as in, a few months ago. This kind of collective action will be difficult now, with powerful players already split among Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, and anyone else. This is the key difference between now and 2016, when the argument that the “establishment” was working collectively to stop Sanders had more teeth: The power then wasn’t centralized in a disparate set of donors and operatives; it was centralized in Hillary Clinton. As the prohibitivefront-runner entering the race, and with massive early polling leads, Clinton was able to clear the field of mainstream opposition and unite party operatives and officials behind her. Hillary Clinton was the coordinated campaign. By entering the race in such a strong position to win the nomination, she was able to capture much of the race’s oxygen before Sanders could set up a campaign office in Iowa or New Hampshire. Sanders had a limited political outreach department in 2016. Some of this was because of his personality: Sanders loathed meeting privately with local party poobahs ahead of rallies to solicit their support, thinking they should make their decision on the strength of his ideas rather than any private agreement he made with them. But it was also seen as a waste of time, since Clinton had already locked up so many of these officials. This time around, though, the Sanders campaign has built up a much more robust political department to capture the many more free agents still looking to make endorsements. And the officials are much more receptive to Sanders this go around, several sources told me, because they want to get on board with a candidacy that has a viable shot at the nomination and they appreciate his party-building efforts. Even the Democratic National Committee, Sanders’ nemesis from 2016, now has a fine working relationship with him. But just as we shouldn’t take too seriously the reports of a powerful “establishment” primed to flip a switch and thwart Sanders, so should we take Sanders’ claims of a such an effort with a grain of salt. Within hours after the Times’ “Stop Bernie” story came out , the Sanders campaign sent out an email fundraising off of it and against the “Democratic establishment.” This just a couple of days after Sanders wrote a letter to the board of the Center for American Progress to complain about a post and video that the think tank’s blog, Think Progress, had published suggesting Sanders was hypocritical for being a millionaire. While neither the blog nor the video was a sterling achievement in the annals of political journalism, they were also … just a blog and a video. If those are the resources that the “establishment” is marshaling against Sanders, then perhaps the power of that campaign has been overstated. Support our journalism

"I Made Gaybros for Gays Into Guy Stuff. But as We Grew, I Learned That “Stuff” Could Include More Than I Imagined.",slate.com,Alexander De Luca,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/gaybros-reddit-non-scene-gay-male-community.html,"Hurricane Maria Tore at the Fabric of Their Island. Now, Queer Puerto Ricans Are Busy Sewing Something New. You’ve probably heard of the idea of a queer “scene,” perhaps most often from people who don’t care for it. But what, exactly, is this scene? Who’s a part of it? Who isn’t? Who decides? Is there more than one? What happens when a scene evolves—or when it doesn’t? These are the questions we’ve gathered a group of writers to consider for an Outward special issue on “The Scene” in LGBTQ life today. You can read all of the stories in the issue here , and you can listen to a full episode of the Outward podcast covering more of the queer scene by subscribing on iTunes , Spotify , or wherever you get your audio . At the age of 21, I deleted every show tune off my iPod Video and disciplined my wavy hair into an almost-military buzzcut. Now, I decided, I was really into trucks and hockey. Previously a too-fastidious Alex, I made people call me Al. I turned my nose up at pop culture, fashion, or anything associated with the gay scene—or at least what I perceived the gay scene to be. At the time, I undertook this overhaul because that stuff, with all its flash and pretense, had come to annoy me; in today’s slang, I would have called it all incredibly “basic.” So I left that basic shit behind and went on with my life as a newly non-basic, overtly masculine gay man. Fast-forward two years. The lights were dim. I found myself descending to the lower level of a Fenway Park bar, hands cold and clammy with nerves, the music loud. I was hosting the first meet-up for Gaybros, a Reddit community I had founded months prior. I created Gaybros in early 2012 in response to what I saw as a lack of gay-friendly spaces online for men who liked “guy stuff.” Guy stuff, as our description explained, was sports, military issues, video games, camping, activities that left your hands dirty and were usually accompanied with country music. Our slogan was “gear, grub, guns, and guys,” and the banner image was a football field. It was consciously an anti-scene scene and took pride in that approach. It was also shockingly popular. Taking off the letterman jacket I had bought for the occasion, I scanned the room for anyone I thought might be present for the meetup. In the far corner I saw a group of frat-types playing pool sporting snapbacks, tank tops, and biceps the size of my head. They fit the bill, yet upon spotting them I was filled with terror. Despite naming the community Gaybros, despite deleting all my show tunes, despite disowning the gay scene and making people call me Al, when the possibility of leading a bar crawl for bros became a reality, I was suddenly sure I didn’t have the charisma or confidence. That they would know I was a fraud. Thankfully, they weren’t the bros I was looking for, so I took a breath and got myself an on-brand drink—whiskey. As I waited for the strangers to arrive, I tried to convince myself that the nerves were normal, that not being 100 percent rock-solid confident didn’t threaten the identity I had created for myself. It was, after all, my second go at it. I began work on my first version of gayness when I was 12 years old. Right after I came out to my parents, I jumped into playing the part I thought I had been assigned. Drama club, regional theater, Wicked , Abercrombie & Fitch. If I was going to be gay, I figured the campy scene was my destiny, and as far as I knew I had no choice in the matter. Might as well get good at it. But like I would feel years later, waiting at that bar to introduce myself as “Al,” I could never shake the sense I was playing a part that wasn’t quite right. It didn’t feel fake, just somehow incomplete, and therefore inauthentic. As users from Gaybros started to arrive, my nerves settled a bit, and I was surprised (and relieved) at how normal and kind they were. A graphic artist with a cartoon obsession. A socially awkward engineer. A junior salesman who could recite passages from Lord of the Rings from memory. They weren’t part of the scene, as I understood it, but they also weren’t hyper-masculine jerks. The occupied a safe and friendly middle ground I hadn’t been sure existed. I let myself breathe. After awkward introductions and a few drinks, the nerves subsided, and we all departed as fast friends. As the years progressed, I continued hosting Gaybros meetups at home in Boston and in cities across the country. Every time, I found a similarly diverse, welcoming crowd as that first night. I could never shake the sense that I was playing a part that wasn’t quite right. The community continued to grow, and the disparity between its branding and actual users became increasingly obvious, and so the messaging of the group began to shift. We dropped the “gear, grub, guns, and guys” tagline. We relaxed the rules on what could be posted. We more actively defended a “come as you are” atmosphere. Not one of these decisions was truly mine, but rather reactions to the desires of a diverse community. As Gaybros evolved and its members asserted a more fluid definition of the space, I began to realize that much like Gaybros, I didn’t need such a strict definition for my own identity. Just like the users who posted every day, I could like show tunes AND sports. I could watch Cops AND RuPaul’s Drag Race . What may seem like an incredibly simple revelation actually felt quite profound. More than anything, it felt freeing. As a young gay man, I was so invested in finding a way to feel pride in my identity that I had assumed identity must be some fixed, unchanging absolute. When one version didn’t fit the bill, I tried another, and another, ad nauseam. It wasn’t until Gaybros came along, until I got to engage with this wide array of guys online and at meetups, that I appreciated identity itself, like sexuality, is fluid. It was the positive evolution of Gaybros as a community that allowed me to accept myself as a gay man who need not be all theater or sports, not all butch or femme, not all one thing or another. And ultimately, the journey toward self-acceptance lead me to realize that perhaps my understanding of the gay community was flawed from the beginning, born of insecurities that “Al” was created to extinguish. Now that Al has settled into Alex, I understand the value in embracing a diverse set of gay perspectives, interests, and experiences, both in others and myself. These days, the “stuff” this guy is into varies widely, but all of it feels authentic. I’m finally at home—with my bros, yeah, but more importantly, in my own skin. "
"A Jock With Glasses Is Not a Geek, but Gay Culture Sure Is Trying to Make It So",slate.com,Zack Ford,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/gay-geek-jock-culture-assimilation-scene.html,"Seeking and Finding the Queer Scene You’ve probably heard of the idea of a queer “scene,” perhaps most often from people who don’t care for it. But what, exactly, is this scene? Who’s a part of it? Who isn’t? Who decides? Is there more than one? What happens when a scene evolves—or when it doesn’t? These are the questions we’ve gathered a group of writers to consider for an Outward special issue on “The Scene” in LGBTQ life today. You can read all of the stories in the issue here , and you can listen to a full episode of the Outward podcast covering more of the queer scene by subscribing on iTunes , Spotify , or wherever you get your audio . I’ve been a geek as long as I can remember, certainly as far back as fourth grade, when I’d regularly wear the Star Trek: The Next Generation T-shirt I’d picked up at a convention. This aspect of my identity has meant having a deep (if not obsessive) appreciation for aspects of culture that are nuanced, complicated, high-minded, and importantly, not caring how anyone else feels about it. For example, I refused to read Harry Potter —for years—just to spite my friends who said it was “so much better” than “boring” The Lord of the Rings , even though they had only made it halfway through The Fellowship of the Ring . Popularity could not sway me from what I personally enjoyed. So when I first came out as gay, it was easy to embrace my new identity because of the experiences I’d already had as a geek. In a sense, both involve rebuffing the expectations of society and taking pride in what made me me , regardless of what anyone else thought. But socially, there were big differences. Connecting with friends who share your geeky affinities is relatively easy, but finding community among other gay men has proved to be more of a Water Temple–level task . Comparing the gay community to a stereotypical high school’s clique culture is unoriginal, but apt. Social capital is valuable and similarly earned by being attractive, cool, and “popular.” As I figured out how being gay intersected with the rest of my life, I immediately felt that participating in “the scene”—here meaning social clubs or bars—came with certain expectations about how I should look, what I should prioritize in my life, and what I should take an interest in. It was like there was a direct contradiction between what it meant to be a proud non-conforming geek and what it would take to be a proudly conforming gay man. As the dating apps came about, however, I noticed that they universally provided an option to self-identify as a “geek,” and I wondered if it was becoming increasingly possible to have the best of both worlds. But that’s not what happened. When the Borg assimilate an individual, they retain any attributes that would add value to the Collective and replace all other parts with cybernetic adaptations. As the traditional lodestars of geekdom (like fantasy, sci-fi, and video games) have achieved more mainstream appeal with the advent of superhero blockbusters and binge-able prestige television, I’ve watched the gay community process the “geek” identity in much the same way, incorporating certain aspects into the calculus for how to achieve gay social capital while dismissing the rest. I’m now left feeling like the word “geek” just means “a jock with glasses”—and I’ve only got the glasses. There was a somewhat recent milestone that demarcated the progress of this assimilation for me. In the first week of September 2016, many of the gay blogs were tittering about a new Men.com porn film called “Fuckémon Go.” With stars Johnny Rapid as Ash and Will Braun as Brock, the film capitalized on the popularity of the Pokémon Go app with campy fanfare. What struck me, however, is that unlike the rest of the site’s musclebound superhero-themed films, this particular parody took something I personally considered purely geeky and sexualized it with stereotypically twinkish, fit bodies. My takeaway: Geeks are welcome in a mainstream gay fantasy space like Men.com so long as they’re hot enough to turn a profit. As someone who also identifies with the “bear” tribe (and not the similarly appropriated muscle- and daddy- varieties), it’s been hard not to see body image superficiality as the main gravitational force at the center of almost all gay scenes. Particularly as apps increasingly dominate our social interactions, what I have to offer in terms of personality, hobbies, or sense of humor takes a back seat to whether or not I measure up aesthetically. This has left me feeling betrayed by those who check the “geek” box on their profiles—and who maybe even list some geeky interests that catch my eye—then refuse to engage whatsoever. Are you really a geek if you’d let a person’s looks get in the way of connecting with someone who shares your niche interests? But even among people I already know, engagement doesn’t always meet my expectations. I remember one brunch a few years ago with a group of gay men who I believed shared at least some of my geeky affinities. Not knowing all of them well, I tried to engage on topics I thought would serve up some stimulating dialogue. The brunch, however, ended up being dominated by discussion about the gym, including but not limited to: workout preferences, stories about other men they’d seen at the gym, and encounters flirting with men at the gym. It was a topic I had little interest in and little to contribute to. Finding community among other gay men has proved to be more of a Water Temple-level task.” I left the brunch feeling ostracized, like the admission price to communing even with fellow gay geeks was buying into an obsession with improving my body and feeding into others’ same concerns. But whatever other people think of my body, I’m not insecure about it, I don’t enjoy exercise, and I know—from trying—that forcing myself into that world was not a positive experience. I’m a geek: I want to like the things I like and not worry about conforming to everyone else’s expectations. I’m not here to demand anyone take up my geeky passions, but I don’t feel like the same respect is reciprocated when it comes to my disinterest in fitness. That’s not to say I haven’t found occasional opportunities for my gay and geek identities to intersect. Groups like Geeks OUT create great little social meetups, and D.C.’s newest gay sports bar is equipped with some video game consoles. These inconsistently available experiences, however, still pale in comparison to what feels like the weekly takeover of the bars by the kickball teams. In high school, the jocks might have picked on us gays, but as gay adults, we’ve re-created the exact same social structure for ourselves. Another entry point to the stereotypical scene I’ve found has been watching RuPaul’s Drag Race out at bars with friends. They might not admit it, but many people have a geek-like obsession when it comes to following their favorite queens, and discussing who should win the current season is a great icebreaker. The kink and leather community has also felt far more geek-friendly, which is not surprising given the similar investment many people make in that aspect of their lives (not to mention the taboo it still faces in society). But I don’t love drag or leather nearly as much as others do, so I’m still on the hunt for my gaggle. To be sure, as a cisgender, white gay man, I know that my request for “the scene” to be more welcoming of geeks is small potatoes compared to some of the other work the queer community must undertake in terms of inclusion, particularly around race, gender, and gender identity. But with so many gay men already identifying as “geeks,” it seems like there’s an easy opportunity for the community to mature beyond the high school cafeteria and show that it’s capable of becoming a bit more heterogeneous without losing its distinct queer identity. A great place to start would be on the apps, which are increasingly serving as a substitute for the bars and community centers where the queer community traditionally communed. Don’t be afraid to let your geek flag fly in your profile! And if you see someone with some similar interests, why not throw a fellow geek a bone? For example, you could ask me about my favorite captain, Doctor, or Final Fantasy , come to a live West Wing Weekly taping with me, or help me theory-craft my next Path of Exile character build. It’s fine if we’re not a sexual match. There’s still something joyous about finding someone who’s as obsessed with a certain fantasy universe as you are. And if we start building more social bridges that way, maybe someday we’ll be the ones taking over “the scene” in our brightly colored Stonewall Board Games or Stonewall Smash Bros . T-shirts. I happen to think there’s room for all of us. Can I get a “so say we all” up in here?"

Allow Me to Help. Forget what you heard. Herman Cain isn’t bowing out of the Fed race after all. In an interview published Wednesday, the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO and one-time presidential candidate told the Wall Street Journal that, contrary to some news reports, he is not planning to pull himself out of the running for a seat at the Federal Reserve, even though he appears to lack enough support to be confirmed by Congress. Donald Trump announced earlier this month that he intended to nominate Cain, a political ally with little relevant monetary policy experience, for one of the two open spots on the central bank’s seven-member Board of Governors. Economists collectively wretched at the decision. And, somewhat surprisingly, so have a number of Senate Republicans, four of whom have said they would not vote for Cain if he is officially nominated. Some have cited the sexual harassment allegations that sank Cain’s presidential bid in 2012. Others, like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, have pretty much written him off as an unqualified partisan. But whatever the reasons, Cain currently doesn’t have enough votes to make it through Congress without Democratic support, which probably isn’t forthcoming. Last week ABC News reported that Cain would withdraw himself from consideration. But on Tuesday , Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggested that might not happen. “At the end of the day, it will probably be up to Herman Cain if he wants to stay in that process or not,” Mr. Kudlow told reporters Tuesday. “As far as we are concerned, he is still in the process and it is proceeding.” Kudlow added that while Trump was still interested in Cain, the White House was talking to “a number of candidates” for the Fed. Now, Cain says he isn’t going anywhere. Per the WSJ:
“What Kudlow was doing was giving me an out, and I appreciate that, but I don’t want an out. I don’t want an out,” Mr. Cain said, adding that he doesn’t think the White House is getting cold feet about his potential nomination.
“You know that the president is a fighter, and Kudlow is a fighter. They might be getting a lot of blowback from some folks, I don’t know. But I don’t think they’re getting uncomfortable with it.” To be honest, I don’t know what to make of any of this. I mean, maybe Donald Trump ends up nominating a former pizza executive who’s been accused of being a serial sexual harasser to the single most powerful economic institution in the world and just dares Republicans to actually vote the guy down. Or maybe not. But hey, at least it’s more entertaining that your typical Fed nomination process, which tends to be dry as an econometrics textbook. This saga is a good time. Everyone’s having fun?

Police memes won’t improve trust.,slate.com,April Glaser,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/police-memes-law-enforcement-trust-social-media.html,"Future Tense Newsletter: A Theory of Conspiracy The rents in the Bay Area are among the highest in the nation—in Oakland, the median rent for a one-bedroom is $2,320 a month. Which is probably why the California Highway Patrol thought this tweet would be funny: Breaking News❗️The only thing 🆓 about disregarding the safety of yourself or others on our roadways is a 🆓 ride from us to this rent-🆓 location✅ #Facts #StayWoke #WedontplaywithDUI #ForYourSafety #DontBecomeaAStatistic #FreeRentInTheBayArea pic.twitter.com/zngxJd2bpj — CHP Oakland (@CHPoakland) December 30, 2018 Maybe some people laughed, but I doubt it dissuaded anyone from driving under the influence. Police use social media to send announcements of road closures, to issue reports of missing persons, to post photos of people they arrest or are looking for in relation to a crime. But law enforcement agencies also turn to social media for the same lighter fare so many of us seek on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter: memes, viral videos, cute dog photos, and ironic jokes about drugs. It’s a form of community engagement. “One way of bolstering your following and connecting with the community is through the occasional use of humor, when appropriate,” says Jaime Coffee, a public information officer with the California Highway Patrol, who noted that some of their humor on social media has made it into local news reports, boosting the visibility of their accounts. Last year, police departments across the country took part in an online lip-syncing challenge. Videos of cops in Norfolk, Virginia , singing Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’ “Uptown Funk” and officers in San Francisco doing a rendition of “Lights” by Journey, for example, went viral, garnering hundreds of thousands of views. Community engagement and showing the human side of officers is a reasonable pursuit. But posts like the one by the California Highway Patrol joking about jail and gentrification in Oakland don’t always come off as funny as intended. “There’s nothing inherently wrong with a cute cop,” John Crew, a retired police practices specialist for the American Civil Liberties Union told me in an interview. “I think the reason you’re seeing attempts at social media across the country is that police agencies and the policing profession are aware that they’ve got a problem.” Part of that problem is trust: Only 44 percent of adults under the age of 35 have a great deal of confidence in the police, according to the most recent Gallup poll . But witty social media is unlikely to fix that problem, Crew says. “If they think the problem is how they’re perceived, then they think the response is to project a better image and not ‘We need more police accountability’ or ‘We have an implicit bias problem.’ They think they’re just not understood.” But if police fear they’re misunderstood, officers may not understand the communities they’re policing either. “Please help! My name is 10 Pounds of Weed. I am lost and looking for my owner. I was sent to the wrong address yesterday in Columbus and now the police have me locked up in the evidence room. Please get me out of here soon, you will need your ID. Thanks a bunch,” reads a tweet last year from the Columbus, Indiana, Police Department. Hilarious … except nearly 6 percent of all arrests in the United States in 2017 were based on possession of marijuana. In Indiana alone in 2016 more than 10,000 people were arrested for marijuana possession and sales, according to FBI data. There’s nothing funny about being arrested, which could lead to jail, legal fees, or time away from work and family, all for possessing a substance that’s legal in 10 states. Lawrence, Kansas, police took a similar approach the year before with this tweet: S anyone know where the marijuana and ecstasy tablet parties are this weekend? Asking for a friend. Trust us, we're hip. — Lawrence Police (@LawrenceKS_PD) March 3, 2017 More recently, a viral Facebook photo of two Mineral Wells, Texas, police officers eating doughnuts in a field of waist-high flowers was shared more than 132,000 times. The caption reads, “Felt cute might arrest someone later idk.” The comments section on the photo morphed into a mini-contest in wry anti-police sentiment. “Felt cute, might racially profile later,” said one person. Another wrote, “Felt cute, might ruin someone’s life for possession of a plant later.” Though most of the top comments appear to be antagonistic toward the police, the post that got the most reactions—more than 8,000—was from the police department in Anchorage, Alaska, asking where the Texas cops got their doughnuts. It’s like what fast food Twitter accounts do , only instead of jokes about unhealthy food, cops are laughing about their power to put someone in jail. Sometimes police department social media use can seriously backfire. Beyond coming off as tone-deaf, sometimes police department social media use can seriously backfire. In 2017, a trio of police officers in Gainesville, Florida, posted a selfie of themselves working on Hurricane Irma relief efforts. Commenters noticed that the officers were attractive, and the post went viral-viral—the Washington Post even wrote about the #HotCops. But it only took a few days for an online sleuth to unearth anti-Semitic Facebook posts by one of the officers in the photo, after which he was suspended. (Notably, one of the police pictured, Daniel Rengering, had better luck after his social media spotlight. He’s gone on to become a cover model for romance novels and was on Survivor: David vs. Goliath in the fall.) But there are times when law enforcement social media accounts use their online mouthpieces for good—like to invite community feedback and accountability efforts. The San Francisco Police Department, for example, regularly tweets about “office hours” it holds around the city where the community is invited to share concerns, and it shares links to “know your rights” brochures. But the same SFPD account posts mug shots of arrested suspects who may eventually be found not guilty or have their charges dropped. Similarly, the Berkeley Police Department decided to post the names and faces of anti-fascist demonstrators last year after they were arrested, which compromised their privacy and put them in danger of harassment from far-right activists. “Police used to put this information out for reporters, so they’d say, ‘What’s the difference [with social media]?’ ” says Lauri Stevens, who organizes the Social Media, the Internet and Law Enforcement, or SMILE, conference, a regular training event for police departments looking to improve their use of social media. “But when you put it out on Facebook, it’s a bigger deal. People’s reputation can be damaged a lot faster and a lot harder.” One tweet from the Illinois State Police last month included a photo with an array of different types of handcuffs. “We love jewelry. We carry it with us. We even let you wear it when we give you a free ride to jail,” it read, along with the awkward hashtags #BraceletsAreOurFavorite, #SharingIsCaring, and #SoManyChoices. The cops are probably trying to come off as funny. It’s not working. "
North Korea says it just conducted a weapons test. Is this the end of Trump-Kim love-a-thon?,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/north-korea-conducts-weapons-test-trump-kim-summit-nuclear-talks.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump North Korea test-fired a new tactical guided weapon, the country’s state-run media outlet announced Thursday (local time), the latest sign of a tactical chill in the love-a-thon President Trump has been touting between the two leaders. Specifics on the exact type of weapon and the nature of the launch remain unclear, but the Washington Post reports that experts believe the early descriptions of the test make it unlikely it was a ballistic missile, which would be an explicit violation of Pyongyang’s self-declared moratorium on testing, and a substantial setback to whatever peace plan President Trump hopes to muster. North Korean state media said Kim Jong-un himself oversaw the launch, which he described as “an event of very weighty significance.” The recent breakdown of denuclearization talks and Kim’s direct involvement in the test heaped strategic symbolism on the event. Experts were cautious to read too far into North Korea’s intentions, but believed the test to be a show of growing military strength as form of negotiating tactic, without crossing the self-imposed ballistic missile red line. In a speech last week, Kim showed frustration with the tenor of recent peace talks with the U.S. and while he said he was prepared to participate in a third summit with Trump, he cautioned he would do so only if the U.S. changed its approach. Pyongyang’s latest launch is its first public test since February talks in Hanoi broke down. While it is surely a negotiating tactic aimed at focusing the mind in Washington, the escalation threatens one of President Trump’s favorite talking points—progress, real or imagined, with North Korea. In fact, Trump’s political reliance on the North Korea détente has grown such that it could diminish his hand at the negotiating table as the personal price of walking away increases. Is Trump already in too deep? Just earlier this week, days before the test, Trump was touting his relationship with Kim and progress with North Korea as kind of a big deal: Full Trump comments on North Korea, from his event in Minnesota today: pic.twitter.com/WrEpGN7ESm — William Gallo (@GalloVOA) April 15, 2019 Maybe let’s pump the breaks on the Nobel Peace Prize daydreams, look a little less personally needy, and hold our cards a bit closer to our chest.

Meghan and Harry’s Decision Not to Dangle Their Newborn Before the Press Is the Natural Next Step in Their Self-Branding,slate.com,Ruth Graham,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/meghan-harry-baby-royals-social-media-instagram.html,"Chill Out, Pete Davidson. No One’s Shaming You for Dating Kate Beckinsale. When someone’s entire function is ceremonial, it can take on big significance if they change up even a small part of that ceremony. And so we turn our gaze to England, where the tabloid press is currently losing its collective mind over the fact that the next royal baby will not be dangled triumphantly in front of hordes of photographers. The trouble started last week, when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex—Harry and Meghan, that is— issued a statement through Buckingham Palace announcing that they “have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.” The couple’s first baby is due sometime this spring, although they have not announced a due date. Their statement said they will share the news of the baby’s arrival publicly “once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.” Presumably, the photos will appear on the couple’s new Instagram feed , which recently referred to “Baby Sussex” for the first time . Blimey! As the British press was quick to point out, this change violates a tradition going back a generation. Yes, just one—Princess Diana started it, and Kate and William have kept it up—but still. The tabloids have grown accustomed to waiting outside the London hospital for the royal parents to make an appearance after the baby’s birth. The gussied-up family poses gamely for a few minutes so photographers can get their first shots of the new baby, and then the family escapes to a palace. Harry and Meghan are skipping the scrum and releasing news and photos on their own time. The Sun slammed the couple for “ keeping the nation in the dark ,” while a columnist for the Daily Mail called it “ just a little rude to smother this wonderful moment in a layer of exclusion and exclusivity.” They’re borrowing from the modern playbook of international—and particularly American—celebrities, for whom participating in traditional journalism feels increasingly unnecessary. The New York Times calls the ritual “silly,” but it does serve a certain purpose. It’s understandable that taxpayers who support them expect a peek at the next generation. The hospital display gives the tabloids a bit of chum to satisfy them while the family proceeds to nest privately with their newborn. It is a routine so simple and rigid that the slightest variations can be dissected for meaning: Kate’s visible postpartum belly (“ brave ”); her second baby’s backwards bonnet (“ the newborn has unfortunately already made a sartorial slip-up ”); a red, lace-collared dress reminiscent of her mother-in-law (and of Mia Farrow in Rosemary’s Baby , whoopsy!). The royal family’s only real output is their own image, and they have been drifting toward seizing the means of production for years. The 2015 birth of William and Kate’s daughter, Charlotte, was first announced on Twitter , although the announcement also appeared on the traditional easel outside Buckingham Palace. Kate took the first official photographs of her daughter, rather than hiring a photographer. That didn’t take power away from the voracious British tabloids, however. Her photographs were still distributed through the usual official channels, and portrait photography doesn’t compete with the paparazzi anyway. Harry and Meghan are doing something different, at least on this occasion: shutting out the press in favor of their own social media accounts, which they can control completely. In other words, they’re borrowing from the modern playbook of normal international—and perhaps particularly American—celebrities, for whom participating in traditional journalism feels increasingly unnecessary. Promotion cycles are changing, with albums dropping as overnight surprises instead of being rolled out with months of advance publicity. And above all, social media has given celebrities unprecedented control over their own images—and forced media outlets to play nice if they want any special access at all. Why pose for someone else’s camera when you could take your own photos and distribute only the ones you choose on Instagram? Why speak with a journalist, who will pluck out juicy and surprising and unflattering quotes, if the magazine will publish a gentler, more comfortable “conversation” with a fellow celebrity ? “If the less fun part of an actor’s job is the part where they have to help sell a piece of work or product,” Vanity Fair wrote of the celeb-on-celeb format last year, “at least they can do it with someone they have a relationship with, who won’t push them on harder questions or ask them things they’re sensitive about.” At the highest rung of fame, the celebrity need not speak at all. In 2015, Beyoncé appeared on the cover of Vogue without granting the magazine an interview ; last September, the magazine apparently granted her complete creative control of her cover shoot—and she still didn’t speak with a journalist. The smile-and-wave in front of the hospital in London is not worth mourning for its own sake. Here’s the extent of what we’ll miss: Meghan and Harry’s baby will have a cute scrunched-up little face, and his or her mother’s hair will look great. As a symbol of the royals’ retreat from any kind of direct tabloid scrutiny, however, it’s arguably kind of a loss. Tabloids can be rude and invasive and even false ; the British tabloids are particularly notorious for their rapaciousness. But they’re also irreverent and curious and reader-serving, and a celebrity’s approach to them is often a sign of their responsiveness to press and the public more broadly. No one would begrudge Harry and Meghan some protectiveness over their first few hours of parenthood. But if they manage to keep cutting out the tabloids, don’t be surprised if the ever-more-curated images we’re left with turn out to be just plain dull."
Mueller Report live analysis: William Barr checks in for a second time.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-live-analysis-barr-press-conference.html,"We’ll be covering everything about the Mueller report, pre- and post-release, on this page, so keep checking in throughout the day (and maybe throughout the night) for updates, insights, and sensationalist exclamations . Update, 12:45 p.m.: Here’s a fun one. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told investigators she lied to the press after Comey firing pic.twitter.com/JNN9ObzKFd — Dorey Scheimer (@DoreyScheimer) April 18, 2019 Update, 12:25 p.m.: Mueller’s reasoning for not prosecuting the June 9 meeting (at which Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner sought to accept “dirt” on Hillary and discussed sanctions with Russian figures) as a violation of campaign-finance laws against accepting foreign assistance is that 1) it’s not legally clear whether “dirt” is a “thing of value” that campaigns are forbidden accepting, and 2) Trump’s advisers didn’t know that accepting foreign assistance was a bad thing. The relevant quote: “On the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful. The investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar with the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual context.” Update, 12:05 p.m.: Pee tape reference! Unfortunately, it’s to say that someone told them that the pee tape was not real. “Comey’s briefing included the Steele reporting’s unverified allegation that the Russians had compromising tapes of the President involving conduct when he was a private citizen during a 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe Pageant. During the 2016 presidential campaign, a similar claim may have reached candidate Trump. On October 30, 2016, Michael Cohen received a text from Russian businessman Giorgi Rtskhiladze that said, ‘Stopped flow of tapes from Russia but not sure if there’s anything else. Just so you know …. ’ 10/30/16 Text Message , Rtskhiladze to Cohen. Rtskhiladze said ‘tapes’ referred to compromising tapes of Trump rumored to be held by persons associated with the Russian real estate conglomerate Crocus Group, which had helped host the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant in Russia . Rtskhiladze 4/4/ l 8 302 , at 12. Cohen said he spoke to Trump about the issue after receiving the texts from Rtskhiladze. Cohen 9/ 12/ 18 302, at 13. Rtskhiladz e said he was told the tapes were fake, but he did not communicate that to Cohen . Rtskhiladze 5/ l 0/ 18 302, at 7.” Update, 12:00 p.m.: This seems to be the nut of it, from page 5 of the first volume of the report (the second volume is about obstruction): “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” So, basically, a quid and a quo but not a pro. As to why Mueller decided that the the presidential transition team’s friendly outreach to Russia about sanctions—an issue that campaign figures had previously learned was an issue of concern to the Russian government—didn’t constitute participation in Russia’s election-interference scheme … I haven’t really figured that out! Update, 11:55 a.m.: A lot to process here! First observation: The report indeed documents previously known instances in which Trump figures expressed interest in Russian assistance (e.g., the June 9 Trump Tower meeting), and it documents instances in which the campaign (via Paul Manafort) and presidential transition team (via Michael Flynn) discussed Russia-friendly policies with Russian-government-linked individuals. But it concludes that such activities were not illegal “coordination” or “conspiracy.” Here’s the wording of one summary: “In sum, the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign. In some instances , the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away. Ultimately , the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.” Update, 11:05 a.m.: It’s alive! Click here to see THE MUELLER REPORT at last. Update, 10:40 a.m.: New York magazine’s Eric Levitz makes another good point regarding Barr’s argument that Trump’s hostility to the Mueller investigation was justified. As Levitz points out, Trump wasn’t just angry about Mueller’s investigation because of “collusion” allegations, but because Trump didn’t believe Russia was even responsible for hacking the Democratic Party in the first place. Which, of course, is something that Mueller ended up confirming. So Barr is arguing that Trump was justified in attacking the legitimacy of Mueller’s investigation even though one of Trump’s central objections to it turned out to be wrong. Update, 10:15 a.m.: It appears that Even Fox News (TM) found Barr’s defense of the president to be a bit much. Chris Wallace on Fox: ""The Attorney General seemed almost to be acting as the counselor for the defense, the counselor for the president, rather than the Attorney General, talking about his motives, his emotions... Really, as I say, making a case for the president."" — Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) April 18, 2019 Update, 10:05 a.m.: LOL. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2019 Nice coordinated meme rollout between the president and the nation’s chief law-enforcement officer, there. Update, 10:00 a.m.: Barr just made a fairly lengthy argument that anything Trump might have done to obstruct Mueller’s investigation was OK because he knew that he hadn’t committed any “collusion.” Update, 9:40 a.m.: Barr is just repeating everything he said in his March letter , except at a lectern.

William Barr press conference: The news media were “relentless.”,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-press-conference-news-media.html,"This One Question Always Trips Up Pro-Choice Politicians. Allow Me to Help. For the most part, Attorney General William Barr’s press conference about the Mueller report (to be released after 11 a.m.) echoed his earlier written summary, with a few more opportunities to reiterate his view that there was no “collusion.” But toward the end of his address, his comments swerved into a rather bizarre and brazen defense of President Donald Trump’s mental state—a line of comments that seemed to bolster the argument that Barr was and is acting as Trump’s attorney, rather than as a representative of the American people. In particular, one strange Trump-like argument toward the end of the address had to do with one of the president’s favorite punching bags: the media (emphasis ours).
In assessing the president’s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation, as he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president’s personal culpability, yet as he said from the beginning, there was, in fact, no collusion. As the special counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by his sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks. This argument—that the “evidence” of the president’s emotional state is relevant to explaining his innocence or at least defending any of his obstruction-adjacent actions—is a remarkable one for an attorney general to make when releasing the results of an independent special counsel investigation. We may not have learned much from this press conference at a factual level, but we definitely got further insight into how Barr and the DOJ sort out their interests, allies, and opposition.

William Barr's press conference on the Mueller report was propaganda.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/william-barr-robert-mueller-report-address.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About James Comey’s Firing Observers of the Justice Department will spend the rest of our lives talking about Attorney General William Barr’s jaw-dropping and horrifically inappropriate address on Thursday morning, which attempted to spin special counsel Robert Mueller’s report in Donald Trump’s favor—before the public has seen it. In just a few minutes, Barr managed to throw Mueller under the bus, mount a Fox News–style defense of Trump, and further obscure his dubious decision to absolve the president of obstruction of justice. It is hard to convey just how appalling Barr’s performance was, and it will take a while to assess the extent of the damage Barr just inflicted on the Department of Justice and the office of the attorney general. But let me take a first crack: This was Pravda-style propaganda, pure and simple, a grotesque display of spineless fealty to the president, and a confirmation that Barr views the Mueller investigation as fundamentally illegitimate. The first half of Barr’s address was essentially a reiteration of his earlier summary of Mueller’s report, which the attorney general helpfully summed up in Trump’s two favorite words: no collusion. Mueller, Barr explained, found that the Russian government did unlawfully attempt to influence the 2016 election; both Russian military officials and the Internet Research Agency , a troll farm affiliated with the Russian government, meddled in the race. But the special counsel “found no evidence that any Americans—including anyone associated with the Trump campaign—conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in carrying out this illegal scheme.” We do not yet know if Barr used this oddly narrow language to conceal attempts by the Trump campaign to collude with Russian agents, or to disseminate stolen material ; to obscure possible coordination with Russian nationals not formally connected to the Russian government; or to obfuscate an extremely cramped definition of conspiracy and collusion. The report itself should help us understand just how candid or dishonest, this segment of Barr’s address was. And hopefully, Barr did not redact portions of the report that might clear up any sleights of hand the attorney general may have performed to gloss over legally troubling conduct by the president and his associates. What we doknow is that the president’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, spoke with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak the same day that President Barack Obama issued retaliatory measures in response to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. And that Mueller later prosecuted Flynn for lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russian officials . And that Flynn pleaded guilty to this felony charge and cooperated with the probe. And then Trump asked then–FBI Director James Comey to end the investigation into Flynn. We also know that Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations committed in an effort to cover up Trump’s extramarital affair—a crime allegedly committed at the president’s direction, and one that was prosecuted by the Southern District of New York after the special counsel’s office provided it with information about Cohen. And we know that Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Organization’s attempts to build a new property in Moscow during the presidential campaign. Cohen, in fact, admitted to this crime as part of a plea deal with Mueller. This information is important to keep in mind when considering the second half of Barr’s address, pertaining to obstruction of justice. Barr once again reiterated that he does not believe in Mueller’s legal theory of obstruction. He didn’t elaborate, but his views here are well-known: Barr believes obstruction of an investigation cannot be committed unless there is an underlying crime ( which is wrong ) and that the president cannot commit obstruction by exercising his executive powers, even if done with a corrupt motive ( which is dubious ). But leave that aside for now. What’s truly astonishing is that after briefly attempting to exculpate Trump of obstruction, Barr launched into a vigorous and gratuitous defense of the president’s highly unusual and suspect behavior throughout the probe:
In assessing the President’s actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context. President Trump faced an unprecedented situation. As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President’s personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion. And as the Special Counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation. Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation. Barr’s message here is simple: Trump is the real victim. The victim of the media and leaks. The victim of excess scrutiny and oversight. The victim of what Barr appears to believe was an overly intrusive investigation conducted by overzealous “federal agents and prosecutors.” All of Trump’s lying, his interference, his efforts to publicly discredit the probe, his public assault on Mueller—all of it is excusable, Barr implied, because the probe found “no collusion.” Indeed, Barr writes off Trump’s campaign against the investigation as a perfectly understandable effort to maintain his innocence. His acts were not obstructionary; they were noble. That’s not legal analysis, since righteous anger is not an actual defense against obstruction. It’s political spin. It’s propaganda. It’s running interference for the president who appointed Barr to do precisely this —to exonerate him in public before Americans can read Mueller’s report. It was a galling performance for an audience of one, the president. And Trump must be pleased. In fact, the moment the presser ended, the president posted a Game of Thrones –themed tweet telling the “haters and the radical left Democrats” that it was “Game Over.” Barr’s performance and Trump’s tweet seemed almost coordinated. It is an extraordinary embarrassment for DOJ. The attorney general did what Trump hired him to do. In the process, he has disgraced his office in ways we are only beginning to understand. Barr joined the DOJ too late to quash the investigation. But he is doing his best to shield the Trump from its findings. Thursday morning will be remembered as one of the most shameful chapters in the history of the Department of Justice. Support our journalism

Four loopholes Barr used to protect Trump.,slate.com,William Saletan,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/barr-press-conference-mueller-report-loopholes-protect-trump.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About James Comey’s Firing On Thursday morning, Attorney General William Barr announced the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation. In his press conference , Barr extended his role as President Donald Trump’s protector. Following the strategy of his March 24 letter on the Mueller report, Barr constructed loopholes to insulate Trump from charges of collusion and obstruction. Here are four of them. 1. “Illegally participated.” Barr made the following statement:
The special counsel’s investigation also examined Russian efforts to publish stolen emails and documents on the internet. The Special Counsel found that, after the GRU disseminated some of the stolen materials through its own controlled entities, DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the GRU transferred some of the stolen materials to Wikileaks for publication. Wikileaks then made a series of document dumps. The special counsel also investigated whether any member or affiliate of the Trump campaign encouraged or otherwise played a role in these dissemination efforts. Under applicable law, publication of these types of materials would not be criminal unless the publisher also participated in the underlying hacking conspiracy. Here too, the special counsel’s report did not find that any person associated with the Trump campaign illegally participated in the dissemination of the materials. Notice the shift in Barr’s language. He starts by talking about whether anyone affiliated with Trump “encouraged or otherwise played a role” in the dissemination. But Barr doesn’t answer that question. Instead, he shifts to a different question: whether any Trump affiliates “illegally participated” in the dissemination. The answer, he says, is no, because WikiLeaks’ publication of the hacked material isn’t criminal. This distinction protects Roger Stone, a Trump campaign associate who colluded with WikiLeaks to promote the distribution of the hacked emails. 2. “Conspiracy to violate U.S. law.” Barr continued:
The special counsel investigated a number of “links” or “contacts” between Trump campaign officials and individuals connected with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign. After reviewing those contacts, the special counsel did not find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign. This paragraph covers the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between leaders of the Trump campaign and Russian intermediaries who had explicitly, as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” offered to give Donald Trump Jr. “official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary … and would be very useful to your father.” This meeting meets the layman’s definition of collusion. But under Barr’s analysis, and ostensibly Mueller’s, it doesn’t constitute a “conspiracy to violate U.S. law.” 3. “Illegally interfere.” In sum, Barr concluded, the investigation “confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes.” Here, Barr introduces the word collusion in order to deny that Trump or any of his associates engaged in it. Until this point, Barr carefully used the word conspiracy in order to shield the Trump campaign from culpability for its collusions. But now he shifts to collusion in order to create an appearance that Trump and his associates have been fully exonerated. And to make this claim technically accurate, he inserts the phrase “illegally interfere,” which excludes the Trump Tower meeting and the Stone-WikiLeaks contacts from consideration. 4. “No collusion.” Having shuffled between conspiracy and collusion in order generate an impression that no collusion occurred, Barr then used that claim to argue that Trump’s attempts to obstruct the investigation weren’t obstruction of justice. Trump had a “sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency,” said Barr—never mind that the same could have been said of President Richard Nixon’s Watergate cover-up—and, as Trump “said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.” Given the absence of collusion, according to Barr, Trump’s efforts to thwart the investigation weren’t criminal. This sleight of hand insulates Trump against the argument that the offenses whose discovery he tried to prevent were, if not prosecutable, impeachable. Barr auditioned for his job by writing a memo outlining how to protect Trump from the investigation. As attorney general, he has used his position to fulfill that mission. He’s a clever lawyer, and his efforts to shield the president pay close attention to legal distinctions. That does not, however, make them honest."
Trump’s Reaction to Mueller’s Appointment: “I’m f--ked. … This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.”,slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/donald-trump-reaction-robert-mueller-report-appointment.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About James Comey’s Firing Here’s what President Donald Trump had to say when, on May 17, 2017, special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to undertake his special investigation into the president’s possible misbehavior: “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked.” Those were the president’s first remarks to then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions when Sessions informed Trump of Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s decision to appoint Mueller, according to notes written by Jody Hunt, then Sessions’ chief of staff. The quote is included in the special counsel’s report, released on Thursday:
According to notes written by Hunt , when Sessions told the President that a Special Counsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I’m fucked .” The President became angry and lambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation , stating, “How could you let this happen, Jeff?” The President said the position of Attorney General was his most important appointment and that Sessions had ” let [him] down ,” contrasting him to Eric Holder and Robert Kennedy. Sessions recalled that the President said to him, “you were supposed to protect me,” or words to that effect. The President returned to the consequences of the appointment and said, “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency . It takes years and years and I won ‘t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” Immediately afterward, at the president’s request, Sessions left to draft a letter of resignation. (He did not resign until November 2018.)"
Mueller Report: Why Congress had it delivered to it on CDs.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/mueller-report-congress-cds.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About James Comey’s Firing The Justice Department hand-delivered special counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report to Congress at about 11 a.m. Thursday—on CD-ROMs. Why did officials decide to use such an anachronistic storage device? Because it’s still one of the standard methods of delivery. While the use of CDs bemused many in the press, it’s actually not that uncommon for lawmakers to receive sensitive documents on compact discs. “I left the Hill in 2014, and at that time *any* electronic production was unusual. When it occurred, CD-ROM was what we got,” Justin Rood, a director at the Project on Government Oversight who used to work for Sen. Tom Cotton, wrote in an email to Slate. “When I saw that the report was delivered on CD-ROM, I thought it was fairly typical.” Indeed, CBS reported that staffers on the House Judiciary Committee still have access to working CD drives. CD-ROMs are a preferred delivery vessel for classified materials in Congress in part because they have a considerable amount of memory and are largely impervious to tampering. As Wired notes , CDs can also typically hold 700 megabytes of data. The 412-page FISA application to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, for example, took up only 7.8 megabytes of space, so placing the document on a disc would leave you with plenty of room. Daniel Schuman, the policy director at Demand Progress, told Slate that some congressional offices have access to email networks that are equipped to disseminate classified material and that such documents are occasionally delivered on hard drives as well. “Sometimes information isn’t given to Congress, but you have to go to a secure facility and can read it there,” he added. It was the case for the report that the FBI produced on the sexual assaults allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last year.

Kevin Durant knows exactly how Patrick Beverley plans to troll him.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/kevin-durant-patrick-beverley-warriors-clippers.html,"Why Do People Keep Lighting Baseball Fields on Fire? In a confusing and surprising twist, the Golden State Warriors will have to try in the first round of the NBA playoffs. The defending champions blew a 31-point lead on their home court against the No. 8 seed Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night, and the erstwhile warmup series is now knotted at one game apiece. It was the biggest choke job, points-wise, in NBA playoff history. To add injury to insult, center DeMarcus Cousins tore his quadriceps during the game and will likely miss the remainder of the season, however long—or truncated—that may be. For a visual representation of this Warriors-Clippers series, look no further than the duel between Kevin Durant and Patrick Beverley. The Clippers’ 6-foot-1 journeyman guard has been hounding the Warriors’ 7-foot All-Star for two straight games, and the lopsided battle has at times looked like an interpretive dance version of Free Solo , with Durant playing the role of El Capitan. Kevin Durant and Patrick Beverley at Oracle Arena on Monday. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images Beverley’s incessant badgering is akin to back-seat roughhousing during a family road trip—it doesn’t matter who started it because everyone is getting in trouble. Even when the Warriors were up by 15 in the fourth quarter during Game 1, Beverley kept himself attached to Durant and goaded the superstar into an altercation that resulted in dueling ejections. In Game 2, Beverley helped stifle Durant to the tune of 8 field goal attempts and 9 turnovers, and he all but burrowed under the superstar’s skin. — Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) April 16, 2019 Both players fouled out of that contest, which, in chess terms, represents yet another successful strategic sacrifice for the Clippers. After the loss, the oft-emo Durant left the locker room without talking to the press, though he spoke at length with reporters during Wednesday’s practice. Kevin Durant goes extremely in depth on the Clippers style of defense, the overhelp, why he won’t get caught up in a 1-on-1 battle with Patrick Beverley pic.twitter.com/nOdmTDY4yi — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) April 17, 2019 While the approach employed by Beverley and the Clippers might appear to be “annoy Durant until he lashes out,” there is a specific strategy behind everything they do. In the above clip, Durant gives a rundown on his opponents’ gambit and deftly explains how he intends to overcome it. First, he identifies that the Clippers are “ top-locking ” Golden State’s sharpshooters, which means the off-ball defenders are preventing them from getting behind the 3-point line. He then elaborates on what, exactly, Beverley is trying to accomplish.
I got a pest Patrick Beverley who’s up underneath me, who I could definitely shoot over the top and score every time if it’s a 1-on-1 situation. But we’ve got a guy that’s dropping and helping and then we got another guy that’s just sitting on me waiting on me to dribble the basketball. If I put the basketball on the floor I can probably make 43 percent of my shots if I shoot them like that, but that’s not really going to do nothing for us for the outcome of the game because we’ve got a nice flow. The clip went semi-viral, and not because Durant called the Clippers’ schemes a “gimmick defense.” Durant has been prickly with the press all year, especially when asked about the looming free agency period and his heavily rumored exit from the Warriors this summer. Durant’s future travel plans have defined Golden State’s season, even as the team prepares to leave Oakland to make its own move to a new arena in San Francisco. Durant’s candid response on Wednesday was a reminder that he can be a great interview when he wants to be, though those moments have become increasingly rare during his Warriors tenure. Fittingly, Durant’s analysis was spurred on by the fact that Beverley and the Clippers tried to get in his head. Durant is the most self-conscious star in the league , and he inhabits that particular space with ascetic hermeticism. While Beverley’s campaign of annoyance has yielded on-court results, Durant’s staid off-court response serves as a reminder that he was forged in a fire of perceived slights. This is a man who reportedly used a burner account to defend himself from Twitter trolls and got into arguments with a teenager on Instagram . If his calm response indicates anything, it’s that he knows he’s in a battle he can actually win—and he’s happy to provide details about how, exactly, he plans to win it. "

"Trump tried to interfere with Mueller, but his aides didn't follow orders.",slate.com,Henry Grabar,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-obstruction-mueller-report-sessions-mcgahn-lewandowski.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump President Donald Trump was “mostly unsuccessful” in interfering with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, according to the redacted version of the Mueller report released on Thursday, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. Here’s the crux of it, from Page 158 of the report, which concerns the president’s efforts to pressure FBI Director James Comey, White House Counsel Don McGahn, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and senior White House official Rick Dearborn:
The President‘s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn’s prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President’s order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President‘s message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President’s direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President’s multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President’s aides and associates beyond those already filed. The report includes juicy details on each of those incidents. For example, while we knew Trump directed White House Counsel Don McGahn to tell Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller, we didn’t know the president had called McGahn at home to pressure him. McGahn told his chief of staff Annie Donaldson that the president called at least twice and at one point asked, “Have you done it?” McGahn told the president’s then–chief of staff Reince Priebus that Trump had asked him to “do crazy shit.” In the case of Lewandowski, the president twice tried to get him to pass notes to Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the investigation. Trump dictated this paragraph to Lewandowski, telling him that the attorney general should read it out loud:
I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our POTUS … is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn’t have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel b/c he hasn’t done anything wrong. I was on the campaign w/ him for nine months, there were no Russians involved with him. I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn’t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history. Very cool, very legal, definitely sounds like something the head of the Department of Justice would say of his own volition. Lewandowski did not pass those directions onto Sessions. This is all great news for the president’s aides—as Mueller notes at the bottom of the long blockquote above, “the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President’s aides and associates beyond those already filed.” As for the question of obstruction by the president himself, Mueller leaves that issue to Congress.

Mueller Report details Donald Trump Jr.’s Twitter DMs with WikiLeaks.,slate.com,April Glaser,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/mueller-report-donald-trump-jr-wikileaks-twitter-hacking.html,"How a Futurist Sees AOC’s Video “A Message From the Future” The redacted version of the Muller report released Thursday surfaces new details about the correspondence between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. before the 2016 election. In November 2017, we learned that Trump’s eldest son had exchanged direct messages with the WikiLeaks Twitter account in September 2016, less than two months before Election Day. In those messages, the WikiLeaks account, which is widely suspected to have been primarily operated by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, offered Trump’s son a “guessed” password to an “anti-Trump site putintrump.org that is about to launch.” According to the Mueller report, that password was provided to WikiLeaks by a man named Jason Fishbein, a detail that was previously unknown. A footnote in the report details that Fishbein obtained the password from someone in a chat room for discussing U.S. politics. Fishbein then sent a direct message to WikiLeaks with the login credentials, which were then passed on to Trump Jr. Hours later, Trump Jr. sent an email to senior campaign officials admitting that he used the “guessed” password to access the site. “I tried the password and it works,” he wrote. That could be an admission that he violated a federal criminal hacking law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it illegal to access a computer using a stolen password without authorization. WikiLeaks doesn’t appear to have had authorization to access the site, and the person behind the account told Trump Jr. that the password he provided was guessed, which implies pretty clearly that the then-candidate’s son knew he was using a key he wasn’t supposed to have. The email where Trump Jr. admits that he accessed a website knowingly using a hacked password was first published in a report from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2018. In that email, Trump Jr. goes on to say that he attached screenshots of an About page of the site, thereby demonstrating in pretty clear terms that he obtained information off the site after using a password he wasn’t authorized to use. Orin Kerr, a law professor specializing in computer crime at the University of Southern California, wrote on the blog Lawfare that that may be enough to make his access of the site a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. This wouldn’t be Assange’s first time brushing shoulders with potential violations of federal criminal hacking law. Last week, when he was arrested by British police after spending seven years hiding out in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on charges of skipping bail, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia unsealed an indictment charging Assange with conspiring to commit computer crime by helping former Army intelligence officer Chelsea Manning crack a password to a government computer. While it’s not yet clear that Assange will ever be brought back to the U.S. to face these charges, it is clear that Assange isn’t shy about encouraging people to break password locks to hack into computers and websites they’re not supposed to access. The Twitter handle provided for Jason Fishbein in the Mueller report links to a person who claims to be in “edtech marketing,” but I found another account that’s different by one character that belongs to someone with the same name who appears to be a fan of WikiLeaks and a defender of Assange. I reached out to both to ask if they’re at all affiliated with the person named in the report and will update this story if I learn more. About two weeks after WikiLeaks first messaged Trump Jr., it sent another message to the then-candidate’s son asking for help sharing a link to a website “alleging candidate Clinton had advocated using a drone to target Julian Assange,” the Mueller report reads. A little over a week later, WikiLeaks wrote to Trump Jr. again to “strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us wlsearch.tk.” Trump Jr. apparently got the message. Two days later, he tweeted the link. For those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the @wikileaks emails are right here: https://t.co/SGcEeM9rCS "
Robert Mueller let Donald Trump Jr. off the hook too easily.,slate.com,Richard L. Hasen,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/donald-trump-jr-mueller-report-campaign-finance.html,"The Mueller Report Is an Irrefutable Case That Trump Is Unfit for Office Robert Mueller let Donald Trump Jr. off the hook too easily for potential campaign finance violations that arose from the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower with Russian operatives. Mueller’s questionable exercise of prosecutorial discretion is bad news for how campaigns and foreign entities might conduct themselves in the run-up to the 2020 elections. Like many others, I am still poring over Mueller’s 448-page partially redacted report . My initial general impression of Volume 1—the part dealing with Russian interference in the 2016 elections and the connections between Trump—is that Mueller and his team did a thorough and fair job in investigating what happened and in describing the facts. But on the potential campaign finance violations, Mueller fell short in numerous ways. I have described the circumstances of that Trump Tower meeting before: During the 2016 presidential campaign, the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. got an email from his friend Rob Goldstone stating that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia” had “offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” This “high level and sensitive information” was being presented as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. replied almost immediately: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.” The subsequent meeting, held on June 9, 2016, included Trump Jr.; Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort; the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner; Goldstone; and a number of Russians connected with the Russian government. Federal law makes it a potential crime for any person to “solicit” (that is, expressly or impliedly ask for ) the contribution of “anything of value” from a foreign citizen. The offer of such opposition research qualifies as something of value for these purposes, a point the special counsel acknowledged based on prior cases and Federal Election Commission rulings. We now know the special counsel considered whether Trump Jr. and Manafort committed such a crime before ultimately declining to prosecute. We also now know that Mueller made some key errors during that decision-making process. To begin with, the special counsel’s report says that Trump Jr. “declined to be voluntarily interviewed” about the meeting. The special counsel should have called Trump Jr. before the grand jury, as he did with other witnesses. It seems likely that he declined to do so as not to incur the wrath of the president. Trump Jr.’s grand jury testimony would have been especially important given one of the key reasons Mueller declined to prosecute the president’s son for this crime: lack of willfulness. In order for a campaign finance violation to constitute a criminal offense (rather than a civil problem handled with fines by the Federal Election Commission), one must act willfully. Willfulness is a question of mental state. Getting Trump Jr. before a grand jury would have been a great way to get at his mental state, because he would have been testifying under the risk of perjury. This was a huge missed opportunity for Mueller. Mueller made some other questionable choices. While Trump Jr. could have been charged with illegally coordinating with the Russians to make an illegal foreign expenditure, Mueller describes the law defining coordination as too uncertain. In fact, as Common Cause’s Paul S. Ryan explains in this thread , there is both a federal statute and case law defining the term, and Trump Jr.’s conduct seems to fall within it. Mueller also made the ridiculous argument that it is possible Russian “dirt” on Clinton could have been worth less than $25,000, the threshold to punish Trump Jr.’s cooperation as a felony. Really? Further, Mueller said that a Trump Jr. prosecution would have raised “First Amendment questions” and “could have implications beyond the foreign-source ban.” To begin with, a First Amendment defense of Trump Jr. is bogus. As I explained in Slate, the main First Amendment argument is that a ban on soliciting foreign political contributions is overly broad and could apply any time a foreign individual gives any information to a political campaign. But Trump Jr. was a major campaign official meeting with representatives from a foreign government that were offering “dirt” on the campaign’s opponent. As I wrote, “To let someone off the hook who solicited ‘very high level and sensitive information’ from a hostile government because there may be cases in which information from a foreign source does not raise the same danger to our national security and right of self-government is to turn the First Amendment into a tool to kill American democracy.” Further, even if Mueller believed there were First Amendment questions in play, he should have left that for the courts to decide given the strong national security interests at stake here. Mueller offered no First Amendment argument in his report. He merely flagged the issue and never provided any analysis to back up the First Amendment claim. I’m afraid that this flagging of the issue does more harm than good. Mueller has now given campaigns credible reason to believe they can accept help from foreign governments because they may have a constitutional right to do so. That’s even more troubling for what it says about 2020 than what it says about 2016. Support our journalism

"Trump 2020’s Mueller report response: Obama did it, investigate him and the others too.",slate.com,Josh Voorhees,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-2020-mueller-report-response-obama-did-it-duh.html,"What the Mueller Report Says About Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump It remains an open question how special counsel Robert Mueller’s report will fit into the plans of the nearly 20 Democrats running for president. Most spent the early days of their 2020 campaigns trying to steer the conversation away from collusion and impeachment and toward issues like health care and the economy—a strategy of restraint that appeared smart in light of Attorney General William Barr’s initial summary late last month. The White House hopefuls could take a more aggressive approach now that the public has seen the redacted version of the full report—and all the juicy and potentially damning details inside —or they may stay the course. Time will tell. We will not, however, have to wait to see how team Trump tries to spin it to help the president’s reelection effort. Barr kicked things off Thursday with a pre-release press conference at which the nation’s top prosecutor acted like the president’s personal defense attorney . And the Trump campaign then took things considerably further in the hours following the release, suggesting that it was time to “investigate the investigators”—a group that apparently includes both those congressional Democrats currently investigating Trump and those officials who worked in the FBI and Justice Department under President Barack Obama. First up was Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, who released a statement that falsely claimed his boss had been “fully and completely exonerated” by the report:
President Trump has been fully and completely exonerated yet again. Now the tables have turned, and it’s time to investigate the liars who instigated this sham investigation into President Trump, motivated by political retribution and based on no evidence whatsoever. There is simply no denying that ‘spying did occur’ on the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, as Attorney General Barr himself noted in testimony before Congress. Barr went on to testify that there was a ‘failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon [of the FBI] … [and] I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused.’ Now that the collusion and obstruction conspiracy theories have been exposed for the pathetic hoaxes they always were, the Obama-era DOJ and FBI must answer for their misdeeds and the scam that they perpetrated against the American people. Justice will be served. And then came the campaign video, which included a montage of Democratic lawmakers like Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, as well as news coverage of last months’ Barr memo: None of this is new. Trump has been trying to blame Obama for the Russian interference for more than a year now , and he called for Schiff to resign last month. Still, it’s the latest evidence that the president’s campaign has no interest in talking about all the things Mueller and his team found, only what they didn’t. "

Ukraine GOP platform change: The Mueller report has some new details on one of the most suspicious moments o f the trump campaign.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/ukraine-gop-platform-gordon.html,"The Clearest Case of Trump’s Corruption in the Mueller Report Throughout the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, questions have swirled around an odd change the campaign pushed for in the Republican platform at the party’s 2016 convention in Cleveland. As the Washington Post originally reported shortly after the convention, Trump campaign representatives pushed to water down language in the platform about “providing lethal defensive weapons” to the government of Ukraine for its fight against pro-Russian separatists. Given then–campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s financial ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, that raised some eyebrows. Was the platform move part of a quid pro quo, or a demonstration of good faith to Trump’s allies in Moscow? On this particular question, the just-released Mueller report is mostly good news for Trump. Investigators found no evidence that the president ordered or was even aware of the change to the platform language. But it does highlight the degree to which Trumpworld officials with questionable motives were engaged in freelance policymaking during this period. The report mostly confirms what has been reported by the Post and later the Daily Beast about the incident. At a meeting of the national security platform subcommittee shortly before the convention, on July 11, 2016, Diana Denman, a Ted Cruz–supporting delegate, submitted an amendment to the platform denouncing Russian military aggression in Ukraine and calling for the provision of lethal weapons, a step the Obama administration was then opposing. J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon spokesman who was then a national security adviser to the Trump campaign and attended the meeting as a non-voting observer, flagged the amendment, saying he did not believe it corresponded with Trump’s views on Russia and Ukraine. Denman says Gordon told her during the meeting that he was on the phone with Trump himself, but she was skeptical of this claim, and Gordon denies ever making it. Trump told the Mueller team he did not speak with Gordon about the matter, though phone records show Gordon called Jeff Sessions’ office that day. Gordon does say he talked to senior Trump advisers Rick Dearborn and John Mashburn, and here’s where things get odd: Gordon says the two backed him up, but Mashburn remembers telling Gordon that Trump hadn’t taken a stand on the issue and that the campaign shouldn’t interfere. With this one notable exception, Trump campaign observers mostly held back and didn’t offer any substantive input during the platform-drafting process. In the end, the language in the amendment was softened to “appropriate assistance,” which led Mashburn to believe, as the Mueller report puts it, that “Gordon had violated Mashburn’s directive not to intervene.” Then-campaign co-chair Sam Clovis also told investigators that he was surprised by the change and did not believe it accorded with Trump’s views. (In fairness, Trump’s stated views on Ukraine, at that time, were a little vague and hard to parse .) So was Gordon just acting on his own? This wasn’t his only activity during the convention that the report discusses. Gordon also spoke briefly with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a conference held the week of the convention in Cleveland. (You may recall this was also the conference where Kislyak spoke to Sessions.) Gordon and the ambassador, along with several other diplomats, also sat together at dinner that night and spoke about improving U.S.-Russia relations. (Gordon remembers the conversation lasting just three to five minutes. Quick dinner!) It should be noted this happened after Gordon advocated the platform change. The Washington Post has also reported that in the months prior to the election—when Gordon had left the campaign but anticipated being offered a job on Trump’s transition team—he socialized with the Russian gun rights activist Maria Butina, who has since been charged by the U.S. with working as an unregistered agent of the Kremlin. According to documents and testimony from the Senate Intelligence Committee, the two exchanged a number of emails, including invitations from Gordon to Butina to attend his birthday party and a Styx concert. The party platform was always an odd place for the Trump team to pick a fight on this or any issue. Its language is not binding, and it’s not as if Trump has ever been reluctant to buck GOP orthodoxy. In the end, the Trump administration did end up selling lethal anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, though reportedly over the president’s personal reluctance . Mueller’s investigation into this odd incident finds no evidence that Trump was acting on Russia’s behalf, though perhaps some people working for him thought they should be."

HBO not amused by Trump's Mueller report-Game of Thrones tweet.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/trump-game-of-thrones-meme-hbo-responds.html,"The Stormy Story of Three Kings , the Only Great Movie About the Gulf War It’s happening again: Donald Trump is tweeting personalized Game of Thrones memes. In response to Thursday morning’s press conference about the Mueller report , the president posted an image inspired by the popular HBO series with text that reads: “No collusion. No obstruction. For the haters and the radical left Democrats—Game Over.” The message was sent prior to the release of the actual report, though once a redacted version did become available , Trump’s campaign announced that it “fully and completely” exonerated the president. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2019 HBO wasn’t too happy about the president borrowing its distinctive font. “Though we can understand the enthusiasm for Game of Thrones now that the final season has arrived, we still prefer our intellectual property not be used for political purposes,” the network said in a statement to Slate. It isn’t the first time HBO has been rankled by Trump’s use of its show, either. In November, after the president posted a similar “Sanctions are coming” tweet riffing on Game of Thrones ’ popular tagline, HBO responded, “We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes” and tweeted out , “How do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2018 If it seems strange that, in response to probes into his own conduct, Trump would opt to invoke one of the bloodiest and politically manipulative series on television—does it really? Trying to puzzle out what goes on inside the president’s mind often feels like an act of sheer folly, though it’s especially unclear what his team was trying to accomplish with the reference.

Redactions: The Mueller report is hardly the first time officials have gone heavy on the black pen.,slate.com,Fred Kaplan,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-redactions-pentagon-papers.html,"Why Elizabeth Warren Wants the House to Start Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump Nearly half the pages in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report —163 out of a total 381 pages of text—contain passages that Attorney General William Barr has blacked out. In some cases, the redactions cover just a few words or a name; in many cases, though, whole paragraphs or entire pages are deleted. Most of the deletions were made for one of two reasons: “Investigative Techniques” (facts that, if uncensored, would reveal intelligence sources or methods) and “Harm to Ongoing Matter” (facts pertaining to grand jury probes or upcoming trials). In principle, these are legitimate reasons for redacting government documents. But two points need to be made. First, because some of the “ongoing matter” concerns people indicted and facing trial as a result of the Mueller investigation, the redactions prevent us from assessing the nature and scope of the relationship between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign. For instance, in a section titled “Trump Campaign and the Dissemination of Hacked Materials” (Volume I, pages 51–58), almost the entire text is blacked out. The same is true for most passages concerning Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort (for instance, Vol. I, page 143). See also a section titled “Russian Hacking and Dumping Operations,” especially a subsection whose title is redacted (“Charging Decision as to [Harmful to Ongoing Matter],” Vol. I, pages 176–79). Another multipage blackout is labeled “Constitutional Considerations” (Vol. I, pages 190–91). A passage recounting Trump discussing a pardon for Manafort is followed by two fully redacted pages (Vol. II, pages 128–30). We may never know what’s in those redacted passages of the Mueller report. The second point that needs to be made about redactions is that they often have little or dubious basis. Thursday morning, in anticipation of the Mueller report’s release, the National Security Archive —a private research organization at George Washington University—published 10 examples of bizarre redactions from the thousands of Freedom of Information Act suits it has filed over the years. In some cases, redactions—or the removal of redactions—were ordered for obvious political reasons. But often, the government gatekeepers have taken out the black pen because there are no firm standards on what should and should not be made public. When in doubt, officials—often to protect their careers—opt for caution, not transparency. In many cases, different officials have different standards or make different decisions. The result is rampant overclassification. For instance, the archive’s report displays a 1984 State Department document on Geneva Convention violations in Rwanda, as it was marked up in four separate declassifications between 2001 and 2012. Each version redacts certain passages—but the passages are different in each one: Words that are clear and open in one version are blacked out in another, and vice versa. All four reviewers justified the deletions for reasons of “national security.” In fact, they were for reasons of individual judgment. Back in 2011, the U.S. government, finally, formally declassified the Pentagon Papers, the top-secret history of the Vietnam War that Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had ordered way back in 1967. Daniel Ellsberg leaked the report in 1971, and the New York Times and several other newspapers famously reprinted huge chunks of it that same year. Sen. Mike Gravel, a Democrat from Alaska, then entered the full report into the Congressional Record, after which Beacon Press published it in four volumes. And yet, the government’s official public version redacted 11 words —even though the complete report, including those 11 words, had been available to the world for the previous 40 years. We may never know what’s in those redacted passages of the Mueller report. Whether we should know—and how it might alter our view of its conclusions—is a vital question. Support our journalism

"PornHub launches BeeSexual campaign, follows in footsteps of Bee Movie, Aqua.",slate.com,Marissa Martinelli,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/pornhub-bee-movie-aqua-conservation.html,"The Haunting Power of “In the Pines” Pornhub’s philanthropic arm recently launched another splashy campaign, this time to benefit honeybee conservation efforts. The site’s new BeeSexual channel features videos of bees—like, actual bees, that’s not a euphemism—with titles such as “Pollen squirter gets raided by exotic explorer” and “Mature natural gets plowed by worker bee.” For the next month, Pornhub will donate to Operation Honey Bee and The Center for Honeybee Research according to how many views the videos, which feature voiceover commentary by actual porn stars, receive. BeeSexual is a very silly initiative that benefits a worthy cause, but it also taps into a weird cultural obsession: the horniness surrounding bees. We literally use the phrase “ the birds and the bees ” as a euphemism for sex, with the process of pollination acting as a convenient metaphor for squeamish parents who need to explain it to their kids. And that’s not even about sex between bees, which is bizarre in its own right: Male drones basically lose their reproductive organ and die after mating. Then there’s also the fetish known as Melissaphilia , human sexual attraction to bees, which hasn’t been studied or documented enough to know if it’s even real. What is real, however, is Bee Movie , the Dreamworks animated feature that launched a thousand memes , thanks in part to the relationship between the main characters, a human woman and a nonconformist bee named Barry. “It was never going to be sexual or anything like that. It was purely this friendship… maybe in Barry’s mind he thought… but it was never going to be that,” director Steve Hickner told the New Statesman . “Often we would lose sight of those characters in the room. They would just be Barry and Vanessa, and we would write this dialogue for Barry and Vanessa, and read it over and have to remind ourselves, well, this is a tiny bee saying this, and the tiny bee is fighting with her boyfriend, so let’s dial it back to friend, and make it less romantic, because it’s getting weird.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Mueller report vs. Barr's summary: a line-by-line comparison of three key passages.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-barr-summary-comparison-key-passages.html,"The Clearest Case of Trump’s Corruption in the Mueller Report Reporters and other interested parties are still reading through the 448-page Mueller report for new and revelatory information, but one thing was quickly apparent: Attorney General William Barr’s depiction of the report in his written summary last month and his address Thursday morning didn’t give the full story. If there’s one conclusion you would come away with after Barr’s address this morning , it’s that there was no collusion . Barr conceded that, yes, Mueller found that Russians had unlawfully sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, and yes, Trump’s campaign likely benefited from these efforts, but Barr maintained that Mueller had found no evidence of any kind of collusion by anyone . Here’s what he said, in a line that he had already quoted in his earlier written report:
As you will see, the special counsel’s report states that his “investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” But here’s the full sentence in the report (emphasis ours):
Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts , the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. Cutting off the beginning of the sentence doesn’t change the end result. But on its own, Barr’s sentence makes the whole thing seem so simple, when that’s far from the reality revealed in the report. Even if there was no proof of coordination, there was still uncomfortable behavior, still a Don Jr. meeting with Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton, still campaign officials with murky connections to states with political aims very much at odds with America’s. That’s a sense you get better from the fuller sentence, reminding the reader of just how the Trump campaign stood to gain from Russian meddling. Here’s another example, Barr’s next quote from his address Thursday:
Indeed, as the report states, “[t]he investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA’s interference operation.” Put another way, the special counsel found no “collusion” by any Americans in the IRA’s illegal activity. But here’s the full version from the report:
By early to mid-2016, [Internet Research Agency] operations included supporting the Trump Campaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the staging of political rallies. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA’s interference operation. Again, the full passage shows that there was nothing cut and dry about the situation. And a third example, in Barr’s written summary from March, shows the attorney general’s cherry-picking at its most brazen:
In making this determination [that there was no obstruction-of-justice offense], we noted that the special counsel recognized that “the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,” and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the president’s intent with respect to obstruction. Here, the full context:
In this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range of other possible personal motives animating the President’s conduct. These include concerns that continued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential uncertainty about whether certain events—such as advance notice of WikiLeaks’s release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians—could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family. While Barr didn’t misquote the Mueller report, he did pluck out lines that failed to give the full, nuanced picture of the report’s analysis. There’s a reason critics have been condemning Barr for seeming to abandon his objectivity in order to defend Trump. As Jeremy Stahl pointed out for Slate, the report does refute coordination between Trump’s campaign and Russian agents to some extent, but it also “seemed to include evidence of a lot of collusion-adjacent activities by those in Trump’s orbit.” And as Mark Joseph Stern argued in Slate , the report did make a case for obstruction—as much as Mueller realistically could, given the limits of his power. But you wouldn’t know that from Barr’s comments, clipped as they are."

Mueller Report: Trump Repeatedly Asked Campaign Associates to Find Clinton’s Deleted Emails,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-trump-campaign-hillary-clinton-emails.html,"There Might Be More Mueller-Related Prosecutions After All During a press conference in Florida on July 17, 2016, Donald Trump asked for some help finding emails that Hillary Clinton had supposedly deleted from her private email account. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said . “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” That same day, Russian hackers made their first attempt to break into Clinton’s servers. Last month, Trump referred to those remarks as “sarcastic” and “a joke” during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, released on Thursday, puts this characterization into question. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn told investigators that Trump repeatedly asked people affiliated with his presidential campaign to find the emails. Flynn claims that he undertook an effort to retrieve the emails at Trump’s request. He contacted Barbara Ledeen, a Senate staffer, and Peter Smith, an investment adviser involved in Republican politics. Ledeen had actually been searching for the emails herself since 2015. She sent Smith a 15-page proposal at the end of that year:
The proposal called for a three-phase approach. The first two phases consisted of open-source analysis. The third phase consisted of checking with certain intelligence sources “that have access through liaison work with various foreign services” to determine if any of those services had gotten to the server. The proposal noted, “Even if a single email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would be catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]” Smith forwarded the proposal to his colleagues but declined to collaborate with Ledeen because he didn’t think the effort was viable. However, weeks after Trump made the request in 2016 to track down the emails, Smith decided to launch his own search effort:
[Smith] created a company, raised tens of thousands of dollars, and recruited security experts and business associates. Smith made claims to others involved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers with “ties and affiliations to Russia” who had access to the emails, and that his efforts were coordinated with the Trump Campaign. In August, Smith sent an update to several people, including Trump campaign co-chair Sam Clovis, claiming that he had been in “sensitive meetings” in D.C. with groups who were looking into Clinton’s server. He noted that hackers had been able to gain access and were planning to release the material ahead of the election. The next month, Smith had a business associate establish KLS Research LLC, partly to manage the money he’d raised to find the emails. Investigators determined that KLS received more than $30,000 during the campaign. In an effort to recruit security experts for KLS, Smith claimed that he was coordinating with campaign officials such as Flynn, Clovis, Steve Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway. However, the investigation only found proof of contact with Flynn and Clovis. At around the same time, Smith and Ledeen got back in contact to discuss their search efforts. Leeden claimed to have found a trove of Clinton’s emails on the deep web. Blackwater founder Erik Prince, brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, provided money to hire a tech expert to analyze the trove. The expert determined that the emails were inauthentic. Despite Smith’s subsequent claims to have had insight into WikiLeaks and contact with the Russian hackers, investigators could not establish that this was the case:
Associates and security experts who worked with Smith on the initiative did not believe that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers and were aware of no such connection. The investigation did not establish that Smith was in contact with Russian hackers or that Smith, Ledeen, or other individuals in touch with the Trump Campaign ultimately obtained the deleted Clinton emails. The report notes, though, that Smith appears to have obtained material from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s inbox before WikiLeaks released it:
A backup of Smith’s computer contained two files that had been downloaded from WikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta. The files on Smith’s computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release by WikiLeaks. Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect when the files were downloaded to Smith ‘s computer. … The investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their release by WikiLeaks. Smith was found dead in 2017 . His death was ruled a suicide."

Robert Mueller gave us everything we need to know.,slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-gives-us-everything-we-need-to-know.html,"Trump Tweet Claiming Millions Killed in Sri Lanka Bombings Stays Up for 20 Minutes It has been said that there are two types of fiction writers, those who can show us entirely new worlds and those who tell us again what we already know. Robert Mueller is quite obviously the latter. What his report, released Thursday, does, irrefutably and in eye-scraping detail, is tell us what we already know. Some may find this frustrating—in many people’s eyes, Mueller went right up to the brink of finding serious criminal misconduct and then blinked, or punted, or declined to interview the president. But knowing, as he must have known, that anything short of a smoking gun, and perhaps even a smoking gun , would be met with cries of “no collusion” and “total exoneration,” Mueller took a slightly different approach. Rather than make specific recommendations of what comes next, he laid out the case and left it to Congress to do the work that he could not, for all sorts of constitutional and structural reasons, complete himself . And Mueller’s efforts managed to do one important thing: They cement the story. They paint a picture. We now have the montage. After two years without facts, we now have facts. Thus far the White House and Trump boosters haven’t disputed the facts. As we pored over the 448-page report, the quote that became the very first hot take of the day was that the president, upon learning that Mueller had been appointed to investigate, shouted, “I’m fucked.” He declared that his presidency was over. The reason this matters is that it cements in the collective consciousness what everyone already knew—that the president wanted this probe ended and knew it was an existential risk to his presidency. What follows in the rest of the report is a highlights reel of things even the most casual observer already knew, at some level, regardless of ideology or politics. The Russians tried to steal the election. Some members of his campaign were happy to help. The president wanted to protect Michael Flynn. The president wanted to kill the special counsel investigation. The president materially and significantly tampered with witnesses to that investigation. The president lied and told others to lie. None of this was ever really in dispute. Almost everything about the president’s impetuousness and vindictiveness and malevolence was known, even before the election, because it’s been on full display, to all of us, for years. What Mueller has done is hold up a mirror to the presidency and shown us what was happening. Sometimes, it was happening on live television or Twitter, and sometimes it was coming out by way of superb reporting by journalists. But almost all of it was entirely known. After two years without facts, we now have facts. Thus far the White House and Trump boosters haven’t disputed the facts. What they say is “no collusion,” because that’s what they were going to say, no matter what. But the facts in this movie are devastating. They paint a picture of Trump campaign members helping Russia steal an election, with polling data and secret meetings, and of a lawless and King Lear–like Trump trying desperately to obscure what was really happening. Mueller may not have taken the American public anywhere specific on questions of law. But he sure as hell took us all to the same place on the question of reality. And the facts that the American public—at least those who don’t have an intravenous hookup to Tucker Carlson’s worldview—are seeing today, whether by way of quotes, or hot takes, or television punditry, is a walk down the well-trod lane of how Trump operates. He lies. He tells others to lie. He fires people. He threatens. He demands loyalty. In some ways, I’m enjoying this movie more this time around precisely because, as 448-page encapsulations of all the facts I thought I’d become insensible to go, this is a hell of a read. And in its own pointillist and nuanced way, that story makes the conclusions of law somewhat less frustrating. It’s as if Mueller was just saying, “You all know this happened and continues to happen. Now you decide what to do about it.” Congress now has its road map, should it decide to pursue inquiries into the matters about which Mueller could not make conclusions. Despite what Attorney General William Barr has asserted, Mueller makes it very clear that Congress is entitled to act on this report. But despite the heavy lawyering and the very lawyerly parsing, I actually read the Mueller report as a fundamentally political document as much as a legal one. It’s a delineation, chapter and verse, of how Trump has conducted himself in office, and for anyone who believes that the president should not be above the law, this is a damning report of presidential lawlessness . It’s lawlessness sometimes erased by staff, lawlessness sometimes declined by underlings, lawlessness sometimes erased by cluelessness and stupidity, lawlessness sometimes elided by technical definitions. But while Mueller may have avoided making explicit legal conclusions about criminality, he has sealed into amber a story that we all needed to hear. The fact that elites are arguing about the mental states required for criminal obstruction doesn’t change the fact that the American public is seeing, yet again, that Donald Trump is exactly who he presents himself to be. For some proportion of the public, that means today confirms, once again, that the president is a valorous and heroic leader, triumphing against all odds. Barr had them at his first claims, in announcing the conclusions of the report, that the president feels he has been treated very unfairly . But for Americans who are weary of Donald Trump, bored of the lies, fatigued by the ugliness and rancor, there is nothing good about this report, which essentially says, “This guy is appalling, I can’t say whether he’s a criminal.” Congress needs to do its job now and follow where Mueller has led. But the American public can no longer claim that nothing has happened. Mueller has shown us what is true. Nobody in the White House has disputed it. We can decide we’re fine with it or that we are not fine with it. That’s a political question, not a legal one. I think that may be what needed to happen all along. Support our journalism

"My dog is camera-shy, hates having his photo taken: pet advice from Beast Mode.",slate.com,Nick Greene,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/dog-hates-photos-phones-camera-shy.html,"My Cranky Old Dog Has No Friends. Is That a Problem? I have two dogs, both from the same shelter. One is an absolute ham for the camera. She will sit down nicely and wait to hear the click and the ensuing praise. The other is much more fearful when someone points a camera or phone in his general direction. It amazes me that the shelter was even able to get a photo to put on its website for prospective adopters. Any time he notices a camera pointed his way, he walks off with his head and tail down and sits in his crate. I don’t want him living in fear of something many people have in their pockets or purses. How can I get him used to seeing what’s ultimately a harmless object? —Pensive Puparazzi Dear Pensive Puparazzi, Dogs are ignorant muses. They may not understand the concept of photography, but that can’t stop them from being the medium’s greatest subjects. My dog Ruby doesn’t know the first thing about shutter speed or aperture, yet she still manages to bring some smoldering looks when it’s go time. Nick Greene Cynics will see my selection of your question as an excuse to post a photo of my own dog, to which I say: Here’s another picture of Ruby. Nick Greene Your dog shares this trait with some of America’s finest novelists. There is no shame in being camera-shy, and your dog shares this trait with some of America’s finest novelists. After a CNN crew captured footage of Thomas Pynchon in 1997, the author called the network to complain . “Let me be unambiguous: I prefer not to be photographed,” he said. Your dog has the same right, and Pynchon would argue that he is perfectly normal in this regard. “My belief is that recluse is a code word generated by journalists,” he said, “meaning, ‘doesn’t like to talk to reporters.’ ” But, unlike Pynchon, your pooch doesn’t feel crushed by the mechanisms of media and fame. He’s simply scared of the camera, though he doesn’t have to be. To help with your issue, I contacted Ellen Shershow , an Oakland, California–based photographer who specializes in canine portraiture. “It sounds like a small thing, but having patience is the most important thing you can possibly do,” she tells me. “It’s the best tool in your toolkit.” Shershow says she always informs her clients that she doesn’t charge by the hour, as the process of luring a shy dog out of its shell can drag on. “I had a little chihuahua in my studio, and she was terrified of the camera,” she recalls. “She hid under my desk for 45 minutes. Finally, I took a very soft dog treat and I mushed it all over my camera, put the camera next to her, and just walked away. She was able to walk out on her own time, sniff the camera, and then lick it down. The camera itself became like a giver of treats. After that, she wasn’t scared anymore. She was practically posing for the camera.” To photograph something is to act strangely toward it. Your dog reacts to this, and because you have the camera out, you may be exacerbating his sense that something is amiss. Shershow recommends having a friend take the photos while you sit near your dog or have him on your lap. “I’ll keep experimenting until I find out what’s making it easier for them,” she says, noting that some dogs prefer to have their humans in their sightlines during photo shoots. He may not turn into a cover model instantaneously, but with a little patience, your dog will learn that the camera won’t hurt him. Just don’t go publishing those photos all over the place. Like Pynchon, he has a mystique to maintain. "
"Mueller report is bad for Trump, but no impeachment.",slate.com,Jim Newell,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-trump-bad-impeachment-no.html,"The Clearest Case of Trump’s Corruption in the Mueller Report Robert Mueller’s report, which details 10 potential instances of obstruction of justice by Donald Trump, is unsurprisingly meatier than Attorney General William Barr let on in his initial summary . As my colleague Mark Joseph Stern writes , it can even be read as an impeachment referral to Congress. House Democrats certainly welcomed it as such. “The Special Counsel made clear that he did not exonerate the President,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a Thursday statement. “The responsibility now falls to Congress to hold the President accountable for his actions.” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, similarly, said in a statement that “the Special Counsel concludes that Congress must make a determination regarding obstruction of justice, unable to make such a determination himself.” But then later, speaking on CNN, Hoyer appeared to put impeachment—Congress’ constitutional remedy for “high crimes and misdemeanors”—off the table. “Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point,” he said. “Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months, and the American people will make a judgment.” Adam Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed a similar point to the network: “A failed impeachment is not in the national interest.” It’s a bit awkward: We’ll hold the president accountable but not in the way you’re thinking . Democrats may be welcoming the investigative responsibility they believe that Mueller, handcuffed by internal Justice Department policy forbidding the indictment of a sitting president, left in their laps. But even should they find strong bases for presidential obstruction, Democratic leaders are still loath to say they would initiate the formal response that would seem to naturally follow. House Democrats could—hell, are even likely to—find themselves following Mueller’s roadmap to the very end, but stopping just before the finish line out of a sense of political impracticality. It’s not a comfortable position to be in. As Barr reemphasized in his Thursday morning press conference, he and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, responded to Mueller’s punt on obstruction by taking it upon themselves to determine Trump had not committed such a crime. The redacted release, however, makes clear that Mueller’s team had operated from the position that it would not make a “traditional prosecutorial decision.” Meaning even from the get-go the team decided “not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes,” even without an indictment, because “no charges can be brought.” The investigation’s stated goal, instead, was to “preserve the evidence,” and a “federal criminal accusation” could “potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct”—a constitutional process like, oh, let’s say, impeachment. Mueller also outlines several instances—asking White House counsel Don McGahn to lie, floating pardons and whispering other sweet nothings to witnesses—in which there’s a reasonable inference that the president obstructed justice, while very carefully not saying any such thing. Now what if the House Judiciary Committee takes those reasonable inferences of obstruction and certifies them as proper instances of such? What would the repercussions be then? When asked about impeachment at a Thursday afternoon press conference, Nadler said, “That’s one possibility.” He added that “there are others,” though didn’t expand much further. That may be because once you look a couple of steps above Nadler’s pay grade, you find that impeachment isn’t much of a possibility. It’s not just Hoyer. Consider one of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s clearly defined criteria for pursuing impeachment: Republican buy-in. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan,” she told the Washington Post in March, “I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he’s just not worth it.” Republicans have unsurprisingly yet to see anything “compelling and overwhelming” enough to persuade them that they should toss their leader out of office. “Democrats want to keep searching for imaginary evidence that supports their claims, but it is simply not there,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted Thursday. “IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON.” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, stated that “Democrats’ accusations of criminal obstruction are unfounded.” “I look forward to examining the mountain of factions supporting the principal conclusions the attorney general and deputy attorney general shared last month: no collusion, no obstruction,” Collins added. With Republicans making the shocking decision to stand by their president in the face of a not-very-friendly report, Democrats find themselves careening toward an impossible spot. The Mueller report will give them solid grounds for making the case that Trump obstructed justice, a presidential misdeed for which there is constitutional remedy. But a remedy that the hapless pursuit of which would completely distract from election-cycle contrasts that swing voters care much more about, like protections for preexisting medical conditions. House Democratic leaders want Trump to carry the stench of well-documented impeachable offenses into election season, without actually having to do the impeachment. It’s not the biggest needle to thread. Support our journalism

The Mueller report is an unflattering portrait of Donald Trump.,slate.com,Christina Cauterucci,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/mueller-report-donald-trump-egomaniac-bad-boss.html,"The Mueller Report Is an Irrefutable Case That Trump Is Unfit for Office President Donald Trump has committed so many brazen acts of cruelty, dishonesty, and stupidity in full view of the public that it’s not really a surprise to hear about the cruel, dishonest, and stupid things he does behind closed doors. But the lightly redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that was released on Thursday morning is still a revelatory document. Read as a profile of the president—a piece of reporting informed by interviews with sources under oath—the Mueller report shades in the portrait of Trump that’s already imprinted on our brains. It also makes it clearer than it’s ever been that the president drives everyone around him absolutely mad. The Donald Trump that readers encounter in the report takes great pains to avoid information that will cause him any emotional discomfort, even if he’ll eventually have to confront it when it blows up into a P.R. disaster. Former White House communications director Hope Hicks told the special counsel that she tried to tell the president about emails documenting how Donald Trump Jr. organized the June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Kremlin-linked lawyer at Trump Tower. Hicks suggested they release the emails to get ahead of the story. “The President said he did not want to know about it and they should not go to the press,” the Mueller report says. “Hicks warned the President that the emails were ‘really bad’ … but the President was insistent that he did not want to talk about it and said he did not want details.” At another meeting, Hicks said, Jared Kushner tried to show Trump a folder of documents that Kushner was supposed to provide to congressional committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. According to the report, the president “stopped Kushner and said he did not want to know about it, shutting the conversation down.” These anecdotes complement previous reports that Trump demands that he be given a folder of positive news clippings about himself twice a day. With the assistance of family members and employees who have scrambled to avoid the president’s unpredictable rage, Trump has been able to cocoon himself in reports of his own competence, outsourcing the fallout from his scam-riddled campaign and presidency to others in his orbit. He seems unable or unwilling to consider inevitable consequences, pursuing momentary comfort over necessary conflict every time. The report depicts Trump as a haughty child of privilege convinced that his social capital and powers of personality are strong enough to make any negative accusations against him (even the true ones) dissipate on their own. Chris Christie told investigators that Trump was shocked to learn that “this Russia thing” was still a thing even after Michael Flynn left the administration . “Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over,” Christie said Trump told him over lunch in February 2017, the day after Flynn resigned. Trump’s seeming naïveté about the severity of “this Russia thing” and his confidence that any repercussions would be absorbed by his underlings isn’t merely evidence of his willful ignorance and stunted capacity for critical thinking. It’s the logical response of a man who has, for a lifetime, evaded consequences for his bad behavior (creating a scam university , doing sketchy tax stuff ) and been rewarded with the presidency thanks to his worst tendencies (racist provocations, bragging about sexual assault). Trump’s blasé attitude about the Trump Tower meeting emails and Kushner’s documents—“leave it alone,” he allegedly told his son-in-law when he learned the documents weren’t due to Congress for a few weeks—contrasts with his well-documented paranoia over leaks to the press. According to Hicks’ account, Trump said he was sure the Trump Tower meeting emails wouldn’t leak so she shouldn’t preemptively publish them. Later, he “seemed upset” because several people in the White House knew about the emails when he wanted only a single lawyer to deal with them. “The President indicated that he did not think the emails would leak, but said they would leak if everyone had access to them,” the report says. This pas de deux of ego (“I’m sure these emails that make me look bad and possibly open me up to a damning investigation won’t leak”) and insecurity (“these emails will definitely leak if more than one person sees them”) is classic Trump. He knows that evincing open mistrust of his own administration means admitting the limits of his lackeys’ admiration and fealty to him. So he convinces himself that no one is going to betray him or compromise his public image, then smears them as incompetent turncoats when they inevitably do. The Mueller report also indicates that the president didn’t much care if the results of the Russia investigation made him seem unethical, greedy, or treasonous. He was only worried that any corroboration of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election would undermine the flattering connotations of his victory: that he won America’s popularity contest all on his own. “Several advisors” told the special counsel that Trump believed it would detract from his election triumph if people thought Russia had propped him on top of a few phone books to help him reach the dinner table. Trump also thinks the same primitive, manipulative tactics that work on him will work on everyone around him. Christie told investigators that in early 2017, the president told him to call then–FBI Director James Comey, who was launching an investigation into Russian election interference, to tell Comey that Trump “really like[s] him.” “Tell [Comey] he’s part of the team,” Trump told Christie. Trump’s conviction that Comey could be swayed with secondhand flattery delivered via the governor of New Jersey is so foolish it’s almost sad. For a man credited by his supporters with superhuman charisma and business instincts, he seems wildly inattentive to who people are, what makes them tick, and how to win them over. In these please-like-me anecdotes, Trump comes off as deeply pathetic. He appears to be a socially inept child who lives in a fantasy world that revolves around his own ego, believes no rules apply to him, barely maintains a weak grasp on logic, and is desperate to be loved. None of these observations are groundbreaking. But it’s still both troubling and satisfying to read these firsthand accounts of Trump’s failures as a president, boss, American, and human being in what was commissioned to be a dispassionate government report. It’s not just Trump’s political opponents and those beset by #resistance brain who think he’s unqualified to lead a nation, a business, a family, or a productive life. The people working hardest to protect him think so, too. Support our journalism

Mueller report shows Russia tried to troll Americans in real life.,slate.com,April Glaser,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/mueller-report-internet-research-agency-ira-trolls-real-life.html,"Why Was the Mueller Report Delivered to Congress on CDs? Within the more than 400 pages of the Mueller report released Thursday, plenty of space is dedicated to the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, the Russian troll organization that’s been hard at work since at least 2013, churning out deceptive memes, posts, and more on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and even Pokémon Go —all with the intention of swaying political conversations and stoking social divisions around the world. The report found that no one in the Trump campaign knowingly interacted with anyone from the Internet Research Agency. But it does lay out some new information about how the operation worked. We got a close look at the troll operation when special counsel Robert Mueller indicted it and 13 Russian nationals in February 2018. The new report goes further, though, in examining how skilled the agency was at deceiving people offline, too—and also gives us a nice opportunity to reexamine and piece together some details that dripped out in the past couple of years while we waited for the final report. The Russian trolls planned dozens of rallies across the U.S. ahead of and even after the 2016 election. The first known Russian operative–organized event was a “Confederate rally” in Houston in 2015, according to new information provided in the Mueller report. An Instagram account called “Stand for Freedom” invited people to join with a post attempting (and failing) to sound like a normal American trying to get the word out about a party. “Good evening buds! Well I am planning to organize a confederate rally […] in Houston on the 14 of November and I want more people to attend,” the post read. The report describes the IRA’s attempts at field research in the U.S. In 2014, before the Internet Research Agency’s efforts to rile U.S. voters were in full swing, four employees applied to travel to the U.S., pretending to be friends who met at a party. But only two of the women who applied were granted visas, which allowed them to travel to America to conduct intelligence gathering, such as taking photographs that could then be later used in social media posts. It’s not clear how long they stayed. The reconnaissance may have helped them later plan rallies across the country, some of which attracted hundreds of attendees. The Mueller report gives the playbook for how the trolls were able to organize these events from an office in St. Petersburg, Russia: First, the IRA used one of its preexisting social media personas (Facebook groups and Twitter accounts, for example) to announce and promote the event. The IRA then sent a large number of direct messages to followers of its social media account asking them to attend the event. From those who responded with interest in attending, the IRA then sought a U.S. person to serve as the event’s coordinator. In most cases, the IRA account operator would tell the U.S. person that they personally could not attend the event because of some preexisting conflict or because they were somewhere else in the United States. The IRA then further promoted the event by contacting U.S. media about the event and directing them to speak with the coordinator. One of the larger rallies was held in Miami in August 2016. The Trump campaign took notice of this covertly Russian-organized event and posted images of the rally on the then-candidate’s official Facebook page, prompting a Russian troll–operated fake American persona, Matt Skiber, to boast in a Facebook message that “Mr. Trump posted about our event in Miami! This is great!” Black Matters, one of the larger Russian-run fake activist Facebook groups, hosted an event page for a protest in New York City the weekend after Trump won the election, which it promoted with an ad. More than 16,700 people signed up to attend on the event page, while 33,000 more listed themselves as interested. The Guardian at the time wrote that thousands of people actually showed up with protest signs in tow, though many of those protesters likely heard about the demonstration through other channels also promoting the rally. Internet Research Agency operatives didn’t mind looking weird in their quest to stoke tensions in America’s deeply polarized political climate. Beyond the rallies, Russian agents were also selling sex toys, offering free self-defense classes in New York, recruiting Americans to work with them through job listings, soliciting women to send photos for a calendar, and even offering counseling to followers of a page called Army of Jesus who were struggling with porn addiction, as detailed in research last year from New Knowledge , a firm that studies Russian disinformation. One of the more bizarre anecdotes in the Mueller report on the Internet Research Agency’s organizing explains that the Russian trolls once even attempted to recruit someone to walk around New York City dressed as Santa Claus in a Donald Trump mask. But unfortunately, the report doesn’t say whether they found anyone up to the task. Facebook, Twitter, and Google testified to Congress in 2017 about their efforts to rid their platforms of inauthentic behavior from the Kremlin-connected troll factory. Before the 2018 midterm elections, Facebook shared that it removed more than 100 more Facebook and Instagram accounts “due to concerns that they were linked to” the Internet Research Agency. The U.S. went so far as to turn off the IRA’s internet on Election Day 2018. The final Mueller report still leaves a lot of questions unanswered about the scale of the impact of the Russian trolls’ attempts to make our elections awful. But it seems clear that 2020 is going to be weird, too."
