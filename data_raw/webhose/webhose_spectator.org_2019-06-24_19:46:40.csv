Memorial Day 2019: Cutting the Cross of Christ,spectator.org,Paul Kengor,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/memorial-day-2019-cutting-the-cross-of-christ/,"by Frank Schell
T his Memorial Day 2019 brings another sorry dispatch from the Kultursmog .
One of the major Supreme Court decisions we’ll soon hear about is the Bladensburg cross case. This is the case in which secularists are demanding the removal of a large cross that memorializes veterans in the town of Bladensburg, Maryland, because the cross resides on public property. To some, the mere sight apparently elicits hisses and shrieks. The cross must fall.
The cross, of course, wasn’t erected yesterday. The “Peace Cross” was constructed in 1925 in honor of 49 fallen veterans of World War I. It was designed by the Gold Star mothers and erected by the local post of the American Legion.
The case is known as The American Legion v. The American Humanist Association . The “humanists” argue that the memorial is unconstitutional because it’s fashioned in the shape of a cross on government property, and thus stands in violation of “separation of church and state” — a phrase, of course, not found anywhere in the U.S. Constitution. That language was expressed by Thomas Jefferson in his 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists, and has been badly abused and misinterpreted ever since.
The fact that the cross is a cross is what makes it unacceptable. Replace it with a statue of Barney the purple dinosaur and all would be peachy. I suppose you could replace it with a statue to Lucifer and satisfied secularists would withdraw their objection.
Secularists like to appeal to the First Amendment of the Constitution, which says, in part, that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” Obviously, allowing the old cross to continue to stand would not create a congressional “establishment of religion.” Anyone who thinks allowing this cross to remain means that the feds are conspiring to implement a national theocracy needs to have his head examined. As they invoke that select handful of words from the First Amendment, the secularists misleadingly do what they always do, namely — avoid the remainder of what the First Amendment says abut freedom of religion: the government “shall not prohibit the free exercise thereof.” The American Legion and Gold Star mothers of Bladensburg exercised their freedom of religion in 1925 to honor their fallen brothers and sons.
The secularists, however, could give a rip.
This is an outrage. It is hostility toward religion, pure and simple. It is also a yet another remarkable example of secular-liberal intolerance. How can people who preach diversity be so blatantly intolerant of the beliefs of others?
For a sense of the lack of respect, consider one of the worst affronts in the case:
A federal appeals court in October 2017 had ruled the cross unconstitutional, asserting that it “excessively entangles” the government with religion. That verdict was rendered in a 2-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, which argued that the Peace Cross “aggrandizes the Latin cross” and thereby constitutes a U.S. government endorsement of Christianity. So said a 33-page opinion written by Judge Stephanie Thacker and joined by Judge James A. Wynn Jr.
Thacker’s overall opinion demonstrated a troubling lack of historical-theological awareness. But worst of all was the insensitivity displayed during oral arguments. Thacker , an Obama appointee approved by the U.S. Senate in 2012 by a vote of 91-3, offered a truly novel solution. During oral arguments , Thacker asked the attorney defending the memorial: “What about… my suggestion of chopping the arms off?”
Whoa, say that again?
Yes, the judge offered a compromise: slice off the horizontal arms. You heard that right: slice off the arms from the cross of Christ.
Can you imagine? Can you picture it? Truly, picture it in your mind. Grab a photo of the memorial and do your own airbrush. How does it look? The cross becomes a pillar.
For the record, Jesus Christ was scourged at a pillar. Also for the record, the Peace Cross, mercifully, does not have a corpus. (Another Latin lesson: “corpus” is Latin for “body.”) Thus, the demolition crew wouldn’t be sawing off the arms of Jesus.
But imagine the precedent proposed. Presumably, using the Thacker Solution, similar memorial crosses on government property could all be targeted for arm-removal.
In fact, that prompts this thought: in the interest of fairness and equality, Judge Thacker, why stop with crosses? Shouldn’t we also target the horizontal parts of the Star of David — another religious symbol — if we find them as memorials on government property?
Let’s go on a search nationwide for memorials to fallen Jewish soldiers. Are there any large Stars of David erected on government property that we should hunt down? We could permit them to remain only if we saw off the horizontal parts. Unfortunately, the star would no longer be a star, but that seems a minor trifle for the magnificent greater good of not “entangling” government with religion. So long as we spare the nation the ominous implementation of a national theocracy.
As for my beloved Jewish friends, no offense — but it’s apparently crucial we do this. Grab the axes!
Sarcasm aside, I pose a serious question to Judge Thacker and the secularists: Do you not see how your objections to the cross of Christ might be offensive? In the name of not offending a few, you’re offending many. In the name of inclusion, you’re excluding. In the name of tolerance, you’re engaging in intolerance.
It isn’t like this cross was planted yesterday or is being scheduled for 2020. It has been there for nearly a hundred years. Can’t you leave it alone at least for that reason? This isn’t a bronzed statue of a Confederate general who whipped slaves on a plantation. This is a testimony to the faith of the men who died for their country in World War I — for peace. Do you not see the aggression in your actions? This smacks of a hostile pursuit.
If this was a giant Star of David on public land, I’d be the first to stand with a group of rabbis demanding we back off and respect a century-old memorial. That’s the difference between conservatives and liberals. A conservative like myself will fight for the rights of every Christian and Jew and cross and Star of David — and for the rights of Muslims as well. The same isn’t true for secular liberals. They pick and choose. They’re the first to harass, fine, sue, shut down, and toss in jail the Christian baker, florist, or marriage clerk. I will defend the liberty of a Muslim baker in Dearborn as well as a Christian baker in Colorado. I will defend the right of an Orthodox Jewish caterer to decline a wedding on the Sabbath just as I’ll defend the right of a Christian florist in Washington state to decline a same-sex wedding ceremony that violates the teachings of her faith and her freedom of conscience.
You folks, however, will not. You target Christians. A colleague of mine who’s an attorney on religious-liberty cases tells me he’s unaware of a single case in which a same-sex couple has sued a Muslim baker for declining a same-sex wedding ceremony. Progressives will not pursue Muslims, even as Muslim bakers likewise openly refuse homosexual couples . Leftists want Christian scalps in their culture war, not Muslim ones.
You folks are the true intolerants when it comes to Christian religious freedom. Show us otherwise by having the decency to leave the Bladensburg memorial cross alone."
No Winners in Infrastructure Spat,spectator.org,Debra J. Saunders,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/no-winners-in-infrastructure-spat/,"No Winners in Infrastructure Spat Another intervention from Speaker Pelosi. by Frank Schell
H ere’s a scary thought about last week’s skirmishes between President Donald Trump and the Democratic leaders formerly known to him as “Chuck and Nancy”: Both sides think they won.
When both parties think they’ve won, dear reader, that probably means you lost. Because there always has to be a big loser in Washington.
The plot device in last week’s soap opera was a $2 trillion infrastructure package. After last month’s infrastructure meeting with Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer emerged from the West Wing to tout an agreement on the big-dollar price tag and the initiative’s scope, which would encompass not only roads, airports and water but also broadband, housing and clean energy.
Glowing, Schumer told reporters that, during the session, Trump never even mentioned the 11 congressional investigations into his finances, taxes, Russian ties, possible obstruction of justice and more. “He didn’t bring it up,” Schumer offered.
Pelosi had asked for the meeting — which was supposed to show she is serious about getting things done. Forget that the package was a $2 trillion pipe dream.
I still haven’t heard a good answer as to why Trump sat back while Pelosi and Schumer said he had agreed to present the details of how he would pay for the massive spending plan, because that never was going to happen. Even if Trump agreed to raise the gasoline tax, that wouldn’t pay for the package. And the fact that the Democrats pushed for Trump to agree to take back parts of his signature 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which would never happen — shows they weren’t remotely serious.
With absolutely no plan to bankroll this big boondoggle, Trump on Tuesday night sent Pelosi and Schumer a letter telling them he wouldn’t talk infrastructure until Congress passed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
After meeting with impeachment-focused members of her caucus Wednesday morning, Pelosi told reporters, “We believe the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.”
Pelosi has said she believes Trump is trying to “goad” Democrats toward impeachment. Former Trump surrogate Jeffrey Lord agrees. “He thinks he wins because the public will hate impeachers,” Lord told the Review-Journal .
But just before heading across town to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to meet Trump, Pelosi charged Trump with engaging in a “cover-up.” It’s as if she was goading Trump to goad her caucus to impeach him.
Pelosi’s provocative accusation gave Trump an excuse to wave a transparently false rationale for calling off the infrastructure talk. As Schumer later noted, Trump didn’t see the House probes as deal-killers in April. And the night before, Trump gave a different reason for not talking bridges and water.
Some readers tell me they are fine with Trump saying one thing one day and another the next, because messing with Democrats’ heads shows he’s a fighter. OK. But in this case, the head fake got him nothing — or nothing but a lousy “No Collusion” T-shirt from his trip to the Rose Garden.
Trump may have wanted to signal that Democrats can’t handle the Mueller report’s failure to establish his campaign’s collusion with Russia. But he also broadcast that he won’t work with Democrats on an issue he supposedly champions.
To show his displeasure, Trump switched from calling the California Democrat his usual “Nancy” to “Speaker Pelosi” and demoted Schumer to “Sen. Schumer” — with no reference to the New Yorker’s leadership role.
On escalation Thursday, Trump was back to a first-name basis, as the nickname pugilist called the speaker “crazy Nancy.”
Pelosi engages in the same game with a different demeanor. Like Don Corleone’s long-suffering wife, she offered that she prays for Trump’s soul “ardently.”
My theory: Pelosi accepts impeachment as inevitable, but she wants to make everyone think she tried to stop her House’s nuclear option. Like a lot of folks in my profession, I once bought that act. But it’s hard to believe Pelosi wants to cool down the temperature as she calmly and efficiently needles Trump.
On escalation Thursday, Pelosi told reporters, “I wish that his family or his staff would have an intervention for the good of the country.”
Crazy Nancy. Intervention-worthy Donald. What’s the difference? Syllables.

Remember the Union,spectator.org,Roger Kaplan,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/remember-the-union/,"by Daniel J. Flynn
T he program on Memorial Day ought to be — well, it ought to be whatever you want it to be, after all, this is a free country and the whole idea is that we are remembering those who gave all to keep it that way.
You could spend a part of the day laying flowers on a grave, or reading to your children about the Saratoga Campaign, or the battle of Lake Erie, or you could get into the better known, more written about, places of terror and valor, Shiloh, Antietam — you could read to them from Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote.
It was, after all, the Civil War that gave rise to the custom of celebrating Memorial Day, as important a date as any other in our civic religion, now weakened. It began with the practice adopted by Southern women to tend to the graves of their fallen husbands, brothers, sons. It was not easy, their land having been laid waste, so they banded together to raise the needed funds and share the chores. And the grief, and the memories.
Northerners of course remembered their fallen too, erected monuments, designated commemorative dates. Eventually, in the 1880s, the customs, now traditions, merged as veterans of both sides met together, agreeing they all had fought honorably and in some mysterious way had equally sacrificed that the great Republic should survive.
Our friends — our ex-friends? — at the Bulwark finally did something useful in reproducing for the occasion the text of Oliver Wendell Holmes’ address to a group of veterans on Memorial Day 1884. It is a speech that should be read, taught, in every high school. Holmes, later named to the Supreme Court by Theodore Roosevelt, was himself a wounded and decorated Civil War veteran who had risen through the ranks, and he movingly evokes the fallen among his comrades, while assuring his listeners that their former enemies were no less honorable and brave.
And he notes that in coming together on a day such as this, “… by common consent we pause to become conscious of our national life and to rejoice in it, to recall what our country has done for each of us and to ask ourselves what we can do for the country in return.”
A young veteran would return to that very theme some 80 years, and several wars, later. It comes, I think, spontaneously, to countless young people. And they act on it — they join the military, they go to work in school districts others have abandoned, they become firemen, policemen, active participants in their churches’ community projects.
People vary in what they give, and their commitments naturally are not equal, but that does not matter — people are not the same, as well they ought not be.
The point is elsewhere, the point being, you owe more than you are owed. That is what Memorial Day is about. You can do what you want on Memorial Day, so long as you remember that were it not for the giving of the “last full measure” that it recalls, you will eventually do only what some tyrant or tyrannical regime allows you to do.
The threat today, to the Republic, lies in the inability to come to the “perfect accord” that, according to Holmes, allows Americans to transcend their differences because they respect contrary opinions and agree that we have a system for dealing with disagreements without precipitating regime crises.
If you think of what they whom we remember and revere on this day gave to sustain this nation and perpetuate it, you will become aware of how dangerous the present state of our political culture has become.
We have somehow permitted a culture to develop that in effect encourages subversion. Political figures are openly anti-American, work with our enemies, sow distrust of the rules by which we choose leaders, strive to overturn elections. This is a recipe for selfish mayhem, not orderly government.
Daniel Webster, in the years leading to the Civil War, habitually greeted others with the question, How fares the Union? To truly remember our fallen heroes, I think, we should be mindful of the Union, and what it takes to keep it safe."
Declassification and Cognitive Dissonance in the Media,spectator.org,David Catron,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/declassification-and-cognitive-dissonance-in-the-media/,"Declassification and Cognitive Dissonance in the Media How the media stopped worrying and learned to love the CIA. Rep. Adam Schiff (YouTube screenshot) Top Stories by Daniel J. Flynn
W hen Nancy Pelosi decided to appease the impeachment hawks in her caucus by accusing President Trump of engaging in a cover-up, the media responded with undisguised glee. The New York Times , for example, ran a story that essentially congratulated the House Speaker for publicly goading the man. Trump responded by giving them transparency good and hard. He not only instructed the various intelligence agencies to assist Attorney General William Barr with his inquiry into the inception of the Russia investigation, but gave Barr authority to declassify related intelligence material. Oddly, the media have suddenly lost their enthusiasm for transparency.
Having already accused Barr of using his office to protect President Trump from the consequences of his fictitious crimes, the media were not pleasantly surprised when Trump issued his May 23 Memorandum giving Barr full authority to “declassify, downgrade, or direct the declassification or downgrading of information or intelligence that relates to the Attorney General’s review.” That put the various “news” outlets in a position whereby they were forced to object to Barr’s all but inevitable declassification of documents relating to the Russia investigation even as they accused him of participating in a “cover-up.” This required some fancy editorial footwork.
The Times has executed a particularly dizzying pirouette. The editors of the newspaper that published the Pentagon Papers — and countless subsequent stories containing illegally leaked government secrets — have evidently had a road to Damascus experience with regard to the necessity of protecting classified information. In an article titled, “Potential Clash Over Secrets Looms Between Justice Dept. and C.I.A,” Julian E. Barnes and David E. Sanger admit that “the ultimate power to declassify documents rests with the president.” Yet they worry that Trump’s order will (heaven forefend) render the CIA impotent in bureaucratic territorial disputes:
President Trump’s order allowing Attorney General William P. Barr to declassify any intelligence that led to the Russia investigation… effectively strips the agency of its most critical power: choosing which secrets it shares and which ones remain hidden.… Traditionally, the C.I.A. has been effective at intramural governmental fights, in large measure because its power comes from its information and its closely guarded secrets.
And who in the world would want to reduce the power wielded within the bowels of the federal bureaucracy by paragons of virtue such as John Brennan? Well, House Intel Chair Adam Schiff for one. The Times quotes him thus: “Mr. Trump’s order could be tremendously damaging to the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, drying up sources and inhibiting their ability to gather intelligence.” And, displaying his trademark gift for unintentional irony, Schiff suggests that the President’s order might introduce an unsavory element of politics into the way intelligence is used inside the Beltway: “The president now seems intent on declassifying intelligence to weaponize it.”
At the Washington Post , meanwhile, Jeff Bezos’ team of seasoned editors and crack reporters has apparently concluded that democracy thrives in darkness. The Post suggests that the President should not have given Attorney General William Barr such broad authority to declassify information relating to the origin of the Russia investigation because it is “unprecedented” and “extraordinary” and causes concern among various and sundry “current and former intelligence officials.” It doesn’t seem to have occurred to anyone at that storied publication that these are almost certainly the very reasons that President Trump entrusted Barr with this responsibility:
Ordinarily, any review of intelligence activities would be done by the Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats. But in giving that authority to Barr, the president has turned to someone he perceives as a loyalist and who has already said that he thinks the government spied on the Trump campaign.… Trump has never considered Coats a close or effective adviser, and earlier this year administration officials thought the president might fire him.
The Post exhumes a variety of former Obama administration officials to comment on the President’s order: “Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy director, called it ‘potentially dangerous’ to let Barr decide what to declassify, because ‘the DNI is in the best position to judge the damage to intelligence sources and methods.’” Robert Litt, another Obama administration retread, is quoted thus: “The part of this order that I find the most troubling says that the attorney general should consult with intelligence community elements on declassification ‘to the extent he deems it practicable.’” The obvious insinuation is that Barr will forego the consultation step.
This is absurd, of course. It couldn’t be more obvious that Attorney General Barr is about as honest as they get in Washington and, unlike those “current and former intelligence officials,” he doesn’t have a dog in the fight. Nor is there any possibility that a man with his long record of unsullied integrity is going to risk damaging that reputation by bending the rules on behalf of the President or any other official in D.C. This is precisely why he refused to comply with the subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee demanding a completely un-redacted copy of the Mueller report. That would have required violating federal law, and this man just doesn’t “play that.”
Consequently, the media must report the “news” in a way that requires them to claim two contradictory “facts” are both true: The President and AG Barr are engaged in a cover-up but are also involved in a nefarious plot to declassify and release as much information as possible. Media hacks at the New York Times and the Washington Post get paid to endure the cognitive dissonance caused by fabulist Adam Schiff, who responded to President Trump’s declassification order by claiming , “The cover-up has entered a new and dangerous phase. This is un-American.” For normal people dwelling beyond the Beltway — the voters — this gibberish just doesn’t cut it."
Trump Let the Dogs Out,spectator.org,Jed Babbin,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/trump-let-the-dogs-out/,"Trump Let the Dogs Out Those responsible for the coup attempt against the president can run but they can no longer hide. by John Glynn
T he Democrats, stumbling down the road to impeachment, were stunned by President Trump’s executive order on Thursday.
The order is in two parts. First, it directs the intelligence agencies to cooperate with Attorney General William Barr’s investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia counterintelligence investigation that was the vehicle used to spy on candidate Trump’s campaign and President Trump’s administration when it was new.
The second part of the order delegates to Barr the president’s authority to declassify — or reduce the level of classification of — anything that the intelligence agencies will give him.
Leaving on his trip to Japan on Friday, Trump said “We want to be very transparent, so as you know, I declassified everything. We are exposing everything.” He specifically mentioned that Barr would be looking at the involvement of several nations including the UK, Australia, and Ukraine.
Trump let the dogs out. The necessity for this action has been comprehensively clear for more than a year, and I have been advocating it for that long.
While he was chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Devin Nunes tried to get the FBI to testify truthfully and provide him the documents that show how it abused its law enforcement powers to investigate Trump. Nunes’s January 2018 memorandum — of which the FBI fought declassification as long as it could — revealed enormous abuses of power by the FBI in seeking and obtaining — on false grounds — surveillance warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act from the FISA Court.
As I wrote last year ( here and here ), Nunes demonstrated that what the FBI did in the Trump investigation was worse than Watergate. Nunes also demonstrated conclusively that nothing other than a presidential order to declassify the documents and testimony the FBI was concealing could overcome the FBI’s stonewalling.
The resignation of Attorney General Sessions who had turned over supervision of the “Russia collusion” investigation to Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, and the confirmation of AG William Barr to his job, solved that problem. Rosenstein, who had discussed wearing a recording device for his conversations with President Trump and possibly removing him using the 25 th Amendment, unsurprisingly never insisted that the FBI give Nunes what he needed. Barr’s accession to the AG’s post made him boss of the FBI and able to obtain anything it has. The FBI can’t stonewall Barr.
But the intelligence community can, or at least could, until Trump’s Thursday order.
Predictably, the people who are at greatest risk of exposure and danger of indictment erupted at Trump’s order. For example, Obama’s CIA chief, John Brennan, told an interviewer,“I see it as a very, very serious and outrageous move on the part of Mr. Trump, once again, trampling on the statutory authorities of the Director of National Intelligence and the heads of the independent intelligence agencies.” Brennan continued: “And it’s unclear to me what Mr. Barr is actually going to do. Is he investigating a crime? Well, what’s the predication of that crime? Or he is just going to be looking for information… that Mr. Trump can just give to his defenders on the right and cherry-pick information that could be taken out of context?”
That’s pretty rich coming from one of the coup plotters who must have personally approved if not instigated the counterintelligence investigation of Trump and his team. Their whole exercise — not Barr’s — was searching for a crime in the manner of Stalin’s secret police chief Lavrenti Beria who once said, “Show me the man and I’ll show you the crime.”
Brennan and his fellow plotters chose a counterintelligence investigation because it could be kept secret and because there was no evidence of a crime, only the unverified Steele Dossier created by the Clinton campaign. And when that investigation came up dry, then-FBI director James Comey, as he admitted, sent two memos about Trump’s supposed misdeeds to a friend for the express purposes that they would be leaked to the New York Times and cause the appointment of a special counsel. Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, one of Comey’s closest personal friends, to be special counsel investigating Trump’s supposed collusion with the Russians.
Just how many Jim Comeys, Peter Strzoks, John Brennans, and Jim Clappers are still employed by the CIA, NSA, and other intelligence agencies? Did Comey, Brennan, Clapper, and their teams of lawyers and spies break the law in their “counterintelligence” investigation — i.e., spying campaign — directed against candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign and continuing through the first months of his presidency?
There are three investigations going on. The Department of Justice Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, is investigating the FBI’s actions as is U.S. Attorney for the District of Utah, John Huber. The IG investigation (which is limited in that it can only question current DoJ employees, not those such as Comey who are no longer employed by the FBI) is reportedly about finished. Horowitz’s report is expected next month. Huber’s investigation is not limited in that manner. However, Huber has been so silent about his investigation that we don’t know what he has accomplished if anything.
The third investigation is apparently focused on the intelligence agencies. It reportedly began about two months ago under John Durham, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.
Trump’s order was probably issued because Durham — acting under Barr’s authority as AG — met severe resistance to any request for specific intelligence information from the intel agencies. Trump’s appointees (CIA Director Gina Haspel, DNI Dan Coats, and NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone) should cooperate with Barr. But they — and the Obama sympathizers who work for them — will be no more cooperative with Barr than the FBI was with Nunes.
The CIA and NSA may have a lot to hide.
Intelligence works in a lot of odd ways. It crosses national boundaries regularly at light speed. The “Five Eyes” program, which enables us and several key allies — Canada, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand — to share intelligence, may have been one of the vehicles that Hillary Clinton’s campaign used to produce and market its false narrative about Trump.
When the Clinton campaign paid for and then began marketing the “Steele Dossier” — the “intelligence information” created by former MI6 spy Christopher Steele — about six people offered it to the FBI. It contained a lot of anonymous allegations (some salacious) of misconduct by Trump which were never verified. There is every reason to suspect that Steele also offered it to the CIA, the NSA, and other intelligence agencies because of his MI6 pedigree. (Sir Richard Dearlove, who headed MI6 from 1999 to 2004, reportedly said that Steele was the “go to person” on Russian matters especially as they reported on the commercial side of affairs.)
The Steele’s dossier found its way to the CIA or NSA. Did they, through “Five Eyes,” share it with MI6 and our other English-speaking intelligence partners?
One of my best friends from Air Force days had an odd way of having fun. He’d start a rumor just to see how long it took for it to be repeated back to him. Did the CIA or NSA share the Steele Dossier with “Five Eyes” as a means of creating a reliability pedigree for it? Did Dearlove or other foreign intelligence officials give Steele credibility and thus create a pedigree for his Dossier?
We know that part of the spying campaign took place in England. A woman working for the FBI as an undercover informant, Azra Turk posing as an assistant to Stefan Halper, an American professor at Cambridge University, met with George Papadopoulos, a minor advisor to the Trump campaign, at a London bar in 2016. She asked Papadopoulos if the Trump campaign was working covertly with the Russian government. What else did the FBI do in England and other countries to peddle that theory? Halper was probably also working for the FBI or the CIA.
We’ll probably never know despite the president’s order. The nations whose intelligence involvement could be revealed will do everything they can to pressure Trump to not reveal their involvement. Moreover, the CIA and NSA will kick and scream and resist every request Barr and Durham make for any intelligence information.
Barr’s investigations may even affect the 2020 election. For example, it’s inconceivable that the FBI under Comey and the CIA under Brennan would have conducted the spying campaign against Trump without either the specific approval or at least knowing acquiescence of Obama himself. It’s more than likely that then-vice president Joe Biden also knew. Biden’s involvement, if shown, could lose the election for him if he became the Democrats’ nominee.
Barr’s investigations may — and probably should — result in indictments of former FBI officials as well as former and current members of the intelligence community. Regardless of whether it does, Barr’s investigations will finally reveal what the public deserves to know about the abuses of power the FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies committed in the attempted coup against a fairly-elected president.

What Next in Europe? | The American Spectator,spectator.org,Roger Kaplan,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/what-next-in-europe/,"by John Glynn
I n the European Parliament elections, held last week, parties critical of the direction of the European Union made substantial, but not decisive, gains. For the first time since 1979, when direct election of deputies by party lists was introduced, neither of the big formations will command a majority.
About a quarter of the European Parliament’s 750 seats will be occupied by deputies representing variously named Eurosceptics — “populists,” “extreme rightists,” “nationalists,” “sovereignists.”
The major formations, which band together for the purpose of forming parliamentary blocs, are the center right conservatives who sit as the PPE, European People’s Party, and the non-communist left, who sit as the Party of European Socialists or, for the latest edition, Socialists and Democrats.
However, the Eurosceptics can at best hope for the Europarliamentary equivalent of a minority government, since they will not hold anything close to a majority of the seats either.
But a “minority government” is dubious, primarily because the parliament’s role in the governance of the European Union is minor. It can exert a feeble objection to the executive’s decisions, but it cannot command it to adopt its preferred initiatives. Not only is the executive, called the Commission, in Brussels, not in Strasbourg with the parliament, it is more beholden to the national governments than to the European parliamentarians.
More realistically, the success of the Eurosceptics might be, in Wlady Pleszczynski’s apt comparison, somewhat akin to the stand of Boris Yeltsin at the Russian Duma when the neo-Bolsheviks attempted a coup against his government following the collapse of the Soviet state. Under Eurosceptic leadership, the Strasbourg Parliament may be able to restrain the administrative tyranny of the Brussels super-state, and gradually push the European Union in the direction of local power and what we might term nation-states’ rights.
It must be kept in mind that while no single party, establishment or skeptic, commands a majority in the new parliament, the establishment types are still stronger. A coalition of center-right conservatives and center-liberals, or Greens, or some other combination, can maintain the broad lines of what has been the mainstream Euro-establishment program, based on the principle of a single market.
None of the rebels, except the British ones, favor leaving the EU. They want to reform the Union from within, and they have various notions of what this entails. The establishment will be able to play on their needs and national interests — for example, in bartering transfer payments (aka European Structural Funds, in plain English welfare) for votes on environmental or even border-control issues.
In recent years, the dominant, super-statist European agenda has been criticized as favoring market capitalism at the expense of the welfare state policies that were conceived in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries (by conservative as well as social-democratic parties) and that were implemented in various forms after World War II.
The gains last week of the anti-Establishment parties are by no means unexpected. They have been making progress for some time in national polls, precisely because of the perceived (and often real) sense that the welfare-state is not working as promised, while wealth inequalities have been widening. France’s Rassemblement National (ex- Front National ) came in second in the last presidential election, ahead of the center-left neo-Gaullists and the center-left Socialists. Italy’s Lega (ex- Lega Norte ) sits in the current governing coalition as the dominant partner.
Although these parties are called “extreme right,” they are such mainly in their championing of traditional views of national sovereignty. They are not necessarily free-market liberals by any means, and in fact they are good examples of why Friedrich Hayek, a very traditional central European gentleman and political philosopher, eschewed the term conservative and referred to himself as a liberal.
The fact of the matter is that the Eurosceptics, outside Britain, are primarily interested in the national question, and that does not mean they have a common vision. The governing party in Hungary, Fidesz, which until recently sat with the PPE in the Strasbourg Parliament, made its mark by staunchly opposing the European establishment’s migration policy. It never objected to EU transfer payments.
Immigration was also the emblematic issue of the French National movement by whatever name, as well as the Italian Lega. As the Lega Nord, indeed, it was anti-Italian, or at least anti-southern Italian. It favored autonomy for Tuscany and the Piedmont and its leadership, notably the charismatic Matteo Salvini, referred to southerners as welfare bums and monkeys.
It is not at all clear how well the various new anti-establishment Eurodeputies will get along, if at all. Some, like the French National Front types, are frankly anti-American; the Hungarians, Poles, Slovenians, are far better inclined toward us, but they must be wary of their large and sometimes threatening neighbor to the east and our own historical fickleness with regard to their needs and independence.
The championing of common European values against large influxes of non-European migrants may serve as a usable slogan, but these values have not in the past prevented sovereign European states from committing mass murder against one another.
As in previous Europarliament elections, the voting carries symbolic importance for national politics. Slightly ahead (22 percent to 21 percent) of Macron, Marine Le Pen will press for heightened spending in depressed regions, as well as restrictions on immigration, and will carry these themes into the next presidential and national parliamentary electoral cycles. Matteo Salvini, will also favor policies to limit immigration, while arguing that Italy should not be under the fiscal and budgetary discipline of the EU Commission. In England, Nigel Farage may launch a bid for a third-party conquest of the next Parliament, or else will make a deal with the “hard-Brexit” Conservatives who will be taking over the leadership of their party from Theresa May in coming weeks.
A shock but not necessarily an earthquake, the elections may have a useful consequence for U.S. policy. No one has been able to answer the question posed by Henry Kissinger: “When you want Europe, whom do you ring?” Now, it may well be that for important calls, we dial whoever is in charge in the capital of the country we want to talk to. As we did in the forgotten past."
The Real Constitutional Crisis,spectator.org,F.H. Buckley,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/the-real-constitutional-crisis/,"by John Glynn
I n case you haven’t been listening, we’re supposed to be in the middle of a constitutional crisis. That’s what Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler are telling us, and it’s all because Donald Trump and Bill Barr are refusing to submit to House subpoenas.
Never mind that Trump allowed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to interview everyone he wanted, without asserting executive privilege, and that everything you might want to know about the administration is out there in Mueller’s report. (It’s not always pretty.) Never mind that, when the shoe was on the other foot, Obama ruled by decree and Eric Holder didn’t want to talk about Fast and Furious.
So even by Democratic standards, it sounds pretty hysterical. But there is a quiet constitutional crisis that’s happening, underneath all the noise.
We’ve got a constitution with a separation of powers which assumes that people can work together. That’s supposed to ensure that bad policies will be screened away and that only good policies will be enacted. But when one party refuses to work with the other, nothing gets enacted. That’s supposed eventually to bring both sides to the table, and in the past that’s what always happened. Except for that one time, in 1861.
Now it’s happening again. It’s not like 1995, when Bill Clinton could turn on a dime and work with Newt Gingrich, or 2001 when George W. Bush got along with Teddy Kennedy. This time it looks more permanent. If Trump is Hitler and the dictator Nadler is warning us about, then you don’t expect to see any deals getting cut.
What’s different today is the Democrats have bought into the idea of “no enemies on the left,” which means they’re prisoners of the most radical people on their fringes. They hang out with Louis Farrakhan, and we’re still waiting for them to condemn the Antifa rioters. In 1992 Bill Clinton cut loose anti-white racist Sister Souljah, but since then identity politics and racism have gone mainstream in the Party and we don’t see any Sister Souljah Moments from them today.
Like children playing with fire, they’ve bought into ideas that put them far outside the mainstream, and they’re several standard deviations to the left of where they used to be. Bill Clinton thought that abortion should be “safe, legal and rare,” but that’s not where the present party is. We’ll see you later-term abortions, and raise you infanticide, says Gov. Ralph Northam. The very woke Beto O’Rourke seeks the blessing of Al Sharpton and endorses racial reparations. As for the green new deal, if the world is going to end in 12 years, it’s whoopee time and anything goes.
That’s not a crisis, however. That’s just lunacy, and it’s something the voters can correct. Where you have a crisis is where one party kisses goodbye to the most fundamental understanding about our system of government. Things like the idea that the winner of the Electoral College is the duly elected president, that there’s something special about American citizenship, something not shared with non-citizens. Or simply the idea that Americans should be proud of their country. When all of that is out the window, when one party no longer thinks that our form of government is legitimate because it’s undemocratic, because abortion rights aren’t protected and because Republicans sometimes win, then you have a constitutional crisis.
So should we get worked up about that? No. It’s like that 1914 Austrian telegram: “situation grave but not serious.” It’s only serious if you take Jerry Nadler and AOC seriously, and you won’t do that if you’ve preserved your sense of humor.
When one party goes so far off the rails, the best strategy for the other party is to be the only adult in the room. Admittedly, Donald Trump hasn’t always helped, but if the Republicans stick to Trump’s policies, the ones that explain the Revolution of 2016, that constitutional crisis is going to fizzle out.
America’s creed is liberalism, the traditionally Democratic idea that freedom is better than repression, that free markets beat socialism, that we don’t prefer one set of people on the basis of their race or religion, that free speech trumps censorship, that our government should provide an economy with jobs for everyone who can work and a generous safety net for those who can’t. It’s pretty basic stuff, but if today’s Democrats have abandoned it and the Republicans seize the mantle of old-fashioned liberalism, they can become America’s natural governing party."
"O Bernie, Where Art Thou?",spectator.org,John Glynn,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/o-bernie-where-art-thou/,"O Bernie, Where Art Thou? Bernie Sanders’ magic has gone pfft! by Daniel J. Flynn
B ernie Sanders wears a permanent frown. It’s the kind of face an individual pulls after stepping in canine excrement. Now, the Vermont native has a genuine reason to look unhappy. The self-described Democratic socialist continues to drop in the polls. According to the latest Fox News survey , Sanders has dropped 6 percentage points since March. He now stands at 17 percent.
Furthermore, according to the the latest Quinnipiac poll, in a little over a year, Bernie’s favorability has dropped significantly, from 48% in January 2018 to 41% in 2019. Even among Democrats, according to the poll, Sanders has a 20% unfavorable rating.
Oh, how times changed. Just a few years ago Sanders was a darling of the left. The old dog was breathing new fire into a party overly reliant on the “wisdom” of Hilary Clinton.
Bernie was an evangelical progressive at a time when this was still somewhat of a novelty. This was his Unique Selling Point.
Free healthcare. Free education. You name it, Bernie was giving it away. However, in the space of just three years, everything has changed. Bernie is no longer the only progressive. As John Patrick Leary wrote in a piece for the New Republic , “In today’s Democratic primary field, everybody claims to see a progressive looking back at them in the mirror. Bernie Sanders has perhaps the soundest claim to the title; he co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991. But Kamala Harris also brands herself a “progressive prosecutor”; Cory Booker’s “progressive record is unimpeachable,” says his spokesperson; and even Joe Biden claims “the most progressive record of anybody.”
In 2019, you see, Bernie no longer has a Unique Selling Point. He’s just another face in an all too crowded field. What he’s selling is exactly what everyone else is selling: The stuff of fantasy and fiction, not reality.
Of course, Bernie’s descent into inconsequentiality is more nuanced than being the victim of a crowded field.
In December of 2018, more than two dozen women and men who worked on Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign requested a meeting with the senator and his top political aides. According to a copy a letter obtained by Politico , these men and women wanted to “discuss the issue of sexual violence and harassment on the 2016 campaign, for the purpose of planning to mitigate the issue in the upcoming presidential cycle.” The letter discussed the “untenable and dangerous dynamic” that developed during the senator’s campaign. Although the signees did not describe specific instances of “sexual violence and harassment” that occurred on the campaign, the statement pointed to a pervasive culture of “toxic masculinity” in the Sanders camp.
What do Bernie, the nefarious concept of “toxic masculinity,” and Harvery Weinstein have in common?
Quite a bit, actually. In October 2017, the New York Times and the New Yorker reported that more than a dozen women accused Weinstein of sexually harassing, assaulting, or raping them. Many other women in the film industry subsequently reported similar experiences with Weinstein, who denied “any nonconsensual sex.” As a result of these accusations, Weinstein was fired from his production company, suspended from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, forced to resign from the Directors Guild of America, divorced by his wife Georgina Chapman, and denounced by leading figures in politics whom he once supported.
Harvey Weinstein, a white, privileged man, became the puffy face of evil. He also became the face of “toxic masculinity.”
Millions of white men, especially those with power and money, were unceremoniously lumped into the same basket as the likes of Weinstein, many of them deemed guilty for simply existing and being successful.
Not only this, older white men with media presence and money were labeled creepy (today, Joe Biden’s hair sniffing doesn’t help the cause). As an elderly, white man with a great deal of power and influence. Bernie may very well have been swept up by the “Toxic Tornado.”
A far-fetched assumption?
No, not at all. After all, Bernie’s campaign was synonymous with the idea of the “Bernie Bro” caricature. In this post-#MeToo world, such an association is a recipe for disaster.
Couple this in with another fact. Sanders is a devout socialist. The mere mention of the “top 1 percent” is enough to make Bernie salivate and growl. He bows at the altar of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. But, he also appears to be worshipping at the altar of Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism.
According to his tax returns, Sanders’ income now puts him within the top 1 percent of taxpayers. Today, he might preach the gossip of parsimony, but he’s certainly not practicing it. From listening to him speak and observing the way he dresses, one would be forgiven for thinking that Sanders lives in a box under a bridge in Vermont.
In fact, the 77-year-old is a three-home-owning millionaire. His net worth is about $2 million. In many ways, Sanders has become one of those people he so vehemently opposes. As a psychologist, we could go all psychoanalytic here and discuss the possibility of deep self-loathing, but that is an article for another day, if ever. Sanders likes to view himself as the Rocky Balboa of the left, the self-designated champion of the underclass. He is David, tirelessly battling capitalism, otherwise known as Goliath. Instead of defeating Goliath, however, Sanders appears to be sharing a bed with “him.” Goliath has a weakness for elderly, white men, it seems.
Bernie Sanders, a man who made a career out of berating millionaires, also happens to be a millionaire socialist. A penny for your thoughts, Karl Marx."
It Is Boris’s Moment,spectator.org,"R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/it-is-boriss-moment/,"by Veronique de Rugy
W ashington
Well, the UK’s Prime Minister Theresa May has run out of gas. She is going to retire. Now the question is who will replace her. All the talk is of Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary and twice mayor of London. I could give you numerous reasons why he should be Great Britain’s prime minister, not the least of which is I met him years ago when he was editor of London’s Spectator magazine. We spectatorians have got to stick together. Moreover, if the Spectator of London can serve as a springboard to high public office, why should not the phenomenon take place on this side of the Atlantic? Already I sense my young staff is getting restless.
On the most important issue of the day in the UK Boris was an early proponent. He favored Brexit years ago. He has remained steadfast. He stands with the British majority avid to leave the EU. Mrs. May let the public down on this vital matter. She became Prime Minister while remaining lukewarm on the issue. She dithered for two years, and finally last week threw up her hands and promised to resign. Now I should think it is Boris’s turn to give the people what they want. They want to be relieved of the Brussels bureaucrats preying upon their economy. Boris will do it.
Yet influential voices in London are murmuring against him. They sound very much like what President Donald Trump calls voices from the Swamp. For a certitude they do, and we have heard it all before. From the British swamp comes dark talk of Boris’s hair. Yes, his hair. It is forever disheveled, and there are hints that the flaxen mop comes from a bottle. Critics have been obsessed by Donald’s hair too and by Ronald Reagan’s if memory serves. The critics should fasten upon something more important. Why not try his political record? He has served in Parliament for eleven years with distinction and he was twice elected mayor of London. That was when London was one of the best run cities in the world.
He has a flair for developing issues. Note his early championing of Brexit. Once it was a marginal matter. Now it is almost the only issue that matters to the British. Boris has a knack for capturing the public eye. What is more he is amusing, both as a journalist and a politician. Over the years he has written that Muslim women wearing burqas on London streets “look like letter boxes.” Well, they do, though I have never actually used the British postal service. Besides his josh inspired in me at least two columns of my own, one speculating about how many people are actually under any one burqa, and what they might be up to. He offered the thought that a Libyan city could pass for Dubai if the Libyans would only “clear the dead bodies away.” And—a personal favorite of mine—Boris claimed Barack Obama disrelished the British Empire because he was “part-Kenyan.” I can find no factual error here, and in fact the former president’s paternity is wholly admirable.
Finally, though some call him divisive, an outsider, a populist, it is just these qualities that keep him in the public eye. From all I can tell, he with his charismatic style is the most popular politician in the UK. He is just what the Tories need at this dismal point in their history.
Right now the Conservative Party is losing support from both the Remainers and the Brexiteers. The Party has to stop these defections. The most likely man to do it is Boris Johnson. Ironically, as the London Spectator ’s James Forsyth writes, “The worse things are for the Tories, the better for Boris Johnson. If the Tories were ahead in the polls, he’d have little hope of becoming leader. MPs would choose someone more clubbable.…” Well, I do not know how clubbable Boris is, but I do know that as of now he has all the headlines. The spotlight is on him. He is most likely to stop the defections from the Tory ranks because he is the most popular politician with the Tory rank and file. Most of its defections are rushing into the Brexit Party headed by Nigel Farage. The way for the Tories to stop this hemorrhaging is to make Boris Prime Minister. A new party is not what the Brexiteers want. It is a Tory who started the exit. Let a Tory complete it. That would be Boris."
Maine-Stream Madness: Measles and Misinformation,spectator.org,John Glynn,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/maine-stream-madness-measles-and-misinformation/,"
F alsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it; so that when Men come to be undeceiv’d, it is too late; the Jest is over, and the Tale has had its Effect. — Jonathan Swift (1710)
On Sunday, May 26, I came across a disturbing article published in Patheos . “Christians will leave Maine in their droves,” it read, “and many will be discouraged to settle in the state as a result of a bill ending most religious exemptions for mandatory childhood vaccines.”
This ominous warning was sounded by Lisa Keim, an outspoken Republican state Senator. Why was Ms. Keim so upset? Well, the Maine Senate had just voted 18-17 to remove religious exemptions from the state’s school vaccination law.
A clearly perturbed Keim told reporters:
We are pushing religious people out of our great state. And we will also be closing the door on religious people who may consider making Maine their home. We are fooling ourselves if we don’t believe an exodus would come about.
As the Patheos piece points out, Keim wasn’t alone in opposing the vote. Not to be outdone by Keim’s exaggerated response, Republican Senator Brad Farrin declared:
Fundamentally, this vote isn’t about public health – it’s about how far is too far for the government to reach into our personal lives. A vote against this bill isn’t a vote against vaccinations – it’s a vote in support of parental choice and religious freedoms.
Two things to address here:
Ms. Keim. Just who are “we,” when you discuss people being “pushed out” the state’s door? This is a law designed to protect people, not persecute. Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease. Can you imagine if Muslims in Maine were refusing to get vaccinated? How do you think people might respond?
Secondly, by appealing to emotion over logic, Mr. Farrin is using a classic move favored by many a politician. You see, the vote is about public health. Policy makers are not “out to get” religious folks. They are trying to protect people from getting sick. They are doing their jobs.
Thankfully, despite opposition, Janet Mills, Maine’s first female governor, used her common sense and signed the bill into effect. Her decision came just a few days after the first confirmed measles case hit the Pine Tree State.
Before joining California, Mississippi, and West Virginia in voting to eliminate religious exemptions for vaccine requirements, Maine had one of the highest rates of non-medical vaccine exemptions in the United States. Right now, as I type, there is a measles outbreak spreading across the country; it has already hit 25 states, with Maine becoming the latest state to see a confirmed case. This is 2019, not 1919, right? Just checking.
The nationwide outbreak is the largest since measles was eliminated almost twenty years ago. Interestingly, as reported in the Patheos piece, Maine is also battling an outbreak of whooping cough, You know, the highly contagious respiratory tract infection that can be combated with a vaccine.
Meanwhile, New York is also in the midst of a measles outbreak. Two of the most recent cases in New York involve pregnant women, both of whom are at risk of miscarriage.
Why do people who otherwise seem educated and rational continue to refuse vaccinations?
There is no one reason; however, a lethal mix of misinformation and myopia appear to play a significant role. Long-discredited studies falsely linking vaccines to autism have been circulating for decades, prompting some to choose herbal remedies and prayer instead of vaccinations.
Can “magical thinking,” a belief that one event happens as a result of another without a credible link of causation, explain the measles epidemic? We have all engaged in “magical thinking” at one point or another. For example: “Today, I woke up before my alarm went off; therefore it will be a great day at work.” This definition is problematic, to say the very least. What exactly constitutes “a credible link of causation,” anyway? Engaging in such thinking is childish and somewhat delusional.
Children have wonderful minds. They repeatedly engage in magical thinking. But, as the saying goes, “When I was a child, I talked like a child; I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.”
Believing in things more strongly than either evidence or experience justifies is a core tenet of being a child. However, it is not the core tenet of science.
Even the brightest among us are susceptible to false beliefs and self-defeating biases. Take Steve Jobs, for example. The man was a genius; nevertheless, he was still merely mortal. In Jobs’ 2011 biography, author Walter Isaacson discussed the Californian’s unwillingness to accept medical advice. What stood in the way?
According to Isaacson, a very dangerous strain of hubris. After attending a doctor’s clinic for a medical checkup, Jobs was told that he had pancreatic cancer. Luckily for the tech-savvy entrepreneur, although pancreatic cancer is usually deadly, the tumor was curable with immediate surgery.
This is where hubris exerted a nefarious influence. Steve Jobs, a wonderfully talented inventor, a man who revolutionized the world of technology, refused the advice. He opted for herbal treatment instead.
As you know, this decision proved to be fatal. Over the next few months, his tumor spread; Jobs spent the next six years battling a demon that would eventually consume him. By believing in the supposed power of herbal remedies, Jobs became another victim of misinformation. A great man ended up becoming just another statistic.
Today, millions of Americans also fall victim to misinformation. Infowars , home to the human megaphone known as Alex Jones, regularly holds discussions about the threats posed by these “chemical lobotomizations.” Here, in the name of misinformation, truth is provisional. It’s easy to dismiss such nonsense as fringe lunacy.
Take a look around the country, however, and you see that the so-called fringe lunacy has gone mainstream. Alex Jones and the likes are, of course, extreme examples. It’s easy to think that vaccine myths are solely perpetuated by some questionable folks on the right… sorry, the very far right. Such thinking is erroneous.
Dr. Oz, a darling of the left, has shared the stage with vaccine deniers, as has Oprah, the woman responsible for creating Oz and his particular brand of quackery. Meanwhile, the comedian Bill Maher also appears to have taken more than a few sips of the Kool-Aid. Maher likes to represent himself as the epitome of sagacity, primarily on the basis of his being a devout atheist.
Stubborn to the point of vexatious, Maher, over the last 15 years or so, has demonstrated an uncontrollable urge to embrace antivaccine pseudoscience and other unscientific “theories.” If you are in any doubt, readers, open up YouTube and watch Maher fawn over Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a well-known antivaccine activist.
Medical professionals overwhelmingly agree that vaccinations help us; they overwhelmingly agree that vaccinations save lives. This is commonsense. The problem with commonsense, however, is that it’s not too common. "
Democrats Succumb to Islamist Influence,spectator.org,Harry Onickel,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/democrats-succumb-to-islamist-influence/,"Democrats Succumb to Islamist Influence Rashida Tlaib isn’t the only congressional backer of Omar Suleiman. Imam Omar Suleiman (C-Span/YouTube screenshot) Top Stories by Veronique de Rugy
S ince the first meeting of the Continental Congress, the United States legislature has hosted religious leaders from various traditions to offer a prayer at the start of open sessions. On May 9, Texas representative Eddie Bernice Johnson invited a popular imam to give the opening invocation. Ordinarily, the presence and prayer of a Muslim religious leader wouldn’t be cause for concern, but the specific imam Rep. Johnson chose certainly is: notorious Islamist and homophobe Omar Suleiman.
With over a million followers on Facebook, and almost three hundred thousand on Twitter , Suleiman is certainly influential among American Muslim youth. But, given his extremism, his influence should not be broadened or encouraged — especially not in the halls of Congress.
For instance, Suleiman supports a theocratic legal system, calling for a “ righteous khalifa [leader of a caliphate ]” so that Sharia [Islamic law] can be implemented “in totality…on a state level,” and insisted that Sharia practiced “on a societal level” would be a “righteous system.”
Accordingly, the seminary Suleiman founded and leads, the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, maintains a YouTube channel with videos of other popular Islamists justifying the practice of using whipping and cutting off limbs as punishments.
Moreover, Suleiman has applauded the protracted periods of Arab violence against Israeli Jews known as the intifadas , writing , “God willing on this blessed night as the 3 rd Intifada begins, the beginning of the end of Zionism [the Jewish national self-determination movement] is here.” Unsurprisingly, he has even dabbled in anti-Semitism by claiming “ Zionist media ” tries to silence the people of Gaza.
Suleiman has expressed his opposition to homosexuality, stating that it is a “repugnant shameless sin.” He has further warned that “we will be forced to conform and watch this disease destroy our children.”
Following significant public outcry that senior Democrats would give a platform to someone as extreme as Suleiman, American Islamist organizations, such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), rose to Suleiman’s defense, encouraging their supporters to call their representatives in support of the Islamist cleric.
This coordinated effort seemed to work. Rep. Johnson, for example, stood by her invitation, tweeting that Suleiman has “ used his voice to call for peace & justice,” and “ has stood hand in hand with leaders of both parties in denouncing hate, bigotry and violence.”
But why are leading American politicians offering their personal support, and the legitimacy of the world’s most important legislative chamber, to an extremist Islamist cleric?
Johnson may be unaware of Suleiman’s anti-Semitism , or she may not care. After all, she has been happy to side with extremists in the past. In 2005, Johnson was part of a group of Congressional Black Caucus members who secretly met with the anti-Jewish preacher Louis Farrakhan .
Additionally, Johnson has a habit of hanging around with Islamists. She has received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from leading Islamist operatives, including Rasmi Almallah, who served as a board member of the designated terror charity, the Holy Land Foundation (HLF), and was named by federal prosecutors in 2007 as an unindicted coconspirator in the HLF trial.
In apparent return for such support, Johnson has been happy to embrace leading Islamist organizations. She has written letters endorsing the terror-linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR); and just a few weeks after Suleiman addressed the House, Johnson was honored by CAIR at its “American Muslim Ramadan Congressional Appreciation Iftar.”
Johnson is not alone in her dismissal of Suleiman’s bigotry. Representative Rashida Tlaib, who has been happy to share stages with him at events sponsored by CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood-founded Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), also tweeted her support of Suleiman’s congressional appearance.
Tlaib’s Islamist connections are deeper than Johnson’s. She is apparently closely linked to Hezbollah supporter Abbas Hamideh, founder of Al Awda, a group of which the Anti-Defamation League states “in its early days openly supported terror groups targeting Israelis.” Tlaib has invited CAIR leaders into her office; and one of Tlaib’s top fundraisers , Maher Abdel-Qader , has a long record of trafficking in anti-Semitism.
The larger issue here is the acceptance, whether through ignorance or shared values, of Islamists such as Suleiman in the capital’s halls of power . These fundamentalists are not spreading blind hatred, but a specific hatred designed to serve a larger purpose: to normalize anti-Semitism and other bigotries, and to advance the Islamist agenda under the cover of a Democratic Party platform.
Moderate Democrats must not welcome extremists such as Omar Suleiman to Congress; they must actively protest him, his congressional cheerleaders, and those deep-pocketed Islamist organizations that stand behind him.

Dissing the Dead in Dallas,spectator.org,William Murchison,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/dissing-the-dead-in-dallas/,"Dissing the Dead in Dallas The Great American Crack-Up proceeds apace, even on Memorial Day. by John Glynn
D uring the walkup to Memorial Day, with its evocations of respect for fallen warriors, hyper-charged Dallas, Texas, found time to stick out a very official tongue at, you see, the wrong kind of fallen warriors: the Confederate kind.
The business of establishment America, on the urging of the political left, has become that of saying, oh, ’scuse us for not living up to ideals we didn’t know were ideals ’til you kind progressives kindly wised us up.
Dallas city government — once fairly accused of patient commitment to reasoned dialogue — bellied up enthusiastically: voting to sell, and bar (unconstitutionally) from display anywhere in the city, a distinguished equestrian statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee and a symbolic aide, removed in 2017 from the city’s Lee Park and hidden away in a rented Air Force hangar due to…
Ah. There’s the question: due to what? How come we’re spitting and clawing, not just at each other but at folks long dead? What are we trying to do here? And what’s to gain?
Ask the progressives and their puissant advocates in Dallas city government, as well as the local media — conspicuously the very “woke” Dallas Morning News , established, ironically, on the instance of a Confederate colonel!
One gathers it’s a case of, boy, watch us stomp on ancient allegiances that hinder, as one News editorial put it, the ideal of “moving forward to a more positive future.” Whatever a more positive future might look like: construed, as it has to be, as capitulation to whoever speaks in the loudest, most insistent tones.
One way to look at things is that, by dissing the Confederates, pulling down their monuments, denouncing the great-souled Lee as a traitor to his country, we’re repudiating slavery. Yeah, sure. As if slavery (an acknowledged evil, if, at that, an ancient one) were by itself enough to explain a ruinous war costing 750,000 lives. History and human motivation are generally too complex to be grasped by activists whose current fallback position can be characterized as “I’m right and you’re evil. (Not to mention stupid.)”
Back to the Dallas establishment’s capitulation to woke-ness (meaning the embrace of group identity as the operative political mission of our time). It’s not just Marse Robert who gets the heave-ho. Dallas is concurrently trying to pull down Confederate statuary adorning — a word I don’t think the Dallas News would employ in this context — a downtown grave! Get those racist images off city property! Such is the city establishment’s, ah, judgment in the matter. Others might apply a word other than “judgment,” with its connotations of reasoned discourse and fair play for all. Is it any wonder Donald Trump — a blunt instrument with hands and teeth — enjoys the tolerance and even fervent backing he more than occasionally puts to substandard use?
The Confederate Crisis, so to call it — in once-normal and good-hearted Dallas, as in many other venues — is one more sign of what resembles, increasingly, the Great American Crack-Up. We’ve lost the knack, it would seem, for putting up with each other; for entertaining ideas different from our own but possibly useful if we think them through.
If we think them through! What a notion — you mean, think? Put aside insults and claims of unique moral righteousness? Marshal evidence instead of accusations? Take into account a viewpoint contrary to the orthodoxy of place and time? Why, that would be… downright conciliatory. People might come together in a common cause. Surely we can’t put up with that, can we? Not when victory, rather than peace, is the great objective: when power over others — the essence of the master-slave relationship, come to think of it — is the end for which we strive.
Having expended 750,000 lives, the soldiers of North and South managed in the end — they thought it was the end — to put it all behind them. As the Civil War’s unsurpassed chronicler, Shelby Foote, used to note, Southerners admitted it was better that the North had won. The North, for its part, acknowledged that Southerners had fought bravely.
Memorial Days, like the one just past, come and go. Our need for them — obviously — never dies.

Far More Than a Culture War Rages in America | The American Spectator,spectator.org,Scott S.

A merica’s two greatest presidents, Washington and Lincoln, both believed that the ultimate threat to the United States wouldn’t come from abroad in the form of a foreign enemy but rather from within. In his Farewell Address, Washington warned of the dangers of “party passion,” and the “disposition to retaliate… [giving] ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens… facility to betray, or sacrifice the interests of their own country…sometimes even with popularity…” Lincoln said, “America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.” On another occasion he said, “…if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher.”
Of all the cultural changes that endanger the well-being and happiness of Americans and impair the governability of the nation, severing the present from the past and the rise of division and intolerance are probably the two greatest threats. In the last 25 years, division and intolerance have increasingly become defining characteristics of American politics and culture — attributes at odds with the vision of the founders and most successive presidents who understood that shared values and unity were the bedrock of American strength.
So all-encompassing has division and intolerance become now, that older generations hardly recognize in contemporary American culture, the place and spiritual home of their childhood. And today, one can rarely take in the arts on stage or in museums, comedy, contemporary Hollywood productions or major league sports without having one’s sensibilities offended or being confronted with politically correct inferences that reflect intolerance and condescension.
Beyond our borders it’s always been a crazy and depraved world. Anti-Semitic prejudice and intolerance has a long history in the Middle East and has been on the rise in Europe and the U.S., taking a turn for the worse on U.S. college campuses in recent years and punctuated this last year with mass murder and attempted mass murder at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, California. In the last 25 years Christian persecution has been increasing in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa from the upsurge of militant Islam. And just when ISIS appears defeated, the shocking news of mass killings of Christians carried out by Islamist terrorists, who directed their bombings at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka Easter morning reminds us of the harsh reality and magnitude of anti-Christian persecution and intolerance.
In January, Newsweek magazine, which is no friend of Christianity, reported that “Christian persecution and genocide is worse now than in any time in history.” The Pew Research Center recently noted that “in 144 [out of 195] countries in the world, Christians are the most targeted religion.”
To the extent Americans are aware of these facts and that more Christians have died for their faith in the 20th century than at any time in history, some might find consolation that such persecution is primarily taking place outside of the United States. But is that really so and what is to come?
Historians whose research is based on primary sources know that the United States was founded by self-professing Christians. The Founders came from different denominations, but they agreed on fundamental beliefs. And when those fundamentals were applied to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, the trajectory of human history was radically changed, for it was Christian Biblical principles that were the basis for man having inalienable rights from God that no government can deny or take away. In the words of President John F. Kennedy many years later: “The rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.” Similarly it was Christian principles in the Declaration and Constitution that asserted that the legitimacy of government came only from the consent of the people and that human dignity and equality for everyone was the calling of this new revolutionary United States of America.
The supposition that America was founded by Christians based on Christian principles does not mean that every American was or would be Christian. From the beginning, America’s doors were open to people of all faiths — or of no faith — to live in peace and tolerance, knowing they could practice their religion or lack thereof without harassment or discrimination. Christianity not only presupposes respect for people’s free will, but also tolerance, which is the essential guarantor of the rights of others to differ in their personal beliefs and expression.
The earliest groups of settlers coming to America were Protestants — Pilgrims, Puritans, Baptists, Dutch Reformed, Anglicans, and others — and they had various and strong disagreements amongst themselves. By experience, they knew secular government was the only workable option because a theocratic-type alternative would be oppressive and cause perpetual turmoil and civil conflict. Since the founders were Protestants, they were basically optimists and believed that things work together for good because of the dual assumption that the hand of God’s providence is at work in human affairs and that spiritual truth would prevail through man, by love not force, by the example of service and sacrifice for others, and by the exercise of free will in the marketplace of ideas.
The Constitution was drafted in 1787, but its acceptance was stalled for several years because the larger and most influential states feared that the document gave the federal government too much power and they wanted to amend the Constitution to provide for and guarantee specific protections regarding the rights of the people and the states. Finally, with ten amendments, the Constitution was ratified by the last state, Rhode Island, in 1790. Those protections were of course known as the Bill of Rights, with the First Amendment providing the explicit guarantee of religious liberty, which included related rights of freedom of the press, speech, and assembly.
That the United States was a Christian nation was affirmed in 1892 in the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in the case of Holy Trinity Church v. The United States , wherein the Court’s findings included a lengthy and detailed accounting of the Christian foundation of both the individual states’ constitutions and the federal U.S. Constitution. The Court summarized its findings, stating: “Our laws and our institutions must necessarily be based upon and embody the teachings of the Redeemer of mankind. [It is] impossible that it should be otherwise and in the sense and to this extent our civilization and our institutions are emphatically Christian.”
Once considered the most towering figure in the Democratic Party, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in 1935 that, “We cannot read the history of our rise and development as a nation, without reckoning with the place the Bible has occupied in shaping the advances of the Republic.…[W]here we have been the truest and most consistent in obeying its precepts, we have attained the greatest measure of contentment and prosperity.”
Fast forward a generation from Roosevelt and things began happening that rapidly changed the path of American values and culture. Two Supreme Court case rulings on the interpretation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause in the early 1960s removed reference and respect for the Almighty from public schools. Together, Engle v. Vitale (1962) and Murray v. Curlett (1963) ruled it was unconstitutional to have prayer, and readings or recitations from the Bible in the classroom or on the grounds of public schools.
Nine years later in 1971 the Supreme Court took up Roe v. Wade , ruling on January 22, 1973, that under the 14th Amendment, a woman’s right to abortion trumped any other competing rights and could not be abridged by state laws banning abortions. This ruling effectively stripped unalienable rights and equality from both the unborn and the father. In yet another 14th Amendment ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges , handed down on June 26, 2015, in a narrow 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court, legalized same sex marriage nationwide, a decision that transformed the definition of the family, which had been for millennia the foundational institution for pro-creation and child-rearing. In the dissenting words of Chief Justice Roberts, that narrow majority ruling was likely to unleash a new level of intolerance and division because it “not only overlooks our country’s entire history and tradition, but actively repudiates it, preferring to live only in the heady days of the here and now.”
That these Supreme Court rulings incrementally and collectively weakened the authority and influence of Christianity in American society and culture, there can be little doubt. In legislating from the bench and creating whole new rights, these Supreme Court rulings are fundamentally problematic, as they run contrary to the Constitution’s requirements of separation of powers. In both Roe and Obergefell , the Supreme Court usurped and nullified the legislature, whose constitutionally defined role was to originate, debate, and vote on new laws — particularly important when those new laws would fundamentally change family life and society. But also — insofar as law is uncompromising — the Obergefell ruling would escalate the culture war because newly created rights of a minority were certain to clash with and encroach on the rights, sensibilities, and long-standing moral values and institutions held by the majority.
The imprimatur of five Supreme Court justices effectively opened the door to some 2% of Americans being able to dictate to the population at large what they can say, how they can conduct their business, and even influence what churches and synagogues are allowed to practice and preach. From there it’s been a short step in the LGBT agenda to demand ever more equal rights — such as equal access to public bathrooms and locker rooms of either sex, and the right to participate in sports under the transgender’ s new sex rather than the biological birth gender like everyone else. And the way it has been going, those who dare question these trends are likely to be charged with being homo- or transphobic and engaging in hate speech.
Thus, the mooring of a Christian anchor hat helped provide protection and continuity around common sense and shared values — established over millennia — and for some three centuries dating back to colonial times, was cast aside in the course of a few decades. Effectively, a few Supreme Court decisions were instrumental in bending the trajectory of American society’s values and priorities that had been shaped by 2000+ year-old transcendent virtues, aspirations and unalienable God-given rights to a new direction preoccupied with unrestrained self-interest and man-made worldly rights of self-gratification.
To be fair, gradual steps leading to marginalization and discrimination against Christians in America were underway considerably before the aforementioned Supreme Court decisions. The influence of John Dewey, lauded as the greatest educational thinker of the 20th century, can be traced back to the 1920s. Dewey was an atheist, who believed and said, “There is no room for fixed and natural law or permanent moral absolutes.” In the decades that followed, various quarters of the public school educational establishment sought to downplay and erase the facts about the role of Christianity in America’s founding and shaping of the nation.
In 1986, Dr. Paul Vitz, a professor of psychology at New York University, published the findings of a commission’s study in which he participated to examine the degree and nature of bias in 60 social studies and history textbooks used by 87% of public schools across the United States. Not only was there no God being thanked by the Pilgrims in the first Thanksgiving, but the study found that almost every other reference to the Christian influence of early America was systematically removed.
In this regard George Orwell’s dystopian future depicted in 1984 has already arrived. Orwell wrote: “Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, and every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.”
As Orwell also noted, “the whole aim of Newspeak and Doublethink is to narrow the range of thought.” Political correctness has the same goal and that’s why its adherents are so intolerant — seeking to shut down and silence people with whom they disagree on college campuses across the country, clamoring for removal of historic statues and monuments, and demanding that people with differing views on such subjects as climate change and LGBT rights be silenced, fined or arrested.
Shocking as it might seem, a pattern has been emerging in the U.S. with similarities to the longstanding standard practices in Communist and Fascist totalitarian states — that is: to rewrite history and indoctrinate the youth so as to be able to manipulate and control the future cultural and political landscape.
In that sense the U.S. is closer to a future that is reminiscent of developments that led to persecution in 1930s Germany than anyone would like to contemplate or admit. The Nazi propaganda machine censored non-conforming views and sought to isolate and discriminate against Jews — a strategy intended to engender hatred and prejudice against them within the greater German population, thus setting the stage for the genocidal “final solution” of the Holocaust.
This is not to say that Christians are on the threshold of massive physical persecution in the U.S. But make no mistake, Christianity in America is being marginalized and put on the defensive by growing prejudice and outright hostility. And this trend of intolerance and disenfranchisement of Christians is happening at a time when the digital megaphone of social media is getting increasingly dominant.
Propaganda may actually be more effective in America than in totalitarian societies because of the power of repetitive messaging from ostensibly separate and diverse private media sources within the United States. Citizens in totalitarian societies aren’t as easily fooled because they know that the government controls the media and all its messaging.
In America propaganda narratives originate less from government than from progressive-minded groups of people who tend to think and act “collectively.” Many with this collective mindset are naturally predisposed to joining forces with what Boston University Professor Angelo Codevilla described as America’s Ruling Class, by pursuing careers in the knowledge and information industry — where others of a similar progressive mindset tend to work. Institutions that are largely dominated by the Ruling Class include the mainstream media; social media and information search multinational corporations — notably but not limited to the near monopolies of Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google; the educational establishment and universities; government bureaucracies; large segments of the law practice and the Democratic Party; and many non-profit foundations.
It is noteworthy that the rise of militant secularism and a decline in tolerance and civil discourse has taken place concurrent with the rise and proliferation of social media in America. And for many, visceral hate and name calling have all but replaced civil discourse and debate. America is more divided now than at any time in its history, except perhaps during the period leading up to the Civil war. But because it is hatred and intolerance that fuel this so-called culture war, we have actually opened the floodgates of spiritual warfare, with the forces of darkness and deceit seeking the destruction of the forces of light and truth.
Just so we can’t miss what’s at stake, this epic spiritual battle — that threatens the very foundation of society and the nation — is driven by extreme hate and intolerance, and Christianity, the religion of love and the Savior, is now in the crosshairs.
Who can deny that America’s blessings are unparalleled in human history? The colonists, through their representatives, drafted a revolutionary Constitution that created a system of limited government with checks and balances and separation of power, which also prioritized the protection of the people’s rights and property. It was the first government in human history whose legitimacy came from the people and whose purpose was to serve the people.
As a result the United States rose from colonial poverty to the world’s most creative, prosperous and generous nation in just 200 years. A miraculous accomplishment. And that success happened not by chance, but because the nation’s Christian foundation and Constitution put limits on government and empowered the people to be creative and productive. In the words of the 30th president, Calvin Coolidge, “Who can doubt that it has been guided by a Divine Providence?”
Unfortunately, with affluence comes spiritual laziness. Comfortable and disengaged Americans have forgotten the admonitions by Washington, Lincoln, and a number of modern presidents, that it’s necessary to understand and overcome the forces and determined enemies within who seek power by emasculating the values of individual liberty and the institutions that have made America great. Some 20 years before he was elected the 40th U.S. president, Ronald Reagan reminds us that, “ Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.”
What’s needed now is an awakening and spiritual revival within Christianity that acts as a positive force throughout America. That revival would not only inspire believers and reach non-believers, but it would also help the silent majority and less engaged people whose yearnings may be simple, such as the return of civility, satisfaction, and joy that comes from being more authentically connected with people and with the nation’s profound heritage. If Christianity is the source of both love and the principles that are at the heart of the Constitution, it is certainly worth defending. For as Christianity in America goes, so goes everything else.

The Outside-the-Box Campaign,spectator.org,Robert Stacy McCain,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-outside-the-box-campaign/,"by Scott S. Powell
M arianne Williamson doesn’t talk like a politician. As she spoke to a crowd of about 300 people at a Unitarian church in Washington, D.C., last week, she invoked scripture to convey her ideas of mercy and justice, “heart and spirit.” Even beyond the words she spoke, however, the way she spoke them was not what one would expect from an experienced politician. Rather than delivering her words at a carefully cadenced pace, the way most candidates do, Williamson spoke so rapidly that she sometimes failed to pause when the audience interrupted her with applause. An author of several bestselling books, Williamson spoke without notes or teleprompter for nearly an hour at the church on R Street in Northwest Washington and then took questions from the crowd for nearly another hour. She received more than one standing ovation.
Williamson is running for president, and she has already qualified for the first two rounds of televised debates beginning in June, according to the guidelines established by the Democratic National Committee. In early May, she cleared the first threshold — announcing that her campaign had gotten contributions from 65,000 unique donors — and last week, she crossed the second threshold, getting at least 1% in three national polls. According to an analysis by Politico , this makes Williamson one of 13 candidates who have met both of the DNC debate criteria. That puts her ahead of several experienced politicians, including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in the squeeze to qualify as one of the 20 candidates on the debate stage in Miami. Because there are 23 announced Democratic candidates, Williamson is actually near the middle of the pack, and with only two candidates (former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders) now registering in double digits in the Real Clear Politics average of national polls , she’s not really far away from being considered a serious contender. That explains why reporters from ABC, CBS, the Washington Post , Time magazine and BuzzFeed were in attendance when Williamson spoke in D.C. last week. Given the format announced for the Democrat debates, it’s entirely possible that Williamson could be onstage right next to Biden, Sanders, or one of the other big-name contenders when NBC broadcasts the first debates June 26-27. With such an opportunity to elevate her profile, there is a chance that Williamson could break through and have a significant impact on the 2020 campaign.
What is it that Williamson brings to the task? As she told the crowd at Unity Church, “I know my candidacy is outside the box.” However, considering that the Republican in the White House was also an outside-the-box candidate, why shouldn’t Democrat primary voters be willing to give her a chance? And as the size of the audience that greeted her in Washington last week suggested, many are at least curious about the woman who has often been called Oprah Winfrey’s “spiritual guru.” With five New York Times bestselling books to her credit, Williamson has a pre-existing nationwide base of potential supporters, and her campaign fundraising during the first quarter of this year exceeded that of former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, considered by many a rising star in Democrat ranks.
She is definitely different. How many Democrats quote the Bible in their speeches? Yet there she was, quoting Proverbs 29:18 (“Where there is no vision, the people perish”) in her rapid-fire speech last week, and telling the crowd that “God calls nations to be good.” Williamson gave a ringing endorsement to reparations for slavery, which was met with applause, and also called for using anti-trust laws to restrain the “gigantic power” of tech companies like Google. Her manner of delivery is not the practiced style of a politician, but it conveys a sense of moral urgency — at times more of a sermon than a stump speech. There is no telling how this might play to a national TV audience, however, and it has been estimated that each candidate in the early Democrat debates might get only seven minutes of airtime. After that, the DNC recently announced, it will raise the threshold for the third round of debates scheduled for September. Then, candidates will need 130,000 unique donors and at least 2% in the national polls to qualify.
To get an idea of how far Marianne Williamson has come in the past few weeks, consider this: When I traveled to South Carolina to cover her campaign in March, I was the only reporter in attendance when she spoke from the pulpit of an AME church. The national media were almost completely ignoring her campaign then, but this week she appeared on CNN’s morning program where host Alisyn Camerota remarked that Williamson had “leapfrogged established governors and mayors” in the 2020 race. The candidate responded by saying that voters she’s talked to in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire don’t care whether she’s held public office, but rather about her ideas and her “vision of this country.” Later in the week on CNN, Chris Cillizza gave Williamson a “B” grade on his 2020 candidate report card, while delivering a “D” to former Texas Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke. O’Rourke, who rolled out his campaign on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine , has faded badly in the past two months, the latest Quinnipiac poll showing him at just 2%. So while the one-time media darling O’Rourke is now beginning to emit what Cillizza called a “stench” of failure, the once-ignored Williamson is moving up. And several better-known candidates, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, are struggling. The latest Monmouth poll , for example, showed Williamson tied at 1% with Booker and de Blasio, while Hickenlooper had less than 1% and five other candidates, including California Rep. Eric Swalwell, registering zero support.
Most of the media attention is now on front-runner Biden, but what will happen after the televised debates in June and July? What happens if Biden stumbles, or if one of the other top-tier candidates goes into an O’Rourke-style tailspin? How long will the various governors, senators, congressmen and mayors be able to stay in the Democratic race if their single-digit poll numbers don’t improve? The outside-the-box candidacy of Williamson could survive longer, simply because she’s got nowhere to go but up. All she’s got to do is keep adding campaign donors and get to 2% in the polls to make it to the September debates, by which time some of her better-known rivals may have already called it quits.
As perhaps the longest long-shot in the Democrat field, Williamson remains upbeat. “There are more lovers than haters in America,” she told the crowd last week in D.C., and her campaign is finding ways to capitalize on that message, offering donors a “U.S. Department of Peace” sticker . That’s one of her outside-the-box ideas, and in the crowded race for the 2020 Democrat nomination, it might be enough to make Marianne Williamson a more formidable contender than many of the candidates inside the box."
"Netanyahu Fails to Form Government, Israel to Hold New Elections",spectator.org,John Jiang,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/netanyahu-fails-to-form-government-israel-to-hold-new-elections/,"Netanyahu Fails to Form Government, Israel to Hold New Elections Former coalition falls apart in significant setback for prime minister by Scott S. Powell
A ttempts to form a new government in Israel ended unsuccessfully this week after a month of negotiations led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to produce a governing coalition. In response, the Knesset voted in favor of dissolving itself and holding a new round of elections in September . This move comes mere weeks after Israel held its 2019 elections in April, the results of which were widely seen as a success for Netanyahu .
The Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday that the 74-45 vote in favor of dissolution was initiated by Netanyahu’s party, Likud. The action was intended to prevent Benny Gantz, leader of the rival Blue and White alliance, from attempting to form his own governing coalition at the behest of President Reuven Rivlin. With 35 seats each after the April elections, Likud and Blue and White are tied for the title of the Knesset’s largest party.
The collapse in negotiations was mainly precipitated by tensions between Likud and former coalition partner Yisrael Beiteinu , the secular-nationalist party led by Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman. Lieberman’s party, which holds five seats in the Knesset, declined to rejoin a Likud government, leaving Netanyahu one seat short of a majority. The two right-leaning parties have been at odds over a new military draft law supported by Lieberman that would revoke certain military service exemptions granted to ultra-Orthodox students. The law is strongly opposed by Likud’s ultra-Orthodox allies, and the party has been unable to mediate between the two sides.
Netanyahu himself has also been plagued by corruption charges since late 2017, with a hearing scheduled for early October . He is likely to ask for a postponement of the proceedings in light of the new elections, which would take place only a few weeks before the hearing and leave his party with little time to pass legislation to protect him from prosecution. Haaretz reports that the Justice Ministry, which maintains that elections are irrelevant to the proceedings, is expected to deny the prime minister’s request.
Lieberman struck a combative but optimistic tone in a speech to reporters several hours after the Knesset vote, accusing Netanyahu of pandering to ultra-Orthodox interests and asserting his belief that his party would be rewarded by voters in September for its hardline stance. Netanyahu fired back shortly afterward, describing Lieberman as a leftist and accusing him of intentionally sabotaging the coalition.
Despite the various setbacks, Netanyahu continues to poll favorably and is on track to become the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history in July, taking the title from the late David Ben-Gurion."
Attorney General Barr’s Remarkable CBS News Interview,spectator.org,George Parry,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/attorney-general-barrs-remarkable-cbs-news-interview/,"Attorney General Barr’s Remarkable CBS News Interview It would be impossible to improve on the excellence of his remarks. by Scott S. Powell
I n his muddled, obfuscatory farewell remarks, Special Counsel Robert Mueller strongly suggested that, although he and his cohort of Hillary Clinton acolytes had reached no conclusion as to whether President Trump had obstructed justice, Congress should address that question by means of the impeachment “process.” Why? Because Team Mueller had not been able to “exonerate” the President. But exoneration is a non-legal standard which completely inverts and perverts our system of justice which places the burden on the prosecution to prove its case.
In every criminal trial across America, the judge instructs the jury that the burden of proof rests with the prosecution and never, ever shifts to the defendant. The jury is told in no uncertain terms that the defendant has no burden of proof and no obligation to prove his or her innocence. It is up to the prosecution to prove each and every element of its case, and, if the prosecution fails to do so, then the jury’s verdict must be “not guilty.”
These legal principles are not arcane, little-known concepts. Nevertheless, they seem to have eluded former FBI Director Mueller and his band of angry law school graduates who seem to think that they are in the exoneration business instead of determining whether the evidence meets the burden of proof as to each and every element of the crime of obstruction of justice.
So, after trying to decode and make sense of Mueller’s tank car of quasi-legal bilge, it came as an intense pleasure and relief to watch Attorney General William Barr’s interview with Jan Crawford on CBS This Morning . Barr’s answers to all questions were crisp, crystal clear, logical, thoughtful, and well-founded in the principles of American law. His sober demeanor, obvious intelligence, and utter lack of conceit or pretense gave weight to his remarks and made manifest that he is the right person to meet the crisis of police-state lawlessness that has pervaded and corrupted the federal law enforcement and intelligence communities.
To get a better sense of Barr’s solid demeanor, you can watch parts of the interview by clicking on the following links: Barr’s concern about his reputation: “Everyone dies”
Below is the complete transcript of Barr’s interview. Although portions are highlighted, there are nuggets of valuable information in just about every line. In fact, there is so much good material here that the highlights are almost pointless. I urge you to read, savor, and reflect on the import of all of Barr’s trenchant analysis.
And yes, to answer your question, Barr provides plenty of material that should give James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, et al., severe indigestion and many sleepless nights.
So here, courtesy of CBS News, is the full transcript of Jan Crawford’s interview of William Barr, the new sheriff in town:
JAN CRAWFORD: Mr. Attorney General, thank you very much for sitting down with us. So, obviously we saw the special counsel yesterday make that statement, he analyzed 11 instances where there were possible obstruction and then said that he really couldn’t make a decision- conclusion on whether or not the president had in fact committed obstruction because of the existing OLC opinion in the legal counsel’s office. Do you agree with that interpretation that that legal opinion prevented him from making a conclusion?
WILLIAM BARR: I am not sure he said it prevented him. I think what he said was he took that into account plus a number of other prudential judgments about fairness and other things and decided that the best course was not for him to reach a decision. I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision but–
JAN CRAWFORD: Was there anything that would’ve stopped him in the regulations or in those…that opinion itself, he could’ve — in your view he could’ve reached a conclusion?
WILLIAM BARR: Right, he could’ve reached a conclusion. The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office but he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity but he had his reasons for not doing it, which he explained and I am not going to, you know, argue about those reasons but when he didn’t make a decision, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt it was necessary for us as the heads of the Department to reach that decision. That is what the Department of Justice does, that is why we have the compulsory powers like a grand jury to force people to give us evidence so that we can determine whether a crime has committed and in order to legitimate the process we felt we had to reach a decision.
JAN CRAWFORD: Well, I mean, he seemed to suggest yesterday that there was another venue for this and that was Congress.
WILLIAM BARR: Well, I am not sure what he was suggesting but, you know, the Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crimes as an adjunct to Congress. Congress is a separate branch of government and they can, you know, they have processes, we have our processes. Ours are related to the criminal justice process we are not an extension of Congress’s investigative powers.
JAN CRAWFORD: Now you have testified that when you met with Mueller at the Justice Department, you had that meeting, that you were surprised that he told you then that he was not going to reach a conclusion on obstruction.
WILLIAM BARR: Yes, Rod and I were both surprised by that.
JAN CRAWFORD: Did you ask him, look, we need you to make a conclusion on this? You should make a conclusion.
WILLIAM BARR: I wouldn’t say I really pressed him on it. I was interested in his thinking on it and he explained his position, said he was still thinking it through and- and- but I didn’t really press him nor did Rod.
JAN CRAWFORD: So, but you left that meeting thinking that he wasn’t going to have a conclusion?
WILLIAM BARR: That’s right.
JAN CRAWFORD: Do you feel because he didn’t do that, did he fulfill his responsibility as special counsel? If you look at regulations, it seems to anticipate that you would get a confidential report explaining why he made a decision to either prosecute or decline to prosecute. He didn’t do that, seems to me.
WILLIAM BARR: Right but on the other hand he did provide us a report and what he viewed to be the relevant facts. And that allowed us as the, as the leaders of the department to make that decision.
JAN CRAWFORD: What is the fundamental difference? Why…I mean, he said he couldn’t exonerate the president. That he had looked at the evil there – these 11 instances of possible obstruction. He couldn’t exonerate the president, if he could he would’ve stated so. You looked at that evidence and you did. I mean, what is the fundamental difference between your view and his?
WILLIAM BARR: Well, I think Bob said that he was not going to engage in the analysis. He was, he was not going to make a determination one way or the other. And he also said that he could not say that the president was clearly did not violate the law, which of course is not the standard we use at the department. We have to determine whether there is clear violation of the law and so we applied the standards we would normally apply. We analyzed the law and the facts and a group of us spent a lot of time doing that and determined that both as a matter of law, many of the instances would not amount to obstruction.
JAN CRAWFORD: As a matter of law?
WILLIAM BARR: As a matter of law. In other words, we didn’t agree with the legal analysis- a lot of the legal analysis in the report. It did not reflect the views of the department. It was the views of a particular lawyer or lawyers and so we applied what we thought was the right law but then we didn’t rely on that. We also looked at all the facts, tried to determine whether the government could establish all the elements and as to each of those episodes we felt that the evidence was deficient.
JAN CRAWFORD: Before you became attorney general you wrote a memo to the justice department looking at the — the question and the legal standards for obstruction and suggesting that the president has the authority to say back off of the Flynn investigation and could have fired James Comey under his executive authority, how much – I mean when you’re talking about, can you explain that a little more. When you’re talking about your judgment that no obstruction occurred based on the evidence that Mueller produced and your understanding of the law, can you explain a little more why wasn’t that obstruction?
WILLIAM BARR: Well let’s take the firing of Comey for example I think we would have said as a matter of law, and I’m not relying on my – my legal memo that I wrote as a private citizen but really on the views within the department of the people who think about these things and are responsible for framing the views of the department, and I think we would have said that as a matter of law the obstruction statutes do not reach facially valid exercise of core presidential authority or official authority even, decisions by the attorney general in administering the executive branch or litigation. But we didn’t rely on that, we then looked at that issue let’s take the again the firing of Comey. One of the elements is that you have to show that the act objectively speaking will have the probable effect of obstructing a proceeding and we don’t believe that the firing of an agency head could be established as having the probable effect, objectively speaking, of sabotaging a proceeding. There was also we would have to prove corrupt intent, the report itself points out that one of the likely motivations here was the president’s frustration with Comey saying something publicly and saying a different thing privately and refusing to correct the record. So that would not have been a corrupt intent. So for each of these episodes we thought long and hard about it, we looked at the facts and we didn’t feel the government could establish obstruction in these cases
JAN CRAWFORD: When you see some of the criticism and you’ve gotten quite a bit of it that you’re protecting the president that you’re enabling the president, what’s your response to that?
WILLIAM BARR: Well, we live in a hyper-partisan age where people no longer really pay attention to the substance of what’s said but as to who says it and what side they’re on and what it’s political ramifications are. The Department of Justice is all about the law, and the facts and the substance and I’m going to make the decisions based on the law and the facts and I realize that’s intention with the political climate we live in because people are more interested in getting their way politically. So I think it just goes with the territory of being the attorney general in a hyper-partisan period of time.
JAN CRAWFORD: The four page summary that you wrote, did you ask in that March 5th meeting for the special counsel to kind of redact all the grand jury material?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes, not redact it but highlight it so we could redact it, we would, so, you know, the report was over 400 pages, I knew that it was voluminous and coming our way in a few weeks. My intent was to get out as much as I could as quickly as I could. To do that I would have to, as a matter of law, make sure that grand jury material was redacted because regardless of the political posturing that’s going on it’s not lawful for me to just make that public.
JAN CRAWFORD: Not even to Congress?
WILLIAM BARR: Not even–
JAN CRAWFORD: So you could even give Congress, which of course is demanding that and threatening to hold you in contempt because you’re not giving them the full report
WILLIAM BARR: That’s right, and so–
JAN CRAWFORD: But by law you can’t?
WILLIAM BARR: Right, and so because we were not involved in the investigation we would have no way looking at the report of determining what was grand jury material and what wasn’t, so we had for a period of weeks been asking the special counsel’s office to highlight the stuff so we could quickly process it for release and I guess–
JAN CRAWFORD: For a period of weeks you had asked for this material?
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah even before the March 5 meeting we had asked or raised the subject–
JAN CRAWFORD: And what was the response?
WILLIAM BARR: And then at the March 5 meeting I made it explicit and then after the March 5th meeting we asked..
JAN CRAWFORD: And what was the response?
WILLIAM BARR: We thought it was being– we thought it was being done and I do believe they were putting in more footnotes in that would be necessary ultimately in identifying the material but whether the wires were crossed or whatever it didn’t come in a form that identified the 6E material.
JAN CRAWFORD: And that was a surprise to you when you got the report?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes.
JAN CRAWFORD: It was.
WILLIAM BARR: And it immediately meant that you know it was going to be a period of weeks before we could get the report out if I had my druthers I would have liked to get the report out as quickly as possible.
JAN CRAWFORD: So instead, you turned this four page summary?
WILLIAM BARR: Right, because I didn’t think the body politic would allow us to go on radio silence for four weeks. I mean, people were camped outside my house and the department and every- there was all kinds of wild speculation going on. Former senior intelligence officials who were purporting to have it- or intimating that they had inside information were suggesting that the president and his family were going to be indicted and so forth–
JAN CRAWFORD: And saying that publicly?
WILLIAM BARR: Saying that publicly. There was all kind of wild and–
JAN CRAWFORD: And you knew that to be false?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes, and it was wild and irresponsible speculation going on which the very–
JAN CRAWFORD: Wild and irresponsible. The former intelligence officials’ speculation–
WILLIAM BARR: Right, and talking heads and things like that, and these things affect the United States’ ability to function in the world. We have an economy. It could affect the economy. It can affect – it can affect our foreign relations during very delicate period of time with, you know, serious adversaries in the world. So I felt- that in order to buy time, in order to get the report out, I had to state the bottom line just like you’re announcing a verdict in a case. My purpose there was not to summarize every jot and tittle of the report and every, you know, angle that – that Mueller looked into. But, just state the bottom line which I did in the four page memo.
JAN CRAWFORD: You didn’t say in that four-page memo that the report would not exonerate the president on obstruction. That line–
WILLIAM BARR: I said that, yes. In the- in the- in my four-page memo, I said that Mueller did not reach a decision. He gave both sides and that- and then I quoted that sentence which is, while we didn’t find a crime, we didn’t exonerate the president. That was in the four-page letter.
JAN CRAWFORD: The- did not- we would so clearly state the preface to that.
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah.
JAN CRAWFORD: That, that was not in there, and there was some criticism that in the summary, and the attorney- I mean, the special counsel himself wrote the letter saying, People are misunderstanding. There’s been some confusion, that the summary had caused some confusion–
WILLIAM BARR: Right, right.
JAN CRAWFORD: That perhaps, and he didn’t say this, but the- the response was that you were too soft on the president, that actually the special counsel was a little sharper on obstruction.
WILLIAM BARR: Well again, I wasn’t trying to provide all the flavor and nooks and crannies of the report. I was just trying to state the bottom line, and the bottom line was that Bob Mueller identified some episodes. He did not reach a conclusion. He provided both sides of the issue, and he- his conclusion was he wasn’t exonerating the president, but he wasn’t finding a crime either. And, for the purposes of the point, I think that that was what was required for the body politic because actually most of the letter then goes on to explain how Rod Rosenstein and I reached a decision and the criteria we applied in finding no obstruction.
JAN CRAWFORD: He wrote the letter taking issue, saying there caused- you had caused confusion. Did that catch you off guard?
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah, sure. I was surprised he just didn’t pick up the phone and call me given our 30 year relationship, but–
JAN CRAWFORD: Why didn’t he?
WILLIAM BARR: I don’t, I don’t know, but, as I said it in the hearing, I thought it was- the letter was a little snitty and staff-driven–
JAN CRAWFORD: Staff-driven?
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah. I personally felt, but we had a good conversation–
JAN CRAWFORD: Because otherwise you would have picked up the phone?
WILLIAM BARR: Right, well, which I did, and we had a good conversation. And I think, I think the matter is now been fully vetted, and I think he was concerned that there should be more context and texture to his work given, and that in the absence of that, the vacuum had been filled with media reports that were then causing confusion, and he wanted it clarified by putting more of an explanation of his reasoning out. And I said that I didn’t want to put out dribs and drabs, I wanted the whole report out. And then I wrote a letter again to Congress saying, look, I didn’t- this is not intended to be a full summary. Bob’s thinking is reflected in the report. Everyone’s going to have access to it. They should look at that to determine, you know, what Bob’s reasoning was. So that’s where we let it sit till the report was released.
JAN CRAWFORD: You said that you had wanted to release the report in full, and you largely have with the grand jury material being, of course, the exception.
WILLIAM BARR: Right. And in the second volume that’s one tenth of one percent of the report has been taken.
JAN CRAWFORD: You, I just want to be clear on this. How long and how many, you expected the special counsel’s office to redact that material, so to point out what should be redacted —
WILLIAM BARR: Right. Right.
JAN CRAWFORD: So the four-page summary would have been unnecessary?
WILLIAM BARR: Correct.
JAN CRAWFORD: You expected, could you just tell us again, you expected to get the report with the grand jury material identified and then what was your plan?
WILLIAM BARR: My plan was to figure out how long it would take us to redact what had to be redacted.
JAN CRAWFORD: And what did you anticipate that would be?
WILLIAM BARR: And if we could readily, if we could readily identify the 6E material, I thought we could do it in a you know less than a week. And if I had been looking at a matter of days like that, then I probably would have just told people what the timeline is do people knew when it would be coming out when they would see it, but once I realized it was going to take 3 or 4 weeks, I felt I had to say something in the interim.
JAN CRAWFORD: But if you had had that material pointed out this would have all been different, you wouldn’t have written the four-page summary?
WILLIAM BARR: Probably not no.
JAN CRAWFORD: I guess just to finish up on this topic then, when we saw the special counsel yesterday, you put out the statement that there wasn’t really any kind of discrepancy in some of things that you had been saying.
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah, we both put out the statement.
JAN CRAWFORD: Was that the first time there had been a joint statement?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes.
WILLIAM BARR: I believe so.
JAN CRAWFORD: — And why was that necessary?
WILLIAM BARR: Well, because I think there was some people who let the facts interfere with their narrative and were trying to suggest that there was a difference of opinion about the role played by the OLC opinion, which simply wasn’t true.
JAN CRAWFORD: The difference is your views on obstruction and–
WILLIAM BARR: — Well the difference was this so —
JAN CRAWFORD: I understand what you’re saying and I guess, I guess you focused on the role the OLC memo, opinion played–
WILLIAM BARR: –Right–
JAN CRAWFORD: –In the statement?
WILLIAM BARR: The so-called discrepancy was that I had, I had testified earlier that Bob had assured me that he had not reached a decision that there was a crime committed but was not willing to pursue it simply because of the OLC opinion and that remains the fact. That’s what his position is. That’s consistent with what he said yesterday. And it certainly is consistent with the joint release we put out. The confusion arose because what Bob Mueller’s position was was that the OLC opinion coupled with other things as a prudential matter made him feel that he shouldn’t even get into the analysis of whether something was a crime or not and that’s a different question than —
JAN CRAWFORD: Right, because you…just because there’s evidence of obstruction or crime was committed doesn’t mean the person is going to be charged or indicted or found to have committed that crime.
WILLIAM BARR: Right and he didn’t even get into that analysis. In other words, what I was discussing earlier was, was Bob, did Bob make a decision there was a crime and the only reason he wasn’t saying that was because of the OLC opinion. The fact is Bob did not make a decision that there was a crime. He didn’t get into the analysis at all. Part of the reason for that was his judgment about the OLC opinion coupled with other things he just didn’t think it was proper exercise of his authority. So it’s a totally different issue and that’s why, that’s why both us feel that this idea that there’s been a discrepancy over the OLC opinion is simply wrong.
JAN CRAWFORD: Did you watch him give the statement yesterday?
WILLIAM BARR: I watched a re-run of it, yeah.
JAN CRAWFORD: Anything new or different?
WILLIAM BARR: No I mean to me it was a reiteration of some of the key elements of his report. I think he wanted to stress a number of things that were in the report. There had been a lot of commentary about his work. I had made some critical remarks about it. So I think it’s quite understandable he wanted to hammer home a few of the key points that were in the report and I thought that that was fine.
JAN CRAWFORD: He said he’s not going to be testifying.
WILLIAM BARR: That’s right.
JAN CRAWFORD: Do you think he should?
WILLIAM BARR: You know, I think as I said, you know, it’s up to Bob, but I think the line he’s drawing which is that he’s going to stick what he said in the report is the proper line for any Department official.
JAN CRAWFORD: But you’ve testified under oath, answered questions under oath. He took no questions yesterday. Is that sufficient?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes, I think it’s sufficient because, you know, he was handling a specific investigation and normally we don’t, we allowed our prosecutors and have them interrogated about how they handled a particular case. I think —
JAN CRAWFORD: But you wouldn’t have objected if he wanted to testify?
WILLIAM BARR: I wouldn’t have objected if he wanted to testify. I do think that his view that he should stick to what is in the report is consistent with the department’s views of these things.
JAN CRAWFORD: So the last thing that he said yesterday was to remind us that Russia tried to sway our election. He said there were multiple systematic efforts to interfere and that deserves the attention of every American. How’s the Justice Department working now to ensure this doesn’t happen again in 2020?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes, we do have. I think an increasingly robust program that is focusing on foreign influence in our election process. The FBI obviously has the lead in that and I’ve been briefed on it on a regular basis and I think it’s a very impressive effort but, we are ramping up. I talked recently to the director of the FBI about putting together a special high-level group to make sure we’re totally prepared for the upcoming elections.
JAN CRAWFORD: And the high level group would be? Who would that include?
WILLIAM BARR: Well, it would include the FBI, the Department of Justice, DHS and intelligence agencies.
JAN CRAWFORD: Do you think enough was done in 2016?
WILLIAM BARR: Enough was done in 2016? Probably not. You know, I think Bob Mueller did some impressive work in his investigation, you know, identifying some of the Russian hackers and their influence campaign and you sort of wonder if that kind of work had been done starting in 2016, things could have been a lot different.
JAN CRAWFORD: Right because it’s just hard to understand why it wasn’t taken more seriously.
WILLIAM BARR: Right.
JAN CRAWFORD: Why do you think it was not?
WILLIAM BARR: I have no idea. That’s one of the things I’m interested in looking at you know–
JAN CRAWFORD: –As part of the review?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes. In other words, you know, there are statements being made that people were warned back in April–
JAN CRAWFORD: –of 2016–
WILLIAM BARR: Right and I don’t have any reason to doubt that, but I’m wondering what exactly was the response to it if they were alarmed. Surely the response should have been more than just, you know, dangling a confidential informant in front of a peripheral player in the Trump Campaign.
JAN CRAWFORD: I want to talk to you about the investigation. Um, because your, that’s suggesting that was obviously inadequate, but when you talk to Director Wray about appointing this high level group and efforts to ensure that this doesn’t happen again in 2020, has he expressed any concern to you that the kind of review that you are now going to undertake, or this investigation of the investigation, that that could hamper these efforts in 2020?
WILLIAM BARR: We’ve discussed how important it is that that not be allowed to happen and we are both very cognizant of that and–
JAN CRAWFORD: —You have discussed that with him?
WILLIAM BARR: Oh yes, and I think he is being very supportive and we’re working together on, you know, trying to reconstruct what happened. People have to understand, you know, one of the things here is that these efforts in 2016, these counter-intelligence activities that were directed at the Trump Campaign, were not done in the normal course and not through the normal procedures as a far as I can tell. And a lot of the people who were involved are no longer there.
JAN CRAWFORD: So when we are talking about the kind of the– well you have used the word spy. You have testified that you believe spying occurred.
WILLIAM BARR: Yes.
JAN CRAWFORD: Into the Trump campaign.
WILLIAM BARR: Yes.
JAN CRAWFORD: You’ve gotten some criticism for using that word.
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah, I mean, I guess it’s become a dirty word somehow. It hasn’t ever been for me. I think there is nothing wrong with spying, the question is always whether it is authorized by law and properly predicated and if it is, then it’s an important tool the United States has to protect the country.
JAN CRAWFORD: On using the word, I mean, do you understand, and I know that some of the, some former intelligence chiefs have said that the president has made that word somewhat pejorative, that there is spying, this is a witch hunt, this is a hoax, and so your use of that word makes it seem that you are being a loyalist.
WILLIAM BARR: You know, it’s part of the craziness of the modern day that if a president uses a word, then all of a sudden it becomes off bounds. It’s a perfectly good English word, I will continue to use it.
JAN CRAWFORD: You’re saying that spying occurred. There’s not anything necessarily wrong with that.
WILLIAM BARR: Right.
JAN CRAWFORD: As long as there’s a reason for it.
WILLIAM BARR: Whether it’s adequately predicated. And look, I think if we — we are worried about foreign influence in the campaign? We should be because the heart of our system is the peaceful transfer of power through elections and what gives the government legitimacy is that process. And if foreign elements can come in and affect it, that’s bad for the republic. But by the same token, it’s just as, it’s just as dangerous to the continuation of self-government and our republican system, republic that we not allow government power, law enforcement or intelligence power, to play a role in politics, to intrude into politics, and affect elections.
JAN CRAWFORD: So it’s just as dangerous- So when we talk about foreign interference versus say a government abuse of power, which is more troubling?
WILLIAM BARR: Well they’re both, they’re both troubling.
JAN CRAWFORD: Equally?
WILLIAM BARR: In my mind, they are, sure. I mean, republics have fallen because of Praetorian Guard mentality where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state. And you know, there is that tendency that they know better and that, you know, they’re there to protect as guardians of the people. That can easily translate into essentially supervening the will of the majority and getting your own way as a government official.
JAN CRAWFORD: And you are concerned that that may have happened in 2016?
WILLIAM BARR: Well, I just think it has to be carefully look at because the use of foreign intelligence capabilities and counterintelligence capabilities against an American political campaign to me is unprecedented and it’s a serious red line that’s been crossed.
JAN CRAWFORD: Did that happen?
WILLIAM BARR: There were counterintelligence activities undertaken against the Trump Campaign. And I’m not saying there was not a basis for it, that it was legitimate, but I want to see what that basis was and make sure it was legitimate.
JAN CRAWFORD: So–
WILLIAM BARR: That’s one of the, you know, one of the key responsibilities of the Attorney General, core responsibilities of the Attorney General is to make sure that government power is not abused and that the right of Americans are not transgressed by abusive government power. That’s the responsibility of the Attorney General.
JAN CRAWFORD: You know the- I guess- we’ve spent the last two years or more talking about and hearing about Russian interference into the elections and what occurred there. And so now we’re shifting to talking about actually investigating, reviewing that investigation and the people who did that. So I guess in making this turn can you help us understand, I mean what’s- what is the concern? What have you seen, what’s the basis for that?
WILLIAM BARR: Well I don’t want to get you know, too much into the facts because it’s still under review. But I think it’s important to understand what basis there was for launching counterintelligence activities against a political campaign, which is the core of our second amendment- I’m sorry, the core of our first amendment liberties in this country. And what was the predicate for it? What was the hurdle that had to be crossed? What was the process- who had to approve it? And including the electronic surveillance, whatever electronic surveillance was done. And was everyone operating in their proper lane? And I’ve selected a terrific career prosecutor from the department who’s been there over thirty years, he’s now the U.S. attorney.
WILLIAM BARR: But he has, over the years, been used by both Republican and Democratic attorney generals to investigate these kinds of activities. And he’s always gotten the most laudatory feedback from his work. So there’s no doubt in my mind that he’s going- he’s going to conduct a thorough and fair review of this. And we’re working closely with the intelligence agencies, the bureau and the agency and others to help us reconstruct what happened. And I want to see, what were the standards that were applied. What was the evidence? What were the techniques used? Who approved them? Was there a legitimate basis for it?
JAN CRAWFORD: The Inspector General is looking at only, it is my understanding, a small part of this? Is that correct? the FISA warrant?
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah, I wouldn’t say small but he’s looking at a discrete area that is- that is you know, important, which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at Carter Page.
JAN CRAWFORD: And could he have… could you have just said I want to expand this investigation? Why did you feel it was necessary to turn to John Durham?
WILLIAM BARR: Well the inspector general at the department, Mike Horowitz, who you know is a superb government official he has limited powers. He doesn’t have the power to compel testimony, he doesn’t have the power really to investigate beyond the current cast of characters at the Department of Justice. His ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the department is very limited
JAN CRAWFORD: So he wouldn’t have been able to go and try to speak with some of the former officials who are making these decisions, necessarily?
WILLIAM BARR: Right
JAN CRAWFORD: If they are not in the department anymore.
WILLIAM BARR: Right
JAN CRAWFORD: Um, what’s the status of Huber’s investigation in Utah? I think the former Attorney General Sessions had asked him to look at this.
WILLIAM BARR: Right, so Huber had originally been asked to take a look at the FISA applications and the electronic surveillance but then he stood back and put that on hold while the Office of Inspector General was conducting its review, which would’ve been normal for the department. And he was essentially on standby in case Mr. Horowitz referred a matter to him to be handled criminally. So he has not been active on this front in recent months and so Durham is taking over that role. The other issues he’s been working on relate to Hillary Clinton. Those are winding down and hopefully we’ll be in a position to bring those to fruition.
JAN CRAWFORD: So he won’t be involved in this really at all then?
WILLIAM BARR: No.
JAN CRAWFORD: This is his role, it’s done?
WILLIAM BARR: Right.
JAN CRAWFORD: And now Durham is going to pick up–
WILL BARR: Yes, right.
JAN CRAWFORD: –this. So again, just to go, just so that I think so people can more fully understand this, I mean have you, and I know it’s early in the investigation, but when we are talking about the basis for this and why you think it is important and obviously any kind of government abuse of power, I mean, you were in the CIA in the ’70s. You can see how that can have….
WILLIAM BARR: Right, when I, when I joined the CIA almost 50 years ago as an intern and this was during the Vietnam, civil rights era and there had been a lot…there were a lot of pending investigations of the CIA and there the issues were what was- when was it appropriate for intelligence agencies, the FBI too was under investigation. You know, the penetration of civil rights groups because at the time there was concerns about contacts with, you know, communist funded front groups and things like that and you know how deeply could you get into civil rights groups or anti-Vietnam war groups. A lot of these groups were in contact with foreign adversaries, they had some contact with front organizations and so forth and there were a lot of rules put in place and those rules are under the attorney general. The attorney general’s responsibility is to make sure that these powers are not used to tread upon first amendment activity and that certainly was a big part of my formative years of dealing with those issues. The fact that today people just seem to brush aside the idea that it is okay to you know, to engage in these activities against a political campaign is stunning to me especially when the media doesn’t seem to think that it’s worth looking into. They’re supposed to be the watchdogs of, you know, our civil liberties.
JAN CRAWFORD: What have you seen? What evidence? What makes you think, I need to take a look at this? I mean, what have you seen in the summer of 2016?
WILLIAM BARR: Well, I’ll say at this point is that it, you know, I- like many other people who are familiar with intelligence activities, I had a lot of questions about what was going on. I assumed I’d get answers when I went in and I have not gotten answers that are well satisfactory, and in fact probably have more questions, and that some of the facts that- that I’ve learned don’t hang together with the official explanations of what happened.
JAN CRAWFORD: What do you mean by that?
WILLIAM BARR: That’s all I really will say. Things are just not jiving, and I’m not saying at this stage that–
JAN CRAWFORD: Was it a timeline?
WILLIAM BARR: There was a timeline, there’s some timeline–
JAN CRAWFORD: I mean, there’s a concern that this may have happened before we realized that the investigation was initiated in July. I mean, what…
WILLIAM BARR: I don’t want to get into those details at this point. I would just say that, you know…
JAN CRAWFORD: But you said there’s a timeline concern.
WILLIAM BARR: Well I won’t, I won’t confirm that, but I’ll just say that, you know, there’s some questions that I think have to be answered, and I have a basis for feeling there has to be a review of this.
JAN CRAWFORD: You’ve said, you’ve said the time frame between the election and the inauguration, you’ve said this publicly, was kind of strange. Some strange things may have happened. What concerns you there? Specifically, the meeting at Trump Tower.
WILLIAM BARR: I don’t want to- I don’t want to get into that.
JAN CRAWFORD: Okay. Yes. So kind of going back to what we were talking about with Director Wray, I mean obviously you’ve seen this like the people are raising concerns that this is going to undermine FBI morale. The rank and file- what are we saying here- but you said in recent Senate testimony, “this is not launching an investigation of the FBI frankly to the extent there were any issues at the FBI, I do not view it as a problem that’s endemic to the FBI. I think there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.”
WILLIAM BARR: That’s right.
JAN CRAWFORD: So there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon?
WILLIAM BARR: Correct. In other words, I don’t believe this is a problem you know, rife through the bureau.
JAN CRAWFORD: What suggests to you there was a failure in the upper echelon at the FBI?
WILLIAM BARR: Because I think the activities were undertaken by a small group at the top which is one of the- probably one of the mistakes that has been made instead of running this as a normal bureau investigation or counterintelligence investigation. It was done by the executives at the senior level. Out of head quarters–
JAN CRAWFORD: And you’re talking about James Comey, McCabe?
WILLIAM BARR: I’m just not going to get into the individual names at this point. But I just view that- I don’t view it as a bureau wide issue. And I will say the same thing for other intelligence agencies. And they’re being very cooperative in helping us.
JAN CRAWFORD: They’re being cooperative?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes.
JAN CRAWFORD: You’re working with the DNI, the head of CIA. I want to ask you about something- just declassification. But the president has tweeted and said publicly that some in the upper echelon, Comey, McCabe, etc., committed treason. I mean do you agree with that?
WILLIAM BARR: Well, I- as a lawyer I always interpret the word treason not colloquially but legally. And you know the very specific criteria for treason- so I don’t think it’s actually implicated in the situation that we have now. But I think what he–
JAN CRAWFORD: Legally.
JAN CRAWFORD: You don’t think that they’ve committed treason?
WILLIAM BARR: Not as a legal matter, no.
JAN CRAWFORD: But you have concerns about how they conducted the investigation?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes but you know, when you’re dealing with official government contact, intent is frequently a murky issue. I’m not suggesting that people did what they did necessarily because of conscious, nefarious motives. Sometimes people can convince themselves that what they’re doing is in the higher interest, the better good. They don’t realize that what they’re doing is really antithetical to the democratic system that we have. They start viewing themselves as the guardians of the people that are more informed and insensitive than everybody else. They can- in their own mind, they can have those kinds of motives. And sometimes they can look at evidence and facts through a biased prism that they themselves don’t realize.
WILLIAM BARR: That something objectively as applied as a neutral principle across the board really you know, shouldn’t be the standard used in the case but because they have a particular bias they don’t see that. So that’s why procedures and standards are important and review afterward is an important way of making sure that government power is being conscientiously and properly applied. It doesn’t necessarily mean that there are people- you know, that people have crossed lines have done so with corrupt intent or anything like that.
JAN CRAWFORD: But it seems like you have a concern that there may have been a bias by top officials in the FBI as they looked at whether to launch and conduct this investigation?
WILLIAM BARR: Well it’s hard to read some of the texts with and not feel that there was gross bias at work and they’re appalling. And if the shoe were on the other–
JAN CRAWFORD: Appalling.
WILLIAM BARR: Those were appalling. And on their face they were very damning and I think if the shoe was on the other foot we could be hearing a lot about it. If those kinds of discussions were held you know when Obama first ran for office, people talking about Obama in those tones and suggesting that “Oh that he might be a Manchurian candidate for Islam or something like that.” You know some wild accusations like that and you had that kind of discussion back and forth, you don’t think we would be hearing a lot more about it?
JAN CRAWFORD: You- I guess when you said that there were things done that were not the typical run of business, ad hoc, small group, it’s not how these counterintelligence operations normally work. I think that maybe Comey and others might say well this was such an extraordinary thing we had to keep it so closely held. So we had to do it differently what’s your response to that? Is that legit?
WILLIAM BARR: Well it might be legit under certain circumstances but a lot of that has to do with how good the evidence was at that point. And you know Mueller has spent two and half years and the fact is there is no evidence of a conspiracy. So it was bogus, this whole idea that the Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus
JAN CRAWFORD: So did you ask the president for authority to declassify?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes.
JAN CRAWFORD: You asked the president?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes and also you know, the direction of the intelligence agencies to support our efforts.
JAN CRAWFORD: So did you discuss this with the DNI and head of the CIA?
WILLIAM BARR: Yes.
JAN CRAWFORD: And what’s their response?
WILLIAM BARR: That they’re going to be supportive.
JAN CRAWFORD: And so you won’t will you declassify things without reviewing it with them it seems like you have the authority to do that?
WILLIAM BARR: Well in an exceptional circumstance I have that authority but obviously I intend to consult with them. I’m amused by these people who make a living by disclosing classified information, including the names of intelligence operatives, wringing their hands about whether I’m going to be responsible in protecting intelligence sources and methods. I’ve been in the business as I’ve said for over 50 years long before they were born and I know how to handle classified information and I believe strongly in protecting intelligence sources and methods. But at the same time if there is information that can be shared with the American people without jeopardizing intelligence sources and methods that decision should be made and because I will be involved in finding out what the story was I think I’m in the best decision to make that decision
JAN CRAWFORD: I know you’ve seen some of the criticism and the push back on- on this. Do you have any concerns that doing this investigation, talking about de-classifying certain materials- that that’s undermining your credibility or the credibility of the department?
WILLIAM BARR: No I- I don’t. I think it’s- actually the reaction is somewhat strange. I mean normally–
JAN CRAWFORD: Strange?
WILLIAM BARR: Sure.
JAN CRAWFORD: Their reaction?
WILLIAM BARR: Well the media reaction is strange. Normally the media would be interested in letting the sunshine in and finding out what the truth is. And usually the media doesn’t care that much about protecting intelligence sources and methods. But I do and I will.
JAN CRAWFORD: You are only the second Attorney General in history who’s served twice. I think the first one was back in 1850.
WILLIAM BARR: Right.
JAN CRAWFORD: But you are working for a man who is- I mean you are an establishment figure in a way. You’ve had a long career in Washington but you are working for a man who is not establishment. And some of his tweets about officials and the rule of law, how do you react when you see those? Are you on Twitter? Do you read his tweets?
WILLIAM BARR: No, I am not on Twitter and every once in a while a tweet is brought to my attention but my experience with the president is, we have- we have a good working, professional working relationship. We, you know, we talk to each other and if he has something to say to me I figure he’ll tell me directly. I don’t look to tweets for, you know, I don’t look at them as directives or as official communications with the department.
JAN CRAWFORD: But when you came into this job, you were kind of, it’s like the US Attorney in Connecticut, I mean, you had a good reputation on the right and on the left. You were a man with a good reputation. You are not someone who is, you know, accused of protecting the president, enabling the president, lying to Congress. Did you expect that coming in? And what is your response to it? How do you? What’s your response to that?
WILLIAM BARR: Well in a way I did expect it.
JAN CRAWFORD: You did?
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah, because I realize we live in a crazy hyper-partisan period of time and I knew that it would only be a matter of time if I was behaving responsibly and calling them as I see them, that I would be attacked because nowadays people don’t care about the merits and the substance. They only care about who it helps, who benefits, whether my side benefits or the other side benefits, everything is gauged by politics. And as I say, that’s antithetical to the way the department runs and any attorney general in this period is going to end up losing a lot of political capital and I realize that and that is one of the reasons that I ultimately was persuaded that I should take it on because I think at my stage in life it really doesn’t make any difference.
JAN CRAWFORD: You are at the end of your career, or?
WILLIAM BARR: I am at the end of my career. I’ve you know–
JAN CRAWFORD: Does it, I mean, it’s the reputation that you have worked your whole life on though?
WILLIAM BARR: Yeah, but everyone dies and I am not, you know, I don’t believe in the Homeric idea that you know, immortality comes by, you know, having odes sung about you over the centuries, you know?
JAN CRAWFORD: So you don’t regret taking the job?
WILLIAM BARR: No.
JAN CRAWFORD: Not even today?
WILLIAM BARR: I’d rather, in many ways, I’d rather be back to my old life but I think that I love the Department of Justice, I love the FBI, I think it’s important that we not, in this period of intense partisan feeling, destroy our institutions. I think one of the ironies today is that people are saying that it’s President Trump that’s shredding our institutions. I really see no evidence of that, it is hard, and I really haven’t seen bill of particulars as to how that’s being done. From my perspective the idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him and you know, really changing the norms on the grounds that we have to stop this president, that is where the shredding of our norms and our institutions is occurring.
JAN CRAWFORD: And you think that happened even with the investigation into the campaign, potentially?
WILLIAM BARR: I am concerned about that.

Exposing the RINO Underground By Smoking Out the ‘Never Trumpers’ One-by-One,spectator.org,Dov Fischer,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/exposing-the-rino-underground-by-smoking-out-the-never-trumpers-one-by-one/,"Exposing the RINO Underground By Smoking Out the ‘Never Trumpers’ One-by-One Soon enough Ana Navarro will be biting her nails. by Tom Raabe
O h, Rep. Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, wants the President impeached? Oh. Wow!
But, uh, who exactly is Justin… a Rash ? Like, really. Who is this character? Beto O’Rourke with the ear hairs still inserted?
Indeed — who are these characters and circus clowns who show up on CNN, MSNBC, and similar organs presenting themselves as Republicans committed to ousting the President? Are these really Republicans — or simply circus acts for new gigs now that Barnum & Bailey permanently has closed down?
Honestly — really, honestly — who ever heard of Ana Navarro before she became a CNN “expert Republican” on what is wrong with Trump and with the entire Republican political agenda? Sure, Mitt Romney reviles Trump, but at least Romney is conservative on several issues, even if he is the Father of Obamacare and soft on many other areas. But he is not against the entire Republican conservative agenda. The Mormons of Utah would not stand for it. Honestly — he believes in capitalism, the right to life, even spoke of self-deportation.
But when it comes to Justin A Rash or this Ana Navarro, what in the world are they doing, walking around and filing their fingernails as “Republicans”? They do not stand for most anything that even the most moderate conservatives advocate. Who are they? How did they pawn themselves off on the GOP?
Bill Kristol once was conservative on many issues, though too adventurist on the international front, but he now completely went off the deep edge. How sad! But we move on. George Will once was a go-to thinker for limited government and rock-ribbed conservative principles. He really was. What in the world happened to him? On the other hand, Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post never was a serious Republican, so no loss there. Same with David Brooks, the resident “Republican” at the New York Times . Baloney. He is no Abe Rosenthal or William Safire, never was. Same with Morning Joe. Even before he got an early show and got intimate with Mika, he never was a solidly conservative talk-show host.
Where do these people come off presenting themselves as “Republicans,” as “conservatives,” who “simply do not like Trump” or even find his personal failings un-Presidential? And how did so many of them infiltrate the only mainstream political alternative this country has to the Democrat Left?
Certainly, it is legitimate for a conservative to harbor concerns about a President who uses foul language in public. Even Richard Nixon, whose mouth was more septic than a sewer, kept his cursing behind closed doors, to be heard only by his inner circle and the microphone in the telephone and the one in the lamp and the one in the stapler. Joe Biden lets a “cuss” word slip here and there, like when he whispered to Obama, but that is because Biden is a patent-protected Gaffe Machine without a rubber gasket, with a word dripping out here, another there, whether profane or just plain moronic. He does speak very well in public, when he does not start repeating his same sentences over and over, but he always ends up saying something that raises questions about either his I.Q. or whether something irreversibly has happened to him. And then there is Trump’s Stormy Daniels stuff and the other Galaxy of Silicone-Implanted Minds with whom Trump has consorted after hours. Something obviously was amiss, whatever it was, because no guy as wealthy as Trump hires a lowlife sub-mediocrity like Michael Cohen for actual legal advice, like the stuff found in law books. Cohen obviously was retained to pass around cash.
So the concerns about Trump’s personal-character flaws are fair. But as so many prominent theologians throughout the G-d-conscious Christian community and the Orthodox Jewish community realize, our Presidents often have profound failings of character. Obama was a brazen liar, a financially corrupt cheat who got rich with the help of the felon Tony Rezko and who consorted with the worst racists in America: Louis Farrakhan, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Al Sharpton. Clinton’s private life was a stain on the American fabric. John Kennedy was a dossier that even Christopher Steele could not compile. By contrast, the two most honest and personally decent among the whole lot of them in the past half century were Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, and one can debate for years which of those two destroyed the American economy worse, presided over foreign affairs more disastrously and incompetently, and left behind a more bewildering mess.
Thus, on one hand, it is reasonable for serious Republican conservatives to harbor concern about aspects of the President’s personal demeanor. Yet he has proven himself to be a truly great President, one of our country’s ten best in more than two centuries. His policies are consistently better and more truly conservative than those of Ronald Reagan, the Republican Gold Standard, whether on border issues, the economy, staring down the enemy in the financial and trade sector, seeing the flaws of weakly negotiated free trade agreements, avoiding entangling Americans in areas overseas where we should not be (like 241 Marines blown up by Arab Muslim terrorists in Southern Lebanon), even on issues like social conservatism at home. Reagan condemned Israel’s bombing and eradication of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor in Iraq; by contrast, Trump has recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel, Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and has moved the American embassy there, something that Reagan promised to do but did not. Reagan extended amnesty to Illegals, setting in motion the border disaster that has unfolded over the next two generations and that has politically destroyed California and New Mexico, while politically imperiling Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. Reagan advanced the Free Trade Agreements that drove so much manufacturing out of America and almost ended our steel and aluminum industries that are essential to our national security. Reagan used the most important opportunity a President gets — the chance to fill Supreme Court openings — to name Sandra O’Connor and thereafter to name Anthony Kennedy. Yes, Antonin Scalia was a great pick, but one out of three does not compare to Trump’s selections of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Reagan, then, was Mount Rushmore material, but Donald Trump’s still-emerging legacy is even greater.
When Donald Trump campaigned for the Presidency, he formulated several slogans that resonated with the Republican conservative base. One of the main ones: Drain the Swamp. But he and his public never realized how murky and dirty that swamp is, how severe and pervasive. In one arena, it took a Trump Presidency to uncover — to unmask — the swamp in the Justice Department and its slimy tentacles, ranging from Comey to McCabe to Strzok to Page to Ohr to Brennan and Clapper. The whole filthy cesspool lot of them. No one knew how far it went, how deep, how slithery, how far up.
In truth, it remains to be seen whether the President ultimately will succeed in draining that septic swamp or whether the swamp ultimately will overwhelm him, pulling him down like quicksand. Perhaps the IG Report soon to be published by Inspector General Michael Horowitz will shed some light. Perhaps not. Perhaps the declassification of documents that Attorney-General William Barr now is evaluating will reveal. Perhaps not. Perhaps those other two investigations now being undertaken by John Huber and John Durham, respectively the United States Attorneys for Utah and Connecticut. Perhaps not.
It is not yet clear whether Trump or The Swamp will win. So much will depend on the 2020 elections. If Trump is reelected and the GOP takes both legislative chambers, the Republic really can be restored, and the American Experiment revives. If not, the rot will worsen, like an osteoporosis of the national soul, fearfully irreversible, decaying, rotting.
Even as Trump — just by being Crazy Bulldog Trump — caused the haters, villains, and even traitors within the Justice Department to go mad, to expose themselves, so he has brought out the poison within the Republican Party body politic itself.
Take, for example, the vile and loathsome Ana Navarro. I have seen Navarro on CNN perhaps three or four times. That is because I stopped watching CNN several years ago, except once-every-two years on national election nights because I really like the way John King analyzes the votes coming in, precinct by precinct. But I have seen glimpses of CNN at my dry cleaner or at the airport. (When I bring my car in for servicing, they know by now to give me the remote so that I can switch the TV in the waiting room from CNN to Fox News — or, when Shepard Smith is on, to the MLB baseball station.) Between those rare glimpses of Navarro, and occasional snippets of that Thing that get aired on Hannity or Laura when that vile object is shown obnoxiously filing her nails during a “debate,” I have figured this out: She claims to be a Republican. She takes the Democrat Left side on virtually every single issue that gets discussed, no matter how little it has to do with anything Trump. She was an advisor to John McCain. She was an even higher-up advisor in Florida to Jeb! Bush. Had Trump not saved the day, Jeb! might have become the nominee of the Republicans. Had Jeb! been elected President, he would have surrounded himself with such “Republicans” as the Nail File.
So the question persists: How did so many Leftists like that one end up as Republican insiders ?
In thinking about it, one begins to realize why Ronald Reagan stood out as so unique for his day and time, and that we essentially have not had a truly conservative alternative political party in this country for close to a century before Trump. Neither of the George Bushes was dependably conservative. One lied, raised taxes, and devoted his one vanilla term to eradicating the Reagan Revolution. The other, not far from the apple tree, ran the economy into the ground just as Daddy had done, without ending the Democrats’ toxic economic programs that fatally destroyed the financial sector, as when they forced banks to lend housing-mortgage loans to thousands of people who never-in-a-million-years were going to be able to repay them. The first Bush named David Souter to the Supreme Court. The next one tried naming Harriet Miers and could not find anyone more conservative than John Roberts. (By some incredible good fortune, he later named Samuel Alito.) Similarly, Nixon named a boatload of shipwrecks to the Court. Ike named Earl Warren.
What kind of two-party system was this?
It took a complete outsider with political views no one completely knew, and in whose consistency no one could be completely certain, to come in and change not only Washington but to save the Republican Party. Most fair-minded sincere Republicans who legitimately doubted in 2016 whether Trump would be true to his promises and remain sincerely consistently conservative have come aboard, fully persuaded by now that he truly is the first real Republican conservative President since Reagan and thus only the second in nearly a century. But what of the others? Not merely the “Never Trumpers” but the outright RINOs, the absolute Counterfeits?
That may prove to be yet another of Trump’s lasting legacies. He drives them crazy, thereby driving them out of hiding to expose themselves so that they can be identified clearly. When future GOP Presidential candidates emerge in future years, the Counterfeits now are known. The kind of Counterfeit “Republican” who can say on Left media that Republican voters should select a Hillary, should vote Democrat, meaning that the Supreme Court would be lost along with the federal appellate courts and district courts… who could oppose efforts to control the southern border… who could oppose tougher trade policies overseas and more generous tax cuts at home. Such a person is a bane on the Republican Party, ruining it from the inside far worse than can any Democrat Left politician outside. Such RINOs and Counterfeits continually have prevented the emergence of a viable conservative mainstream voice in our country through the decades, resulting in so much of the corroded social and political infrastructure that exists today.
Like a strong but heavily toxic antibiotic used to fight Lyme disease or some sepsis in the body, but which causes real pain as it drives the embedded poisons out into the bloodstream, Trump has driven so much of the foreign RINO bodies out of their embedded cells, but they have not yet been extracted completely from the body politic of the GOP. More time is needed to extract it all as the RINO Underground and outright Counterfeits get exposed, one-by-one. That, too, is the swamp Trump has uncovered for draining. It yet may be Trump’s greatest contribution to making America great again."
A Plea to Millennials: Save Our Worship,spectator.org,Tom Raabe,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/a-plea-to-millennials-save-our-worship/,"by Dov Fischer
I talked with a good buddy of mine the other night about the Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) takeover of my denomination, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. Needless to say, we didn’t break any new ground. We’ve been complaining about this for 30 years — always the same arguments, always the same irritation, always the same, at the end, resignation.
He always ends up blaming the music. Some of the old-style hymns we sing can be pretty stodgy, he says, and tend to turn off young people. He proffers hymn titles like “I Come, O Savior, to Thy Table” as examples and says, “They don’t want to sing these lugubrious dirges, played torturously slow by the organist. That’s why they go contemporary.” He thinks if we had more lively but still sacred-sounding hymns composed by Herbert Brokering and Martin Franzmann and their kind, the legions that fled to the 7/11 world would come streaming back into our sanctuaries with a newfound enthusiasm for march time, musical notation, and pipe organs.
I always end up blaming our educational institutions. For the past 30 years, or more, our seminaries have been pumping out pastors who, once they get into a parish, abandon what they were taught about liturgy and music and go over to the happy-clappy side. “You’d think a seminary that espoused the traditional liturgy would produce pastors who believed in the historical liturgy and had enough sand to defend its theological warrants!” is what I tell him.
We disagree on why we got to where we are, but we agree that we’re there.
Any casual tour of my denomination’s churches will reveal how right we are. Rare — practically unknown — is the church that has not bent at least one knee to this movement. Some pastors meld contemporary songs with organ-led hymn singing and call it a blended service; others establish rival services, one for the traditionalists, one for the moderns. Who knows how many churches have installed the furniture of rock ’n’ roll in their chancels — the amps and music stands and keyboards and drum kits and microphones — and affixed disagreeable worship screens to the front walls.
If it’s any consolation, we have plenty of company in the Christian world. The National Congregations Study, published in 2015, a survey of nearly four thousand congregations from across the Christian spectrum undertaken by researchers at Duke University, found traditional aspects of worship in decline. Between 1998 and 2012, congregations that used choirs in worship decreased from 54 to 45 percent; those using organs dropped from 53 to 42 percent. But use of drums — a big uptick there: 20 percent of congregations used drums in 1998, 34 percent in 2012. Churches printing bulletins fell from 72 to 62 percent. The use of projected images (translation: worship screens) skyrocketed by 23 percent in the same period. Informality in worship is way up (shouting “Amen,” wearing shorts to church, toting a “go cup”); formality way down (calling the minister “Pastor Last Name Here,” dressing up for services).
That’s the trend line for the historic liturgy — down, down, and down. Which brings up the question: What now? Seriously, what is going to happen to liturgical worship in the foreseeable future?
We can trot out all the usual criticisms in an effort to turn the CCM crowd’s head. The songs are repetitive — they don’t get the moniker “7/11 songs” for their lyrical sophistication. A lot of them are performance numbers open to interpretative treatment, and thus less than optimal for group singing — which, when coupled with the amps being cranked up to 11, explains why nobody sings at contemporary services. As for content, CCM numbers do not exactly limn Augsburg Confession–level theology. Many are filled with pious generalities, acceptable to the full range of Christian denominations, and even some non-Christian religions. And they’re all about me, me, me, focusing on how I feel about God, whereas the really good news, the news that uplifts us, pertains to God’s “feelings” about us.
Not only do our criticisms fail to gain purchase but we get pushback. None of that is new, either. It’s all adiaphora , we’re told — the Bible prescribes no worship style. We hear the old evangelical style–Lutheran substance stuff that we heard in the ’80s and ’90s: we keep our doctrine but just package worship in a different way, a better way, like the evangelicals do, whose churches, in case you haven’t noticed, are packed every Sunday with excited worshipers singing contemporary songs. We’re told it’s what the people want, that CCM speaks to the modern heart and doesn’t turn people off like the dry, old-timey worship does. It appeals to the youth, the lifeblood of any organization. We’re told it’s a generational thing, it’s a relevance thing. We’re told churches that don’t do it will die. All of which boils down to one thing: people like it; it’s popular . It puts fannies in the chairs.
And to make matters worse, the religious landscape has changed dramatically since CCM burst on the scene a half century ago. We used to argue that the form itself was incongruous. It was rock music, after all, albeit of the easy-listening, KOOL 105 sort. It had no place in a room with pews and stained-glass windows and time-honored chancel appointments, where the sounds of worship for a quarter-millennium consisted almost entirely of voice and organ. The associations were just too strong. You simply didn’t do rock music in church.
Pop-style melodies overlaid with a patina of religiosity in the form of Christian lyrics gave off a secular vibe regardless of any sacred intent. Just as one associated the chorale, the measured musical cadence, the march time, of a hymn, with Christian worship, one associated pop music, with its ubiquitous back beat, with the secular world, with concert venues and dance clubs. If you pasted pious words to a Van Halen melody, you’d still be doing Van Halen. The music itself would still call up mental associations of hair bands and Spandex.
We can’t make that case anymore. The form of rock music has become the form of religious music for much of the church. For everybody under forty who has grown up with the CCM movement, CCM is what the church is all about. They’ve probably attended worship services with CCM, and only CCM, since they’ve been going to church. Put them in a big darkened room where throngs of people stand waving their arms back and forth, with strobe lights scanning the walls and ceiling and pulsating guitar riffs bombarding their ears, and maybe a smoke machine pumping out water vapor on the platform, and they think they’re doing church .
That’s what makes the situation so dire for traditionalists. That’s why the fear is real: liturgical services are doomed to die when the people sitting in the pews of those liturgical services die. Which, incidentally, if you canvass the amount of gray hair in those pews, might not be that far into the future.
And on top of that, we are fighting the Zeitgeist — in all its casual, militantly informal, unprescribed, instantly-connective power. It is supremely countercultural to attend a somewhat formal event in an odd-shaped building with strange furniture, and continually stand up and sit down, and sing measured, largely unsyncopated, straight-time songs from a book you hold in your hands. And to do that for an hour, or more, without looking at your phone? It is, as they say, a tough “ask.”
But the Zeitgeist may have thrown us a bone. Although the intra-Christian movement seems to be in a contemporary direction, outside the church it’s a different story. A recent survey by Gallup showed that church membership has dropped by about 20 percent in the last twenty years. While that is not news any of us can exult in, the major group staying away, the “nones,” are millennials, the famously “spiritual but not religious.” While Americans born in 1945 or before indicated they belonged to religious institutions to the tune of 68 percent, only 42 percent of millennials claimed the same. The numbers from other studies are similarly dire.
This demographic represents a fertile mission field. What do they want? It seems millennials are not particularly keen on following their parents and, yes, grandparents — it’s the boomers who are the biggest backers of CCM — into the big boxy rooms with stackable church chairs and worship screens. Jonathan Aigner, writing in Patheos , says millennials are “seeking old ways of doing things.” They are demonstrating “an increasing rejection of the church of the 1990s and 2000s. More emphasis is being placed on liturgy and community, and less on using corporate worship chiefly as a contrived evangelistic tool,” Aigner claims.
They may not attend church, but the overwhelming majority of millennials aren’t atheists; two-thirds still believe in a higher power and 20 percent still pray every day, according to a PBS NewsHour interview with Harvard University’s Casper ter Kuile in 2017. While the report championed alternative forms of community that functioned as religious groups traditionally have — like dinner parties for the grieving, lifting weights and climbing ropes with the dedicated like-minded, yoga and meditation — one can’t help but think such content-lite, interiorizing, gnostic forms of religiosity will eventually be found unfulfilling.
The “spiritual but not religious” crowd might at some point want to attach theological muscle to their skeletal spirituality, sinews that derive from something more authoritative than their feelings. They might even want to lock into a ritualistic form that emanates almost totally from a sacred text, that gets them out of their own heads and into an objective presentation of God’s grace acting on their lives.
The historic liturgy checks all those boxes. Its elements are taken directly from Scripture, and it conveys the gospel message of sin and forgiveness in an effective and beautiful way, even apart from whatever good news is promulgated from the pulpit. We have confession and forgiveness built into the script, so to speak, and then forgiveness realized in the Eucharist.
The hymns, as well, convey that gospel in all its glory and beauty. The poetry is refined, serious, elegant, espousing a vocabulary suitable to the holy place in which it is sung. Our forebears in faith sang many of the same melodies, with the same words, thus offering us a spiritual connection to the church down through centuries, even millennia on occasion, when we sing historic, ancient hymns. New hymns by creative, traditional hymnwriters are breaking into the rota as well, putting lyrics to sacred-sounding melodies that will appeal to seekers serious enough to want theological meat in their Sunday morning menu.
Is it possible that young people, when they seriously pursue spiritual fulfillment, will move away from content-lite, culturally conforming, ever-new and novel worship practices and toward a style of worship and hymnody that has nourished Christians for millennia?
The survival of traditional worship may depend on it."

W ashington
It’s July 8, 2017, and the New York Times has submitted questions to the White House about a June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting between top figures within the Trump campaign. On the list: the candidate’s son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; campaign chairman Paul Manafort; and a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. As he determines how to respond, President Donald Trump is on Air Force One returning from the G-20 summit in Hamburg after his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It was a pivotal moment for Trump, and he took the wrong path.
A month before G-20, Trump had learned about the Trump Tower meeting with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. As special counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report on the investigation into Russian interference in the election detailed, Trump also had learned about emails sent to Trump Jr. that teased him with the prospect of a “Crown prosecutor of Russia” providing “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia” as a show of support from Putin’s government.
“If it’s what you say, I love it,” Trump Jr. emailed back, as he agreed to a meeting.
On Air Force One a year later, Trump could have directed his attorneys to forward the emails to the Mueller team. Instead, Trump edited his son’s draft press statement by deleting Trump Jr.’s admission that the meeting involved an individual who “might have information helpful to the campaign.” In the statement edited by the president, Trump Jr. simply said that, during the meeting, “We discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.”
Team Trump sent the draft back to Trump Jr., who then added the word “primarily” because, he texted, “If I don’t have it in there, it appears as though I’m lying later when they inevitably leak something.”
Trump should have handed the emails over to Mueller right then with an honest explanation of what happened — because not much happened, as Mueller himself concluded.
According to the Mueller report, Veselnitskaya told campaign staffers that Russia funneled illicit funds to Clinton and other Democrats. When Trump Jr. asked for proof, she did not pony up. Instead, she talked about the Magnitsky Act and Russia’s retaliatory ban on American adoptions of Russian children.
According to the Mueller report: “Trump Jr. suggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was elected. After the election, Veselnitskaya made additional efforts to follow up on the meeting, but the Trump Transition Team did not engage.”
“If they (Trump and his team) had turned over Donald Trump Jr.’s emails to the special prosecutor as soon as they had been discovered by the lawyers, it would be impossible to say they were trying to obstruct any investigation,” said Mark Corallo, who worked for the Trump legal team briefly and as a spokesman for the Department of Justice contemporaneously with Mueller under President George W. Bush, in an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal . “They had nothing to hide. There was nothing illegal about the meeting.”
A few weeks ago, I asked the “what if” question: How might Trump have begun his presidency if then-FBI chief James Comey had not poisoned the well by informing Trump about a so-called Russian dossier shortly before his inauguration? It was a reveal that was followed by a leak — an experience that gave Trump reason to distrust federal investigators and U.S. intelligence brass.
Today’s “what if” questions: What would have happened if Trump hadn’t tried to bury what he knew about the Trump Tower meeting? What would have happened if Trump had behaved as if he had nothing to hide and, of greater importance, if he had acted as if the moment was about the country and not his ego?
After Mueller gave a brief statement announcing his retirement and his preference not to speak about the report in the future, a number of Trump defenders took up the president’s claim that Mueller was a “never-Trumper” who was out to get the disruptive Republican.
There are big problems with the Mueller probe, which netted a string of convictions for crimes not tied to Russia and the campaign. It took 22 months to find really nothing. Mueller’s list of possible acts of obstruction included Trump’s firing of Comey — as if it’s a crime to fire a fed.
But let’s not pretend that Trump did not provoke the Mueller team’s suspicions.
It is the rare federal prosecutor who sees a suspect baldly lie about a key meeting — albeit to the media, not investigators — and doesn’t smell a rat.
Of course, the intelligence community was suspicious when Trump boasted to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump boasted. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off… I’m not under investigation.” And Trump didn’t help himself when he seized an interpreter’s notes after he met with Putin at that G-20 meeting.
I realize it is not in Trump’s DNA to admit that his actions fueled the suspicions of federal law enforcement and intelligence officials. But they did contribute to the snail’s pace of the investigation.
Over the coming months, more Democrats will call for Trump’s impeachment, and others will engage in tactics meant to create paralysis by a thousand subpoenas. They know that there was no criminal violation and no coordination between the campaign and the Kremlin, and they don’t care.
But let’s not pretend this was a one-way street or that much of this saga could have been different if only had behaved like a president.

Trigger Words: A Gun Ride Through American History,spectator.org,Daniel Lee,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/trigger-words-a-gun-ride-through-american-history/,"by Betsy McCaughey
W hen Free Soil settlers in Kansas were being bloodied by pro-slavery forces in the years before the American Civil War, abolitionist preacher Henry Ward Beecher decided enough was enough, endorsing the shipment of a thousand high-powered Sharps rifles to the settlers.
The guns’ new breech-loading mechanism dramatically increased their rate of fire over the era’s slow, awkward muzzle-loaders. In essence, this made them the assault rifles of their time. The Rev. Beecher (brother to Uncle Tom’s Cabin author Harriet Beecher Stowe) told a reporter that there was “more moral power in one of those instruments, so far as the slaveholders of Kansas were concerned, than in a hundred Bibles.”
Viewing guns as a positive good isn’t typical in this era of mass shootings, but a recent book suggests that for much of America’s history, that is exactly how they were regarded.
In First Freedom: A Ride Through America’s Enduring History with the Gun (Simon & Schuster, Oct. 2018), David Harsanyi argues that in America at least, guns were central to the national experience; without them we might still be squatting on the Atlantic seaboard subsisting on shellfish and charity from the nearby Wampanoag Indian tribes.
Harsanyi begins at the beginning, with man’s discovery that doing violence is safer at a distance. The use of “ranged weapons,” sticks and stones, for the most part, likely began in Africa some 71,000 years ago.
Working forward, he touches on the use of gunpowder weapons in China, where “alchemists searching for an elixir for immortality combined saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal and inadvertently stumbled upon a man-made recipe that would cause more premature death than any other mixture in history.”
The Chinese also demonstrated an entertaining creativity in the naming of their gunpowder devices: “Heaven-Shaking-Thunder-Crash Bomb,” “Match-for-Ten-Thousand-Enemies Bomb,” “Bandit-Burning Vision-Confusing Magic Fire-Ball.”
More prosaically, firearm development jumped to Europe, including the creation of “pot” mortars — basically shards and other shrapnel blasted from a large iron pot — and unwieldy “handgonnes… essentially miniature cannons designed to be held by hand or attached to a pole.”
But in keeping with the title, most of the book focuses on firearms in America, specifically their indispensable contribution to the creation of the country.
British arms-confiscation efforts served as a spark to Revolution, as with Major General Thomas Gage’s September 1774 effort to seize gunpowder from a colonial storehouse. The mission succeeded, but the incident, wrote Abigail Adams to her husband John, “has so enraged and exasperated the people that there is great apprehension of an immediate rupture.”
The urgent need to disarm the colonists came because as tension increased, British authorities realized that living on the very edge of civilization had created a populace willing and able to defend themselves.
“European powers were not used to being out-armed by their subjects,” Mr. Harsanyi writes. “… New England was teeming with weapons.” General Gage said he couldn’t pacify the colonies without another 20,000 troops (more than the entire peacetime army) because so many of the colonists were armed. He didn’t get them, and he turned out to be right.
Studies of estate lists from the colonial era confirms it. “[G]uns were owned by 50 to 73 percent (depending on the county) of male estates in North America,” the author notes, citing research by Northwestern University School of Law historians. They were more abundant than such ordinary household items as tables, hoes, axes, books, pictures and curtains, and “personal ornaments.”
The pattern extended into the frontier expansion period, where firearms were a crucial tool in settling the country.
As exploration continued, the nation’s inventors saw a need and filled it.
A key example was Sam Colt’s “Single Action Army — more famously known as the ‘Peacemaker.’”
Having traveled the frontier and seen how isolated and vulnerable pioneers were, and how slow to re-load their weapons were, Colt was convinced of the value of the personal firearm to Americans settling their vast new country. “Place a revolver in the hands of a dwarf… and he is equal to a giant,” he said. Or as Harsanyi puts it, “A Colt made one man six.”
And unlike in Europe, where dueling was limited to the upper classes, Americans of every social level were prone to settling differences with deadly force, especially out west, where access to reliable law enforcement was doubtful.
But for all that, there’s reason to believe that the popular vision of the lawless, violent West is overstated, possibly because the prevalence of weapons helped keep the peace.
The author cites research by historian Robert R. Dykstra indicating that even Dodge City recorded only 1.5 homicides a year in the decade of its chief prominence as a cattle shipping center. As regards the often misunderstood “no guns in Dodge City” dictum, Harsanyi points out we have no way of knowing how long or how stringently this was enforced.
And in any event, “Not in the wildest recesses of the westerner’s imagination would he think a person had to ask for permission — or get a license — from the government to own a firearm.”
Throughout the development of gun technology, the process was interestingly linked with the growth of American industry, as weapons here progressed from handmade, one-off muskets, flintlocks, and other basic rifles, to mass-produced guns created with interchangeable components, technology that would later drive mass production of early automobiles. The connection came full circle with Prohibition era felons taking to American roads with the Thompson submachine gun and shooting it out with woefully outgunned local police.
The story moves forward from there through 20th century efforts to control crimes committed with guns by focusing on the weapons, rather than the criminals, and traces the development of the National Rifle Association from an early shooting club to the aggressive pro-Second Amendment force that it is today.
Harsanyi pays attention to the re-definition of the Second Amendment as a group right supporting organized government efforts — militias — and then more recently back to an individual right, based on readings of contemporary sources.
“The notion of individual ownership of firearms was so unmistakable and so omnipresent in colonial days — and beyond — that Americans saw no more need to debate its existence than they did the right to drink water or breathe the air,” he writes. After the battles of Lexington and Concord, he writes, “Not a single Minuteman was asked to hand his musket over to the Continental Congress after chasing the British back to Boston.”"
Luck and Guts: The Heroes of Midway,spectator.org,Geoffrey Norman,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/luck-and-guts-the-heroes-of-midway/,"by Betsy McCaughey T he Battle of Midway began 77 years ago, today. This anniversary (if that, indeed, is the right word) will be noted but not so lavishly as the one in two days time, in remembrance of D-Day. These were both great and decisive American victories and should be remembered and honored as long as there is a United States of America. Not so much, however, because they saved the nation. The U.S. would almost certainly have survived defeat at Midway and a repulse in Normandy. The “what-if” scenarios around either case — or both, for that matter — make for interesting speculation. But while the world may have looked a lot different if the Japanese had won at Midway and the Germans had pushed Eisenhower’s troops back into the sea in France, there were still two broad oceans protecting the American homeland where the nation could employ its enormous industrial capacity to rearm and reorganize before getting back into the fight. And, then, there was the bomb. A repulse in France might have meant, more than anything else, that Berlin would have been the first city leveled by a nuclear device. Still, the victories at Midway and in Normandy were decisive and heroic. Also exceedingly “American” in character. It is impossible to read about them, these generations later, without recognizing that and feeling proud. If, that is, you are a patriot which, sadly, is not true of everyone living in the United States these days. Still … Consider Midway, first, and leave D-Day for later, by two days on the calendar: The U.S. Navy had apparently been decisively crushed by the Japanese surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. Almost every battleship in the fleet had been sunk or catastrophically damaged. But this defeat had also illuminated a truth and a path to victory. The U.S. battleships had been sunk by bombs and torpedoes dropped from airplanes flown off aircraft carriers. These were now the capital ships of navies. Battleships would, from now on, serve as escorts for the carriers. If at all. Six months after Pearl Harbor, the U.S. had only three carriers available to counter a Japanese attack on Midway. It might have been just two except for the American way with tools and capacity to improvise. The carrier Yorktown had been badly damaged in the battle of the Coral Sea and was expected to require several months in dry dock before it would be ready to conduct flight operations again. Admiral Chester Nimitz, who was in command of what was left of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, told the people in his repair yards, “I want that ship ready to go to sea in 48 hours.” American welders and machinists swarmed over the broken Yorktown , like a pit crew at Daytona. They worked around the clock, sometimes pulling so much electrical power that the lights in Honolulu flickered and went dim. And they got it done. The Yorktown left Pearl Harbor in time — just barely — to join the battle. Its last. The two other carriers — Hornet and Enterprise — were already on station, waiting to ambush four Japanese carriers. The Americans knew they were coming, having broken the Japanese codes enough that they could read some radio traffic. It was a distinct advantage but one that might not have been sufficient to overcome the Japanese superiority in numbers, experience, and, above all, equipment. Their planes were better than those flown by the U.S. Navy. The American torpedo planes were relics. They were slow, not especially maneuverable, and they could not take much punishment. Other than that … Still, they launched and they attacked. One squadron of fifteen planes from each of the carriers. Torpedo squadron eight, off the Hornet , found the Japanese fleet when the squadron commander, John Waldron, trusted his instincts over the information he’d been given in briefings on the location of the Japanese fleet. It was borderline insubordination — in a very American sort of way — and Waldron might have been court martialed for it. If he had survived. He received, instead, a posthumous Navy Cross for leading his squadron to the Japanese fleet and pressing the attack. The squadron scored no hits and all of its fifteen planes were shot down. One pilot survived. None of the gunners. Neither of the other torpedo squadrons scored a hit. Of the 45 of the torpedo planes launched from the three American carriers, four survived the battle. And yet … they had attacked from very low altitude in order to launch their torpedos. The covering Japanese Zeros — which might have been the finest fighter planes in the world at the time — had come down low to engage and slaughter the American torpedo planes. Leaving the upper sky unguarded and the Japanese carriers vulnerable to American dive bombers. But it was an opportunity that might have been lost. The dive bomber squadron from the Hornet never found the Japanese fleet. And the squadrons from the Enterprise might not have except for the initiative and decision making of another junior officer. Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky had been searching for the Japanese fleet in the area where, according to his briefing, it should have been. But when he looked down from some 20,000 feet, the only thing he saw was empty ocean. He conducted a search, according to doctrine, and succeed only in burning more fuel. To the point where it would soon be either a) head back to the Enterprise or b) ditch. Meanwhile, the Japanese could launch their own attack, against the three American carriers which might even have been recovering planes at the time and woefully vulnerable. The battle of Midway would, then, have been another Japanese victory. The U.S. would likely have been forced to abandon Hawaii. It would be months, even years, before it could be retaken. More months and years before the ring of islands defending Japan could be breached. Still more before Japan, itself, could be invaded and conquered. A lot depended on what one fairly junior naval aviator decided to do with the time and fuel he had left. Wade McClusky had to make a decision. What course would take him to the Japanese fleet? It was all on him. He made a call and you could say he played a hunch. An informed hunch but still, if it had come up wrong … He had seen a spotted a single Japanese ship on the wide surface of the Pacific. It was a destroyer and judging by the distinct white wake, it was making speed. To where and for what? McCluskey thought. To wherever the Japanese fleet was, in order to rejoin it, he reasoned. Using the V of the ship’s wake as though it were the point of a compass needle, McCluskey changed course. A few minutes later he and the dive bombers he led were in the wide, unguarded skies over the Japanese fleet. The dive bomber squadron from the Yorktown arrived at almost exactly this time. The Americans attacked and the Japanese lost three fleet carriers and the initiative in the Pacific in a span of five minutes. There is nothing else like it in the history of warfare. In the next hours of the battle, the remaining Japanese carrier was sunk as was the Yorktown . Admiral Raymond Spruance handled his fleet both boldly and steadily. He was aggressive when he needed to be and prudent when he had to be. The workers in the yard who had made it possible for the Yorktown to take part in the fight played a big role in the victory. As, certainly, did the code breakers. And then, there were those bold decisions, made in the moment, by Waldron and McClusky, recalling the way that Chamberlain saved the situation at Little Round Top. America seems to find people like them when they are most desperately needed. And, one thinks, it isn’t by accident."
Nurse AOC Gets to Pick Democrats’ Presidential Winners and Losers,spectator.org,Hunt Lawrence and Daniel J. Flynn,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/nurse-aoc-gets-to-pick-democrats-presidential-winners-and-losers/,"Nurse AOC Gets to Pick Democrats’ Presidential Winners and Losers Healthcare remains the number one issue and again Republicans aren’t in the game. by Betsy McCaughey
“M edicare for All may sound good,” John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman running for president, told the California Democratic Convention, “but it’s actually not good policy, nor is it good politics.”
The crowd booed, lengthily and lustily, as they had booed former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper for informing them that “socialism is not the answer.”
The enfant terrible of the Democratic Party quickly responded through the medium preferred by enfants terrible .
“Since there’s so many people running for President (& not enough for Senate), instead of obsessing over who’s a ‘frontrunner,’ maybe we can start w some general eliminations,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “This awful, untrue line got boo’ed for a full minute. John Delaney, thank you but please sashay away.”
The exchange exhibits the best and worst about the Democratic presidential race.
On the one hand, Democrats, buoyed by their success on the issue in 2016, discuss health care — a lot. And why not? Healthcare costs approach $11,000 per person in the United States annually, or more than $3.5 trillion collectively. No nation comes close to spending anything close to that, and all but three other countries spend less than that in their entire economies.
On the other hand, Democrats air heretical thoughts at great risk. Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most listened to voices in the party, essentially instructed Delaney to drop out of the race because he disagrees with her on healthcare. Is there a party line on healthcare for Democrats?
Aside from the inherent dangers of nearly doubling the budget by assuming costs for nearly all healthcare spending in the United States, Medicare for All, in the form endorsed by Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and several other of Delaney’s presidential rivals, forces most Americans to switch from their current healthcare plans to ones administered by the government.
Sanders’s bill makes it “unlawful” for “a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act” and for “an employer to provide benefits for an employee, former employee, or the dependents of an employee or former employee that duplicate the benefits provided under this Act.”
In other words, it outlaws the insurance currently used by most Americans. If you like your healthcare plan, you can’t keep your healthcare plan.
For these reasons — disrupting the lives of more than a hundred million Americans and forcing a government $21 trillion in the red deeper into debt — Delaney finds Medicare for All neither “good policy” nor “good politics.” One imagines on this latter point he speaks of the general election and not the Democratic primaries, in which announcing pie-in-the-sky schemes provides effective applause lines.
Despite Ocasio-Cortez’s best efforts, a debate exists within the Democratic Party on how to alleviate the healthcare problem. By viewing it as a coverage problem instead of an affordability problem, the Democrats get it wrong. But at least a discussion occurs.
After failing to repeal Obamacare with majorities in both houses in 2017, Republicans remain largely mum on healthcare. This comes at a great a political price. In 2018, voters named healthcare as the number issue facing the nation. Forty-one percent of voters selected healthcare in exit polls as the top issue versus 24 percent who named immigration and 21 percent who chose the economy. Democrats won the majority by flipping over 40 seats in the House of Representatives. They added seven gubernatorial offices previously held by Republicans. Aside from running against Donald Trump, they ran on healthcare. This worked because healthcare does not work for Americans.
Seventeen months before the 2020 elections, Republicans do not address the number-one concern of voters. Democrats may address it from the wrong angle. But something, even the wrong thing, usually beats nothing. And with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating healthcare to cost Americans $5.7 trillion by 2026, good politics serves good policy here."
Tariffs: A Threat to America’s GDP,spectator.org,Bob Luddy,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/tariffs-a-threat-to-americas-gdp/,"by Betsy McCaughey
T ariffs are a popular remedy to maintain a favorable balance of trade and create domestic jobs. Some believe tariffs will foster a renaissance of American manufacturing, but let’s consider the facts.
America has six million unfilled jobs, with almost every industry desperately trying to hire qualified personnel. Our trade surplus is widening as these trade wars progress, and international relations are very stressed.
Free trade allows buyers and sellers to be winners and facilitates comparative advantage and the division of labor. For example, iPhones are designed and engineered in the United States, manufactured in China, and sold worldwide. China assembles the iPhone, but many countries provide the components, software, and technologies for this amazing computer.
Apple is now enduring tariffs imposed on China and restrictions on the sale of technologies to Chinese companies such as Huawei. Chinese buyers have reduced their purchases of iPhones because of American tariffs. If the U.S. imposes tariffs on the importing of iPhones, it will have a very adverse impact on Apple and its suppliers. More importantly, Americans rely on iPhone technology in every industry to operate their businesses; for example, chefs store their recipes, contact their users, and order food from this small device.
Tariffs are the favorite ploy of the Mercantilist; however, the unintended consequences of tariffs abound, causing pain for many industries, including agriculture, energy, steel, automotive, retail and, now, information technology. Most all U.S. industries are losing sales momentum because of tariffs or concerns about tariff policy. This means GDP might quickly revert from a robust 3 plus percent to under 2 percent.
The steel industry, protected by 25 percent tariffs since Q-1 of 2018, is doing poorly since the imposition of these tariffs. In January 2018, U.S. Steel stock traded at $44 a share; now after 15 months of tariffs, the stock has declined to $11, and many analyses have “Sell” ratings on the stock. Investors who purchased the stock at $44 believing that tariffs would yield large profits have lost 75 percent of their investment.
U.S. industries using steel lost 200,000 jobs during the Bush steel tariffs earlier in this century. Many small companies permanently shut down and, in many cases, buyers purchased finished products on the international market, which were not subject to tariffs.
The U.S. automobile industry is suffering a similar decline due to excessive regulation, high labor costs, and, now, onerous tariffs. General Motors stock trading at $33 has declined from $44 in the last 17 months. If tariffs are imposed against all Mexican imports, GM will continue to lose sales and jobs.
Retail sales have been decimated by competition and obsolete business models, which has resulted in the closure of thousands of retail stores. If additional tariffs are imposed on retail goods, it will be catastrophic for this industry. New tariffs will also force consumers to buy higher-priced goods and effectively lower their standard of living.
Tariffs undermine supply chains, which take many years to develop and are not easily transferred to new locations. Disruptions in supply chains make our economy less efficient and less reliable. Quality is also undermined, as manufacturers seek ways to save money or substitute components. Moving a plant from China to another country will not change our balance of payments, but will increase costs and create supply disruptions.
Lastly and most importantly, tariffs undermine trading and international relations. It takes years to develop strong relationships, which tariffs undermine when implemented. T.J. Watson, Chairman of IBM, often stated, “World peace through world trade.”
Thanks to our founders, America’s 50 states provide the best unilateral free trade zone in history. Every American benefits from this system, which allows us to produce 24 percent of the world’s GDP.
Free trade facilitates goodwill among nations and allows all nations to prosper. Modern international trade is making almost every person in the world better off economically.
There are no long-term winners in trade wars. Investment in the United States is declining because trade instability creates uncertainty, which impedes long-term investment. It’s imperative that we end the trade wars and return to free markets and certainty.
Small countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore have proven, definitively, that the principles of free trade, low taxes, and moderate regulations create permanent prosperity.
It is time for America to reject tariffs and to enjoy the many benefits of free trade, which have helped to make America the richest country in the world."
"‘The Longest Day,’ Revisited",spectator.org,William Murchison,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-longest-day-revisited/,"by Bob Luddy
I n my capacity as a certified, government-inspected old coot, I have taken particular interest in the bubbling excitement over the 75th anniversary of D-Day. It takes me back — not to D-Day itself, when I was in knee pants, but to the 18th anniversary thereof in 1962. Darryl Zanuck’s The Longest Day brought to stirring cinematic life on that occasion Cornelius Ryan’s D-Day book of the same title.
I still find great satisfaction in Zanuck’s film, but here’s what I remember about 1962. We — well, a lot of us — who went to see it wore coat and tie or heels. It seemed the thing to do. As the house lights went down, the sound system roused us with “The Star-Spangled Banner” — the real one, with trumpets and drums and no swaying hyper-inflected nightclub singers. We in the house rose as one, with hands over hearts. Many sang. It was a big deal, in keeping with the occasion celebrated and the sacrifice required to liberate Europe from evil.
By coincidence, the other day, I learned from the New York Times the present locus of evil in the world. Times columnist Maureen Dowd identified the attorney general of the United States, William Barr, as the “perfect villain” of the Mueller report saga. More than a mere villain, it seems: “devious-devising,” “crooked-counseling” and, at the end of the day, “diabolical.”
I stared at that last one. I continue to stare. Barr, by Dowd’s account, is diabolical, as if glowering before a Salem tribunal. He revealed his horns, it appears, in his hourlong CBS interview with Jan Crawford last week. We were hungering — weren’t we? — for an account of Donald Trump’s knavery. What did we get? Barr’s insistence that evidence didn’t support unconstitutional behavior on the president’s point. G . Snarl.
To this we have come in our national life since 1962. Honest differences of viewpoint are inherently dis honest: as viewed from at least one side. The rope — get the rope! As Barr commented to Crawford: “We live in a hyper-partisan age, where people no longer really pay attention to the substance of what’s said but as to who says it and what side they’re on and what its political ramifications are.” “The Star-Spangled Banner” — who’d leap to his feet for it now?
Possibly more Americans than we would suppose. What I am inclined to call D-Day nostalgia has its heartening side. And why not? There was no fun in Operation Overlord. You were likely to get your head blown off. Many did. But many more kept coming and fighting in the face of it all. And they won! They won! Stephen Ambrose, in his own D-Day book, quotes Sgt. John Ellery of the 16th Regiment, 1st Division, after Omaha Beach: “The first night in France I spent in a ditch beside a hedgerow.… But I felt elated.… I was ten feet tall.… I had made it off the beach and reached the high ground.… I had walked in the company of very brave men.”
It was once upon a time more natural — say, in 1962 — to applaud courage and sacrifice than, culturally speaking, it soon became. Many of us certified old coots are glad we were around then. We jumped to our feet for “The Star-Spangled Banner.” America was beautiful. Ditto, freedom. Ditto, the idea of surrendering human existence for the well-being of others. The beauty was paradoxical: Death turned into life, suffering into fulfillment, battlefield noise into the quiet of peace. Something holy was in it — something the very reverse of satanic.
Which is perhaps why D-Day nostalgia — evidenced by all the excitement of the last reunion of the survivors — finds, it would seem, a secure place among the victims of the fear and explosive emotions of the past half-century when it became necessary, seemingly, to hate and despise fellow Americans, to detect on their garments the fumes of sulfur.
Here’s to the boys of Pointe du Hoc and Omaha Beach and the whole panoply of destruction that lives in an admiration that gives hope of eventual recovery from the wasting disease of hatred.
Oh, say, we can see — never mind the barriers so many work to place in our sightlines.

Thirty Years After Tiananmen Square,spectator.org,John Jiang,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/thirty-years-after-tiananmen-square/,"Thirty Years After Tiananmen Square At the anniversary of the massacre, Trump confronts China. by Bob Luddy
O n this day in 1989, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army opened fire on civilians throughout the Chinese capital of Beijing, killing hundreds of students and activists who had assembled to protest for democracy and reforms of China’s authoritarian government and political system. The incident, now known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, shocked observers worldwide, resulting in international condemnation and sanctions.
Three decades later, democracy has not come to China. Indeed, the personalized politics of the Mao era has returned with Xi Jinping, who has overseen the introduction of “Xi Jinping Thought” into the Chinese constitution and the removal of term limits. To the east of the country, it is working at a breakneck pace to seize ocean territories in defiance of international opinion; in the west, it has interned millions of Uyghurs in “re-education camps” without trial. The Communist Party has been blunt in its efforts to undermine and dismantle the political autonomy of Hong Kong, China’s last remaining bastion of democracy. The government is notoriously unfair in its conduct of trade: companies hoping to do business in China are pressured to hand over technology , and where such pressure is infeasible, state spies have few qualms about theft .
The response from the West has been muted. Gone are the days of the Cold War, when Europe and America united to confront communism. This is partially a result of China’s enormous economy and willingness to use it as leverage, a tool that the Soviet Union never had. In the 1980s, the value of U.S. trade with the USSR averaged around $3 billion per year; in 2019, U.S. trade with China exceeds that value every two days.
In many respects, engagement with China is a great positive. Its breathtaking economic boom has elevated nearly a billion people out of poverty in the span of a few decades. Trade with China, though hotly debated, has raised effective purchasing power for millions of Americans and accelerated the U.S.’s transformation into a high-tech service economy. Even discounting such advantages, it is certainly in the interest of global peace that a rising superpower should have a significant stake in the wellbeing of its potential rivals and vice versa.
On the political front, however, China’s embrace of free trade has failed to deliver. Thinkers as excellent as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek strongly argued for the idea that economic freedom and political freedom are indubitably interlinked, though it has long been a matter of debate whether the former would be sufficient, on its own, to generate the latter. China’s recent lurch toward greater authoritarianism, a sharp reversal from its seeming liberalization under Xi’s predecessors, has effectively answered this question to the negative. Rather than breed political freedom, the country’s economic might has turbocharged its illiberal government. The Party has worked to sow discord in Europe , force foreign companies to engage in censorship , and quash academic freedom in the United States and elsewhere.
Generations of Western governments have believed in having their cake and eating it too: that permanent economic partnership with China will reap economic benefits in the short term and, in the long term, transform China into a polyarchy. What has happened instead is that China has risen as an opposing ideological force to the United States, pouring billions of dollars into countries with autocratic governments and human rights abuses that Western investors would be loath to go near. It has, in short, helped to bankroll the global retreat of secular democracy.
What can be done to prevent this new world order from taking final shape? As unwilling as the establishment is to admit it, perhaps a reversal of policy is in order. Against the fancies of various mega-corporations, European leaders, and Washington swamp creatures, President Trump has taken up the banner of economic war and confronted China.
It is an ungraceful but necessary and timely solution. Trump’s continued escalation of tariffs on Chinese imports represents the first meaningful break in U.S. policy toward its biggest trade partner since the turn of the millennium. It is the first time in living memory that the United States has tried to inflict large scale economic pain on the Chinese. After decades of assisting the growth of its political and ideological rival, America’s tone is changing.
Trump is not a perfect standard-bearer. His desire to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. is unlikely to be achieved with tariffs, and any jobs leaving China are likely to go to its neighbors in South or Southeast Asia instead. But his instincts are correct, and he is right to believe that China does not play fair and must be confronted before it is too late.
Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, in various writings and appearances in the media, has articulated the goals that the Trump Administration must aim for in its trade war. The President must insist that China demonstrably ceases its manipulative production and trade practices, ceases pushing smaller countries into unsustainable loans, and ceases stealing and strong-arming its way to acquiring technology. These are not simple goals. Achieving them would mean the decline or even death of the Communist Party, and China knows this. But the United States must persist, for the alternative is authoritarian Chinese hegemony. Reckoning for Tiananmen Square has been a long time coming."

I t is The Season of Grading. Twice annually, I am obliged lovingly to hunker down and grade some hundred or so law school final exams. My students consistently prove to be deeply serious-minded and know the expectations, so they produce solidly crafted 15-page narratives analyzing a complex fact pattern. Then they are free to frolic, while I hunker down to grade them. Each exam can run me 30-45 minutes, as I read, compare, and try my best to assign the right grade. Such exams properly are submitted with anonymous student identification numbers to assure the purest possible fairness in grading. Would that all testing — and grading — were done that way!
After grading every few exams, I take a break. I am quite strict about not allowing myself to get into a rut. I want to approach evaluating each exam as a fresh experience, even as all the students are analyzing the same “parade of horribles” fact pattern. To relax my mind, I grab a bite, turn on the TV but try to stay away from the news or from the New York Mets. The Mets aggravate me. The news aggravates me. I cannot watch CNN or MSNBC. CBS. NBC. ABC. PBS. It’s all the same, and it’s all brazenly dishonest. There is Fox News, during the hour when Shepard Smith is not on, but the aggravation lurks there, too:
Illegals streaming across the border with no resolution in sight, more than two years into the Trump Presidency, first subverted by the Paul Ryan Congress, now by the Congress of Knaves. Subpoenas to get Trump’s taxes. Subpoenas to divert America’s highest officers in the executive branch from doing their jobs. Demands that the Attorney General brazenly defy federal law — just like the last two Attorneys General, Obama’s Twiddle-Dum and Twiddle-Dummer — and, in this case, disclose secret Grand Jury testimony. Star Chamber proceedings, now aimed at branding life-long law-abiding stalwarts in “contempt of Congress,” even as the same Congress of Knaves celebrated when liars from Lois Lerner to Hillary slithered from prosecution and incarceration.
Too aggravating to watch.
Even my Fox favorite — Laura Ingraham — is no safe harbor. Just when I am hunkering in for “The Angle,” I know the foreboding feeling that soon her opening monologue will end when she says “And that’s the angle,” and then a Public Nuisance will invade my home: the two-faced Chris Hahn, the auditory shriek of Jessica Tarlov. Some people have “trigger finger.” I have developed a condition called “Fox News Remote Finger.” I see Chris Hahn’s mouth start moving, and my thumb presses “Mute” without my even thinking to do so. It now is conditioned. His lips stop, and my thumb presses again to hear Dan Bongino. (Love that guy — except when he says, “Look, Chris, I like you. You are my good friend.” Gimme a break.) Then the camera shifts back to Hahn; my thumb snaps “mute.” Back to Bongino; thumb smack back on. But now Hahn cuts in, and they both are talking at the same time — and my thumb starts gyrating uncontrollably, seeking guidance.
I used to listen to “The Judge” — Andrew Napolitano. I always kind-of felt, “Y’know, nothing personal, but this guy is not exactly on the U.S. Supreme Court, but he’s OK.” He was a New Jersey state trial judge for eight years or so. He has begun aggravating me. Thumb. Then I see Brit Hume. Always liked Brit Hume, even a million years ago when he was at ABC and contributed, yes, to The American Spectator . Thumb: back on. But then Geraldo. Thumb: mute. Sara Carter — thumb: on. Leslie Marshall / Juan Williams — thumb: off. Melissa Francis / The Great One / Greg Gutfeld / Huckabee — thumb: on.
Might it cause Fox News Arthritis someday?
I needed to take a break from grading for a while, and I had to protect my grading thumb. I need it to hold my pen. So I thought of going to that History Channel instead, but I already have seen all their stuff — eight things about Hitler and the Nazis, and eight episodes about Mafia guys getting whacked, all of which they just keep rerunning on a theory that World War II lasted for five years, and “Godfather (1972)” kept running in sequels for eighteen years with Godfather III in 1990, so why can’t those reruns?
So I just turned on C-SPAN to watch whatever they got for fifteen minutes.
Of all the things on the planet, it just so happened that they were re-running at that minute their film of President Donald J. Trump earlier in the day in Buckingham Palace, then at Westminster Abbey, looking and acting extremely Presidential . Next thing I knew, he was at a State Dinner, walking up the aisle very elegantly and Presidentially alongside the Queen of England. For some reason, the orchestra was playing “My Country ’Tis of Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty, of Thee I Sing.” (Yes, I know. . . . Don’t correct me.) Anyway, Our Guy was amazingly Presidential .
They get to the dais. There’s Melania, our First Lady. There’s one of Diana’s kids. There’s Charles, the Man Who Would Not Be King. Everyone is seated. Some Beefeater type is standing behind the Queen and President. Queen Elizabeth rises and makes a lovely speech, about America, about Trump. She then raises a glass and toasts Trump and America. They start playing the United States National Anthem. As is my wont, I stand up from my couch, hand over heart. As the music stops, I return to my couch, they to their seats. Then Trump delivers an absolutely eloquent, beautiful speech about England, the United Kingdom, our two-century alliance (no tweets about the War of 1812, no quips about Cornwallis at Yorktown), and poignantly notes the shared sacrifices at Normandy. An absolutely gorgeous short speech, perfect for the moment. Completely Presidential . He raises a glass and toasts the Queen and the people of the United Kingdom. For some reason, they start playing “My Country ’Tis of Thee” again. ( Yes, I know!)
And I start thinking: All those Left-Dems and Left-Media defamers, how are they going to characterize the President who they say does not act “Presidential”? Because, honestly, no human alive could have projected a more elegant Presidential persona at that moment. And, indeed, I even started thinking back to when The Great Pretender was in the White House during the Wasted Obama Decade. Remember Obama at the State Dinner with the Queen — continuing to ramble on while the whole room was shocked, drop-jawed stunned, that he did not notice that everyone in the hall but he was standing at silent respectful attention while the music was playing and yet he continued jabbering ?
Remember? Compare this and this .
Our Guy is really Presidential when he needs to be. That is why we regard him as the Real Thing. We do not care that the Left Pundits and Left Dems say otherwise during their daily slanders that reverberate throughout their echo… echo… chambers. We know the difference.
Such a wonderful, proud moment. And through it all — no Tarlov, no Hahn, no Juan. My thumb and mind refreshed, I returned to grading in peace."
Who You Callin’ Fascist?,spectator.org,"R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/who-you-callin-fascist/,"by Veronique de Rugy
W ashington
For over two years now a peculiar combination of the media and the Democrats have been goading Donald Trump, always to painful effect — painful for both sides in this vituperative battle; but particularly painful to the media and the Democrats. Not much good has come of it.
The media and the Democrats vilify Trump as a Hitler, a fascist, a racist, also a misogynist, a homophobe, and so forth. What is more, they do not approve of his hair. Interestingly, they do not disparage him as a Stalin, a Castro, or a communist. Why do they not dip into their arsenal of dread phraseology to call him a Stalinist, a Castro, or a communist? Is it because they still see these comrades as the good guys? Do they perceive communists as liberals without the red tape? What Henry Wallace once called liberals in a hurry.
Do the media and the Democrats harbor some lingering respect for these historic friends of the working class? Are they somewhat smitten by the bilge of the left. Do they even understand the term fascist? What would Senator Chuck Schumer or Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi describe as Donald’s fascist traits? His songs? His martial music? What is his daily uniform? All I see is Donald’s sober business suit, always worn with a tie, a white shirt, and wingtip shoes. How does this uniform differ from that of Schumer?
What is all this talk of fascism? Fascism generally features politicians who favor one-party dictatorship above democracy. Fascism favors a glorified sense of nationalism and often of race over the individual. In governance it favors centralized government and is heavily militaristic. Actually, when you compare fascism with communism it is pretty much the same thing, though the German and Italian fascists always were smarter dressers, and their guns usually worked better. The communists even caught up eventually with German racism. Both the Germans and the Russians were anti-Semites.
What is more, now that the latest edition of Democrat is coming out as a socialist I guess they have all the more reason to stay clear of calling Donald a communist or Stalin or Castro. These Democrats are at least Stalinists in the economic sense, and they can always adopt the one-party ism and militarism later.
Yet to return to my original point about the effect these coarse terms are having on the public discourse, particularly for the media and the Democrats. All the media and the Democrats achieve it seems to me is that they enrage Donald, who resorts to his Twitter account and fires off a volley that leaves the media and the Democrats the worse for wear. The fact is that Donald is better at it than they are and he usually amuses. The media and the Democrats never do. Hitler was not funny. Nor was communism. Donald’s “Fake News” has caught on, and everyone knows who authored the term along with “Crooked Hillary” and “Pocahontas” and “Crazy Bernie” and all the rest.
When the race really gets under way, what will Donald make of poor old Joe Biden, the gaffable one (I shall take credit for that one). Joe was caught red handed, as they say, filching from a speech by Neil Kinnock of Britain’s Labour Party. Neil is not even an American. Already Donald has dispatched Beto O’Rourke with his notice of the former congressman’s “hand movements…. is he crazy?” Donald had only a few hours to come up with that one. Well done, Donald! Beto has yet to recover. There will be two dozen more Democratic candidates who bite the dust before Donald finishes off the final Democratic candidate. Will the candidate be the one from South Bend, or is there another would-be John F. Kennedy out there? It is going to be vastly amusing.
As I say, it is destructive language from both sides, but from one side it is at least amusing. I noticed this when I first met Donald in 2013. He is very entertaining. I can well imagine long after Donald is out of office relaxing with friends and watching old tapes of Donald up against the Republican gang in 2016 and then Donald against Hillary, agelastic Hillary. She thought she could beat him, and after she lost she plotted with her friends in the intelligence community to run him out of office. She, a life-long liberal, threw in with certain chieftains of the FBI and the CIA (and presumably others) to turn these institutions against the American people in an election. They were the kind of liberals who were always haranguing us against the police power of the state. But they were the first in American history to turn the intelligence community against us. Hillary has been a malign force in American politics from her early days. I am glad she turned her back on Goldwaterism.
These next months will be interesting."
Dems Revise History Regarding the 19th Amendment,spectator.org,David Catron,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/dems-revise-history-regarding-the-19th-amendment/,"Dems Revise History Regarding the 19th Amendment It was introduced by the GOP in 1878 and the Dems fought it for 40 years. by Betsy McCaughey
I f you know the history of the 19 th Amendment, you will notice a peculiar omission from the statements issued by various Democrats celebrating the 100 th anniversary of its passage by Congress. Elizabeth Warren, for example, tweeted : “People always say that big change is impossible. That’s what they told the suffragettes — but they got organized, persisted, & 100 years ago today, the Senate passed the 19th Amendment to give women the right to vote.” What Warren conveniently forgets is that the people who said it was “impossible” were Democrats. Her party blocked passage of the amendment from 1878, when it was introduced by the Republicans, until the latter won such huge majorities in the 1918 midterms that the Democrats were no longer able to deny women justice.
Warren and the rest of today’s Democrats, knowing that our government education system has long since given up teaching history have little fear that the public will realize that the GOP’s support of women’s suffrage goes back to its founding in 1854. Nor are they worried that the “news” media or the various organizations purporting to support women’s rights will let the cat out of the bag. Indeed, much of the media has tried to reframe the fight for women’s suffrage in terms of racism. The Washington Post , for example, ran an article titled : “How racism almost killed women’s right to vote.” The piece all too predictably attempts to blame Democratic resistance on the southern members of their party.
The reality is that most Democrats were against the 19 th Amendment, including President Woodrow Wilson — who was so reviled by the suffragists that they routinely referred to him as “Kaiser Wilson.” What really delayed Congress from passing the amendment was a forty-year legislative war in which the Democrats did their level best to keep women out of the voting booth. That war began in 1878, when a California Republican named A.A. Sargent introduced the 19 th Amendment only to see it voted down by a Democrat-controlled Congress. It finally ended four decades later, when the GOP won landslide victories in the House and the Senate, giving them what we now call a “super-majority.”
One of the weirdest events in the long congressional war over women’s suffrage involved Utah. In 1870, 50 years before the 19 th Amendment was ratified, Utah passed a suffrage bill recognizing a woman’s right to vote. This was celebrated by congressional opponents of polygamy, which was practiced by some wealthy Mormons. The assumption was that Utah’s women would deploy their votes to end “the abomination of bigamy.” Ironically, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of polygamy. Congress then passed the Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1882, which disfranchised Utah’s women while also violating the First Amendment by outlawing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Meanwhile, the Republicans continued to introduce the 19 th Amendment in Congress every year, but the Democrats were able to keep it bottled up in various committees for another decade before allowing either chamber to vote on it. In 1887 it finally reached the floor of the Senate. Once again, however, it was defeated by the Democratic majority. After this setback, advocates of women’s suffrage opted to put pressure on Congress by convincing various state legislatures to pass bills giving women the vote. This met with some success. By the turn of the century a variety of Republican-controlled states, including Wyoming, Colorado, and Idaho, had granted women suffrage. During the first 10 years of the new century, several other states gave women the vote, including Washington and California.
Congress, however, didn’t deign to vote on the issue again until 1914, when it was once again defeated by Senate Democrats. It was subsequently brought up for a vote in January of 1915 in the House, where it also went down. Nonetheless, the Republicans continued to push. The big break for 19 th Amendment came when President Wilson, being a typical Democrat, violated his most solemn campaign promise. Having fervently pledged to keep the United States out of the European conflict that had been raging since 1914, he nonetheless decided to enter the war. This set the stage for the 1918 midterm elections in which voter outrage swept the Republicans into power. This finally placed the GOP in a position to pass the 19 th Amendment without the votes of the still intransigent Democratic opposition.
In May of 1919, Republican James R. Mann reintroduced the 19 th Amendment in the House and it finally passed. The Republicans voted in favor of the amendment 200-14. These 200 GOP votes constituted a majority, so some Democrats reluctantly faced reality. Nonetheless, 40 percent of the much-diminished Democratic caucus still voted, “Nay.” Shortly thereafter a now Republican-controlled Senate also passed it , clearing the way for ratification by the states. But the Democratic resistance was by no means dead. They did their level best to prevent the amendment from being ratified but failed : “When the Amendment was submitted to the states, 26 of the 36 states that ratified it had Republican legislatures. Of the nine states that voted against ratification, eight were Democratic.”
By this point, President Wilson had finally faced the reality that women would inevitably get the vote and reversed his opposition. Indeed, he staged a signing ceremony despite the inconvenient fact that the amendment required no presidential signature. Obviously, today’s Democrats desperately hope that most women voters don’t know this story, and are counting on the media and our government education system to prevent it from being told. They know that, if the truth about the roles each party truly played in the women’s suffrage movement, they will be deprived of yet another phony talking point. If that happens, the Dems may have to face the prospect of discussing their pathetic record. Meanwhile, anyone inclined to support the party that passed the 19 th Amendment should vote Republican. "
A Cancer Stigma Killing Thousands,spectator.org,Betsy McCaughey,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/a-cancer-stigma-killing-thousands/,"A Cancer Stigma Killing Thousands Why does lung cancer lack the stature of other cancers? by Veronique de Rugy
T he nation’s biggest meeting of cancer specialists unveiled several breakthroughs on Saturday. The horrible news is what’s not improving. Only a minuscule 4% of men and women at high risk of getting lung cancer from smoking go for a CT scan to detect it while it’s curable. That 4% figure has barely budged in a decade . Lung cancer detected before there’s coughing or other symptoms is at least 80% to 90% curable . People who wait until they feel sick have as little as a 10% chance of surviving .
Cost isn’t the problem. Insurance pays for CT (short for computer tomography) scans. But the public is clueless they’re necessary. There’s no public campaign because lung cancer is a politically incorrect disease, tainted by its link to tobacco. Most politicians, charities, and corporate underwriters haven’t wanted to touch it.
Unlike breast cancer. Everyone wants to join the war against that. An endless array or products from M&Ms to lipstick display the pink breast cancer ribbon . In 2016, all the presidential candidates were asked where they stood on breast cancer, as if anyone could be for it. A Maine newspaper announced that Sen. Susan Collins is “ working to end breast cancer by 2020 .” Here in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo bragged about a 2016 state law barring copays for breast cancer screening. Never mind that federal law already accomplished that. Politicians hustle to bask in the glow of a pink campaign about a blameless disease.
All that publicity and political mojo is working. An amazing 68% of women get regular mammograms at age 55 and over . “Women don’t even ask their doctors if they should get a mammogram. They just do it,” explains Dr. Daniel Libby, Clinical Professor of Pulmonology at Weill Cornell Medical College. “But they’re not hearing a message that if they have a history of smoking, they also need a CT lung scan.”
Lung cancer advocates need to take a page from the pink ribbon campaign. Nearly twice as many women die from lung cancer as from breast cancer . Women smokers are 1.5 to 2 times as susceptible to lung cancer as men who smoked the same amount, warns David Yankelevitz, Professor of Radiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
Fear of false positives is preventing some people from getting scanned. With a false positive , the scan shows a spot on the lung, and the patient undergoes a biopsy or waits months in anguish for another scan, then finds out it isn’t cancer.
New research published in Nature Medicine shows that artificial intelligence — computers making decisions based on algorithms — may soon eliminate most false positives . Until then, they’re no joke, says Libby, but hardly as awful as discovering you’ve got a later stage cancer that’s not curable.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends CT lung scans for people between 55 and 80 who smoked a pack-a-day for 30 years, or 2 packs-a-day for 15 years and who quit less W 15 years ago. Mark Pasmantier, Clinical Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell and a leading researcher on cancer detection, recommends even broader use. He says people who smoked a pack a day for ten years should get scanned, no matter how long ago they quit.
What about nonsmokers? Lung cancer is on the rise, and women nonsmokers are twice as affected as men. New data in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine show lung cancer deaths among nonsmokers outnumbering ovarian cancer deaths and cervical cancer deaths in the UK. It’s happening in the U.S. too.
Now that nonsmokers are affected, the stigma around lung cancer is fading. Senators Dianne Feinstein, Marco Rubio, Joe Manchin, and Shelley Moore Capito are sponsoring a bipartisan bill to promote lung cancer research and detection, particularly for women. “In 2019, an estimated 66,000 women will lose their lives to this terrible disease,” says Feinstein . Not to mention the death toll for men. Now that politicians are grabbing the issue, the next step is choosing a ribbon color."
Sadiq Khan: Britain’s Old Order Swamp Creature,spectator.org,Jeffrey Lord,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/sadiq-khan-britains-old-order-swamp-creature/,"by Veronique de Rugy
T he mayor of London was not happy.
So with the president of the United States soon to arrive in the town over which Mayor Sadiq Khan presides, what better for Khan to do than take to the pages of the Observer , owned by the left-wing Old Order’s the Guardian , and attack Britain’s staunchest ally?
The headline:
It’s un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump.
Among other things, London’s mayor said things like this as the president was still winging his way across the Atlantic, as yet to touch down on British soil:
Praising the “very fine people on both sides” when torch-wielding white supremacists and antisemites marched through the streets clashing with anti-racist campaigners. Threatening to veto a ban on the use of rape as a weapon of war. Setting an immigration policy that forcefully separates young children from their parents at the border. The deliberate use of xenophobia, racism and “otherness” as an electoral tactic. Introducing a travel ban to a number of predominately Muslim countries. Lying deliberately and repeatedly to the public.
No, these are not the actions of European dictators of the 1930s and 40s. Nor the military juntas of the 1970s and 80s. I’m not talking about Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un. These are the actions of the leader of our closest ally, the president of the United States of America.…
Donald Trump is just one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat. The far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms and the values that have defined our liberal, democratic societies for more than seventy years. Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Matteo Salvini in Italy, Marine Le Pen in France and Nigel Farage here in the UK are using the same divisive tropes of the fascists of the 20th century to garner support, but are using new sinister methods to deliver their message. And they are gaining ground and winning power and influence in places that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.
In other words? The mayor of London took to print to tell one deliberate lie after another about the president of the United States — while spectacularly failing to conceal his own Old Order colors as someone who believes to his core that he is, along with his global Old Order elitist buddies, the intellectual and moral superior of, in this case, his fellow Brits. Not to mention the president and Trump-supporting Americans.
The projection of Mr. Khan staggers. The Old Order as it appears both in America and Britain is nothing if not authoritarian — make that totalitarian — in nature. The mayor, described in the UK’s Sun as an “avowed remainer” — which is to say a staunch opponent of Brexit — was furious that the British people, by popular vote, had decided Britain should leave the European Union and reclaim its own identity, out from under the control of un-elected bureaucrats in Brussels. So angry was he that the peasants were in open political revolt against his fellow elites that last September he called for another Brexit vote because, you know, the peasants got it horribly wrong and they must be forced to do as Old Order elites insist. The Old Order just knows better, you know?
To give Americans a flavor of just how Sadiq Khan rolls, there was this article on the pre-mayoral Mr. Khan in the Daily Mail of 2016. The British government can ban the entry of foreigners it deems unsuitable, and a while back they applied this policy by banning an American — an American named Minister Louis Farrakhan. Sadiq Khan took up Farrakhan’s cause and, as reported here in the UK’s Daily Mail , insisted:
“Mr Farrakhan is not anti-Semitic and does not preach a message of racial hatred and antagonism.”
Got that? Louis Farrakhan, as the Daily Mail also noted, quite accurately, is infamous for saying things like the following:
“Farrakhan is a hugely controversial figure who has denounced white people as ‘devils’ described Jews as ‘bloodsuckers’ and called Hitler a ‘very great man’.…
In 1990 Farrakhan sparked outrage after claiming Jewish people controlled the US “like a radar controls the movement of a great ship in the waters’ and had ‘got a stranglehold on the Congress’.
He has described Jews as ‘bloodsuckers’ who profited from the slave trade. Judaism he called a ‘dirty religion’ and a ‘gutter religion’.
‘The Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well Hitler was a great man.’
White people he said were ‘devils by nature’.”
All of that long on the record, nonetheless there was Sadiq Khan insisting that “Mr. Farrakhan is not anti-Semitic and does not preach a message of racial hatred and antagonism.”
In other words? Louis Farrakhan should be allowed into Britain, but the president of the United States, staunch friend of Israel and the Jewish people, the president with the Jewish daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, should be snubbed.
As if to deliberately reinforce his blossoming reputation as an authoritarian-minded Old Order elitist, there was this story once Khan took office as mayor. As he himself noted in his piece demanding the British government refuse to “roll out the red carpet” for the president, one of Khan’s stated reasons for a snub of the President was that Trump had supported “introducing a travel ban to a number of predominately Muslim countries.”
Travel bans, in the Khan world view, are immoral. Unless.
Take note of this 2017 story in the UK’s Evening Standard : The headline?
Sadiq Khan: world leaders must speak out against Donald Trump travel ban
In a story in which this was reported:
Sadiq Khan will today tell senior diplomats that the international community must show “moral leadership” by speaking out against Donald Trump’s travel ban .
The Mayor will urge global leaders to condemn the US President’s “cruel, prejudiced and counterproductive” policy as he hosts the largest ever gathering of ambassadors and dignitaries at City Hall. …
“As an international community, I believe we have a responsibility to show moral leadership and so my ask of you tonight is this: join me in speaking out against this ban and condemning it for what it really is — discriminatory, self-defeating and completely un-American.”
At the diplomatic reception tonight, the Mayor was set to add: “You don’t need me to tell you that there’s no contradiction between subscribing to Western values — of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and freedom of speech — and being a Muslim.
“Nor do you need me to tell you that targeting people for no reason other than their faith or their country of birth is cruel, prejudiced and counterproductive.”
Hmmm. Who was in attendance as the mayor attacked America and totally misrepresented the travel ban? That would be, as noted here , “11 dignitaries whose countries bar Israeli citizens from entering. Bangladesh, Brunei, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan, Sudan, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.”
About those travel bans targeting Jews the Mayor had not so much to say — meaning, nothing. Hypocrisy, much?
Let’s cut to the chase. The mayor of London is nothing more nor less than one more Old Order Swamp creature, British version. He will demand that the president of the United States be snubbed — while fighting to see that one of the most vicious and out-there anti-Semites in America, Louis Farrakhan, is admitted to Britain. He will denounce and misrepresent the travel ban — which was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — but blithely entertain the ambassadors of 11 Muslim countries whose countries have bans on the entry of Israeli citizens.
Make no mistake. Mayor Sadiq Khan is a hard left extremist who, like Old Order authoritarians everywhere, has a habit of projecting his own views and mindset on others — in this case President Donald Trump. Or Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson, Khan’s mayoral predecessor who is running to succeed the outgoing Theresa May as prime minister.
The good news is that in the recent elections in Britain for the UK’s representation in the European Union Parliament, the majority of Brits voted for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, with nine of the UK’s 12 regions making it clear they favored Brexit.
The back-and-forth between Sadiq Khan and Donald Trump is yet another reminder that the president’s new populism is in fact the leading voice for positive change from the smug, authoritarian elitist Old Order ways that have been holding back America — and Britain.
This populism is signaling the end of policies that has kept both countries from making themselves great again. In the words of President John F. Kennedy in his historic address to the nation on civil rights a full 56 years ago in June of 1963:
“A great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all.”
Exactly. And the leading agent of that quite positive change is Donald Trump — whether Sadiq Khan and his fellow Old Order elitists like it or not.

Islamism and Immigration: A New Front for Troublemaking,spectator.org,Oren Litwin,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/islamism-and-immigration-a-new-front-for-troublemaking/,"by Betsy McCaughey
R ecently, Islamist groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) have opened up a new field of activity. Going beyond lobbying against the Trump administration’s “Muslim ban” and caps on refugee admittance, CAIR and its allies have enthusiastically jumped into the larger fight for open immigration in general, becoming involved in many protests focused on the U.S.-Mexican border.
For example, CAIR-San Diego held a “Prayer Beyond Borders” event “to pray for peace and justice in the borderlands,” and CAIR National was one of the sponsors for a series of Mother’s Day rallies “to call for [an] end to immigrant family separation [and] child detention.” On the more hard-Progressive end, Linda Sarsour’s organization MPower Change attacks President Donald Trump for “ripping families apart from each other” at the border, and castigates Amazon for providing surveillance technology to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).
One might view this merely as part of the Islamists’ bargain with the Progressive movement, to support Progressive priorities even when they don’t necessarily relate to Islamist goals. However, that underestimates the strategic importance of the immigration debate to the Islamists. An emerging trope among Islamists and their allies has been associating the effort for expanded immigration in the U.S. with the “Right of Return” claimed by Palestinians. Just as Central American immigrants ought to be able to enter the U.S. legally, goes the thinking, so too Palestinians ought to be able to gain citizenship in Israel.
This juxtaposition is clever at first blush; yet it seems unwise for the Islamists. The justification for embracing those crossing the U.S.-Mexican border is ostensibly that America is a nation of immigrants, and no one group has more of a right to be here than another. But if you apply the same logic to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it seems to torpedo one of the central claims of the Israel-bashers. If Salvadorans and Mexicans and Palestinians ought to be allowed to live where they wish, why should Jewish immigrants not have been welcomed into Ottoman-controlled Israel? And why should Jews today be expelled from Palestinian-controlled territory?
The truth is, however, that Islamists are not making a cosmopolitan argument for U.S. immigration at all; and their real argument is perfectly in line with their rejectionism towards Israel. Their implicit argument, and that of much of the hard-Progressive left, is not that anyone should be able to live anywhere; it is that the United States lacks the standing to keep people out, because we are an illegitimate country built on European colonialism and white supremacy.
White supremacy has been featuring more and more in Islamist discourse lately. Partly this is a rational response to the vivid episodes of white-supremacist terrorism against Muslims — both the rare incidences of mass shootings as in New Zealand, and the relatively more frequent (but still rare) cases of mosque arson. The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) has been criticizing government complacency on white-supremacist violence, saying that it goes beyond the random acts of “lone wolves,” and advocating for a more deliberate counterterror policy.
But partly, the new focus on white supremacy reflects a strategic choice by Islamists to align with Progressive rhetoric , resulting in some outlandish claims. For example, Adam Soltani, executive director of CAIR-Oklahoma, recently claimed that “white supremacy is the root of Islamophobia and other types of discrimination,” a claim that was amplified by CAIR-National. Emgage Action objected to the attention paid to the Notre Dame fire, as opposed to a minor fire in the courtyard of the Al-Aqsa Mosque that same day (which did no damage and was quickly put out), blaming this focus on “white racism.”
MPower Change blames all the ills of the world on “Militarism and white supremacy, from Baltimore to Baghdad,” and frequently attributes American criminal policy to an obsession with regulating “black and brown bodies” (an obnoxious Progressive trope borrowing from philosopher Giorgio Agamben, and verging on the pornographic in its implications). In April, CAIR participated in the annual “Manzanar March” commemorating U.S. internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II; during the weekend, CAIR officials repeatedly drew between the discrimination against Japanese-Americans and modern anti-Islamic bigotry . And Islamists have been deliberately proselytizing to American Indian communities, amid new arguments that Islam has roots in America that predate the founding of the United States.
Islamists are presenting themselves as champions of civil liberties. If only. The hostility to a “white supremacist” American society underlying Islamists’ views on U.S. immigration is profoundly illiberal, and should be seen for what it is: an attack on not only the legitimacy of the United States itself, but on the very cosmopolitan ideal. And this attack is motivating a fictitious rewrite of our history, the wholesale attribution of racist motives to innocent people, and the deepening polarization of our society."
Something Totalitarian This Way Comes,spectator.org,Daniel J. Flynn,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/something-totalitarian-this-way-comes/,"Special Report Something Totalitarian This Way Comes Big Tech monopolies intensify their censorship of the right — but with the right entrepreneur, there is a way out. by John Jiang
A t the urging of other journalists, YouTube demonetized and deplatformed various voices this week. Steven Crowder, an actor, comedian, and activist with nearly four million subscribers on his YouTube channel, remains on the site but stripped of the ability to support his show with advertisers. Carlos Maza, a Vox writer and frequent target of Crowder mockery, decried YouTube for “creating a platform where only monsters feel safe enough to talk about s#!+ that actually matters” in arguing for the company to remove Crowder entirely. MeTube, not YouTube.
The censorship follows similar moves by tech companies, including Twitter bans on American Spectator writer Robert Stacy McCain, political consultant Roger Stone, and radio personality Anthony Cumia, and Google rigging its search engine to suppress results for numerous conservative outlets, including The American Spectator .
Why do progressives censor? Because it works. While a muzzle resulting in a megaphone surely results from censorship on occasion, the more likely outcome involves suppression.
Progressives understand this. “Milo’s deplatforming was so swift, and so just, that the man found himself in several million dollars’ worth of debt following the utter collapse of his book deals, national tours and television appearances,” Harry Todd writes at Paste regarding an equally anonymous figure throwing a milkshake at Yiannopoulos in the United Kingdom. “The virulent bigot used to be nigh-inescapable, his xenophobic remarks following you at every turn on the internet like the eyes of a creepy portrait in a haunted house. Then he got the boot from social media, and today we don’t even hear about an act of severe dairy-based political violence until nearly a full week later. In other words, as we argued in April, deplatforming works.”
Consider also Lauren Southern, who announced her retirement from the great conversation this week — at 23 . “Farewell,” she tweeted followers. “I’ve enjoyed this all greatly but it’s time to start a new chapter of my life.” Patreon deplatformed her after she reported on non-governmental organizations trafficking illegal aliens from the Middle East into Europe. She did not peddle falsehoods in her documentary on illegal immigration, but truths, which serve as a big offense for journalists when they traffic in the wrong truths. An activist dumped urine on her in Vancouver. Governments detained her and blocked her from speaking.
Big Tech duct-tapes a mouth more effectively than the government. Consider the report this week that Americans, for the first time in history, spend more time on their devices than watching television. This is how we communicate to a mass audience in 2019. Google enjoys a 92 percent share of the search-engine market. YouTube’s market share exceeds three quarters. Facebook’s market share reaches 70 percent.
At its peak, Standard Oil’s domination of the American oil refining market did not match Google’s domination of the worldwide search engine market, and by the time the government splintered John D. Rockefeller’s creation into Esso, Arco, Chevron, and other entities, Standard Oil’s market share did not approach the current market share of Google, Facebook, or YouTube.
Inaction against Big Tech monopolies strikes as especially unusual given Big Government taking a special interest in monopolies that involve the free exchange of ideas, especially ones pertaining to the public airwaves.
The federal government aggressively regulated the internet of the interwar years. Every hour of every day ABC broadcasts the precedent of the federal government breaking up media monopolies. During the 1940s, the FCC and the courts cleaved the Blue Network from NBC, which resulted in ABC — and the Red Network effectively remaining as NBC. Both companies soon added television networks to their existing radio empires.
After initially refusing to run radio broadcast schedules, newspapers that could not beat ’em joined ’em. WGN (World’s Greatest Newspaper), WTAG ( Worcester Telegram & Gazette ), KRNT ( Des Moines Register & Tribune ), KTAR (Keep Talking Arizona Republic ), and other stations broadcast the symbiotic relationship between radio and newspapers during every station identification. Though the call letters remain, the association of such stations with the local newspapers largely ended after the FCC restricted media companies from owning a broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same city in 1975, a prohibition lifted in recent years.
The government, which regards the airwaves as public, purports to regulate broadcast media in the public interest. The internet, which relies on those airwaves for wifi, somehow escapes this precedent dating back nine decades.
For those squeamish about the government dictating to private companies, even ones controlling nearly all of their communication sector, that it cannot tell people what not to say — David French cautions against this course at National Review , writing that “what conservatives cannot and should not do is use the government to erode freedom for the alleged purpose of saving freedom” — another option exists. In the mid-1990s, after decades of complaints about the bias of network news, Rupert Murdoch launched the Fox News Channel. As a result of it filling a void, it quickly became the dominant cable news channel.
Given the brazen partisanship and politicization of various Big Tech companies, and America remaining, however tenuously, a Center-Right nation, one wonders when some enterprising billionaire realizes that challenging Twitter or Facebook or YouTube or Google pays dividends. The appeal of such a venture involves not its philanthropy but its money-making potential. Tens of millions of people want to read or hear the thoughts or jokes or ramblings of Steven Crowder, Milo Yiannopoulos, Jesse Peterson, Gavin McInnes, Meghan Murphy, and others, some with an audience but really not worth an intelligent person’s attention, suppressed by Big Tech.
Perhaps an entity as dominant as Google remains beyond challenge, but other Big Tech behemoths, relying as they do on content produced by unpaid third parties, seem ripe for competition. Currently, social media finds itself in a spot analogous to television in its early days — ABCCBSNBCDuMont — when a big country looked to three or four channels for news and entertainment and much else. Today, television sets offer thousands of choices on hundreds of channels. That’s the inevitable future of social media, perhaps hastened by the Big Brotherism of Big Tech."
Hold On To Your Avocados,spectator.org,Scott McKay,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/hold-on-to-your-avocados/,"Political Hay Hold On To Your Avocados Trump’s five percent Mexican tariff is more negotiation than policy, and should be recognized as such. Plus, a few items from hither and yon. by John Jiang
Y ou would think that with a president who wrote a book entitled The Art of the Deal , something like a threat of tariffs against Mexico unless that country begins playing a more constructive role in cleaning up the migrant crisis at our southern border would be seen for what it is.
And you’d be wrong.
It’s obvious that Trump is aiming at the most identifiable, pushable pressure point he can find in order to influence Mexico’s behavior. Imposing tariffs on the Mexicans over the long haul isn’t in his political interest; what’s in his interest is stopping the flood of illegal aliens into the country before that flood inundates the country and turns all of America into California.
The Democrats are acting in their interest, after all. The more low-skilled, uneducated, and dirt-broke immigrants can be brought to our shores and connected to entitlement programs, the more eventual votes that party will receive as the closest thing to a Latin American kleptocrat/socialist party those immigrants will be familiar with. Unbridled immigration, legal or illegal, is the stated aim of today’s Democrats — no matter that their luminaries all sounded exactly like Trump does now a mere decade ago on the subject. They have seen the light, and like leftist parties in Europe they recognize that importing the electorate they want is far more preferable to attempting to convince the current electorate the policies which have made a ruin of every major American city simply need to be writ large and all will be well.
But the five percent tariff threat to the Mexicans, together with Trump’s tariff wars with the Chinese, are only in his interest so far as they are a means to an end which is in his interest. With China, it’s about deflating a hostile nation operating in a predatory and lawless fashion with respect to not just trade balance but intellectual property. Trump knows our current imbalance with the Chinese isn’t preordained, and he wants to change our fate.
And with Mexico it’s about ending the migrant crisis.
The Mexicans have responded to the tariff threat by coming to the table. There is no deal yet on Mexican cooperation with the migrant issue; that was unlikely to be the case in any event. The Mexicans can’t afford to immediately cave to Trump’s demands. That would make for bad politics back home, particularly given the domestic circumstances south of the border whereby the vast majority of territory adjacent to the border containing population centers is governed, all or in part, by the vast criminal syndicates which began as drug cartels. We know that’s not an exaggeration, by the way — it’s the admission of Mexico’s own government and the subject of a major internal discussion in that country.
Trump is making an extremely large ask of the Mexican government, which — let’s face it — lacks the functionality to follow through on the demands he’s making. But he’s going to get something out of those threats, and whatever it is will be better than the current status quo.
Talks continue. Concessions are forthcoming. The Mexicans have already offered to staff up their national guard deployments by 6,000 men and station those troops on their border with Guatemala as part of a shift in national policy toward dissuading Central American migrants from flowing through to our cities and towns.
And the Mexicans did block a caravan of 1,200 migrants from entering at their southern border. So Trump’s threats have already paid off, at least a little.
But the entire political class in this country is screaming about Trump’s tariff threat as though it’s a policy shift. The lobbyists on Capitol Hill and the politicians of both parties are acting as though it’s some great abuse of power for Trump to be using the lever of tariffs in his negotiations.
Well, what else is he going to use?
Ideally, the president would be able to sit down with Congressional leaders and map out a bipartisan strategy for ending the border crisis, and then do a bilateral deal with Mexico to make that strategy a reality.
Fat chance of that. The Democrats have made it clear they want this crisis. And the Republicans are so devoid of understanding of what Trump is doing, or so in the thrall of elements of the business community which have abused their influence in order to get cheap foreign labor, he can’t even count on them.
Here’s an interesting thought experiment. If the Democrats and the NeverTrumpers are so aghast at Trump’s threats — coming as they do after a month in which a staggering 133,000 migrants were apprehended at the border — and if what they disagree with are his tactics rather than the goal he seeks, why isn’t there a serious effort to pass bipartisan legislation giving the president some other lever in which to negotiate with Mexico?
We know that’s not forthcoming, and we know why. Too many of our political class are invested in bringing in either cheap labor or captive voters, and they don’t want anything done about the invasion of our country through its southern border — whether that might be from Africa, Central America, the Middle East or wherever else.
Most of those migrants aren’t Mexicans, you know.
And in case you might have forgotten, this is why Trump won in the first place .
…
We need a free-speech-friendly alternative to YouTube, and we need it immediately. Steven Crowder is sometimes hit-and-miss on his antics, which isn’t surprising considering how hard it is to be consistently funny (the best comedians do very often bomb), but to deplatform him based on a comment someone might find homophobic, as YouTube did by demonetizing his account , is beyond the pale.
And Crowder certainly isn’t alone in suffering that fate.
Advertisers ought to be flying away from YouTube. Those who don’t, probably shouldn’t be getting much in the way of business from conservatives. But nothing will really change until there are alternative platforms which are of a scale and quality to compete with the offerings of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the rest of the Big Tech giants.
You won’t get that without help, though. Google and Facebook buy up every app they can get their hands on which might someday grow up to compete with their offerings. That’s why it’s a good thing the Trump Justice Department is preparing an antitrust action against Google — those acquisitions will pause while DOJ works its ways, and instead of catching a $50 million payout the next great app builder will have to press on to market — where he’ll make $50 billion by beating the pants off YouTube, or Facebook, or Twitter.
Because the market is ready. When something comparable to Facebook or Twitter comes along which sees its role as a platform, not a publisher, and takes a neutral view toward the free expression its users exhibit (with allowances for the suppression of truly illegal activity, obviously), and that something is capably marketed, the users will come.
A few days ago I started experimenting with Minds , which is a free-speech Facebook alternative. I like it. It’s a bit sparse in terms of users so far (about a million at this point), but the platform is fairly well built and it has an interesting system of rewarding users for their activity within the app.
But Big Tech has such a stranglehold on social media that we’re probably past what the market can do alone. Whether it’s antitrust actions, class action suits or state legislatures chipping away at them, conservatives are going to have to use law and politics to counter what the leftists running those companies are doing.

I’m too lazy to go look up all the quotes from Bernie Sanders praising the USSR and Venezuela over the years. Let’s just recognize as a general matter that he’s done so — copiously.
Which begs the question: how come Bernie Sanders has spent his whole life as a socialist touting a bunch of regimes which aren’t actually socialist? When he now says he’s not talking about authoritarian regimes run by dictators when he flogs socialism at us, does he really believe anyone will give that credit?
Of course he does. Sanders is counting on the stupidity of his voters and the complicity of the mainstream media in not challenging him on his lies.
And so far he’s right.
Then again, there is still time for some enterprising journalist to ask Bernie Sanders if he’s seen Chernobyl.

A follow-up to last week’s column about the Mighty Mississippi and its efforts to change course and flow down the channel of the Atchafalaya River — at the time that was written the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was to have opened the Morganza Spillway, a flood control structure which allows Mississippi River floodwaters to make their way through the Atchafalaya Basin to the Gulf of Mexico, Thursday.
But since the column’s publication the Corps first postponed the Morganza opening until Sunday, then canceled it altogether.
That has people in South Louisiana, particularly in the Baton Rouge and New Orleans areas, absolutely freaking out over high river levels and the prospect of levees breaking.
But nobody has more information about the river and its levels, and nobody is better poised to make accurate forecasts as to the need, or lack thereof, to open the spillways than the Corps. So if they don’t think they need to open Morganza, the farmers and crawfishermen who work that spillway can breathe a little easier.
Unless, of course, a levee does break — in which case there will be hell for the Corps to pay and rightly so."

S acramento
Late Monday evening, I felt a stabbing sensation in my gut, so I went to the emergency room when it became apparent the pain wasn’t going away. I had to wait to see a doctor of course, but then was examined, scanned, and diagnosed. By 5:30 a.m., surgeons were removing my inflamed appendix laparoscopically . By late afternoon I was home watching Mafia flicks and enjoying the benefits of an oxycodone prescription. By Wednesday, I was back at work.
Say what you want about our nation’s screwed-up healthcare system, but that isn’t bad. Sure, I have health insurance, but so do 93 percent of Californians . The 7 percent who aren’t covered should receive the same emergency treatment as anyone else, given that hospitals can’t deny emergency service based on an inability to pay. After scanning the waiting room at the downtown Sacramento ER that night, I’d say it’s a safe bet most of the people there had no insurance and weren’t about to pay by credit card.
America’s healthcare system is no model of free enterprise, of course. It’s heavily controlled by government regulations. Myriad state and federal subsidies distort the prices. Because third parties (insurers and government) foot most of the bill, no one shops around for the best deal even on elective procedures. The cost of Tuesday’s surgery will probably remain a mystery to me. Blue Cross bean-counters will determine what I owe and I’ll pay it after being inundated with incomprehensible forms and bills. End of story.
This inefficient mixed-market system could use various competitive reforms, but it works decently for most people most of the time. Nevertheless, it is the prime target for leftists with grandiose dreams of something better. They promote various incremental plans such as “Medicare for all,” but we know what they really want: A government-controlled single-payer system of “free” healthcare with taxpayers footing the entire bill.
In a word, they want medical socialism. They’re not swayed by data about people in Britain and Canada waiting months and even years to get surgeries people in the United States can schedule right away. They’re not concerned about the rationing of care , the multitrillion-dollar budget costs, or the stifling of innovation. Who is going to invest in clever medical devices (like those laparoscopic tools that spared me a big incision) or life-saving drugs if there’s no possible windfall? If you say “government,” then you haven’t been watching the Chernobyl miniseries.
Leftists tout an idealized version of the Scandinavian model, ignoring the scarcity problems that plague healthcare in those countries. They ignore other obvious points, too. The United States is a huge multicultural and individualistic society that’s not at all like homogenous Norway or Finland. People there are more apt to follow edicts and wait in lines, less willing to file lawsuits, complain, and protest. Single-payer advocates should look closer to home for a sense of what we’ll get, such as the disastrous Veterans Administration hospital system .
California Democrats never addressed these concerns when they passed a bill to create a single-payer healthcare system that would replace all private insurance in the state. The Senate’s own analysis pegged the costs at $400 billion, which is twice the state’s total budget. And you know how government price estimates go. The eastern span of the Bay Bridge was completed a few years ago at a mere 2,500 percent over budget. I’d guess that $400 billion is only the down-payment.
The state Senate plan would have provided any needed healthcare service to anyone who made it into the state, regardless of their home state or country. Gov. Gavin Newsom raised eyebrows recently for encouraging women from conservative states to come to California to have an abortion — a ghastly version of medical tourism . But imagine how many “tourists” will flock to California under the scenario devised by the Senate. Then again, those free treatments might not look so great if you’re stuck waiting 10 years to get them.
That largely symbolic single-payer bill ultimately died in the Assembly, but every Democratic leader, including the new governor , has paid homage to the concept of single payer. That means that they would endanger a healthcare system that works tolerably well for 93 percent of the public in the hopes of improving it for that 7 percent who lack health insurance. That’s nuts, but I still remember when promising socialized medicine was the kiss of death for a politician. Now it’s the kiss of death in California to not promote socialized everything .
At the California Democratic Party convention last weekend in San Francisco, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper suggested that, “If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.” His seemingly uncontroversial words were met with a loud chorus of boos . Maryland Rep. John Delaney was booed for a full minute after he criticized “Medicare for all.”
If only we had a socialized system, everything apparently would be well. Just ask the Venezuelans. I would have gone to the emergency room with that stabbing pain and the surgery wouldn’t have cost me a dime. Then again, I’d probably still be waiting for the treatment or would already have died in the process, so socialism might have a couple of down sides.

The Fake News Attack on Laura Ingraham,spectator.org,Jeffrey Lord,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-fake-news-attack-on-laura-ingraham/,"The Fake News Attack on Laura Ingraham A defense of free speech is not a defense of content.
W ow.
It’s hard to get more misleading than this.
Mediaite and my old CNN colleague and fellow Red Sox fanatic John Berman stepped up and said something so wildly misleading that it needs to be politely called out.
Yesterday, Fox’s Laura Ingraham interviewed President Trump in France.
Here was the disgraceful Mediaite headline:
CNN’s John Berman Calls Out Trump For Laura Ingraham Interview: She Just ‘Defended an Anti-Semite’
The story , by Mediaite ’s Caleb Ecarma, said, in part, this:
CNN’s John Berman called out President Donald Trump for sitting down with Fox News host Laura Ingraham this morning, as she recently used her show to champion white supremacist Paul Nehlen after he was banned from social media for sharing violent, racist content.
Berman made the remarks while discussing Trump postponing ceremonies commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day Thursday today by 15 minutes so he could appear on Ingraham’s show.
“ A lot of that politics led right up until the moment the president gave his speech because not minutes before he walked on that stage he sat down for an interview with Laura Ingraham, who in the last few weeks on her show has defended an anti-Semite, Paul Nehlen, who spouts anti-Semitic views and white supremacist views all the time,” Berman observed.
Catch that line? This one: “… before he walked on that stage he sat down for an interview with Laura Ingraham, who in the last few weeks on her show has defended an anti-Semite, Paul Nehlen, who spouts anti-Semitic views and white supremacist views all the time.”
Over at the Washington Post was this headline :
Laura Ingraham promoted a white supremacist on her show. At least one advertiser is pulling out.
Stop. Full stop. And yes, full disclosure I have occasionally appeared on Laura Ingraham’s show, have known her off and on over the years. We are also both Reagan White House alumni.
So let’s set the record straight. What Laura Ingraham did on her show was support free speech — not the content of the speech in question. She never, ever defended the views of white supremacist Paul Nehlen. Not once. That is just flatly untrue and all one had to do was watch the segment to see just how grossly untrue this charge was.
In fact (but who cares about fact?), the Ingraham Angle graphic was based on a report from the Associated Press that headlined:
Facebook bans ‘dangerous individuals’ cited for hate speech
The AP report quite specifically said this:
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — After years of pressure to crack down on hate and bigotry, Facebook has banned Louis Farrakhan, Alex Jones and other extremists, saying they violated its ban on “dangerous individuals.”
The company also removed right-wing personalities Paul Nehlen, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson and Laura Loomer, along with Jones’ site, Infowars, which often posts conspiracy theories. The latest bans apply to both Facebook’s main service and to Instagram and extend to fan pages and other related accounts.”
So the Ingraham Angle posting was based on this AP report. Question for Mediaite , John Berman, and the Washington Post : Was the AP anti-Semitic for posting Paul Nehlen’s name? After all, the AP put the words “dangerous individuals” in quotes. Suggesting what? Support? Suggesting they aren’t “dangerous individuals”? The AP story — and the Ingraham Angle posting based on that AP story — is what is called dealing with fact. Not support for content — fact.
Here is the Ingraham Angle segment — as posted on YouTube by, yes indeed, none other than Laura’s own Ingraham Angle show. If she actually did what she was falsely accused of she would hardly have the entire segment posted for all of Internet eternity to view.
The segment, with Candace Owens of Turning Point, was about the increasingly rampant censorship of social media directed towards conservatives, Trump supporters and anyone else who is seen as out of step with the left-wingers who run Silicon Valley. If one is a regular viewer of the Ingraham Angle , as I am, this is a subject Laura has discussed many, many times. As, for that matter, have I. She is a staunch believer in what John Berman’s CNN insists that they support — free speech and a free press.
In the course of the segment, an 8-picture graphic of people who have been censored by one or another left-wing social media behemoth was flashed onscreen. The eight people were: Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens, Michelle Malkin, Dan Scavino, actor James Woods, and Paul Nehlen.
Laura’s exact words were these:
Ingraham: “These are some of the people they have shunned. Are you in there?
Owens: There I am! (Laughter)
Ingraham: But its people who believe in border enforcement, people who believe in national sovereignty…
Owens: People who believe in black America.
Ingraham: Oh yeah, heaven forbid! Black conservatives. Keep them out of it. Back of the bus for you! But Candace, I think this is going to be a moment, though, for us to stand up to these censors. They are the new censors.
Owens: That’s correct. And it will backfire as I said. We’re going to it in 2020.
So the obvious question? Where in there did Laura defend anti-Semitism? Obvious answer — she never said a word about it.
To be crystal clear, she never defended Paul Nehlen’s obviously racist and anti-Semitic views. Not once.
Again. To defend everyone’s right to free speech in this country is hardly the same as defending the content of what a person says with that free speech.
A while back, CNN president Jeff Zucker accepted a “First Amendment Award.” In his acceptance speech he had these lines:
We are here tonight to celebrate the First Amendment and oh how do we love that First Amendment. If we could we’d kiss it like Donald Trump kissed that flag.
By the standards of Mediaite , John Berman, and the Washington Post , Jeff Zucker just endorsed every publication out there that uses the First Amendment to push whatever racist, sexist, anti-Semitic garbage they wish to spout. Here are a few examples of publications that exist because of the First Amendment that Jeff Zucker celebrated: The Crusader , published by the Ku Klux Klan. The Daily Stormer , described in Wikipedia as a publication of American neo-Nazis and white supremacists. Over here is the website of the Communist Party USA.
One could go on with a very long list of publications and websites that print or spout utter garbage. To suggest that because the President of CNN supports their free speech — and his support of the First Amendment by definition does just that — most assuredly does not mean that he endorses what they say. That is ridiculous on its face.
Yet there is Mediaite and my friend John Berman and the Washington Post blithely asserting that to defend Paul Nehlen’s free speech is to endorse what Paul Nehlen says. Which is flatly untrue, and was, in fact, never said at all by Laura Ingraham.
In sum? This Mediaite story, John Berman’s remarks, and that Washington Post story are exactly examples of why this story made news the other day. Over at Axios the headline was:
Poll: Americans view fake news as a bigger problem than terrorism
The story says in part:
Americans view made-up news and information as a bigger problem than other critical issues, including terrorism, immigration, climate change and racism, according to a new survey from Pew Research Center .
Why it matters: The survey finds that Americans feel more worried today about fake news because it’s undermining their trust in key institutions, like government and the media.”
Which is to say, what was said by Mediaite, John Berman, and the Washington Post about Laura Ingraham was 110% fake news. Utterly and completely false. And it is a sterling example of just why so many Americans have long since lost their trust in the media.
Retractions and apologies coming to Laura? Don’t wait up."
The Ides of June: Kerensky’s War Allowed Bolsheviks to Triumph in Russia,spectator.org,Doug Bandow,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-ides-of-june-kerenskys-war-allowed-bolsheviks-to-triumph-in-russia/,"by John Jiang
W orld War I resulted in two seemingly minor events which had epochal impact: a little known army operative took over a small, radical, racist political party in Germany and an exiled political agitator returned to Russia. The consequences of the latter, as intended by the German government, which facilitated his transit, were more immediate. In just a few months the Bolsheviks established tenuous control over remnants of the imperial Russian state. Out of which emerged the Soviet Union, which Ronald Reagan so accurately called the Evil Empire.
When the “Great War,” as the conflict was originally known, began in August 1914 the Entente’s members proved to be skilled propagandists. They said they were fighting a war for democracy and against Prussian militarism. It was the war to end war, a fabulous phrase even though the very definition of oxymoron. The maladroit and heavy-handed Germans inadvertently did much of the allies’ work.
Still, the Russian Empire was a great embarrassment to the Western allies. Belgium was perhaps the most murderous colonial power and revenge animated French military policy, but the Tsarist autocracy, a backward anti-Semitic despotism, most dramatically undercut Entente image-making. Under pressure the dynasty had been liberalizing, but remained far from liberal or democratic.
Then came a “constitutional” revolution in March (February in the old calendar) 1917. The Entente’s slogans suddenly seemed true even in Russia.
However, the Provisional Government was weak and political stability was beyond reach. Royalists, liberals, socialists, and communists all struggled for power. Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov promised the allies that the government would continue the war and uphold the original annexationist war aims, which inflamed popular opposition.
For men in the ranks the conflict was a purposeless horror. Soldiers’ committees formed, calling for “peace without annexations or indemnities.” Urged on by former exile Vladimir Ilych Lenin’s Bolsheviks, military personnel mixed with civilians in calling for Milyukov’s resignation. In early May Milyukov and Defense Minister Alexander Guchkov were ousted. The latter was replaced by 36-year-old socialist Alexander Kerensky, who embarked upon a speaking tour at the front, supporting continuation of the war. “There is no Russian front. There is only one united allied front,” he expounded. And he plotted a new military offensive.
The latter was a disastrous decision. By June few Russians outside of Petrograd (St. Petersburg was renamed in 1914 to sound less German) backed participation in the conflict; the soldiers, in particular, expected the new authorities to end the war. The impact of his rhetorical efforts quickly faded; soldiers initially captivated by his eloquence soon remembered the inanity of the conflict. Lenin called Kerensky a “loudmouth” and “idiot,” as the Bolsheviks campaigned on a program of “peace, land, and bread.”
Nevertheless, Kerensky announced plans for his offensive, which began in July. He became prime minister the same month, but his military plans foundered. Soldiers wanted no more of the war. The army melted away and right-wing monarchists attempted a putsch, forcing Kerensky to rely upon Bolsheviks and other communists for support. His policy became no enemies on the left, empowering his most dangerous internal adversaries.
The German army advanced against declining resistance. It was Kerensky’s moment. He might have saved a revolution which sought to reform rather than destroy had he thought of the Russian people rather than the allied leaders, who treated even their own soldiers as expendable cannon fodder. Instead, he insisted on upholding the monarchy’s war aims. When asked decades later why he continued the fight, he responded that honor required doing so. Honor measured by governments which were sacrificing the norms of Western civilization.
The war was destroying its participants, eating away at the sinews of society. Mores, morals, and cultures were dissolving. The world — politicians, armies, aims, illusions, hopes — in which the conflict erupted had disappeared. The people doing the fighting, who had been dragged into war by sheltered elites, demanded, and deserved, a change. Kerensky could have led his nation to a better future had he listened to them instead of foreign rulers who cared only about maintaining a second military front in the east.
But he did not, and the war became the Provisional Government’s decisive weakness. Power gravitated to the Petrograd Soviet, a competing revolutionary force. In November the Bolsheviks struck, occupying government buildings and arresting government ministers. Virtually no one, other than an outnumbered women’s unit, was willing to fight for Kerensky’s government. He fled and his efforts to organize resistance failed. He went into exile in May 1918 as civil war flared in Russia.
In contrast, Lenin understood the necessity of ending the war at any price. Facing down much of his party, he insisted that the Bolsheviks make peace with Germany despite the harshness of the terms offered. (Although looking ahead a century the Brest-Litovsk Treaty turned out to be prescient, with Moscow shorn of its empire, a much more realistic outcome than the allies’ Versailles Treaty.) Otherwise, he warned, the Bolsheviks would be overthrown by someone else willing to sign.
So Russia’s new rulers accepted Berlin’s ultimatum. Then the victory forced by America’s growing role destroyed German power and voided Brest-Litovsk. Facing multiple foes aided by Russia’s one-time allies, the Bolsheviks, with the ruthless and talented Leon Trotsky as war minister, improbably triumphed. At horrendous human cost. Ten million, and perhaps more, Russians, mostly civilians, died in the multi-sided struggle.
Lenin barely outlived the conflict, dying after a series of strokes in 1924. Which opened the way for someone even more cruel and ruthless, who brilliantly understood the nature and operation of power. Playing his colleagues against one another to gain absolute authority in the land of the tsars, Joseph Stalin constructed one of the world’s infamous totalitarian death states. Tens of millions more lives were consumed, including many of the November revolution’s most devoted adherents and leaders. The Bolshevik regime finally collapsed of its own weight, corrupted within. On Christmas 1991 the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time over the Kremlin.
It took 74 years to reverse the consequences of Kerensky’s tragic mistake.
The forlorn Kerensky eventually ended up in America, donating his papers to the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace. He died in 1970 at age 89 in what again turned out to be the crucial month of June. His obituary made the New York Times , but he was a forgotten man from a bygone era, whose slightly longer than 15 minutes of fame was long past. The Russian and Serbian Orthodox Churches delivered the final indignity, refusing to allow his burial. His body instead was flown to London for interment in a nondenominational cemetery.
Conservatives once understood the nature of war and feared its consequences. Today, however, some on the right appear to glory in the opportunity for revolutionary change. But World War I offers a stark reminder that it was the furies of war which opened the way for the terrible simplifiers, who released even greater horrors upon the globe in World War II. In short, men like Kerensky were necessary for men like Lenin to triumph. That lesson never should be forgotten.

Rights Abridged: The Flawed Model for Red Flag Laws,spectator.org,Kerri Toloczko,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/rights-abridged-the-flawed-model-for-red-flag-laws/,"by John Jiang
I n fifteen states and the District of Columbia, new Red Flag laws allow judges to take licensed firearms away from individuals even if they have not committed or even threatened to commit a crime. A simple petition from a third party triggers a court proceeding that could eliminate a person’s Second Amendment rights and cause a cascade of consequences.
Florida is a good example of one of those states.
Some civil rights organizations have expressed concern about constitutional principles being violated by such laws, such as the right to due process and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
Red Flag laws seem intended to bypass processes that already exist to have someone adjudicated as mentally ill or guilty of a crime. Initial Red Flag hearings, like other restraining order hearings, often do not allow the accused time to retain an attorney or present a full defense before having their rights abridged.
Proponents often make the case that Red Flag laws are generally modelled after existing protection order or restraining order laws and are therefore a reliable method of protecting the public. This implies civil rights are not already being violated in protection order proceedings, even though examples abound of rights trampled and the judicial system abused by individuals advancing a personal agenda.
It may be that state lawmakers don’t realize their well-meaning laws, when implemented, are harming citizens by depriving them of constitutional rights and wreaking havoc with their lives. Legislators may not perceive that courts are currently abused by individuals using the justice system as personal leverage in disputes such as child custody, divorce, or a bad break up.
If lawmakers spent a day watching the proceedings of those whose lives are forever changed by hasty injunctions, they would see the abuse and think twice about using this system as a model.
A recent observation day in a Lee County, Florida courtroom showed clear problems with the system. Those who had petitions filed against them had little time to prepare. One man was informed of a hearing just one business day before, leaving no time to retain an attorney. Within minutes he lost his ability to have firearms, was blocked from entering his own home, and had to stay away from his children and estranged wife, who showed no evidence of a threat in the few minute “hearing.”
A judge granted a restraining order against another man in a four-minute hearing in which his accuser provided no evidence of a threat or harm. The accused was left in a position of trying to prove he was innocent rather than the accuser proving he was guilty. This is not how the American justice system is supposed to work.
A Southwest Florida attorney, who wishes to remain unnamed, explained that judges grant orders with little or no evidence because they are afraid if they don’t and a crime occurs later, they will lose their jobs or face public ridicule. One can see how judges in Red Flag hearings could succumb to the same self-preservation methods.
If an order of protection is granted, from that point forward, the accuser can call 911 and claim the accused drove by their house or place of work in violation of the order. The accused is forced to prove that they did not drive that route, something nearly impossible to do.
A restraining order given under false pretenses can lead to the accused losing their home, children, reputation, job, Second Amendment rights and ability to move freely within their community. Procedures with negative consequences this significant should require a more thorough process to safeguard constitutionally protected rights.
It appears Red Flag laws are indeed a red flag. They point to inadequacies and injustices already occurring in our court system.
In order to protect civil liberties, lawmakers should work on fixing the restraining order practices in their states before they use a broken system as a model for a new wave of orders.
They could start with criminal penalties for anyone who lies while filing a petition for a restraining order. If there were criminal perjury penalties with consistently implemented punishment it would be a deterrent to abuse of the system. In a recent case in Lee County, when it was clearly found in court that a claim was false, there was no repercussion for the accuser.
But reform of the system must go much further. Due process and the presumption of innocence are the bedrock of the American justice system — or at least they used to be. It will take a concerted effort by courageous lawmakers, prosecutors, and judges to fix it.
We all should be waiting to see who will lead the way.

Spiting Poland’s Communist Bastards,spectator.org,Paul Kengor,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/spiting-polands-communist-bastards/,"Spiting Poland’s Communist Bastards Two June anniversaries — from 1979 and 1989 — that mustn’t be overlooked. Shrine to John Paul II in Rzeszow, Poland (Adam Jones/Creative Commons) Top Stories by Larry Thornberry
“I came here to do glory to the mother of God and also to spite those bastards.”
It wasn’t exactly what Jesus might have said, but one can sympathize with this sentiment from a Polish citizen long repressed by the jackboot of atheistic Soviet communism. This particular Pole is quoted in the new film documentary on Pope John Paul II and Ronald Reagan, The Divine Plan , directed by Robert Orlando (I’ve co-authored the companion book to the film).
This Polish gentleman in June 1979 attended one of the massive rallies that greeted Karol Wojtyla, by then Pope John Paul II, the first Polish pope, the first Slavic pope, the first non-Italian pope in four and a half centuries.
The Pole spoke to a bemused Western reporter interviewing those basking in the almost surreal, once-unthinkable glow of a Polish pope coming home to shake the foundations of the Marxist-Leninist state. Millions of jubilant Poles joined their suddenly famous native son in open defiance of the communist authorities. “Why are you here?” the reporter had asked. He got his answer: Giving glory to the heavens meant shaking your fist at the ideological brutes who denounced the heavens.
This June 2019 is a good time to remember this. Last week the world remembered the 30 th anniversary of Tiananmen Square. And yet, just hours after Tiananmen, something else of major historic importance happened, and it happened in Poland: the people there held free and fair elections. The first round came on June 4, immediately after the Tiananmen protests. The second round would follow on June 18. These were, finally, the elections promised long ago at Yalta but had never happened.
The communists that June didn’t win a single seat. Mikhail Gorbachev knew what that landslide rejection meant. He said the “chaos in Poland” threatened an “ensuing break-up of the entire Socialist camp.” With those groundbreaking elections, a fuse was lit that would run all the way to the base of the Berlin Wall.
They were the first free and fair elections in the Communist Bloc. Solidarity candidates won 99 of the 100 contested seats, with an independent candidate winning the other. The communists were completely skunked. They paved the way for the presidential election of Lech Walesa a year later.
And that’s not the only anniversary for Poland this June 2019, which brings me back to that Pole giving honor to the Blessed Mother and spiting the communist thugs. That historic moment had come 10 years before those Polish elections, and in fact was a catalyst for those elections. It came June 1979, when Karol Wojtyla returned home as a (peaceful) conquering hero. He would launch what has been called nine days that changed the world .
The Polish pontiff arrived home on June 2, 1979. Church bells rang throughout the nation, further infuriating the authorities. And still worse for communists, the pope chose for his platform Warsaw’s historic Victory Square. The choice could not have been more powerfully symbolic. As secret police pressed in from all around the perimeter of the massive crowd, the Polish shepherd exhorted his flock to “Be not afraid.” He also stated definitively: “there can be no just Europe without the independence of Poland marked on its map.” The crowd was ecstatic.
My friend Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, today a Polish scholar and historian, was among those who made sure he didn’t miss the hometown boy that June.
Marek’s family had dealt with political goons all their lives. He’s the only male member of his family in three centuries not sent to jail, to Auschwitz, to Siberia, or wounded or killed on the battlefield. The women of his family have been equally tough. Marek’s grandmother was tortured by the Gestapo, the Soviet NKVD, and the Polish communist secret police.
“I come from a long line of freedom fighters, people who die for the cause,” says Marek. “So, I was raised not afraid and I, when I was a child, would challenge my teachers. I would tell them things against communism when I was 12 years old — when I was chucked out of school for the first time.”
Marek was 16 years old in June 1979 when he played hooky from high school to watch it all: “John Paul II was scheduled to make his first ever visit to Poland as pontiff, and we were told at school, don’t go .” They were informed that attending the rallies would be tantamount to cutting school. When that threat was shrugged off, the government’s teachers and administrators tried to scare students. Maybe a threat of being stampeded by a crazed mob would work. “We were then told, don’t even entertain a thought because it’s going to be like Mexico,” recalls Marek. “There will be a stampede like a bullfight, and they’ll scrape you off the wall. My teacher told me that.”
The communists were doing their damnedest at every level to undercut the pope’s visit. The regime sent a directive to schoolteachers instructing them how to characterize the papal visit to students. “The Pope is our enemy,” exclaimed the directive. “Due to his uncommon skills and great sense of humor he is dangerous.… Besides, he goes for cheap gestures in his relations with the crowd, for instance, puts on a highlander’s hat, shakes all hands, kisses children…. It is modeled on American presidential campaigns.”
Poles rejected such absurdities and intimidation. They could not have been more inspired and were openly defiant of the regime. They looked to spite those bastards.
“Of course, I cut school with a couple of friends,” recalls Marek. “The weather was beautiful and what I saw was a million-strong crowd. The best behaved, the best self-policed mass of human beings I have ever encountered. It was simply incredible. There was kindness, which was publicly surprising because communism also meant churlishness. There was love. There was expectation of a miracle, and the miracle came. A dude in a white suit and a little yarmulke, John Paul II. We loved it.”
Though fear theretofore had been everywhere, in everyone’s eyes, John Paul II told the Polish people to “fear not.” It was that, Marek said, that for him and for the million people he saw in Warsaw that day, and then millions more who would see the pope elsewhere during that trip, “was astonishing and incredible. For me, it was gratifying. It was just a miracle.”
In fact, Lech Walesa, Solidarity’s leader, would say of John Paul II’s visit: “He comes to Poland, and the twenty who followed me were suddenly ten million. It was a greater multiplication than the loaves and the fishes.”
In terms of sheer numbers, it was indeed.
The communists stared in horror as the crowd chanted not “we want Marx” but “we want God!” That was the Gospel they wanted, not what John Paul II and Ronald Reagan called “the false faith” of Marxism-Leninism. And it was that Gospel, proclaimed without fear by John Paul II, plus the stoic efforts of the likes of Ronald Reagan, of Margaret Thatcher, of the Solidarity movement, and more, that tore open the Iron Curtain.
Alas, that will bring us to another anniversary coming this fall, which the world will be acknowledging soon: the 30 th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Much of the focus will be on that wall, but we must know and remember that its toppling was precipitated by the elections in Poland in June 1989 and by the visit of Pope John Paul II to Poland in June 1979. We must not forget those events nor the damage done by the ideological gangsters that were defeated and spited."
Dinner at Mr Chow,spectator.org,Ben Stein,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/dinner-at-mr-chow/,"by Larry Thornberry
S aturday night and Mr Chow is hopping. It’s a fashionable, delicious Chinese bistro and as I waited for my guests, Magic Johnson walked in and upstairs to a private dining room. My guests came. Three astonishingly healthy-looking men from Holland, via Canada.
They told us their stories, or a tiny bit of them. Two of them were brothers, in late middle age, super successful in business in western Canada. One set of their grandparents had been administrators in Indonesia before World War II, when it was a Dutch colony.
When the Japanese came and occupied the country, the women were sent to an internment camp high in the mountains.
The men were sent to do forced labor on a railroad and bridge in the lowlands. The men were worked so hard and given so little food that the boys’ grandfather became ill, was beset by malnutrition, and died.
At almost the exact same moment in 1944, the man’s grandson, who had been in Holland when the Nazis occupied it, had died after having been worked to death at a Nazi-run deportation and slave labor camp for Dutchmen suspected of anti-Nazi sympathies. The 48-year-old man swore he had seen a vision of his son in a white robe just before he died in Indonesia.
When the Japanese surrendered, Indonesian revolutionaries led by the evil Sukarno tried to get the Indonesians to kill any Dutch who had survived. By luck, they made it back to Holland, and thence to Alberta, where they worked like mad men and survived and prospered.
The third man at the table was a film maker from Calgary. His great aunt and uncle were sent to concentration camps for hiding Jews. Their names are inscribed in stone at Yad Vashem, the memorial to the Holocaust in Israel.
And there we all were, eating filet mignon and shrimp toast and two of them drinking fine wines and contemplating major business ventures. Upstairs from us was a black super star athlete and entrepreneur. God only knows the horrors his family suffered under slavery in this country, and all around us were other black people whose ancestors would all have been able to tell horror stories.
But there we all were, eating and laughing and gorging ourselves, and this is called America, the beautiful. My father, a famous man, used to say that his ancestors had made many decisions. The best one was to come to America. God bless this great country and Canada and Holland and all who bled and starved and died for freedom. There is no blessing quite like being free, especially in America."
The Open Border Extremists,spectator.org,Jed Babbin,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-open-border-extremists/,"Loose Canons The Open Border Extremists President Trump’s major win in his border-tariff showdown with Mexico is no skin off the Democrats’ nose. by Andrew Harrod
T he extremism of the Democrats, their honed-to-a-fine-edge radicalism, is displayed almost daily on the subject of abortion. When anyone — like poor old Joe Biden — strays an inch on abortion, they’re quickly reined in as Biden was last week when he endorsed the Hyde Amendment and then was forced into a flip-flop.
Their extremism goes beyond abortion to other important issues such as illegal immigration. The Dems are committed to an extreme open borders position.
The Dems’ refusal to consider any legislation to stop the flow of illegal immigration across our southern border was, to their outrage, end-run by the president in his deal with Mexico last week. The deal resulted from Trump’s threat of presidentially imposed tariffs under his national security authority. It was a beautiful sharp stick in Nancy and Chuckie’s eyes.
Since he was inaugurated, President Trump has been searching for solutions to the immigration problem and most — nearly all — of what he’s tried to do has been thwarted by the Dems and court actions. The threat of heavy tariffs on Mexican exports — most of which come into the U.S. — was Trump’s attempt to use the economic sanctions weapon that he’s used to great effect on nations such as Iran and Russia to tackle illegal immigration.
Trump threatened five percent tariffs on Mexican goods if they didn’t do more to stop the flow of illegal aliens into the U.S. The tariffs would have increased by five percent per month until Trump was satisfied with the Mexicans’ actions. About 80 percent of Mexico’s exports come to the U.S., so the Mexicans were facing a huge decline in trade they cannot afford.
The threat was enough to get the business community’s alarm bells ringing and for some Republican senators to threaten disapproval of the tariffs. They all looked pretty stupid when the result was announced.
Mexico has been a bad actor in this crisis. Its government has been providing illegal aliens from Central America transportation by bus and train to the U.S. border guarded by federal police. Mexico doesn’t want the illegals and has been very happy to shuffle them off to us.
Trump’s threat was enough to force Mexico’s President Lopez Obrador to compromise. The details of the deal are still sketchy — Trump and the Mexicans have different stories on what it does and doesn’t do — but it’s a big step in the right direction and a major win for Trump.
Under the deal, Mexico reportedly will deploy about six thousand troops to its southern border to prevent people from crossing it and then coming to America. Other Mexican national guard troops will be deployed around the country.
Also, the U.S. will be expanding its “Migrant Protection Protocols,” under which would-be asylum seekers are returned to Mexico to await adjudication of their cases. This will result in many fewer illegals being released into the U.S. general population.
The deal reportedly includes a promise to recommence the financial aid to Central American countries that Trump had stopped earlier. That’s a very bad idea because it removes the pressure on those countries to act to stem the flow of illegals into the U.S.
The Dems’ reactions to the deal are what you’d expect. Pelosi said that Trump’s threat of tariffs was reckless and that, “Threats and temper tantrums are no way to negotiate foreign policy.” Schumer said, sarcastically, that now that Trump has solved the immigration problem we won’t be hearing about it anymore.
No, Chuck. You’ll be hearing about it a lot next year and for very good reasons.
The Dems insist that there is no national emergency at our southern border despite the facts. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, by the end of May there were 676,315 illegals apprehended there this year, over 144,000 in May alone. More than one million illegals are expected to cross our border with Mexico this year.
A growing number of them aren’t only from Central America. By June 5, at least 500 from southern and central Africa were apprehended. About 350 of them have been sent to San Antonio, Texas. Portland, Maine denied San Antonio’s request for it to take more of them.
Last week, a captured ISIS terrorist confessed to an ISIS plot to have English-speaking terrorists and “westerners” cross the border and attack U.S. financial targets. The “westerners” are citizens of European countries who have gone to Syria to fight for ISIS and are now returning to their homelands. ISIS wants them to get into the U.S. to continue their jihad.
The number of illegal aliens in the U.S. is, according to the Dems and their media cohort, around ten to eleven million. The better estimates say they are about double that in number.
The illegal aliens are welcomed to the Dems’ sanctuary cities where local cops are prohibited from cooperating with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, “ICE,” which often results in the release from local custody and escape of illegal aliens who are the subjects of deportation orders.
When the president declared a national emergency to overcome the Dems opposition to building his signature border wall, the Dems shouted about a constitutional crisis. They continue to refuse funding. In response, Trump ordered the Pentagon to reprogram some of its funding to build the wall. The Dems, despite the fact that walls have protected borders effectively for hundreds of years, deride the idea of a wall as a “medieval” remedy to a non-existent problem.
That “non-existent” problem surfaced again last week when it was reported that TSA was allowing illegal aliens to board airliners without proper identification. With one phone call, the president could stop that practice. He should make that call today and, in the same call, fire the head of TSA.
Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of the loudest anti-Semitic radicals in Congress, said last week that, “It’s un-American to criminalize immigrants for wanting to come to this country for a better life. This is why ICE needs to be defunded.” If a video of her statement exists it ought to be made into a Republican campaign ad next year.
The Democrats have worked themselves into a corner on abortion, illegal immigration, and gun control. They are chafing at the bit to impeach Trump and may yet try to do so. They don’t want to, and probably can’t, stifle their radicalism because it is a primary characteristic of their base.
The 2020 campaign may prove to be the most bitterly-fought in our history. The Dems, with the media’s help, will try to conceal their extremism in a fog of supposed moderation. They can’t be allowed to succeed."
The Media Press Dems for Impeachment Porn,spectator.org,David Catron,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-media-press-dems-for-impeachment-porn/,"The Media Press Dems for Impeachment Porn House Democrats dither while the press demands clicks and eyeballs. by Andrew Harrod
O n a sunny afternoon in 2010 a man stepped through the window of his San Francisco apartment onto a ledge, looked at the street below, and saw a cheering crowd taking cell phone videos while yelling: “Jump! Jump! Jump!” His death was collecting clicks on the web within seconds. This unsettling episode provides a grisly metaphorical glimpse at the motivation of the media as they continue to peddle impeachment. They know it would be political suicide for the Democrats because only a minority of voters supports removing the President, yet they crave the countless clicks and eyeballs the circus would inevitably produce.
But the Democratic leadership, their antipathy for the President notwithstanding, is loath to take the leap just to provide impeachment porn for the media. Consequently, even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi throws red meat to the far left by saying she wants to see Trump in prison, she knows the majority of House Democrats regard a mere impeachment inquiry as very risky. The number in favor of this course is about a fourth of their 235-member caucus. Thus, when Pelosi peers down at the ravening crowd of journalists yelling “jump,” she knows the media want that circus far more than do the Democrats themselves.
There is clearly an inverse correlation between the ever-increasing lust for impeachment among the media and the decidedly tepid enthusiasm among House Democrats. The latter are increasingly frustrated by the Fourth Estate’s monomania on the subject. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), for example, recently scolded CNN’s Chris Cuomo, “The media is consumed with the issue of impeachment.” Likewise, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) accused the media of “fanning the flames. They are well aware that public support for impeachment is dwindling, as a recent Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll confirms :
Sixty-eight percent of respondents said Democrats in Congress should accept Mueller’s finding that there was no criminal conspiracy and 65 percent said Democrats should accept Attorney General William Barr’s conclusion that the president did not obstruct justice. Sixty-three percent of respondents said the investigations into Trump are hurting the country.
The most deadly number for the Democrats is the small percentage of Independent voters who support impeachment. Only a third support removing Trump, and the Democrats can’t beat Trump in 2020 or retain their House majority if they alienate the rest of that crucial voting bloc. Yet the media are so obsessed with getting Trump, and deluded by their nostalgia for Watergate, that they continue to hawk impeachment. The New York Times has gone so far as to draft hypothetical articles of impeachment based on the Nixon and Clinton examples, despite the clear dissimilarities that characterize Trump’s case.
The editorial assistant who wrote this nonsense, Ian Philbrick, is evidently too young to remember that Presidents Nixon and Clinton faced multiple and unambiguous prosecutorial recommendations involving obstruction of justice. In fact, independent counsel Ken Starr produced a report that identified no fewer than 11 felony counts — including five involving obstruction. Special counsel Robert Mueller, on the other hand, was unable or unwilling to make even one such recommendation on Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice. Yet Philbrick blithely pronounces him guilty:
An impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump is far from guaranteed. And whether impeaching him would politically help or hurt Democrats remains an open question. But there is no question that by the standards for high crimes and misdemeanors applied to past presidents in living memory, Donald J. Trump has committed impeachable offenses.
In the Washington Post , meanwhile, Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe helpfully suggests that the House could impeach the President without referring him for trial in the Senate. The idea, though Professor Tribe tarts it up with dense legalese, would be to drag Trump through the mud in the House and then drop the matter after passing a resolution “expressly and formally proclaiming the president impeachable.” This would, despite Tribe’s claims to the contrary, be the equivalent of publicly indicting Trump without giving him the chance to clear himself in a trial. This would be both unjust and un-American.
Still, there seems to be a growing consensus in the media that the best course of action for the Democrats would be to use a lengthy impeachment inquiry to smear Trump without taking the charade to its logical end — call it “impeachment lite.” USA Today exhumed that paragon of virtue Harry Reid, and this is exactly the course of action he favors: “I think that that’s one reason an inquiry should go forward, to find out how the public reacts to this.” But, if Reid wants to see how the public will “react” to another expensive witch hunt, he should go to YouTube and replay a few video clips of Election Night 2016.
The voters know special counsel Robert Mueller’s job was to find evidence of wrongdoing on the President’s part. They know he spent nearly two years and $34 million only to find nothing — his 448-page recitation of irrelevancies and innuendo notwithstanding. Thus, the country has moved on. Do the crack “editors” and “journalists” of the legacy media actually believe House Democrats can remove Trump? Even House Intel chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) admits , “We’re not there yet.” More significantly, House Judiciary chair Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) confesses , “The American people right now do not support it.”
Thus, the goal of the media is obvious. There might be a few journalists who think an impeachment inquiry will turn public opinion against Trump the way it did in Nixon’s case, but this isn’t 1973-74. The legacy media no longer enjoy a monopoly on the news. But they have been going through ratings withdrawal since Attorney General Barr announced that Mueller came up dry, and they want the Democrats to make them well. The Fourth Estate needs a fix of eyeballs and clicks, and believe they can get them with impeachment porn. That’s why they’re standing on the street clamoring for Pelosi to jump."
Rafa’s Dozen,spectator.org,Roger Kaplan,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/rafas-dozen/,"by Andrew Harrod
S erving at 0-30 and down 0-40, the young challenger hits two aces and a perfect forehand winner on the next serve-plus-one to even the score. He goes on to hold; then the rout begins. In less time than it takes to take his position behind the service line, Rafael Nadal has raised his level and gone ballistic. He pummels the pretender — for this is the championship match of the tournament Nadal owns — with power serves and winners to every corner; breaks his next service easily; and, serving for the match, draws from his opponent a routine forehand that sails long, as if to say, you’re so beat up you are down to beating yourself.
Actually, there is little doubt Rafa Nadal, who won his 12 th French Open yesterday, emphatically reaffirming his monarchial ownership of the tennis Tour’s clay season, beats his opponents. He grinds them down. He out-forehands all comers, as he out-backhands them and out-volleys them. You might make the case he does not out-serve them in the sense that they not infrequently hit more aces than he, but the point of a service is not to hit an ace but to help you win the point. If you serve to set yourself up for a winner, and you do that more often than the other fellow hits aces, you have as useful a serve as he has — in fact, a better one.
Also, Nadal out-runs them and out-lasts them. He has a better sense of the movement of the ball on the clay court than his opponents, as he shows by the choices he makes to run backwards after a lob or to let a cross-court shot go (both of which he rarely does). Conversely, he hits the ball where they ain’t more than they do, with an insistence, a persistence, that is unheard of — at least it was not heard of until he showed up on the famous old center court of the Stade Roland-Garros 14 years ago to win his first trophy, starting a run that has yet to give any sign it will ever end. In short, he wants it.
That is the story of the French Open. But, in fact, there were some interesting details, subplots might be the better term, along the way. Dominic Thiem, the young pretender, won the second set, improving on last year’s final. And he played a fantastic semifinal against world no. 1 Novak Djokovic, battling over two days, due to rain delays, and five sets each one of which could have gone either way and in particular the last one.
If you can do that, you can beat the master of Manacor. In fact, Thiem — who is Austrian not Vietnamese, as Mr. Pleszczynski likes to think, notwithstanding his deep historical and tactical knowledge of tennis and his appreciation of its international, indeed cosmopolitan, qualities — Thiem, then, in fact did beat Nadal on clay, this year even — he beat him straight sets in the semifinal at Barcelona on a court called the pista Rafael Nadal and he went on to take that trophy, again in straights, against a young Russian his own age.
You can beat Novak Djokovic in Paris and you can beat Rafa Nadal in Barcelona, you can even beat Roger Federer at the final of the Indian Wells tournament in California, as Thiem did earlier this year. You can achieve all these astonishing, breathtaking feats of athletic prowess. Not always — to take only one example, the young phenom from Wroclaw, Hubert Hurkacz, in whose progress Mr. P. takes a keen interest, beat Thiem at the Miami Masters first round in straight sets — but sometimes. Often enough to become No. 4 in the world at 25.
But beat Rafael Nadal in Paris, on the avenue Gordon-Bennett (named for a legendary American press baron and bon-vivant)? Not yet. Maybe — Nadal is 33 — someday, as the king always the good sport, suggested in his trophy acceptance speech. But as likely not.
The cinderella story was that the best Australian player on the ladies’ side since Evonne Goolagong, Ashleigh Barty — who like her legendary predecessor proudly asserts her Aborigine identity — won the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (the equivalent to the Coupe des Mousquetaires that Nadal again won) at the end of a brilliant fortnight in which she played her game without fault or fail, and it is refreshingly classic.
Miss Barty covers the court with a guile, a tactical shrewdness, that harks back to the traditional ladies’ game. It requires the sure eye and the fleet feet that the divine Suzanne introduced in the postwar boom years of the sport. A superb athlete — she quit tennis to play pro-cricket for two years — she mixes her shots and goes for daring angles as well as deep winners to the lines. It is original in that she must combine this with an ability to meet the pace of the often bigger players she confronts — she is scarcely five and a half feet tall — who have followed the course of history in adopting a female version of the baseline power game.
The American she beat in the semis, New Jersey’s own Amanda Anisimova, is herself a big girl (this is no condescension, she is only 17 ) and she too made a powerful impression. Already two years ago, when she first appeared in the draw here, it was clear she has a big game, and an unusual set of athletic skills. Her backhand is a thing of beauty — and a permanent threat. But Miss Barty, at 23 — who beat another teen phenom, Czechia’s Marketa Vondrousova, in the finals — has wisdom and a certain mental determination that goes with championhood.
The mental side of tennis, yes: Nadal’s and Miss Barty’s are excellent example of why you know this matters, while you cannot quite define it, at least not in a way that would apply to everyone. Nadal’s mental energy makes him worry, and his worrying makes him fierce, and his fierceness makes him put everything he has into winning every game. In Ashleigh Barty one sees, certainly, a ferocious determination — can’t win without it — but you also see a kind of happiness, a serenity almost: she loves to be on the court. She is having a good time.
She wants to keep winning so she can have more court time. Maybe it comes down to that, with each his or her own mix of motivations and moods and mind-sets. Well, that’s tennis, folks, and for the scores if you want them, not to worry, you can look them up."
Bama Law School Does the Right Thing — Social Justice Warrior Stuffed,spectator.org,Larry Thornberry,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/bama-law-school-does-the-right-thing-social-justice-warrior-stuffed/,"Bama Law School Does the Right Thing — Social Justice Warrior Stuffed Roll Tide. Hugh Culverhouse Jr. (YouTube screenshot) Top Stories by Andrew Harrod I t’s rare but ever so refreshing when social justice warriors are told to shove it. It should happen more often. So hats off to the University of Alabama School of Law (its former and once again name) for returning a $21.5 million donation to Hugh Culverhouse Jr. after he had called on businesses to boycott the state and students to boycott the university and law school that he was bankrolling. The law school also ditched the name The Hugh J. Culverhouse Jr. School of Law and returned to the name it long held before the Culverhouse largess and his attack on the school and state. What led to this incoherent action on the part of Culverhouse, a Boca Raton real estate attorney, investor, and philanthropist, was the very strict anti-abortion law passed recently by the Alabama Legislature and signed into law by Alabama Governor Kay Ivey. Informed TAS readers know the strictest-in-the-nation law criminalizes almost all abortions and has about as much chance of surviving judicial review as Tuscaloosa has of enduring a blizzard on Independence Day. Hugh Jr. was not amused and, curiously, took it out on the law school for which he has been a mega-sugar-daddy, and which had about as much to do with passing this hopeless law as the Dallas Cowgirls did. “As a lawyer, I cannot countenance a law school, especially one which bears my name, teaching state law that I believe to be wrong both constitutionally and morally,” Culverhouse said in one of the biggest non-sequiturs of the new century. “No accomplished law professor would join a law school which teaches law that is proudly unconstitutional.” These statements are almost knee-buckling in their ignorance. You’d think a guy like Culverhouse, a law school graduate smart enough to have the resources to contribute $21.5 million, would also be smart enough to know that the law he so strenuously objects to was not passed by the Alabama law school but by the Alabama Legislature. Numerous of the law school’s professors have been quoted by numerous publications saying they don’t agree with the law and don’t believe it will stand. The Alabama law school is not teaching this law, and how curious of Culverhouse to think it is. I’ve always suspected the bar exam is too easy. This is further proof. It was just a matter of days between when Culverhouse started warning the world off of Alabama and its misguided (according to him) law school that the law school board of trustees met, made their decision, wired the money back to Culverhouse, and took his name off the law school. The only possible hedging came after the quick action when university officials said their action was not directly motivated by Culverhouse’s boycott statements. University spokeswoman Kellee Reinhart said the board acts as a “direct result of Mr. Culverhouse’s ongoing attempts to interfere in the operations of the Law School.” Apparently Culverhouse has a history of being a buttinsky. Not unheard of among lefty big donors. The university’s insistence that their action did not result from Culverhouse’s boycott statements is curious, and can be taken with a handful of salt big enough to give one high blood pressure. But the law school board’s quick and unequivocal action demonstrates the members’ courage of conviction. Courage at the cost of $21.5 million. At least Alabamians, regardless of their views of abortion and the recent almost-certainly-doomed law, cannot say of board members that, “We know what they are, and we know what their price is.” Roll Tide."
Did Narendra Modi Get Reelected Because of Islamophobia?,spectator.org,Saurabh Jha,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/did-narendra-modi-get-reelected-because-of-islamophobia/,"Did Narendra Modi Get Reelected Because of Islamophobia? Of the thousand reasons India’s prime minister won, 999 had nothing to do with religion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a public meeting at Sher-e-Kashmir cricket stadium, in Srinagar (Prime Minister’s Office/GODL-India/Wikimedia Commons) Top Stories by Jeffrey Lord
A s a child when I visited India, I rarely had jet lag. At the crack of dawn, I’d be awoken first by the azaan — the call for morning prayers from the mosque. I’d barely fall asleep again when the bells in the temple would ring to the aarti — the devotional Hindu prayer. The neighborhood mosque and temple were close enough for their acoustics to be inseparable. To the untrained ear of a child the two calls sounded the same but were vastly oppositional. The azaan , translated, means there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet. The aarti is a paean to Lord Vishnu, the mighty Lord of the Universe.
By sunrise in most parts of India the gods of Hindus and Muslims have laid their respective claim to the celestial White House. On Earth, things seemed more cooperative. The azaan signaled that it was time for the aarti. The muezzin would wake the priest up with “Allah ho Akbar” (Allah is great) to remind him to give Lord Vishnu the same deference. By agreement, the muezzin and the priest made sure their calls for prayer did not overlap. Only years later did I realize the significance of this acoustic juxtaposition. The first lesson that India teaches you about coexistence is that for people to truly get along they must be their religious selves.
My first memory of religious expression was a procession of men beating their chest in the streets. I thought it was a funeral. Men looked angry but were crying and some had blood dripping from their bared chest. It was Muharram , the death anniversary of Hussein Ali, grandson of Prophet Muhammad. I recall how my grandmother, a Hindu who expressed her Hinduism in symbolic carnates, casually went about her business as if nothing was happening. Many Indians of every faith wear their religion on their sleeves, and few think the worse of anyone because of it.
If the left-leaning media is to be believed, India is hurtling towards dark ages and her days of religious tolerance are over since Narendra Modi, the leader of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), a party which unabashedly flaunts Hinduism, was reelected by a landslide. An editorial in the Guardian expressed disappointment in the election of Modi. Soon after the election results were announced notable Indian writer, Pankaj Mishra, wrote in the New York Times that Modi had “seduced India with hate.” Some believe that Indian Muslims are living in fear. Just like many believed that Trump’s victory signified rise of prejudice and white supremacy, so many feel that Modi won because he inspired prejudice, specifically hatred of Muslims in Hindus. Is this media-inspired moral panic or is there some truth?
Part of the problem in judging the significance of Modi’s return is the temptation in divorcing the present from the arc of history. If you magnify the present, there truly is much to be concerned about. Misinformation, particularly about the scientific achievements of Hindus five thousand years ago, is on the rise. Cows have assumed a special status in society and, for now, are off the menu. Many Muslims have been bullied by cow-vigilantes — self-appointed Hindu thugs charged with keeping cows from the frying pan. Magnified, India is a fallen star whose dimming light casts a shadow of despondence over a long horizon of despair.
But it is constellations not stars which tell stories. To understand India’s constellation, we must return to 1947, when the British Raj ended, and the subcontinent was divided into India and East and West Pakistan. India chose to remain secular, rather than base its national constitution on Hinduism, even though Hindus comprised the vast majority. Leaders of the Congress Party, which had inherited India, pleaded with the frightened Muslims not to leave. Many Muslims stayed back. India was reshuffled with a new aspect ratio rather than amputated.
The Congress Party felt morally responsible for reassuring Indian Muslims that their decision to remain in India was correct. They were given concessions, though historians would argue that they were political expedients, not concessions. For example, Muslims were granted their own civil law in marriages. There is one law for Hindu women and another law for Muslim women.
The line between reassurance of Muslims, a noble endeavor, and bringing religion into politics, an ignoble consequence, is thin. By 1960, Congress Party, ostensibly secular, crossed that line. The Party under Jawaharlal Nehru joined forces with the Muslim League to oust the democratically elected Communist Party in Kerala — India’s most literate state. Feroze Gandhi, Nehru’s son-in-law, wasn’t pleased with the political alliance his father-in-law — India’s first prime minister (PM) — and his wife, Indira, had chosen. Feroze warned that an alliance with an overtly religious party was an uncomfortable precedence for India’s secular politics. Feroze and Nehru did not get along. Though both were idealistic, Feroze was more principled and Nehru more pragmatic.
The Congress Party wagered that Muslims voted en bloc. Their calculation made two assumptions. The first that Muslims were united — united by theism and a continual fear of the Hindu majority. The second that religious leaders could tell Muslims who to vote for. The Congress began mixing religion with politics.
Before the elections in 1980, Indira Gandhi met Shahi Imam Bukhari , the highest authority of the Jama Masjid — India’s most important mosque, asking for his support. Bukhari agreed, but had terms of his own. Bukhari then advised millions of Muslims to vote for Indira Gandhi. Imagine if the Archbishop of Canterbury had instructed the Protestants of Northern Ireland to vote for Mrs. Thatcher. Whether or not the Protestants paid attention, the net effect of mixing religion so explicitly in politics, would have been even greater resentment from the Catholics towards Protestants.
By projecting a one-size-fits-all psephology on all Muslims, politicians not only devalued their individuality but discouraged people from seeking their individualism. The “Muslim” badge became stuck to their identity by superglue. An example — innocuous but instructive. A young man running for local elections came to my grandparents’ house to canvass for support. He was a friend of the family. My grandmother loved him. When he left, my grandmother, fiercely Hindu, said — “what a nice Mussalman (Muslim). He even supports India when India plays Pakistan in cricket.”
The idea that Muslims are a monolith, an idea still extant, is deeply offensive, unapologetically patronizing, and demonstrably false. Nevertheless, the two communities were different in one regard. After independence the Hindus and Muslims in India were joined by destiny but separated by counterfactuals — different “what ifs”? To many Hindus, for India to be logical, the two-nation theory had to be rejected, which meant Pakistan had to be illogical, the partition had to be a mistake — a regret, at best.
Muslims, understandably, saw Pakistan differently. Just as the Jews who aren’t domiciled in Israel, who live in the U.S. for example, still view Israel with reverence, Muslims in India looked to Pakistan with affection and reverence. A homeland that was never home is still a homeland. But unlike the U.S. and Israel, who are allies, India and Pakistan were perpetually at war with each other. How the two communities viewed Pakistan became a source of tension between them.
Actually, it wasn’t the wars which were the problem. It was cricket. For most of post-independence, Pakistan was undeniably the better team. India would frequently get walloped, and walloped badly, in both the short and long versions of the game by Pakistan. Hindus wondered if Indian Muslims supported Pakistan. The shame of losing to Pakistan turned into resentment for Muslims. The loyalty of Indian Muslims towards India was questioned.
Imran Khan, the fiery Pakistani bowler who was the nemesis of Indian batsmen, once declared, apparently in jest , that the Kashmir dispute, the festering land dispute between India and Pakistan, should be settled over a test series. Pakistan beat India 4-0 in that series. Cricket was salt to the wounds of the partition.
India is a complex country with complex emotions. Even as Hindus questioned the loyalty of Muslims, they flocked to cinema to watch Muslims. In the arts the Muslims flourished. Several successful actors, playwrights and singers were Muslims. Bollywood — India’s music and film industry — is fiercely agnostic — the type of amorality which comes when money is the only arbiter of judgment. For a while Bollywood was dominated by the Khans —the trio of Shahrukh, Aamir, and Salman, particularly Shahrukh, who was also known as “King Khan.” The Khans drew, predominantly Hindu, crowds to the cinema, making Bollywood rich through their fans.
Can the popularity of the Khans be extrapolated to broader Hindu sentiments about Muslims? Is it really possible for Muslims to be so successful in movies if Hindus are inherently prejudiced against them? The master logician would scoff at my fallacious dichotomy. But wisdom would not discount the broader significance of the popularity of the Khans, which indicates that prejudice, even if it exists, can be overcome.
Commerce guts prejudice more effectively than entertainment. When I was getting married in India, I needed a special suit tailor made for my physique. My physique isn’t exceptional but needs exceptional attention to detail. The choice wasn’t any tailor, but any Muslim tailor. Muslims had a reputation for attention to detail. Muslim tailors would thrive during colorful Hindu weddings and Hindu-owned grocery stores would profit during Ramadan. Hindu-Muslim commerce most succeeded when both sides clung to their traditions.
Indian Muslims were far from pampered. They had the highest rates of poverty. They lived in closed spaces — partly because of poverty. The politicians, content by their “Muslims are a monolith” strategy, never bothered improving their economic condition. Instead they indulged the demands of the vocal few whose decibels were generalized to the silent many.
In 1988, Salman Rushdie’s controversial Satanic Verses, for which he received a fatwa from Ayatollah Khomeini, was immediately banned in India . Was banning the book the highest priority for the government? At that time, Muslim women, like Hindu women, in rural Bihar, one of India’s poorest and least developed states, still defecated in open spaces, often behind the bushes, risking being assaulted by men or being bitten by poisonous snakes. Defecating in the open is one of the most pernicious problems facing women in rural India. It’s dangerous. It challenges the modesty of a culture in which immodesty is eschewed. That it was allowed to go on for so long is a testament not only to Indian politics, but those charged with reporting its warts.
Modi promised a sanitation drive and has delivered — 80 million toilets have been built in India, and many millions still need to be built. One of the untold stories of this election are the Muslim women who voted for Modi. The construction of toilets seems to be one reason for Modi’s popularity in this constituency.
There’s a certain distance from the truth one inevitably acquires when making general statements of a country as complex as India. I don’t blame Pankaj Mishra, or the Guardian or New York Times , for missing the significance of toilets for Muslim women in rural India. Like me, I suspect Mishra does not have to relieve himself in the bushes. And I would hazard a guess that if we had to go out in the sweltering heat or the dark night to defecate in the open, our wish list from India’s PM might change — banning inflammatory books, or reducing fake scientific news, might assume less pertinence. A toilet at hand is worth two in the bush.
With identity politics, politicians felt they didn’t have to do anything material for disadvantaged communities. Policies which uplift all communities — Hindus and Muslims, alike — don’t have the same religious-specificity as banning blasphemous books. But economic growth disproportionately helps Muslims precisely because they’re disproportionately poor. Modi’s pro-growth policies have brought many Muslims out of poverty.
Modi’s mandate in this elections shows that Indians are tired of being divided. They’re signaling to their politicians that local, grievance-based, identity politics, doesn’t work anymore. They’re tired of being played against each other. And they’re tired of a media which seems to gallantly miss the point, their point. The Congress Party, led by Feroze Gandhi’s grandson, Rahul Gandhi, has been slow to understand the national mood. But Modi understands the proletariat and promises to address problems which transcend India’s multiple divisions — sanitation, healthcare, roads, corruption, national security. Nationalism has terrible connotations but nationalism, for many Indians, simply means issues which affect them all.
After the election, I received a text from an Indian American physician, a Hindu, who was worried that Hindus in India were descending into Taliban-style theocracy. I, too, had concerns but I wasn’t as concerned as he was and couldn’t see the sky falling imminently. Our conversation rapidly deteriorated. I accused him of moral panic and silly hyperbole. He accused me of “normalizing the BJP” and compared my behavior with those who ignored the Nazis. The conversation got sillier — the sort you see in the comments on YouTube. He then sent me a video of a Muslim man being beaten by Hindu thugs. The video was distressing and I felt bad. Then I remembered India’s past. I still felt bad but felt proud, too, at how far India had come.
In 1980, violence erupted between Hindus and Muslims in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, because a pig had entered a Muslim colony. A conservative estimate places the death toll at 400. In 1987, Hindus and Muslims fought each other in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, after the disputed Babri Mosque was reopened for worship. In 1989, over a thousand people, mostly Muslims, died in Hindu-Muslim violence in Bhagalpur, Bihar, after false rumors that Muslims had killed a dozen Hindu students. I could go on and on. This is just a glimpse of the episodic communal violence in India.
The human death toll of the riots aside, riots rip the psyche of the region and destroy its economy for generations. Only a simmering mistrust between communities remains. During Modi’s first term, India recorded the fewest Hindu-Muslim riots. The significance of the absence of riots can’t be understated. Riots should be a zero event. If India in the 1980s gets a grade F for Hindu-Muslim relationship, then the absence of riots, notwithstanding the rise of the cow vigilantes, surely gives India today a C-. India has a long way to go before it can get a B+. But how far India still has to go should not diminish how far India has come.
The popular narrative of Modi’s victory in the media, that he won because Hindus have become more fanatical, is very different from the realities in India. Of a thousand reasons people voted for Modi, 999 have nothing to do with religion. To believe that the Hindu votes for Modi were actuated by a chronic resentment of Muslims renders upon Hindus the same uncharitable assumption of uniformity which is still rendered upon Muslims. The assumption of tribalism is deeply offensive.

Republicans Aren’t Funny,spectator.org,Mark Bauerlein,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/republicans-arent-funny/,"by Evan Maguire
I n recent months, conservative intellectuals in D.C. and elsewhere have gathered to discuss where conservatism stands in the Age of Trump and where it will be after he leaves office. (See here , here , and here for examples.) As those deliberations evolve and spill into Republican Party affairs, the leaders better keep one thing in mind: conservatism, now and then, has to be fun, and sometimes funny, too. William F. Buckley made it fun 54 years ago in a free-wheeling run for the mayoralty of New York, his wit dispelling the despair conservatives felt after Barry Goldwater was thrashed by LBJ in ’64. (Buckley titled his platform statement, “ Mayor, Anyone? ”). Ronald Reagan certainly made people laugh, often at his opponents’ expense: “Republicans celebrate the 4 th of July; Democrats celebrate April 15 th .” Laughter helped Arnold Schwarzenegger win California (“Don’t be economic girly-men!”) and, of course, Donald Trump the White House, including jokes about himself . (“I never had alcohol, for whatever reason. Can you imagine if I had? What a mess I would be. I would be the world’s worst.”)
It’s a sound liberals hate to hear. They know how important comedy is to public opinion, and they remember that many people preferred George W. Bush to the wooden Al Gore because he’s the one they’d have liked to join for a beer. Besides, they believe, comedy rightly belongs to the left, from Lenny Bruce and Laugh-In to The Daily Show and Tina Fey doing Sarah Palin. If conservatives cultivate their own comedians and each Republican develops a comic style of his own, 2020 and beyond look less dim than they did last November after the midterms. Democrats have to stop them: there is no such thing as conservative humor!
“How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?”
“I don’t know, how many?”
“That’s not funny.”
No, the liberal must say, that’s not funny one bit. It’s offensive.
So is the bake sale that conservative students mounted at University of Washington, which charged Asians $1.50, whites $1.00, African Americans and Hispanics $0.50, and Native Americans nothing for each item. The stunt was a brazen parody prompted by a bill in the state legislature that reinstated affirmative action (voters had outlawed preferential treatment in 1998). University President Cauce, who has exquisitely correct progressive views , wasn’t amused by the kids. She upheld the right to free speech, but issued a sententious letter decrying the “crudity, offensiveness and sheer outrageousness of the message.”
And when Milo Yiannapoulos donned blond wig and glasses, sat before the camera , and called himself “Dr. Christine Blazing Faggot,” announcing, “You might know me from… lying to the Senate,” liberal observers assumed that anyone with a scrap of sympathy for survivors would consider it downright repugnant. That kind of malice deserves to be booted off of social media, as happened to Milo last month, they insist. Reporting on the affair , the Atlantic Monthly classified him as a “far-right extremist” who was banned by Facebook because he violated “policies against dangerous individuals and organizations” They didn’t grant him an ounce of merriment.
President Trump isn’t funny, either, say the 53 percent of Americans who disapprove of his job performance. At the signing of the Executive Order threatening colleges with the loss of research funds if they fail to safeguard free speech, he regretted the catastrophe of student debt, but paused and told us not to get the wrong idea. “I’ve always been very good with loans,” he declared with a naughty smile. “I love loans. I lu-u-u-v other people’s money.” All of us in the audience laughed, yes, but, really, it wasn’t funny, not to the reporters in the back, not at all.
President Obama, on the other hand, told a lot of jokes and he appreciated good comedy. As Politico reported in 2015, “Obama, aides took unusual steps to cultivate ‘Daily Show’ comic,” inviting Jon Stewart to the White House for discussion at critical times. President Obama did an hour with comedian Mark Maron on his podcast show “WTF,” too, and when it came time to defend Obamacare, he sat down for a conversation with comedian Zach Galifianakis that was, to be sure, appealingly droll, the YouTube video of it collecting nearly 26 million views. The Washington Post actually labeled him “Barack Obama, the first alt-comedy president.”
Liberals and Democrats can enjoy that loose way of parleying; conservatives and Republicans can’t. We have an imbalance of laughter, which the left has created as part of its longstanding culture war tactics. What the right thinks is comical the left labels offensive, the left makes fun of its adversaries at will. Joe Biden was free to warn voters in a wry, folksy way during the 2012 campaign about Republicans reviving slavery, telling a half-black audience in Virginia, “They’re going to put y’all back in chains.” Hillary Clinton was sure that her “basket of deplorables” remark would count as a witticism, which did indeed get a laugh from the original audience (listen to it here ).
So did Stephen Colbert when he characterized Donald Trump’s mouth as Vladimir Putin’s “cock-holster”; and Michelle Wolf , too, who in her speech at the Correspondents’ Dinner wondered what to call Sarah Sanders, who was sitting nearby: “Like, what’s Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women?”; and Samantha Bee as well, who termed Ivanka Trump a “feckless c–t,” and brought squeals of glee from the crowd.
None of those comics lost their platforms. Conservatives protested, a few liberals took some temporary distance from the speaker, the clip circulated widely, and it all passed over. Colbert continues his sarcasm every weeknight, and Samantha Bee still has 514,000 followers on Twitter. Milo has none — Twitter removed him three years ago. She’s funny, he’s not.
Nor is Paul Joseph Watson, another proclaimed hate-monger banned from Facebook and Instagram. His videos taunt and flout the sacred cows of “wokeness” and he has 1.6 million YouTube subscribers, but he gets no credit for wit. He created the “ Creepy Uncle Joe ” video back in November 2017, which showed the former-vice president getting too touchy-feely with girls, inserting “COMPLETELY NORMAL” at telling moments and used camera slowdowns and close-ups to sensationalize Biden’s clinginess. The video has logged 2.4 million views and just as many guffaws, but the media judge such creations despicable, not a mode of Juvenalian satire as a Salon article did in justifying Jon Stewart’s anti-Republican obscenities.
Do Republican politicians and conservative commentators still not get it? Are they still unaware that this is all a set-up, conservatives-as-stunted and liberals-as-hip? As with all things cultural, the left is way ahead of the right on this matter. The censors who ousted Milo and PJW certainly understand. The more they paint those coarse performers unfunny and odious, the less their performances will damage the progressive brand. So will the words of those conservatives who aren’t offensive and belligerent but are, liberals say, un-funny in a different way: uptight, repressed, literal-minded, and straight-laced. In either case, liberals reserve the joys of comedy for themselves. And the arrows of comedy, too.
For example: Fifty years ago, when anti-War protesters marched on the Pentagon, one group led by Allen Ginsberg and Abbie Hoffman, both of them experienced political performance artists, set about holding hands and chanting pagan prayers while The Fugs played in an effort to levitate the building — yes, to raise it three feet in the air (they actually secured a permit to do so). It was a ceremonial theater of the absurd whose stagy pointlessness had a satiric purpose: to treat the Pentagon itself as a site of absurdity. People normally assumed that inside the building were shrewd men devising plans of high geopolitical seriousness, but with these goofy protesters outside the image of noble patriotism dimmed. That was the point, to discredit the military, and there were no comics in 1967 to fight back. John Wayne’s patriotic 1968 film The Green Berets didn’t have a lot of irony.
Cheap or not, satire is a weapon, and it’s one that Democrats monopolize. They want to pigeon-hole Republicans as Puritanical Pat Robertson or Evil Dick Cheney, repressively humorless or villainously humorless. They have exercised that caricature secure in the expectation that Republicans won’t turn it upon them. When Whoopi Goldberg spoke at a fundraiser in 2004 for John Kerry and John Edwards (both of them were in the audience), she said this about the sitting president: “We should keep Bush where he belongs” — here she paused and pointed at her genitals — “not in the White House.” That didn’t hurt her career at all, even though the Kerry campaign asked to see her remarks in advance and she refused. Goldberg described her response to that request: “I Xeroxed my behind and I folded it up in an envelope and I sent it back with a big kiss mark on it because we’re Democrats — we’re not afraid to laugh.”
Establishment Republicans have learned to play along. They are most definitely afraid to laugh. They seem to be in a competition of earnestness. Did John Kasich tell a joke in 2016 and make it work? Did Jeb Bush ever evoke a belly laugh? How much of Jeff Flake’s sincerity did we have to take? One might assume that their oh-so-concerned aura stems from an inner conviction, or from their readiness to assume the grave duties of leadership. In truth, they are under the sway of a liberal censure that strikes whenever they veer into a politically-incorrect mode. They play this brand of sobriety because they fear the stigma liberals have attached to them: “Republicans don’t care about poor people, sick people, minorities, women, immigrants…” They must show that they care, that they feel their pain, which means that they must eliminate all sardonic edges from their words and visages. This is, of course, to strip them of a crucial firearm in the field of political battle. Saul Alinsky, a brilliant tactician, would approve.
Americans who lean right have been begging for their representatives to deride PC norms for a long time. People want to laugh; it brings relief as the straitjacket of liberal decorum is loosened. But Establishment Republicans won’t do it. Leftwing scolds from Hollywood to the Washington Post to Silicon Valley have them cowed. Remember the attack ad from 2012 showing a Paul Ryan lookalike wheeling grandma off the cliff? It was so bizarrely melodramatic that it really was kind of funny. Ryan’s standard rejoinder to such lampoons, though, was the wholly unfunny Boy Scout persona, a hapless claim of innocence that was no defense against liberal raillery. Recall, too, the story of Mitt Romney many years before sticking his dog on the roof of the family car for a 12-hour vacation ride, which evoked hundreds of jokes during the campaign including one by President Obama himself at the 2012 Correspondents’ Dinner. Romney’s answer when asked by Diane Sawyer if he would do it again wasn’t, “Heck, yes! — that dog was never happier than when he had the wind in his face — I could never take him out in the car without him sticking his head out the window and begging me to drive faster, faster!” No, he said , instead, “Certainly not with the attention it’s received.”
This is the actual context for the indignation provoked by the new comics of the right: Milo, PJW, Mark Dice , … and Donald Trump himself (“Only Rosie O’Donnell!”). From the very beginning of the campaign, Trump realized that Romney/Ryan’s brand of solemnity doesn’t overcome liberal mockery, especially when that solemnity issues from the mouths of DC politicians who have absolutely no claim to victim status. Romney-Ryan lost, Trump won, but Establishment Republicans haven’t learned the lesson. They didn’t register how much fun people had at Trump’s rallies, or how much his jibes (“fake news,” “Pocahontas”) countered the jibes they’d endured for so long (“Teabaggers,” “wingnuts,”…). Trump’s success in spite of all the times the media declared him done — for instance, after Trump in South Carolina called the Iraq invasion a disaster — proved that a significant voting bloc was waiting to be inspired by a leader who could make them laugh. Ordinary citizens felt the bliss of candor when Candidate Trump groaned in 2015, “I am so tired of this politically-correct crap!”
But Republicans still wince at his sallies. They still want to display how respectable and civil they are. Mitt Romney stated in 2012 that the Obama campaign aimed “to minimize me as an individual, to make me a bad person, an unacceptable person,” and yet, Senator Romney just voted against a judicial nominee because the nominee “made particularly disparaging comments about President Obama” while the man was running for office in 2011.
We are in an arms race of political banter. Without the weapons of parody, jest, and artful invective, conservatives can’t win and liberals know it. That’s why they cast conservative humor as offensive, for instance, Diamond and Silk as “unsafe to the community” (Mark Zuckerberg later called that judgment an error). And that’s why President Trump came to the defense of right-wing figures banned from Facebook. He knows the value of raillery, and he recognizes the duplicitous game the left has been playing and winning, propriety-for-thee and edginess-for-me. Republican leaders should treat these sometimes racy but highly popular political satirists in the same way President Obama treated Jon Stewart. The impact of Saturday Night Live and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on the polls should not be underestimated (Colbert brings in four million viewers per night). Republicans rightly abhor the bad language of Milo et al., but wrongly shun them for that reason. Those bawdy wits are, in fact, the best force against the heated social justice warriors flocking to AOC. If Hillary Clinton can share a stage one week before the election with Jay-Z, whose songs lyrics include
You wanna know what’s more important than throwin’ away money at a strip club? Credit You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it…
and NBC reports on the event by noting only how Ms. Clinton is able to bring out “star power” for her final push, then Republicans should be able to sit down with conservative YouTube stars and ask why so many young Americans love them. If they don’t, they surrender the entire territory of edginess so much prized by the young to the left. Last November, the youth vote went 2-to-1 for Democrats.
Besides, liberals decry President Trump’s un-presidential vulgarity not because of their high-minded image of the presidency. They do it because he has stolen some of their weaponry. Democrats have hemmed Republicans in with politically-correct etiquette while maintaining a squad of comic culture warriors eager to jeer and demean conservatives the moment they wield comedy as political critique. Trump won’t cooperate. He has taken the antic advantage away from the left, the first national Republican figure to do so in a long time, and liberals hate him for that. Oh, they make jokes about him, but the jokes they come up with aren’t very clever and they’re so predictable that they aren’t funny, either. They really aren’t."
"The Questionable Fun of Yelling, Boo, Hiss!",spectator.org,William Murchison,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-questionable-fun-of-yelling-boo-hiss/,"The Questionable Fun of Yelling, Boo, Hiss! About Chick-fil-A’s setbacks in San Antonio. by Evan Maguire
N ow hear this, now hear this: Anti-Chick-fil-A San Antonio mayor narrowly reelected this past weekend over Pro-Chick-fil-A candidate! Proving…
Come on, my eyelids are drooping. The lack of an answer proves what? That the Era of the Non-Issue Issue has yet a ways to run? Yes, that may be it. Alas.
I can’t believe I’m writing about a fast food franchise. It’s come to that. In the eyes of my progressive friends, some of them, the dividing line between righteousness and evil passes through the drive-thru window. We’re reduced to a love of ideological bickering over what a free-born American does with his hard-earned money, I guess. And therefore, in a democratic republic launched by the likes of Hamilton, Madison, and Jefferson, informed debate turns to nattering and accusation. Civic commitment means personal readiness to yell: “You’re a rotten person — boo, hiss!” The founders hoped for much more. Some are surely spinning in their graves.
San Antonio’s city council was both praised and blasted a couple of months ago due to banning Chick-fil-A service at the local airport. A kick in the tail feathers, this, to a nationwide fast food chain distinguished by its customer service (flowers on the table, avoidance of “No problem“ as a server response) along with high culinary quality; a chain faulted, nevertheless, for contributing money to operations like the Salvation Army (!) that some progressives blame for impeding the LGBTQ agenda.
Proving what, I say again? Mostly that the historic terms of civic virtue require refurbishing. While there’s time. Before we forget entirely that the terms of our life together as a people relate theoretically to the furtherance of virtuous freedom and a spirit of general happiness. “To secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” Wasn’t that the Constitution’s challenge to us? We’ve wandered; which isn’t the fault of Hillary voters specifically or of Trumpians specifically.
The product boycott as symbol of moral virtue? Pass the smelling salts. What about, alternatively, the production of useful civic ideas? Any halfwit, such as the author of these present lines, can boycott. The present author, perversely, declines to pay a pfennig or a slot machine slug for Ben and Jerry’s bolshevik ice cream. What’s that got to do with anything, other than the working off of some undoubtedly narrow antagonisms?
What the author would really prefer is for those filthy-rich bolshies up in Sandersland to work with the U. S. Chamber and the Republican Study Committee on ways of keeping entitlement excesses from taking us down as a prosperous nation. Wouldn’t that make a lot more sense than treading underfoot a scoop of Ben & Jerry’s? I admit it.
Or what about a nationwide effort really, truly to improve educational opportunity in economically and sociologically depressed communities? What about arguing and preaching and propagandizing in behalf of a return to some lost understanding of abortion and cohabitation as sociologically inferior (and dangerous) substitutes for good old solid, life-creating, life-affirming marriage?
The narrowing of the American mind to the production of boycott slogans, and the verbal tarring and feathering of political opponents, has taken place under the gaze of a generation once called “the brightest” ever. Brightest, my hind foot, if all this is the best we have to show for 40 years of application to the task of overhauling a nation more in need of foundational repairs than of reinvention.
Reinvention — more government control, less freedom to spend or donate your money without moral reprobation — looks like the chief aim of the Sanders-Warren-O’Rourke set: whose creative juices, channeled toward restoration work, would count for a bunch more than they do now.
Not that I anticipate such a happy outcome. Slogans, boycotts, and epithets fall more readily from the assembly line than do rational policy proposals. And are so much more cheap fun. The joy that must come from saying, “Don’t you dare eat that chikin!” I can’t see it, but I’ll bet you the reelected mayor of San Antonio can — so there!

T his toast was offered at the Lincoln Day Dinner on May 24, 2019 in Nassau County, Florida.
I rise, Mr. Chairman, to honor a man who reminded us recently what it means to be a good citizen of the free society.
Three weeks ago last Monday, a class of sixty students convened at UNC Charlotte. Shortly after the class began, one of the students, Trystan Terrell, stood up, pulled out a gun, and began shooting his classmates. Fifty-eight of the students did what they’d been told to do. They ran. They tried to hide. They dove under tables. They crowded into a closet.
One of the students, Riley Howell, did not do what he’d been told to do. He turned and charged Tristan Terrell. As he closed on the gunman, Riley was hit twice. A third bullet, fired at point-blank range, took him down. Riley fell and bled out on the classroom floor. But not before pinning the gunman long enough for police to arrive and make the arrest.
Two students were killed that day. Four others were wounded. Many more survived.
Within the hour, the press swarmed the school. The questions about Riley seemed perfunctory. He was, after all, white, male, strong, athletic — a virtual lab specimen of what the fashionable media call toxic masculinity.
The questions about Tristan were wide-ranging. Had he grown up in a stable family? Had he been abused as a child? Did he find UNC Charlotte a cold and unwelcoming place? How had he obtained the weapon? Was it legal? And most predictably of all, what new gun controls might have prevented him from shooting his classmates?
These were mildly interesting questions, even if all of them were couched in the idiom of the activist Left. But they were not the questions anybody in this room was asking that day.
The men in this room — young men and old alike — were asking themselves this question: In my own moment of crisis, would I have done what Riley did? Would I have given my life that others might live?
We all know the answer to that question. Probably not. Mountains of data tell us that, in those terrifying moments, most people do what they’ve been told to do. Most people do what every human instinct screams at them to do. They will run and they will try to hide. There’s no disgrace in that.
But every man likes to think he would have done what Riley did. And every man fears that he would not have done what Riley did.
If I may contradict the New York Times, women look at things differently. Riley was blessed to have good women in his life. A steady girlfriend. Younger sisters. A proud mom. A doting grandmother. We know what they wanted, on that day and every other day. They wanted Riley to take care of himself and come home safely. They may even have told him so when they kissed him goodbye that morning.
Riley’s mom, Natalie, told the local newspaper that she was devastated by the news from Charlotte. She had hoped that Riley might run. That he might get lucky. That he might be able to save himself. But was she surprised at what he had done? Was she surprised that he had put the safety of his friends before his own? No, not really. She had raised him from a small boy to be a good man. A good citizen of the free society. No, she said, she was not surprised. She knew his heart as well as he did.
For Natalie Howell, the pain is intense. It will last for a long time. But there’s reason to hope that her pride will last even longer.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to Riley Howell.

Misleading While Muslim,spectator.org,Andrew Harrod,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/misleading-while-muslim/,"by Evan Maguire
A t a recent appearance in Washington, D.C., leading Muslim-American educator Debbie Almontaser hawked her new book , Leading While Muslim: The Experiences of American Muslim Principals After 9/11 . The book grew out of her own personal experiences as the founding principal of the long-troubled Khalil Gibran International Academy (KGIA), a New York City public high school with a focus on Arabic instruction.
In 2007, Almontaser resigned from KGIA after praising a t-shirt bearing the phrase “Intifada NYC” — an apparent reference to violence against Jews in Israel and the Palestinian territories. “Intifada,” Almontaser insisted, “basically means ‘shaking off. ’” Almontaser argued that although the word was “developing a negative connotation due to the uprising in the Palestinian-Israeli areas,” it was nonetheless “an opportunity for girls to express that they are part of New York City society” and are “shaking off oppression.” Her comments sparked storms of protest from the New York Post , the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and local parents.
The group that produced the t-shirt, Arab Women Active in the Arts and Media ( AWAAM ), shared office space with the Saba Organization of American Yemenis, of which Almontaser was a board member and spokesperson. AWAAM also shared officials with Al-Awda, an anti-Israel organization that the ADL has accused of openly supporting terrorism and violent anti-Semitism.
Following her resignation from KGIA in 2007, in the wake of immense public pressure, Almontaser only developed her reputation for radicalism further. In 2008, she worked with the Council on American-Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) to oppose the NYPD’s counter-terrorism efforts. At the time, CAIR had just been named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted coconspirator in a prominent terror financing case, leading the FBI to cut off all contact with the organization.
Since then, Almontaser has become a prominent activist in New York City, where she helped organize a 2017 protest against President Donald Trump’s temporary travel restrictions. That protest, during which Yemeni-Americans closed their bodegas, gave rise to the Yemeni American Merchants Association (YAMA), where she now serves as board secretary. Most recently, YAMA launched a bodega boycott of the Post after it published a sensational cover denouncing Representative Ilhan Omar for remarks trivializing the 9/11 attacks.
Despite her scandalous behavior while at KGIA, Almontaser is still mixing Islamist activism and educational issues. She appeared on April 16 at the American Federation of Teachers’ (AFT) Albert Shanker Institute , where AFT President Randi Weingarten moderated a discussion before an audience of about 35. The next day Almontaser addressed about 25 listeners at Georgetown University’s Saudi-established Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU). ACMCU director Jonathan Brown moderated. (In February 2017, Brown came under fire for a speech defending sex slavery, in which he claimed that “the Sharia understanding of slavery” is “not comparable at all” to America’s past slavery.)
Almontaser’s message is one of victimhood. At the Albert Shanker Institute, she reiterated the falsehood that an “Islamophobia industry” has “so much funding” to attack people like her. She passed off KGIA as a high school “to develop global citizens to compete for international careers,” that struggled against an “astonishing” onslaught of demands about the teaching of issues such as Israel.
Almontaser further condemned post-9/11 America as a “police state,” which enacts tyranny through law enforcement issues, such as stricter immigration enforcement. Her moderator, Randi Weingarten, hyperbolically responded that current “dehumanizing” of Muslims is “not terribly dissimilar to the way in which Jews were treated by Hitler.”
Almontaser compared her “Intifada NYC” t-shirt imbroglio with Representative Ilhan Omar ’s ongoing controversies. Almontaser described Omar’s critics “taking words out of context and portraying them in a way to make her anti-American.”
In 2007, Almontaser’s host, the very same Weingarten, had publicly reproached Almontaser for her praise of the intifada t-shirt. However, at AFT, Weingarten appeared to regret her stand against Almontaser’s extremism, now lamenting that people had “used my words against Debbie.” She now accepted without demurral Almontaser’s condemnation of the Post , which she stated was “making money from racism and bigotry” through criticism of her and the scandal-ridden Omar. The audience applauded Almontaser’s role in the bodega boycott.
The following day at ACMCU, Almontaser stated that the Islamic “way of life” cannot include any violent understandings such as those of Al Qaeda, an assertion she has often made in the past. “The so-called radicals,” she said, “I personally don’t see them as Muslims,” but rather as a “fringe minority within the 1.7 billion Muslims” that “has a political agenda that has nothing to do with Islam.” She added: “Anyone who takes the life of one person is like taking the life of humanity.”
Yet, in sharp contrast to her statements at ACMCU, she readily imposes her own political agendas on American Islam. One subject in her writing, a Harvard-educated Pakistani-American named Aiman , “didn’t want to have anything to do with Islam anymore” because he thought American Muslim leaders have offered too lenient a response to jihadism. “He believed that Muslim clerics and leaders in the United States and elsewhere are complacent, that they are not condemning what’s happening, that they are not educating the public,” she explained. Yet Almontaser concluded that Aiman’s observations were nothing but internalized “Islamophobia,” a “self-fulfilling prophecy when you hear it over and over and over again that you start to believe these things.”
Almontaser’s Pakistani-American skeptic found ironic confirmation in an audience questioner who described his own experiences with four “Muslim” college professors. “Three of them,” he claimed, “have made anti-Islam, anti-Muslim statements in class.” The only professor whom the audience member deemed supportive enough of Islam has purportedly been “viciously attacked, his statements taken out of context, himself and his family attacked.” During these discussions, none among Almontaser’s audiences recognized the dangers of non-Muslims denouncing Muslims who struggle against Islamism as “anti-Muslim.”
Almontaser’s miseducation efforts would have everyone believe that all Muslims think like her and her radical allies. In contrast, her studies and the audience’s comments at ACMCU indicated the diversity of thought among individuals with Muslim backgrounds who confront issues such as Islamism, extremism and violence. And yet, teachers’ unions and academia are promoting Almontaser’s monotone tales of victimhood while ignoring or even suppressing more critical voices among America’s Muslims, who struggle against Islamist attempts to dominate their faith.

The Left’s Lousy Grasp of Science,spectator.org,Greg Jones,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-lefts-lousy-grasp-of-science/,"The Left’s Lousy Grasp of Science It pretends to champion reason but always settles for superstition and refusal to learn from mistakes. A Caracas street scene last January (Rufus Alfonzo/Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by Evan Maguire
T he left has long fancied itself as the champion of science, insisting for years now that the tools of logic and reason belong to no one else.
By extension, it often considers conservatives Neanderthalic savages who place their faith in invisible beings rather than reality.
What rot. After all, it’s today’s left that is thumbing its nose at long-settled biology by recognizing a spectrum of genders to rival the Pantone color wheel. And these same zealots, clearly devotees of rigorous investigation, now insist that life begins when a woman says it does, not when the heart begins to beat or features start to form. Despite the scientific consensus on life, to say otherwise would advance “the patriarchy,” whatever that is.
But their ineptness in the natural sciences pales in comparison to their absolute disdain for the softer sciences, particularly history and economics.
In the natural, or hard sciences, researchers attempt to re-create nature, usually in laboratory experiments. The idea is that any fundamental understanding of a particular phenomenon requires conditions that mimic the natural world as closely as possible.
Such a methodology won’t work in the softer sciences, for obvious reasons. While it’s indeed possible to replicate in a controlled setting the chemical reactions that occur in, say, photosynthesis, scientists cannot simply reproduce the dynamics of global trade and human migration with beakers and Bunsen burners.
Luckily they don’t have to, as human history has provided the ultimate laboratory in which to examine the softer sciences ad nauseam .
And that greatest of experiments has produced some interesting findings, almost all of which are wholly ignored by today’s science-loving left for the simple reason that they directly contradict its agenda.
Take, for instance, the ongoing debate, sadly occurring even now in this country, on the merits of capitalism and socialism.
While China, Russia, Cuba, and many others suffered for decades due to their reliance on the state rather than the individual, America’s ascendance to world superpower via its preference for free markets ushered in an unprecedented era of global prosperity.
The U.S.’s economic influence is such that countries that have elected to do business with America, such as post-Mao China and India, have become economic Goliaths in their own right. In fact, America’s economic dominance set the stage for the greatest migration from poverty to middle class in the history of the world.
Contrarily, Venezuela provides the perfect case study for this phenomenon in reverse. Once a flourishing petrostate, its devolution into socialism, including the nationalization of key sectors of its economy such as oil production and its institution of the type of redistributive policies dreamed of by today’s American left, led directly to the economic implosion we are witnessing today.
And yet despite all of this the left is unswayed, instead demanding ever-more government control over the most successful economy in world history. They point to European countries, particularly in Scandinavia, as proof that socialism works, sadly unaware that many of those countries aren’t socialist at all. Inform them that Sweden privatized its version of Social Security more than 20 years ago and watch their mouths hang open as if they just spotted Bernie Sanders in a MAGA hat.
Scientific indeed!
Of course, they have to look abroad for evidence as America’s most liberal states and cities appear to be in their death throes, while those that lean right are the new epicenters of economic progress and innovation.
Illinois, long recognized as the poster state for liberal largesse, is hemorrhaging residents at record speed; its population has declined for five consecutive years, with 45,000 residents saying goodbye in 2018 alone. Predictably, the liberal governor of Illinois, currently under federal investigation for his own property tax scheme, has proposed a tax on the wealthy to fund the state’s out-of-control deficit. Only the best scientists recognize that driving taxpayers away increases tax revenue.
The state’s prize metropolis, Chicago, faces numerous crises, both cultural and economic. Not surprisingly, it hasn’t had a Republican mayor in nearly eight decades, a trend that haunts America’s most violent and corrupt urban centers.
California is likewise facing its own exodus , and despite its love of income redistribution the Golden State maintains the highest poverty rate in the country. Perhaps most telling, however, is the sad saga of San Francisco which, though home to much of the world’s leading tech entrepreneurs, is riddled with human feces to the point that the dogs are worried about where they step.
Meanwhile America’s redder regions are thriving . Businesses and people eager to flee the burdensome taxes and increasing crime of liberal strongholds are significantly shifting the nation’s balance of economic power to places like Texas, Florida, and North Carolina; of the nation’s ten fastest growing states, seven went red in 2016.
All of this, of course, is rooted in the left’s core belief that the government can fix any problem simply by throwing enough money at it, a hypothesis which has been debunked more times than Bill Nye’s credentials.
Consider LBJ’s War on Poverty. In the more than half century since the tough-talking Texan declared “unconditional war” on the ills of the nation’s poor, government programs have managed to reduce the poverty rate by a measly 2.5 percent. The costs of these programs, however, has ballooned to greater than $22 trillion (as of 2014), or more than our current annual GDP.
And then there’s education. Despite America’s global leadership in spending , our students fall significantly behind their first-world counterparts in academic performance.
There are countless other examples of the left’s failures throughout history, far too many to document in a single column. But all the data in the world doesn’t matter to today’s agenda-obsessed liberals.
After all, the entire point of science is to ensure human progress by testing ideas, keeping the good ones, and ditching the bad ones. Yet today’s “progressives” insist we repeat the same mistakes over and over, no matter the costs.
And no matter how many times they claim science as their own, there’s absolutely nothing scientific about that."
Deal with Mexico is Good News for Everybody,spectator.org,Ali Atia,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/deal-with-mexico-is-good-news-for-everybody/,"Blog Deal with Mexico is Good News for Everybody Trump’s deal with Mexico is good news for all - and a good sign for negotiations with China by Jeffrey Lord
“E veryone [sic] very excited about the new deal with Mexico” President Trump tweeted Saturday, following the announcement of a deal aimed at curbing immigration from Central and South America. The deal came after several days of negotiation, largely as a result of threats by President Trump to raise tariffs on Mexican goods by 5% weekly. These threats, as noted from the outset by various commentators , were intended more as negotiation tactics, as opposed to concrete policy. The speed with which a deal was reached illustrates that these tactics were successful.
The news is good for everybody. Mexico has agreed to attempt to curb the flow of immigration through the use of various programs and initiatives . These include devoting more troops to its southern border in order to stop immigrants from other nations before they can enter Mexico as a route to the US. Mexico has also promised to expedite the process of holding immigrants until their asylum claims are adjudicated.
With these developments, Trump can rightly say that he has made substantial progress towards one of his main campaign promises – securing the border. Further, with the threat of tariffs now a thing of the past, the economy and consumers can rest easy knowing that trade with Mexico will continue uninterrupted. Markets worldwide have responded positively to the deal. There is no denying that the deal is beneficial not only for the US and Mexico, but also for the global economy .
Perhaps most importantly, the deal indicates that positive progress for the US-China trade war may be on the horizon. For Trump, tariffs are not ends in themselves – his use of tariff threats against Mexico indicate that, while he may verbally express willingness to raise barriers to trade, in practice he is more careful. This line of thinking extends to the trade war. Thus far, Trump has made statements professing his desire to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and negotiate a deal, in what is sure to be the key event of the upcoming G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan. Mr. Xi, too, has made optimistic claims about future trade relations with the US.
Such a deal is sorely needed. Trump is justified in wanting to push back against China – they have engaged in espionage and other bad faith practices against America, and their leadership is authoritarian and repressive. Tariffs have served as effective short-term negotiation tools against both China and Mexico. But in the long-term, high tariffs can only serve to damage the US and the world’s economy. At G20, with a deal with China in the works, Trump should also seek to make trade deals with other Western nations focused on strengthening the West against rapid Chinese growth."
Black Mirror’s ‘Striking Vipers’ Unintentionally Highlights Everything Wrong With Today’s Sexual Culture,spectator.org,Evan Maguire,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/black-mirrors-striking-vipers-unintentionally-highlights-everything-wrong-with-todays-sexual-culture/,"Black Mirror’s ‘Striking Vipers’ Unintentionally Highlights Everything Wrong With Today’s Sexual Culture Virtual Sex, just a fantasy or reality? Photo credit: Agus Fitriyanto Suratno/Shutterstock.com Top Stories by Jeffrey Lord
O ne of television’s most anticipated and talked-’ shows in recent years, Black Mirror , has just released its fifth season straight to Netflix. The show is a series of vignettes that discuss the dangers and absurdity of our technological culture and increasing human dependence on the digital world. This season, three episodes long, was not as futuristic or surreal as previous seasons have been, and critics haven’t been pleased .
Each episode in one way or another shows the desperate situation that cultural conservatives are now facing. The most jarring and bizarre episode is the first, which highlights everything wrong with the postmodern West’s view of sexual activity and morality.
The first episode, “Striking Vipers,’ begins with two seemingly well-adjusted men catching up at a barbeque. Danny (Anthony Mackie) is given a new virtual reality (VR) video game, “Striking Vipers X,” by his longtime friend Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Later that night the two begin playing the game, which uses a neural link to digitally transport players into the game-world. The game is like a hyper-realistic Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, and the players can really feel and see what is going on, while their motionless true bodies stare glassily towards the ceiling. This is certainly an interesting concept, but the episode takes a depraved turn. Danny, playing a male character, and Karl, playing a female character, start by fighting, but then begin sexually engaging with each other. While both feel strange about it, they continue this behavior for months.
Danny is married with a young son. He and his wife, Theo, are trying to have another child. But because of Danny’s strange online sexual activities, his marriage is faltering. Danny realizes what he is doing is wrong and eventually cuts things off with Karl. Danny’s life gets back on track and his wife becomes pregnant; his family is growing.
Months later, Danny’s wife invites Karl over for dinner as they hadn’t seen each other in quite some time, due to the awkwardness of their online gaming habits. The two men have a heated discussion while Theo is getting dessert in the Kitchen, and they decide to meet up later that night to figure out what on earth they have done with their lives. Karl says he cannot reach sexual pleasure in any way better than virtually with Danny, and Danny reluctantly feels similarly. The two kiss each other to find out if their attraction translated in the real world, and it turns out they aren’t actually gay for each other, so they start physically fighting. This leads to Danny’s wife finding out about what has been going on.
In a sane world, this would likely lead to either the end of the marriage or some serious counseling, and obviously, the two men would no longer be playing their “fighting” game together. In the fleeting moments of the episode, the married couple comes to a compromise. On special days, Danny can go virtually sodomize his friend Karl, while his wife goes out into the real world and hooks up with real men, cuckolding her virtual sex-obsessed husband. That’s the end, and it’s portrayed in a relatively positive light.
Of course, this is fantasy, but there is always some reality to Black Mirror episodes. The Western World’s sexual culture is so depraved that some people watched this episode and found the conclusion to be beautiful or reasonable . With the growth of the free love movement from the flower power generation, aberrant sexual activities have become increasingly accepted and mainstreamed, from extra-marital sex to virtual sex.
The digital aspect of the episode is also not that far off from reality. Our current digital landscape is mired in pornography; an estimated 90% of young men and 60% of young women are exposed to porn before they turn 18. Masses of young men and even women have become addicted and dependent on this filth. A study conducted by Proven Men Ministries indicated that 3 out of 10 men from ages 18 to 30 are daily pornography viewers.
All of these numbers are extremely concerning, and with the advent of VR Pornography , things will likely only get worse. People can now simulate, much like the Striking Vipers players, something that is meant to be at best between a husband and wife, or at least something going on between two real people. Quick pleasure and a dopamine rush can “replace” something sacred, at a minuscule fraction of the effort.
This sexual depravity has real-world consequences, some of which we are already seeing today. Increasingly pornography is cited in the reasons that couples divorce. In Japan, young people are giving up on real sex/relationships (including nonsexual relationships) in growing numbers to either pursue other interests or virtual sexual interests. As a result, Japan’s birthrate has declined rapidly to, as of 2016, around 1.44 births per woman, among the lowest in the world. As a result, Japan is dying, and so will the world. If this commodification and digitization of sex continues unabated, the traditional family will continue to be dismantled, people will continue to be unable to find true meaning in their lives, and birthrates will continue to decline, all of which is a recipe for disaster."

N ineteen Democrats running for president took the stage in Iowa Sunday to woo voters. It was a circus of left-wingers going bonkers for things most Americans don’t want. The front runners back abortion any time before birth, abolishing ICE (the immigration enforcement agency), outlawing gas-burning cars, shutting down fossil fuel industries that employ millions, and redistributing wealth.
These White House contenders are veering far left, even though polls show half their own party’s voters aren’t “liberal .”
It’s a worrisome spectacle. For 150 years, our two-party system has provided political stability envied by the rest of the world. Republicans and Democrats put forward broad agendas to compete for the widest number of voters. When one party wins, the other cedes power, and cooperates in governing.
Not this time. The Democratic contenders are espousing policies few Americans support, and giving moderate and conservative members of their own party the cold shoulder. They’re also vowing to destroy their Republican opponent, President Trump
Front runner Joe Biden wasn’t in Iowa, but his three nearest challengers — Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg — took aim at Biden, warning against picking a moderate. “ We’re not going to win by playing it safe ,” said Mayor Pete. Sanders railed against a “ middle-ground ” that “ changes nothing .”
So far, Iowans aren’t convinced. Polling shows Biden almost ten points ahead of the radicals , because he has name recognition and he’s electable.
But Biden’s changing fast. He’s dumping long-held positions, and kowtowing to radicals nipping at his heels. He has already careened left on abortion and climate, and is likely to go for open borders too.
For decades, Biden opposed taxpayer-funded abortions, citing his Catholic faith. He even authored the 1981 Biden amendment banning foreign aid from paying for abortion research. But last week, he flip-flopped , announcing he now supports federal funding. Does he actually have principles?
Most Americans, including Democrats, see abortion as a wrenching, complicated issue. A recent NPR/Marist poll finds only 18% support third-trimester abortion . Yet every senator running for president voted against a bill requiring doctors to help infants who survive a late-term abortion . Senator Kirsten Gillibrand says there’s no room in the party “ for a Democratic candidate who does not support women’s full reproductive freedom .” That’s slamming the door on a majority of voters.
On climate, Biden has already capitulated to the Green New Dealers. Last week he announced his plan to force the U.S. into zero net carbon emissions by 2050, including-regulating gasoline-powered cars out of existence. Popular with coastal elites, maybe, but say good bye to heartland voters working in the auto and fossil fuel industries.
For years, Biden and mainstream Democrats like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, called for strong borders. President Obama was dubbed “ Deporter in Chief .” Yet now Biden’s under assault for his past views . Expect another flip-flop.
Today most elected Dems are siding with illegals, instead of with the public. When the House was asked to pass $4.5 billion in border relief funding last week, with the lion’s share for food, medical care and schooling for children, Democrats refused, because a sliver of the funds would pay for border guards and enforcement.
Eleven of the Democratic presidential contenders are also calling for the House to impeach Trump , while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she wants him in prison . That’s banana republic talk.
Democrats eyeing the White House need to get real. By writing off moderate and conservative members of their own party, they’re boosting Trump’s chances of reelection.
Then again, Trump’s reelection may be the gut punch that brings the Democratic Party back to its senses."
Big Business Sides With the Culture of Death,spectator.org,Dominick Sansone,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/big-business-sides-with-the-culture-of-death/,"Big Business Sides With the Culture of Death It's hip to be pro-abortion! by Kevin Kosar
B usinesses used to avoid taking political positions, lest they anger half their consumer base. No more. This week, 180 CEOs signed a pro-abortion open letter that appeared as a full-page ad in the New York Times . More than simply an endorsement of a single stance on a social issue, this business decision reveals a change in corporate strategy: avoid ticking off the mouthy minority.
The letter , presented with the print-version of clickbait “Don’t Ban Equality,” is a response to laws passed in several states that restrict abortion. The signers make the claim that the laws are “bad for business.” While the letter is short on how these laws harm business, it’s long on moral buzzwords like “equality,” “empowerment,” and “inclusive.” The signers do not make a compelling business case for killing a human life .
Are the signatories ardent supporters of a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy? In the current day and age, this very well may be the case. A more likely explanation is that virtue signaling is good for business.
Studies show that 47% of millennials hold the belief that, “CEOs have a responsibility to speak up about issues that are important to society.” 51% say they would be more likely to “buy from a company whose CEO spoke out on an issue they agree with.” In the age of social media, the economic repercussions of these statistics can’t be understated, particularly as this generation continues to enjoy the growing influence commensurate with its increasing position in the ranks of political and social power.
One needs only to look at the slew of Fortune 500 companies withdrawing from doing business in Georgia following the state’s ban on abortion once a heartbeat is detected. Businesses fight to prove their level of “wokeness” to customers. They don’t consider expressing opposition to the new leftist party line, even if it doesn’t affect their business. They attempt to avoid business risk headaches like the fast food chain Chick-Fil-A faces over CEO Dan Cathy’s personally held belief about traditional marriage.
The battle lines of the culture wars have been drawn. The business world, by throwing in with social justice warriors have enabled the Age of the Heckler’s Veto.
In a capitalist society, however, competition ensures that newcomers may reach the customers lost to “going woke.” Big businesses undermine their own market power by alienating portions of their customer base in order to appease the minority who are radicals. Others will likely pick up the slack .
Those who seek to censor, bully, and shame will ultimately be defeated by the one thing they continuously work to control: personal choice.

A Mafia Hit Man’s Assessment of John Dean,spectator.org,George Parry,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/a-mafia-hit-mans-assessment-of-john-dean/,"A Mafia Hit Man’s Assessment of John Dean Jerry Nadler knows how to pick ’em. by Kevin Kosar
I n the running-around-with-their-hair-on-fire department, the Congressional Democrats just topped themselves with yesterday’s bizarre testimony of convicted felon John Dean before the House Judiciary Committee. Students of history may recall that Dean served in the Nixon White House as Counsel to the President and pled guilty in 1974 to obstruction of justice for his role in covering up the ties between Nixon’s Committee to Re-Elect the President and the Watergate burglary. Since then, Dean has become a CNN commentator.
Under the leadership of Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), the committee is investigating whether or not President Trump obstructed justice based on the innuendo-laden report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Despite the fact that Mueller’s cohort of Hillary Clinton acolytes did not charge Trump with obstruction of justice and Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (who appointed Mueller) determined that there had been no obstruction, Nadler is hoping to use the unsubstantiated and discredited allegation to impeach the President.
In his testimony before the committee, Dean conceded that he was not appearing as a fact witness and did not have personal knowledge as to the truth or falsity of a single fact in Team Mueller’s report. Instead, his role was to provide “historical context” within which Trump’s actions could be assessed. So Dean appeared, in effect, as an expert witness on how to commit obstruction of justice, a crime which involves hiding the truth.
The Republicans on the committee raised all of the obvious points about Dean’s admitted criminal conduct in the Watergate conspiracy. But it was this exchange between Dean and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) that particularly caught my interest.
JORDAN: Today Chairman Nadler brings in front of the Judiciary Committee a guy [Dean] to talk about obstruction of justice who went to prison in 1974 for obstruction of justice.
DEAN: I did not go to prison.
JORDAN: Okay. You pled guilty to obstruction of justice…
And that rang a bell in the deep recesses off my aging frontal lobes.
After pleading guilty to obstruction in the Watergate case, Dean was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of one to four years. So when he later testified against his co-conspirators in the Watergate cover-up trial, the government was able to represent to the jury that he hadn’t gotten a sweetheart deal for his testimony and had nothing to gain by tailoring his testimony to satisfy the prosecutors.
But because he had flipped and cooperated, instead of prison, Dean was incarcerated in a safe house maintained by the U.S. Marshals Service at Fort Holabird, Maryland. Dean spent his days at the prosecutor’s office prepping his trial testimony and his nights and weekends in confinement. This lasted for 127 days until, following his trial testimony, Dean’s sentence was reduced with the agreement of the prosecutors to time served.
Bottom line: despite what the government had told the jury, by his testimony Dean was working his way to a sweetheart deal and had every incentive to shade his testimony to curry favor with the prosecutors.
In a 2004 interview, Dean said that he had been lodged at the Fort Holabird safehouse because “I was in the Witness Protection Program. The government was very concerned about keeping me alive.”
He then he added this tidbit:
There were other government witnesses in that facility, yes. My next door neighbor happened to be a former mafia hit man who once told me, you know, John, I always liked Richard Nixon until I realized he wasn’t a very good criminal.
That “mafia hit man” was one of my informants from my days as a Special Attorney with the Justice Department’s Buffalo Organized Crime Strike Force. I had been part of the trial team that successfully prosecuted Vito (not his real name) for extortion and related felonies. After his conviction, he flipped and became a valuable mob informant and government witness.
Instead of sending him to prison, we placed Vito in the Witness Security Program and lodged him at Fort Holabird. From there we regularly brought him to Buffalo where we pumped him for information and prepped him for various trials.
Among the safehouse inmates were Watergate conspirators John Dean, Jeb Stuart Magruder, Chuck Colson, and Herb Kalmbach. Vito got to know all of them.
One day, he asked if I would like an autographed copy of Magruder’s new autobiography An American Life: One Man’s Road to Watergate . Sure I would. And so I sent a copy to Vito who had it signed by the author.
As I am writing this, I have before me Magruder’s book bearing the hilarious inscription “To George, A dedicated prosecutor, Best Wishes, Jeb Stuart Magruder, 1/4/75.” That Vito always was a card.
The book contains pictures signed by Colson and Kalmbach and this very special inscription: “To George – With best regards, John W. Dean, 1-4-75.”
So what did this mafioso think of the Watergate defendants? He spoke highly of Colson as a decent “stand up guy.” But he considered Magruder and Dean to be untrustworthy and duplicitous weaklings. And of Dean in particular he opined, “That guy would steal the silver dollars off his dead mother’s eyes.”
Coming from a hardened career criminal, that’s quite a peer review. But since Dean has offered himself to the Judiciary Committee and the world as an expert on committing crime, he may want to add it to his curriculum vitae. After all, what better testimonial to his criminal expertise can there be than that of a member of La Cosa Nostra, the Harvard of the underworld?

Joe Biden Flubs It,spectator.org,"R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/joe-biden-flubs-it/,"W ashington
It is increasingly difficult to be a Democratic presidential candidate.
There are some twenty candidates who are running for the presidency today. Tomorrow there could be thirty. A week from now the number could be up to fifty, possibly 100. If they allow convicted felons to run for president in the Democratic primaries the number could multiply fast. After all, there are a lot of felons who are Democrats and they do not have a lot to do. Some are confined to small places. Whatever the case, all the Democrats in the primary today pretty much agree on everything. Already it has been remarked upon in the news.
Oh, there will be some disagreement. In fashioning his green dream Beto O’Rourke is willing to spend only $1.5 trillion in federal funds to repristinate the environment. On the other hand, the governor of Washington (whose name I have forgotten) has put the price of his green dream at $3 trillion. But all the candidates are in agreement that America is going green in 2020, and the environmental package that Congressgirl Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez envisages has set the parameters for them all. The thought that America does not possess a feasible solution for eliminating its “carbon footprint” has yet to cross any of these goose-stepping candidates’ minds.
What makes the situation so difficult is that not one of them dares to disagree with the others. It is going to be a pretty boring campaign, and we are all going to get tired of hearing about Donald Trump, who has actually accomplished something. Their refusal to disagree became apparent by the weekend when good old Joe Biden on Thursday night caved in on his refusal to oppose the Hyde Amendment. Theretofore, he stood with the majority of Americans who do not believe an opponent of abortion should see taxpayers’ money go to fund an action that they deem immoral, to wit: abortion.
Joe is a Roman Catholic and he opposes abortion on religious grounds. He believes abortion might be okay for nonbelievers but not for him or for other people of faith. When tapes of him expressing his views on abortion back in 2012 were broadcast last week, I sympathized with him. Good old Joe. He will not buckle for political gain. He is a man of faith.
Moreover, he is making the right political move, I thought. Let the mob of candidates all oppose the Hyde Amendment that became the law of the land 42 years ago. He is the only one! Joe is sticking by his opposition to abortion — opposition for him, not coercion of those who favor abortion. They can have their abortion. Taxpayers do not have to pay for it. Joe is a true liberal, and by staying with the Hyde Amendment he is giving what is perhaps a majority in his party reason to vote for him and against the mob. Some 40 percent of his Party oppose breaking with the Hyde Amendment. Staying with the Hyde Amendment and staying with the majority of Americans is right for Joe and also good politics.
Well , of course, I was wrong. Joe folded and after only a few weeks in the race. Now he too is part of the mob. Possibly one of the felons will take up the cause of the Hyde Amendment.
Leadership does not mean following the crowd. Sometimes it means leading. It means doing the bold thing despite the mob. For a while it looked like Joe was going to do the bold thing. Why all the Democratic candidates are rushing to the left I cannot say and I have seen no one undertake an analysis of the matter. I will only say that had Joe stuck to his guns I estimate he would have had a solid 40 percent of rank and file Democrats with him. That would be enough to win the nomination. His place as the leading Democrat in the race for the nomination is now slipping away.
Back in 1982 Bill Clinton’s campaign was encountering dangerous headwinds. That is when he boldly repudiated Sister Souljah, a racist who talked of killing white people. His repudiation won him a place in campaigning history. It has been recorded for the ages as Bill’s Sister Souljah Moment. He went on to win the nomination and the race for the White House. I thought until last Thursday Joe would turn questions about the Hyde Amendment into repeated Sister Souljah Moments for him and distinguish himself from the mob. Joe, you flubbed it. Now the felons have their opening."
Big Abortion’s Biggest Lie,spectator.org,David Catron,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/big-abortions-biggest-lie/,"Big Abortion’s Biggest Lie The claim that abortion on demand has freed women is a myth. Kirsten Gillibrand in Iowa City last January (Michael F. Hiatt/Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by J.T. Young
T he abortion industry is nervous about the reduction in its profits that may result from state laws prohibiting the termination of a pregnancy after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. This anxiety is exacerbated by the possibility that the Supreme Court may revisit Roe v. Wade . Big Abortion has responded to these threats by filing lawsuits, pressuring politicians in Democrat-controlled states to pass preemptive statutes permitting the “abortion” of babies born alive, forcing poltroons like Joe Biden to recant heretical positions, and launching a propaganda campaign to the effect that unlimited abortion liberated women from the depredations of “the patriarchy.”
Of all the lies promulgated by the abortion industry, the claim that abortion on demand has improved the lives of women in general is the most pernicious. It encourages women to make uninformed choices which can and do damage their physical and psychological health. Yet, despite the absence of evidence supporting the liberation myth, it has been inculcated in young women for nearly half a century by the education system, the media, and professional feminists. A typical example of the latter, Katha Pollitt, recently repeated the lie in a New Yorker essay titled , “How the Right to Legal Abortion Changed the Arc of All Women’s Lives”:
I wonder if women who have never needed to undergo the procedure, and perhaps believe that they never will, realize the many ways that the legal right to abortion has undergirded their lives.… Legal abortion means that the law recognizes a woman as a person. It says that she belongs to herself.… A woman could plan her life without having to consider that it could be derailed by a single sperm.
Predictably, Pollitt neglects to mention the easiest way to avoid being thus derailed. Pollitt knows perfectly well that the very real progress that women have made during the last 100 years has virtually nothing to do with abortion. The foundation of that progress — the right to vote — was secured by genuine feminists who vehemently opposed abortion. Yet she suggests that the gains women have achieved in legal, social, and employment rights is due to their ability to murder their own children in the womb: “Without more women obtaining law degrees, would men still be shaping all our legislation?” The obvious answer is, “Of course not.”
The progress that Pollitt attributes to abortion on demand was primarily the result of cultural changes that preceded Roe v. Wade by decades, and those changes were accelerated by the advent of “the Pill” in 1960. This cultural evolution manifested itself in federal and state legislation. Laws like the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 all preceded the Supreme Court’s 1974 discovery of “penumbral rights” lurking in the Constitution. In other words, the claim that the progress women have made is due to abortion just doesn’t conform with the facts.
Not that mere reality enters into the thinking of all abortion apologists. Nor is there room for other viewpoints in the thinking of abortion advocates like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Gillibrand is, of course, running for the Democratic presidential nomination. During an interview with the Des Moines Register on Tuesday, she suggested that any change to current abortion law is unacceptable. After pledging that she would only appoint judges and justices who see Roe v. Wade as settled precedent, she implied that those who would do otherwise are “racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic.” Gillibrand then delivered herself of the following:
I think there’s some issues that have such moral clarity that we have, as a society, decided that the other side is not acceptable.… I believe that for all of these issues, they are not issues that there is a fair other side. There is no moral equivalency when you come to racism. And I do not believe that there is a moral equivalency when it comes to changing laws that deny women reproductive freedom.
In this, Gillibrand is at odds with half of the nation. According to Gallup’s annual survey on morally acceptable behavior, 50 percent of Americans consider abortion “morally wrong.” And a new NPR/Marist poll finds that only 18% of Americans support third-trimester abortion. But you will note that, in addition to declaring alternative viewpoints verboten, Gillibrand never uses the term “abortion.” As George Orwell famously wrote , “In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism.” Gillibrand’s use of “reproductive freedom” is a textbook example.
But where does all this get us in terms of how abortion on demand has affected the lives of women in general? Are they now, 45 years after Roe v. Wade, free from the tyranny of the patriarchy? According to Dr. Ingrid Skop, an obstetrician-gynecologist practicing in San Antonio for 22 years, the answer is clearly “No.” She writes that abortions are frequently not, as its advocates would have it, freely chosen. Often, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is encouraged by the “sperm donor” who threatens abandonment when faced with the responsibilities of child rearing. The patient is often subjected to family pressure:
In a recent survey of post-abortive women, 58 percent said that they had their abortions in order to “make others happy,” with over 28 percent saying they had the abortion because “they feared their partner would leave them” if they did not. Perhaps most heartbreaking is that 66 percent of women “said they knew in their hearts that they were making a mistake when they underwent the abortion.”
It would appear that, despite Katha Pollitt’s assurances, 58 percent of the women who get abortions don’t really feel like they “belong to themselves.” They do it to “make others happy.” Who exactly are these others? At least 28 percent are the males who have impregnated them but would rather pay $600 to some stranger to avoid behaving like actual men. Another 30 percent are family members, and it’s a good bet that the maternal grandfathers of the unborn children make up the vast majority of this group. These characters are less concerned with the life of a child than with the shame of having a daughter who bears a baby out of wedlock.
Does this suggest that the young women who submit themselves to the tender mercies of Planned Parenthood have been liberated from the patriarchy? Has abortion really freed them? As Katha Pollitt writes in her opening paragraph, “I’ve never had an abortion. In this, I am like most American women.” Pollitt, like Kirsten Gillibrand, is an upper-class white woman. The vast majority of women who actually get abortions are low-income women of color neither will ever have to face at a D.C. cocktail party. Has abortion on demand improved their lives?"
Joe Biden: A ‘Good Guy’ Without Principle or Backbone,spectator.org,Doug Bandow,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/joe-biden-a-good-guy-without-principle-or-backbone/,"by J.T. Young
J oe Biden, the crazy uncle that many people try to hide in the attic, so to speak, is a “good guy,” even if he didn’t have enough backbone to defend his use of that phrase to describe Vice President Mike Pence. When the left-wing mobs came calling, Uncle Joe scurried for the exit.
Of course, the former senator already had run from his record in the Anita Hill hearings, during which he apparently privately acknowledged the inconsistencies of her story. Now, seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in an era when truth and consequences are of no account, he apologized for not arming the anti-Clarence Thomas mob with pitchforks and torches.
His latest craven surrender is on abortion funding.
Uncle Joe’s principle strength is his longevity. He comes from an era before the Democratic Party had turned into a left-wing hothouse. The party always included a lot of big spenders, but on culture and foreign policy many Democrats were to the right of many Republicans. Across America’s heartland many Democrats supported gun rights and opposed abortion.
Indeed, the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits public funding of abortion except when the mother’s life is in danger and in cases of rape and incest, was first passed in 1976 by a Democratic House and Senate . Democratic President Jimmy Carter, elected in that year, defending the prohibition. Belief in the eternal value of the human person was not limited to the right.
In 1980 Democrats purported to be the party of diversity and tolerance when they attacked the Reagan campaign for creating an abortion “litmus test” for judicial nominees. To be sure, most Dems backed the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade , but they said they would never, ever impose that belief on judicial nominees.
By the late 1980s and 1990s fealty to the principle of unlimited abortion was becoming a requirement for Democratic presidential nominees — which was a problem because so many leading Democrats had unclean hands, from the Left’s perspective. As a result, Richard Gephardt, Al Gore, and Bill Clinton all tossed aside measured records on the issue in their campaign for the top political prize. Still, the latter felt the need to claim he wanted the procedure to be “rare” as well as safe and legal. Scores of congressional Democrats continued to vote pro-life.
However, over the years the two parties increasingly divided along abortion. Ironically, as the usual suspects among the media and commentariat denounced the GOP for its alleged intolerance in becoming more uniformly pro-life, Democratic orthodoxy largely extirpated any public role for pro-life Democrats. Two years ago Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez declared: “Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health.” He added: “That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.” There is simply no room for individual conscience: “we must speak up for this principle as loudly as ever and with one voice.”
Only a few congressional Democrats show hints of reluctance to take the abortion-uber-alles pledge. Today there are Senators Joe Manchin and Bob Casey and Representatives Henry Cuellar, Collin Peterson, and Dan Lipinski. The latter, perhaps the most conservative Dem in Congress, has become quite a problem for the intolerant Left. Bernie Sanders is supporting Lipinski’s primary opponent, who almost unseated Lipinski two years ago. Under pressure Rep. Cheri Bustos, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, canceled a fundraiser for the incumbent. At the time she claimed to still support a “big tent Democratic caucus,” but opined: “I’m proud to have a 100 percent pro-choice voting record and I’m deeply alarmed by the rapidly escalating attacks on women’s access to reproductive care in several states.”
Now comes Uncle Joe, who when he arrived in Washington in 1973 said that Roe was wrongly decided. (In fact, the decision wasn’t really even constitutional law, as some liberal legal scholars admitted.) His votes against abortion funding go back more than 40 years . Over the years he followed his ambitious Democratic brethren into the pro- Roe camp, but in 2007 still described his position on abortion as “middle of the road.” And up until last week he supported the Hyde Amendment.
That measure should be considered unexceptional, yet it generates untold hysteria. The thought that there is anything anywhere which Washington does not subsidize sends the average left-winger into hysterics. The knowledge that government is not paying to abort babies is treated as uniquely offensive. The “right” to have an abortion apparently includes the “right” to make others pay for it. It bears repeating that the Hyde Amendment blocks no one from getting an abortion. It merely says that if you want to eliminate your baby, you can’t conscript taxpayers to pay. The responsibility is yours alone.
Naturally, Biden’s at best vestigial commitment to past principles — he long ago made it very clear that he does not believe the unborn warrant the slightest legal protection — generated a tsunami of criticism. It seems as if every declared, undeclared, and still thinking about it Democratic candidate announced his or her determination to make every American pay. Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty declared that Biden “is a man out of step with his party” and the breach is “potentially irreconcilable.”
That’s about all that was needed for Uncle Joe to discover his inner abortion crusader. He explained: “Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code.”
Which is, well, complete nonsense. Abortion is not simply a matter of “health care.” There is another life at stake. And 40-plus years is a bit long to take before noticing that refusing to fund abortion, like anything else, means it is easier for rich people than poor people to afford. The best one can say about Uncle Joe is that he is a slow learner. Who knows what other brilliant insights he might come up with as the campaign proceeds?
Alas, the better explanation is that he is a craven opportunist, afraid that taking even the most modest of principled stands will cost him too many votes. So now, after decades of declaring that taxpayers should not be forced to underwrite a procedure many view as the equivalent of murder, he says, never mind. Protecting his left flank matters more.
Maybe his shameless flip-flop will pay off. More likely, he will find that he has sacrificed the very raison d’être of his candidacy.
The original case for Uncle Joe was that he represented an older, better rooted, and more centered liberalism. Human beings mattered more than ideology. Social engineering was not politics’ highest virtue. Even as liberalism trended left it retained a few of its classical characteristics.
But now we find Uncle Joe joining the braying left-wing mob, apparently prepared to toss aside all the traditional verities in which he once believed. If the “new” Joe Biden hopes to look like an ideological carbon copy of his opponents, however, why should anyone vote for him? Does anyone really want as president a frankly aged, slightly addled, often goofy, and ostentatiously unprincipled lifetime politician who never has said or done anything particularly interesting or worthwhile? If Biden has become just another man of the Left, why not vote for the real thing, a genuine socialist and gender warrior determined to force the socially unenlightened to kowtow to liberal totems?
Uncle Joe still seems like a “good guy,” but he no longer possesses even the pretense of principle. In the short-term his reversal on abortion might help insulate him from his opponents’ attacks. In the long-term it is likely to sap support from those who no longer see anything that sets him apart from his younger, brighter, tougher, and more vigorous opponents.

The U.S. Women’s Soccer Team: Shameful and Hypocritical,spectator.org,John Glynn,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-u-s-womens-soccer-team-shameful-and-hypocritical/,"by John Jiang
F rom an early age, we are taught the importance of respect. Most children, one hopes, are taught to respect their parents, teachers, and elders. They’re also taught to respect traditions, be they familial or cultural. They are taught to respect people’s feelings and rights, even the country’s flag and leaders. Have respect for truth and people’s opinions, regardless of race or sex. As life progresses, we develop great respect for people we consider representatives of moral decency; on the other hand, we lose respect for those we discover to be dishonest or obnoxious.
Speaking of obnoxious….
On Tuesday, the U.S. women’s soccer team tried (and failed) to defend itself against some richly deserved criticism. As you probably know by now, the Americans trashed Thailand 13-0. This is not the reason they were criticized, obviously. After all, soccer is all about outscoring your opponent. The Americans were slammed on social media for the manner in which they celebrated each goal. This was Thailand’s only second time in a major competition, having lost 4-0 to Norway and 4-0 to Germany in 2015, neither of whom piled on. In many ways, the Thai ladies were David; the Americans, Goliath.
The U.S., favorites to win this year’s World Cup absolutely thrashed the Thai team in Reims, France. They were seen reacting to every goal scored in the most overly dramatic ways imaginable, celebrating each one as if it was a cup final winner. While their Thai counterparts were left in tears, the Americans rejoiced in the most vulgar way possible. Against a lowly opponent, it was the heaviest defeat in World Cup history.
As a huge soccer fan, I have participated in and watched the sport for almost a quarter of a century. Soccer is supposed to be a game of honor, a game of humility. When you are fortunate enough to earn a win, you need to be humble in victory, respecting your competitor and their effort. Just like a loser must be gracious in defeat, a winner must also be humble in victory.
It all comes back to respect. Sport revolves around the concept of respect. Calls to respect this or that are increasingly part of public life, especially in the United States: environmentalists urge us to respect nature, opponents of abortion and capital punishment insist on respect for human life. The list goes on — respect for sexual orientation, age, and religious beliefs. The ubiquity and significance of respect in everyday life largely explains why so many, from pseudo-intellectuals to supreme philosophers, have been interested in the concept. Everyday discourse and practices insist that respect is personally, socially, politically, and morally important. On the topic of discourse, fans, as well as commentators, took to social media to voice their disapproval. Clare Rustad and Kaylyn Kyle, two retired soccer pros, slammed the team on Canadian sports channel TSN. Rustad had this to say: “I just think they could have won with some humility and grace, and they just couldn’t manage to do that. Celebrating goals later in the game like this is just completely unnecessary. What is this?”
Clearly in agreement with her former teammate, Kyle chipped in by adding: “They’re the No. 1 team in the world and for me, I’m disgusted, honestly.”
The irony here is that a number of the Americans are self-confessed feminists, regularly pleading with the masses to respect the rights of ladies around the world. Megan Rapinoe, possibly the most outspoken team member, even refused to sing the National Anthem on Tuesday.
The player stood silent and somber looking as her teammates sang along to “The Spangled Banner” in the Auguste-Delaune Stadium.
Why? By refusing to sing the anthem, she was acknowledging the pain felt by the LGBT community, something she says President Trump repeatedly fails to do.
The 33-year-old midfielder went on to score a goal in the game and, like the rest of her teammates, celebrate inappropriately. This is a woman that virtue signaled and vice signaled in the space of an hour.
The former occurred when she refused to sing the anthem. The latter occurred when she participated in overly provocative celebrations, jumping around like a possessed kangaroo.
The U.S. women’s soccer team happens to the best in the world, but the behavior on show lacked the class that we associate with top tier professionals. Their actions presented the United States in the worst possible light — bullies, cruel and ruthless. I have never seen soccer stars behave in such a mindlessly ignorant manner.
The irony here is that a number of these women have criticized Trump for being cold and heartless. What is it that they say about people in glasshouses?
The hypocrisy is absolutely astonishing. To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson, “people are respectable only as they respect.”"
"Sad, Dying Gasps of Pension Reform",spectator.org,Steven Greenhut,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/sad-dying-gasps-of-pension-reform/,"California Watch Sad, Dying Gasps of Pension Reform San Diego’s final capitulation to union demands signals the end of a reform movement that had once showed promise to help fix California’s debt woes. Nothing to do now but wait for a downturn to send cities over the cliff. A public employee strike in California (John Hennigan/Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by John Jiang
S acramento
The San Diego City Council’s vote Monday to join the union side in an effort to invalidate a 2012 ballot initiative signaled an ignominious end to one of the most promising pension-reform efforts of the past decade. The city’s modest voter-approved law had offered a roadmap for other cities, but after years of assaults from a union-friendly state agency, that measure now is effectively dead. So too are any hopes to reduce hundreds of billions of dollars in public debt.
The San Diego situation was a perfect example of how the California government is, at every level, rigged on behalf of public-employee unions. It also spotlights the degree to which union priorities almost always win — even when they undermine long-established constitutional rights. In that case, the courts agreed that union demands for city officials to “meet and confer” with them about benefit changes trumps the right of citizens to vote on such matters.
The 2012 ballot measure, Proposition B, shifted most new employees into 401/k plans rather than the costly defined-benefit pensions that are based on guaranteed formulas. For instance, most California “public safety” officials receive what’s known as “3 percent at 50.” They can retire with 90 percent of their final years’ pay beginning at age 50. And that’s before various pension-spiking gimmicks often push their retirement pay above their working pay.
At the time of its passage, the state had been facing $25 billion budget deficits . Although the pension portion of that shortfall was relatively small, the state’s fiscal crisis highlighted soaring pension debts. Local government were — and still are, actually — cutting back public services to deal with the growing costs, driven by a pension-increasing spree sparked by a 1999 law that encouraged localities to retroactively boost pension pay.
Pension reformers saw that crisis as a great opportunity to reform the troubled pension systems. In liberal San Jose, voters approved Measure B by 69 percent to 31 percent margins after pension costs had risen 350 percent over a decade. But that voter measure reduced benefits for current employees, which ran afoul of something known as the California Rule. The courts have interpreted that “rule” to mean that benefits can never be cut for current employees even going forward, unless they received something of equal value in return.
San Jose’s reform was halted after a series of union-backed lawsuits. Proponents of San Diego’s Proposition B , however, took a different tack to avoid any potential conflict with that legal precedent. They limited “pensionable pay,” which means they capped the amount of salary upon which pension benefits could be based. They focused mainly on new hires. They eliminated a city charter requirement that employees vote on any changes to their pension plan. There was no “California Rule” issue, but the unions were able to derail it anyway.
The California Public Employment Relations Board , or PERB, invalidated the measure by claiming that city officials were legally required to negotiate with unions over benefit changes before putting any such measure on the ballot. This was an absurd interpretation of state law given that the city of San Diego did not put the measure on the ballot. Local activists collected signatures and placed it before voters, which is a constitutional right, after all.
However, the city’s mayor and a council member had, in their role as private citizens, supported the initiative effort. But PERB ruled that the mayor had acted as the city’s “agent” when advancing that initiative. State administrative agencies don’t have the power to invalidate elections, but they ruled that the city must pay the unions’ legal costs.
The California Supreme Court ultimately sided with the unions, ruling that PERB is “one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the authority or an expertness which courts do not possess and must respect.” PERB also is one of those agencies that is largely captive to one particular interest group — and its decision was never in doubt. The high court asked the lower courts to remedy the situation by fining the city or overturning the law.
That led to Monday’s decision , where San Diego city officials threw in the towel and agreed to ask the city attorney to seek the invalidation of the voter-approved law. Because it was approved by voters, they can’t simply vote to overturn it. The city could have chosen to continue to fight, although Prop. B’s proponents are still moving forward with their legal battle. It’s a sad chapter, and one that should have triggered more outrage given the implications of the ruling on Californians’ right to place initiatives on the ballot.
“The power of initiative is a constitutional right, not something for which people must bargain,” wrote former San Diego city attorney Jan Goldsmith in a 2012 San Diego Union-Tribune column . “It is unconditional and nonnegotiable, like the First Amendment.… Never in the history of California has there ever been a requirement to negotiate with labor unions over terms of a citizens’ initiative placed on the ballot by voter signatures.… And the mayor doesn’t give up his constitutional rights simply because he’s the mayor.”
The state Supreme Court has put the kibosh on every major attempt to rein in spiraling pension costs. Many advocates for pension reform, including former Gov. Jerry Brown, had hoped that the court would revise the California Rule after a series of lower courts found that public employees were only owed a “reasonable pension” — and that it was perfectly fine to reduce future benefits to ensure the health of the pension systems.
But the high court thought otherwise. The court was reviewing a lawsuit filed by a firefighters’ union involving a pension-spiking benefit known as “air time.” In its modest 2013 pension-reform law, lawmakers scuttled that benefit, which allowed public employees to buy extra years of service at deeply discounted prices. It was a way to inflate final earnings to permanently boost pensions.
The court upheld that state law, but punted on the broader question. It declared that “[W]e have no occasion in this decision to address, let alone to alter, the continued application of the California Rule.” That was perhaps the last, best hope the state has had to change a rule that makes it nearly impossible for cities and counties to scale back benefits that are consuming their budgets and leading to an endless wave of tax hikes and service cutbacks .
Now, with San Diego’s decision, there is nothing left to do — other than wait until an economic slowdown pushes cities to the brink. California officials have decided that public employees’ right to enjoy millionaires’ pensions is more important than our right to vote or receive decent public services. At least the courts have recognized reality: The public works for the public-employee unions. They are not public “servants” by any stretch of the imagination.

Pennsylvania Legislature May Repeal Stealth Drinks Tax,spectator.org,Kevin Kosar,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/pennsylvania-legislature-may-repeal-stealth-drinks-tax/,"Pennsylvania Legislature May Repeal Stealth Drinks Tax Tax reform one could drink to. A Philadelphia bar in December 1933, after Prohibition’s end (Everett Historical/Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by John Jiang
K eystone State legislators may abolish Pennsylvania’s stealth drinks tax. The House Liquor Control Committee is examining HB 1512 , which would end the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board’s “flexible pricing” power.
Rep. Jesse Topper, the measure’s primary sponsor, argues that flexible pricing power is not a power one should give to a monopoly. “[T]he PLCB is neither constrained by market discipline nor antitrust laws,” he wrote.
Topper’s bill would repeal the flexible pricing provision “in order to reinstitute some kind of consumer protection.” If enacted, the PLCB would revert to using a longstanding pricing system that set spirit prices by a formula . The Board marked-up drinks by 31 percent, and then added an additional 18 percent tax.
While profitable for the government, flexible pricing comes with costs for Pennsylvanians. The PLCB’s monopoly pricing power means consumers are stuck paying whatever the state monopoly demands. Additionally, the agency’s monopoly purchasing power leaves drinks-makers with little leverage to bargain over the cost the agency is willing to pay.
More fundamentally, flexible pricing is effectively a stealth tax and may therefore raise constitutional questions. Instead of elected officials setting income- or sales-tax rates to cover the cost of government, the pricing mechanism has enabled the state Legislature to outsource revenue-raising authority to an executive agency. And increasingly, the state has come to rely on profits made from drinks sales to help fill its budget hole. Since flexible pricing was enacted a few years ago, the PLCB has been raking in higher revenues. According to one PCLB official , under the old price formula system, the agency contributed $80 to $100 million to the state. This year, the agency will deposit $185 million into state coffers.
Last week’s hearing of the Senate Law and Justice Committee put these issues on full display. Sen. Anthony H. Williams chided the spirits industry officials who testified before his committee for failing to help elected officials figure out ways to generate more state revenue collections from drinks sales. Strangely, Williams also insisted , “The government doesn’t make profits.… The PLCB does not make profits — it collects revenue that the Commonwealth uses.”
Topper’s measure has a ways to go before it gets to Gov. Tom Wolf’s desk — the liquor committee must first report the bill, then the whole House and Senate must approve it.
Whether Topper’s drinks bill will be enacted is anyone’s guess. If the bill is stymied, however, someone could challenge the constitutionality of flexible pricing. This would be a dangerous development for the government, as the state supreme court could rule that flexible pricing was an illicit tax and demand that the state forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars — most of which it already has spent.

Will the Real Tariff Man Please Stand Down?,spectator.org,Veronique de Rugy,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/will-the-real-tariff-man-please-stand-down/,"Will the Real Tariff Man Please Stand Down? Trump’s tariffs are turning into a massive tax hike on Americans. by John Jiang
T he air always swirls with popular myths that, when repeated constantly, are taken by some to be indisputably true. One such myth today is that President Donald Trump is unique among presidents in standing up firmly to the Chinese and other foreigners to stop them from harming us economically with their import restrictions, export subsidies, and illegal immigration. According to that theory, the tariffs he uses to counter these foreign practices are to our benefit. As such, we should purportedly welcome them with gratitude.
Trump is indeed unique among modern presidents in his eagerness to use tariffs. But his vaunted “toughness” in using them is nothing for us Americans to applaud: We should instead condemn their use. Trump’s so-called “standing up” to foreigners is more like stomping on Americans’ freedom and prosperity.
The fundamental reality most people forget is that when foreign governments artificially make their exports to the United States more abundant and less expensive, we’re the winners. We Americans reap the gains. Foreign consumers and taxpayers are the poor souls who predominantly suffer the burden. While some U.S. producers admittedly suffer from this competition, the truth is that when Trump bargains hard to stop other governments from subsidizing their exports, he inflicts more harm on his fellow Americans overall, in the form of higher prices and reduced supplies. If successful, his bargaining may actually help foreign consumers and American taxpayers. Unfortunately, it’s more likely that foreign governments won’t cave and may instead retaliate. Then we’ll all end up with higher tariffs.
Each tariff Trump imposes is a tax on Americans. This is true regardless of why he claims he does it. It’s true when he wants to protect his friends in the steel industry against foreign competition. It’s true when he does it in the name of telling the Chinese government how to rule China or not to steal our intellectual property. It’s true when he uses tariffs to force the Mexican government to stop immigrants from entering Mexico through its southern border — something he fails to do for the United States. And it’s true when he uses tariffs as leverage to get a “better” trade deal with Canada and Mexico or with the Europeans.
Leaving aside for now the fact that this has failed repeatedly as a strategy to force countries into making concessions they weren’t willing to make in the first place, we must face the truth that these tariffs are a penalty Trump forces on those of us who choose to buy imports. This is obvious to anyone who reads through the comments submitted to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative on proposed new duties on Americans who import from China. You’ll read heartbreaking stories like this: “We are concerned that this tariff could single handedly reverse over half a century struggling through the journey to support our large family and our many loyal employees.” Or this: “Margins in our sector are already very thin, and the proposed incremental duty would result in us shutting down the business.”
These duties that our self-proclaimed “Tariff Man” president is so proud of will have long-lasting consequences — none of which are good. American natural gas companies selling in China, for instance, have not only seen their market diminish steadily since the beginning of the trade war, but it’s now at risk of disappearing completely if trade negotiations collapse.
Farmers, obviously, have taken a serious hit thanks to multifront trade wars — a hit that the president attempts to soften with billions of dollars in subsidies paid for through higher taxes on other Americans.
Automakers have operated in a state of uncertainty, not knowing when the next large tax hikes on auto parts or automobiles will materialize. They also live with the uncertainty of whether and when they may be subjected to stricter and counterproductive rules of origin through the new NAFTA.
On the other hand, if you define “standing up” for Americans as imposing a massive tax increase on us, then, yes, the president is indeed standing up for us. According to Bryan Riley at the National Taxpayers Union, the potential 2019 inflation-adjusted tax burden of the Trump tariffs at our current import level is the biggest tax increase Americans have been subjected to since World War II.
Maybe it’s time for the president to take a seat.

Why Gillibrand Is the Most Vapid Clown in the Car,spectator.org,Dov Fischer,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/why-gillibrand-is-the-most-vapid-clown-in-the-car/,"Dov Is All You Need Why Gillibrand Is the Most Vapid Clown in the Car Your call: As she fights to reach 0% in the polls, is she absurd or just plain stupid? S he is so excruciatingly, insufferably, painfully stupid, shallow, pandering, desperate, and without ethics. Kirsten Gillibrand. United States Senator from New York. Candidate for 2020 Democrat Presidential nomination. Dolt. She was not initially on my radar. I follow the news like a hawk, but she always was so politically lightweight — make that bantamweight — that she did not register . Here in California, “register” is a term we often use for earthquakes. The Northridge shaker registered at 6.7. A solid 3.5, give or take, will wake you up. Gillibrand registers at 0.0, give or take a zero. It is not that I live amid a high bar for United States Senate excellence. Here in Orange County, the epicenter of The Resistance within the People’s Republic of California, reports reach us that we are represented by Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris. One slept her way from the bottom to the top. Everyone here knows that. She cavorted publicly with one Willie Brown, then California Democrat Kingmaker, even prompting Willie’s wife to castigate her in the same brazen open way that the affair itself was conducted. In a quote published by the famous San Francisco columnist Herb Caen in his book, Basic Brown , Mrs. (Blanche) Brown said on the eve of Willie being sworn in as Mayor of San Francisco: “Listen, she may have him at the moment, but come inauguration day and he’s up there on the platform being sworn in, I’ll be the b***h holding the Bible.” As for our other U.S. Senate star, she spent nearly twenty years being chauffeured around by a spy for the Chinese government . Are you worried about collusion and leaks to foreign governments? How about having a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence talking privately on her phone for two decades with no one else listening in — except for a spy planted there by China? Many Americans outside the Golden Homeless State had the opportunity to witness for your own eyes and ears these two gems on full national display during Christine Blasey Perjury day. Dromedary and Bactrian. One hump and two humps. Dianne and Kamala. So my exposure to Senate excellence does not set a high bar for Kirsten Gillibrand to transcend or even to ascend. And yet, as she endeavors to ascend, that is exactly the end on which she lands. Here is why: For several years, The Dolt was in the House, representing a somewhat moderate, even conservative, Upstate New York theretofore Republican district. She won election in 2006 and retained office in 2008 by advocating conservative views. She supported the National Rifle Association. She even received a 100% rating from the NRA. She opposed amnesty for Illegals. She even opposed issuing drivers’ licenses to Illegals. She voted to withhold federal funds from Sanctuary Cities. She won the Republican district because news broke days before the election that her opponent, the incumbent GOP Congressman, was abusive to his wife and even “ knocked her around the house.” The wife had phoned in a plea to 9-1-1, and the tape ended up in the news just in time. That is how democracy works. That is how our leaders emerge to lead us over the cliffs. Gillibrand was a Clinton neophyte and sycophant. She traveled with them, campaigned for them , and they for her . They raised money for her. Despite everyone knowing about Bill Clinton’s history with Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, and Monica Lewinsky — among others — Gillibrand was only too eager to associate closely with Bill. And it paid off. When Hillary was named by Obama as Secretary of State, she had to give up her Senate seat. Gillibrand, an Utter Unknown in a field of possibilities that included Andrew Cuomo and Caroline Kennedy, nevertheless was named by New York Governor David Paterson to that vacated Clinton seat. She has been running for President ever since. Gillibrand immediately ditched all her “values” and moved rapidly to the Left. As the Democrats moved even farther yet to the Left, she kept endeavoring to outpace them. When #MeToo erupted after Harvey Weinstein, Gillibrand played a leading role in demanding that Al “Probing Fingers” Franken resign from the Senate. To get more national attention as she ramped up her Presidential aspirations, she then turned on her Clinton patrons and excoriated Bill, saying that he should have resigned from the Presidency in light of all the times he abused women, culminating with Lewinsky. Yet such concerns never before had stopped Gillibrand from endorsing Clintons and bragging of their endorsements and of their fundraising for her during all the prior years, even though all of Clinton’s storied abuses of women had been world famous by then. In other words, not only no deeply held personal values, but also no loyalties , just the brazen single-minded pursuit of fame and power. When she ran in New York for reelection to the Senate in 2018, she was challenged whether she had eyes on the White House. She famously and publicly promised to serve a full six-year term in the Senate if elected. Yet only two months after her November reelection, she announced her Presidential exploratory committee and joined the Democrat Clown Car. Unlike Georgia Governor-Not-Elect Stacey Abrams, she was able to fit in. During the past many months, Gillibrand repeatedly has demonstrated two defining characteristics: 1. She is the most phony of fakers. 2. In the face of polling for months in the general vicinity of Zero-point-Zero, she will say absolutely anything , no matter how absurd (assuming she is smart and realizes what she is saying, but is saying The Outrageous for news-making effect) or outright just-plain-stupid (assuming she actually means what she is saying). 1. The Most Phony of Fakers Gillibrand is a strong supporter of the most vile bigot in America, Linda Sarsour, and likewise praises Sarsour’s close second in hate, Tamika Mallory . Gillibrand endorses them, seeks to be photographed with them, and wants the Democrat Left to associate the name of Kirsten Gillibrand with Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory. When Time magazine named those two Jew-hating racist bigots among America’s most influential people, Sen. Gillibrand amazingly personally authored the article. Sarsour openly thanks Gillibrand for “ work[ing] for us on the inside .” Yet the same Gillibrand will throw around the insult “Racist!” when describing others who are not politically correct. She even sees “racism” in being pro-life . But she endorses Sarsour and Mallory, whose catalogues of prejudice, bigotry, and hate against Jews, White people, and even White women are an open book. Although Gillibrand postures as a #MeToo activist, she has openly tolerated remarkable anti-female abuse in her own office , where she disregarded several women’s complaints and pleas to deal with one of Gillibrand’s closest long-time staffers, who repeatedly told “rape jokes” in the office, intimidated women sexually, and created a profoundly hostile workplace environment for women. Only after a woman staffer resigned over the severe and persistent abuse, and the story then broke in Politico , did Gillibrand act to contain the political fallout. 2. She Will Say Absolutely Anything to Register a Decimal Gillibrand was a relative unknown when named United States Senator. As a Democrat United States Senator in New York, she cannot lose reelection if she tries. But her Aught Nothingness is more manifest on the national stage. From the early weeks of her candidacy for the Democrat Presidential nomination, she has been unable to register. To get attention — any attention at all — she now will say anything that comes to her unscripted mind, no matter how absurd, no matter how really not smart. That is, no matter how objectively stupid. You be the judge: Absurd or Stupid ?
Thus, she has announced that, if elected, she will federally recognize a legal third-gender option, creating an “X” field on identification documents for people who don’t identify as male or female. Likewise, she will roll out new birth certificates, replacing “mother” and “father” with gender-neutral language “to ensure that both members of a same-sex couple can secure their parental rights from the day their child is born.” Absurd or Stupid ?
She tweeted : “Our future is: / Female / Intersectional /… And we’re just getting started.” For that, she got slammed all over Twitter. Remember: She is White. Rich. Non-Muslim. For years a friend of the tobacco lobby . And although she yet may change her gender to get another vote somewhere, meanwhile she is one of the two genders recognized in the Bible. She is not yet Muslim, though she works on the inside for Linda Sarsour. Tough to see how Instersectionalism raises her Presidential fortunes above Cory (Black), Kamala (female, Jamaican, Indian, weed smoker, sexually promiscuous when needed), Pete (Gay), Julian Castro (Hispanic), Andrew Yang (Asian), Gov.-Non-Elect Stacey (female, Black, non-stereotypically full-figured, not elected), and those of such ilk. Absurd or Stupid ?
She compares pro-life judges to racists and Jew-haters ( like, uh, Linda Sarsour? Tamika Mallory?). Absurd or Stupid ?
Still hovering at Zero-point-Zero, she pledges to legislate giving $600 to every person to donate to a candidate. Absurd or Stupid ?
Not enough? Still not registering in the polls?
So she goes to a Gay Bar , wearing a rainbow-colored “Love Is Brave” T-shirt (get it?), and gets herself filmed sipping a drink at the bar, as though she does this all the time. A long weary day on the trail, so need to relax just a bit at Happy Hour at the Ol’ Gay Bar. And then she waves at one of her many fans in the bar, assuming anyone there even recognized her and did not think instead that she was signaling a desire to be “picked up” or to “pick up,” and she yells: “ Gay Rights! ”
Think about that last one. Really, pause a moment. Can you imagine someone entering a kosher deli, wearing a T-shirt that says “I Love Lukshin Kugel ,” eating a piece of gefilte fish with a sour pickle and rye bread, waving at people she does not know and yelling out down the room “Jew Rights!”? Seriously.
I have been at a gay bar only once — at an awkward moment fifteen summers ago, when my wife and ten-year-old son were driving down to a world-famous Laguna Arts Fair, and we needed most assuredly to stop at a restroom. None of us ever before had been in any bar at all (except a bar mitzvah…), and it was during the years before a Starbucks bathroom was available on every block. We did not want to enter a non-kosher restaurant for the pit stop because it might seem we would be entering to eat there, so we figured let’s just go in-and-out of the bar. As we entered, I made a bee-line for the men’s room. The first thing that seemed strange was that there was no door to the room — you could see in and out of the room. And then I saw something else in there that educated me rapidly beyond my yeshiva education. ’Nuff said. I realized rapidly that I had entered a twilight zone that even Rod Serling never had imagined, and — although I had tried avoiding the non-kosher burger place down the block — I essentially just had brought my wife and young boy into a place that might as well have had that burger store’s sign: “In-and-Out.”
So there is Kirsten, Intersectionalist, tight “Love Is Brave” T-shirt. Music blaring so loud that no one can hear a thing. Sipping a drink at a bar, fake dancing in a kind of Elaine Benes way . Big inviting smile. And she waves her hand at someone and yells something inviting that no one can hear at the bar, except for the microphone her campaign has attached near her for her choreographed tweet. So tell me: What does a person there think, if not that she is looking for a “date”? Invest five seconds of your life and watch this tweeted snippet . Absurd or Stupid ? Kirsten Gillibrand will say absolutely anything to register a decimal. Even at a gay bar. To get a one-dollar donation, she will film how many tries at beer pong ? For every Robert O’Rourke video showing him getting a full-mouth cavity inspection or having his ear hairs cut, she can take Twitter and YouTube a notch even lower. In the year of the 23-and-Counting , Kirsten Gillibrand is the most vapid clown in the car."
Bernietopia,spectator.org,Daniel J. Flynn,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/bernietopia/,"by J.T. Young
W hen a noun must disguise itself behind an adjective, beware.
“We must recognize that in the 21st century, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, economic rights are human rights,” Bernie Sanders announced at a speech this week. “That is what I mean by democratic socialism.”
The word hiding behind that adjective hides in plain sight at the site of all of the past century’s great atrocities. Whether one thinks of National Socialism or Soviet Socialism, that second word conjures up a horrible track record exclusive of such concepts as compassion , justice , and love — the very words Senator Sanders employed to describe socialism. Sanders’s use of the modifier “democratic” might suggest a kinder, gentler socialism if Democratic Kampuchea and the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea did not already try this approach.
Despite these historical cautionary tales, and the senator’s admission that the recalcitrant bastion of capitalism somehow remains “the wealthiest country in the history of the world,” a Harris poll indicates that 40 percent of Americans would rather live in a socialist country than a capitalist one. The results closely mirror a recent Gallup poll in which 43 percent of respondents affirmed socialism as “good thing” for the United States.
Coincidentally, about as many Americans hold no memory of the Berlin Wall. Many of them, uncoincidentally, support Sanders, whose numbers, although down in recent polls, slide because others coopt, not because they reject, his message. It’s not former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, booed for telling California Democrats that “socialism is not the answer,” seeing his numbers climb. It’s Elizabeth Warren, running as Bernie without the baggage — or at least his baggage.
A democratic economic system — really not a system but something that developed organically — already exists. Its detractors label it capitalism; its enthusiasts call it a market economy.
People vote in it with their dollars and labor. No dictatorship sets the price over goods or labor, as democratic socialism presumes to do; a market of 328 million people do. When they vote for a product by purchasing it, its price, or the supply or it, generally increases due to this demand. When they vote against it, its price, or the supply of it, generally recedes. Nobody forces anybody to work this job, buy that product, or hire those workers. Voluntary cooperation governs such exchanges. The people hold the power.
In contrast, socialism — national, soviet, democratic, or otherwise — always represents a transfer of power from the people to the state. In Bernietopia it means top-down direction of what you can buy (no private health insurance), what you can sell (“ keep oil, gas, and coal in the ground by banning fossil fuel leases on public lands” and “end exports of coal, natural gas, and crude oil”), how much employers can pay employees (“a living wage of at least $15 an hour” and “everyone who can work in America should have the righ t to a decent-paying job”), and other edicts from those who know best.
Just because Bernie Sanders can turn a DeLorean into a time machine does not mean he can micromanage the economic affairs of 328 million people. No one can do that. But many can. And that’s the irony. Capitalism rests on cooperation, millions choosing (or choosing not) to engage in exchanges that bring happiness to both buyer and seller. Socialism rests on authorities paternalistically dictating exchanges.
This ideology seduces intellectuals by flattering them with the conceit that they know how to run the affairs of the rest of us. The market insults them by showing that people do not need their theories to lead happy, productive lives.
Apart from curtailing freedom, socialism in case after case hamstrings prosperity. Juxtapose the pathetic situation of North Korea (115th largest economy) with the thriving South Korea (world’s 11th largest economy). They share the same genes and the same peninsula. They enjoy and endure very different lives.
This stems in part from the hubris of the enlightened imagining they can dictate the choices of the benighted. In larger part, disincentivizing work, risk, innovation, competition, and much else that characterizes capitalism dooms socialism to failure.
But what does a guy who, according to Politico , “didn’t collect his first steady paycheck until he was an elected official pushing 40 years old” know about any of that?
Capitalism works for men who do. Socialism works for men who don’t."
A Grotesque Political Party,spectator.org,Ron Ross,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/a-grotesque-political-party/,"by J.T. Young
T he United States has a long tradition of reliance on a two-party political structure. For that structure to function effectively both parties need to be competent and responsible. Unfortunately, that is not the case now.
The lineup of Democrat presidential candidates currently stands at 25 and growing. Conrad Black has aptly described them as “unelectable non-entities.” The long and growing list is more like a tower of babel than a collection of credible leaders. Evidence of that is that leading the race currently is former senator and vice president Joe Biden.
Beyond the confines of the Democrat Party the reaction to Biden’s candidacy is typically, “Is this a joke?” Joe Biden? The guy is a goof. He is known primarily for his gaffes, flip-flops, plagiarism, and unwelcome advances toward women. The very fact he is leading the race is a sad indictment on all the other candidates.
The unreality of all the candidates’ policy positions, e.g. the Green New Deal, sanctuary cities, open borders, unlimited taxpayer-funded abortions, should be obvious to all sentient beings.
Democrats label all Trump supporters as racists, just as Hillary Clinton labeled them all “deplorables.” Trump supporters are seen as homogeneous members of a collective. It’s another variation on the Party’s addiction to identity politics and also a good definition of bigotry.
I don’t know about you but I don’t appreciate being labeled a racist by people who’ve never met me and know nothing about me. Racism is one of the ugliest of all slurs, one that is almost impossible to defend against. It is a Democrat proclivity that will surely shrink their voter base.
Furthermore, what is their definition of a racist? It must include every person who’s ever had a fleeting thought of racial differences. That’s the only way you could get tens of millions of “racists.” The entire party has become a bunch of Jussie Smollett clones.
Why do they rely so much on accusations of racism? Because it works, because they have nothing else, and because they have no shame.
Democrats also have the annoying habit of making wild, unsubstantiated exaggerations. Three examples are the significance and prevalence of “white supremacy,” “Russian meddling,” and “voter suppression.” Such accusations are never defined and never quantified.
The dearth of leaders for the party is nothing new. Consider who their previous nominees were — Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. What a strange collection of characters. To paraphrase William F. Buckley, “I’d rather be governed by the first 24 names in the phone book than any of these people.”
Hillary Clinton was an incredibly bad candidate. Why was she nominated? Amazingly, it was because she was the best they had! We can thank our lucky stars she’s not president and Bill is not the “first gentleman.”
Nancy Pelosi is currently the most powerful Democrat. She is the face of the party (as well as the hands). Is she someone who will inspire independents to become Democrats? Democrats love her. Conservatives can barely stand to look at her.
The most incompetently managed, crime-ridden cities in the country are run solely by Democrats. If they can’t run cities why would anyone want them to run the country? Those cities should be seen as canaries in the coal mine.
“Impeach Trump!” Would you mind telling me for what, specifically? Could you name just one of his “crimes and misdemeanors?” They’ve offered nothing but a bunch of vacuous accusations, e.g. he’s “unfit” to be president.
The Mueller report took 22 months and could not find any collusion or obstruction. It was based on something so flimsy and ludicrous it should not have taken more than 22 minutes to evaluate and reject. Even now the Democrats cannot let go of it.
To Democrats way of thinking the very thought of Donald Trump being president is simply too horrible to contemplate. He has driven the Democrats to distraction.
As Victor Davis Hanson wrote recently, “One way of envisioning the Democratic obsession with Trump is as an addiction.” Unfortunately, there are no rehab programs for political parties."
America’s Bull in a China Shop,spectator.org,J.T. Young,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/americas-bull-in-a-china-shop/,"America’s Bull in a China Shop Main Street has known the problem all along, which is only now dawning on our elites. by Ron Ross
A merica’s bull is loose in the China shop. President Trump has set in place a confrontation with China over that nation’s trade infractions. The shop’s elite patrons are in paroxysms, while Main Street presses their nose to the glass to watch the show. That two groups could see such different things in the same occurrence is the crux of American politics today.
The Chinese have a long heritage as merchants. Found across Asia and the world, they run businesses from the smallest street stalls to the largest conglomerates.
For decades now, China’s Communist Party has taken a mercantilist approach, tapping into their nation’s predilection. They have thereby generated the capital no other communist nation has ever been able to raise. By doing so, they have transformed the former embodiment of global impoverishment into the epitome of successful development.
Along the way, the world’s undiscerning shoppers have enjoyed the bargains but ignored the consequences. Both were equally clear: Cheap goods in large quantities and unscrupulous business practices. The world focused on the former and ignored the latter. Trump has done the opposite.
This has been the Trump trade agenda writ large: Taking a contrarian position to the prevailing elite approach that welcomed foreign exports in unlimited quantities. Pursued everywhere, nowhere has Trump advanced his contrarian position more forcefully than with China.
Following China’s backtracking from a deal that promised détente in the nations’ trade relationship, President Trump has begun putting in place actions likely to escalate the conflict. Tariffs on hundreds of billions in Chinese exports are due to increase significantly. Additional tariffs on hundreds of billions more are promised to follow. Restrictions on Chinese telecom giant Huawei are in place, and a response aimed at currency manipulation — a practice China has unabashedly pursued — appears in the works.
As with all wars, they comprise casualties and assets. The first casualties of Trump’s China trade war were America’s elites. They have benefited greatly from our former trade relationship with China —inequitable though it was. They would like very much to continue to do so. As a result, although they ostensibly lament the obvious inequities, they tacitly support the status quo . They want the bull out of their China shop.
Trump also has his assets in this trade conflict. The American economy is fundamentally strong. Perhaps stronger still is his case against China. China’s numerous transgressions are well and long known — not just here, but globally — despite having never faced a serious challenge before.
For decades, Main Street America has felt the effect of the elite’s prevailing trade approach. Elites therefore cannot directly oppose Trump in attacking China; they are left only with the cursory response that they would pursue it in a better way — despite never having bothered to do so.
China’s mercantilist approach is nothing new. In Asia, Japan, and then Korea, earlier used this developmental approach. In America, a different segment of Main Street suffered each time.
The economic throwback of mercantilism seems quaint to America’s elites — its beneficiaries — but cruel to its victims — Main Streets. Undoubtedly, the elite’s perception would have been very different had China been flooding America’s markets with lawyers instead of leggings.
America is democratic to a fault. Today’s elite brands it demagogic. However, it predates America’s revolutionary origin. After, Tocqueville eloquently documented it. We have a long-held love of satirizing the elite — from the Three Stooges running roughshod through a mansion, to the Marx Brothers demolishing an opera.
For Main Street, Trump has imbued America’s innate love of such high jinks with a sense of high justice: “It is about time.” There is no little element of payback here. This is why Trump has bulled into so many china shops — NAFTA, trade with the EU and Japan, immigration — not just China. And, why so many have enjoyed watching him go.
There is a fundamental misunderstanding in American politics. The elite believe Main Street cannot see there is a bull in the china shop, or do not understand the damage he will cause. For Main Street’s part, they see and understand perfectly — and it is precisely where they want him. The real issue separating elites from Main Streets is not about where the bull is, but whose ox is being gored."
Joe Biden and the Democrats’ Racist Abortion Position,spectator.org,Paul Kengor,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/joe-biden-and-the-democrats-racist-abortion-position/,"Joe Biden and the Democrats’ Racist Abortion Position They couldn’t be prouder of their genocidal commitments. by Ron Ross
I magine if Donald Trump announced he would change his longtime opposition to public funding of abortion in order to ensure that black, Hispanic, and poor women can abort their babies. Would liberals need even 10 seconds before foaming at the mouth screaming that he’s a racist?
Last week in Atlanta , Joe Biden, Democrat presidential frontrunner for 2020, said: “For many years as a U.S. senator, I have supported the Hyde amendment as many, many others have because there was sufficient monies and circumstances where women were able to exercise that right [to abortion], women of color, poor women, women were not able to have access…. But circumstances have changed.”
Thus, said Biden, “I can’t justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and their ability to exercise their constitutionally protected right. If I believe healthcare is a right as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code.”
In response, the crowd of liberal women went wild, applauding ecstatically.
It was an incredible moment. A sick moment. Think about what Joe Biden said, to liberals’ roaring approval: He’s reversing his long-held position so “women of color, poor women” can get abortions — that is, have their abortions publicly paid for. He’s changing specifically because of women of color and poor women. He wants them to be able to have their abortions. He wants to make sure money isn’t an issue. He wants no obstacles to them securing their desire to abort their child. This change is prompted wholly on their behalf: “women of color, poor women.” Even long-held religious objections should be no barrier. Your belief in God, and your conviction that God would shudder at you helping to finance others’ abortions, plays second fiddle to the greater goal of these women getting abortions.
Naturally, liberals will recoil when seeing Biden’s comments framed that way. Biden, after all, is their boy, and Roe v. Wade is their baby. The hallowed “right to choose” is a sacrament in the liberal church. That abortion far and away disproportionately annihilates minority and especially African-Americans is dismissed in light of their ultimate highest good.
I’ve written here many times about the awful history of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger, her work with the “Negro Project,” her commitment to racial eugenics for what she called “race improvement,” her May 1926 speech to the Silverlake, New Jersey chapter of the KKK, which she openly wrote about in her memoirs. I’ve written on Hillary Clinton’s abortion hypocrisy and on liberal cult-hero Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s assessment to the New York Times Magazine : “I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of. So that Roe was going to be then set up for Medicaid funding for abortion.”
I also wrote here recently about abortion in Biden’s birth state of Pennsylvania, a state he hopes to take away from Donald Trump. The vast majority of Planned Parenthood clinics in Pennsylvania and throughout the nation are located among African-American populations. Looking strictly at Pennsylvania, the latest statistics show that 43% of abortions were to African-American women and 10% to Hispanic women. More remarkable is the sheer disproportionality: only 11% of Pennsylvania women are black and 7% are Hispanic .
Abortion in Pennsylvania, like everywhere else in America, victimizes minorities by leaps and bounds. The national figures show that abortions by black and Hispanic women outpace white women by 4.5 times. Some civil rights leaders, including Dr. Alveda King , have called this “ Black Genocide .”
Well, America’s minorities should know how much Joe Biden has their back: he wants to make sure they get free abortions. In fact, it’s so important to Biden that he’s willing to suddenly abandoned his three-decade-long support of the Hyde Amendment for this grand objective. And progressives cheer mightily.
Biden, of course, is hardly alone in this among liberals. Quite the contrary, he’s caving on the Hyde Amendment because not doing so is heresy in the liberal church. The Democratic Party once supported the Hyde Amendment , just as it once defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But progressives, you see, have since progressed . They’re now more enlightened. Hyde must be aborted, so Americans can support abortions for poor women, women of color, black women, Hispanic women.
“The problem is, the Hyde Amendment affects poor women, women of color, black women, Hispanic women,” says Patti Solis Doyle , who served as Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign manager in 2008, and who has also worked for Biden.
And whose lives are eliminated in this equation? The answer: Poor babies, babies of color, babies of black women, babies of Hispanic women.
Planned Parenthood, naturally, is thrilled with Joe Biden hopping on the progressive bandwagon. Minority women are its biggest customers.
“Happy to see Joe Biden embrace what we have long known to be true: Hyde blocks people — particularly women of color and women with low incomes — from accessing safe, legal abortion care,” said Leana Wen of Planned Parenthood .
You can’t make this up. And it’s no laughing matter. Just ask Elizabeth Warren. Choking back tears , filled with anger, she insisted to an audience of clapping, stomping women that Hyde be reversed: “Understand this,” said Warren, voice trembling. “Women of means will still have access to abortions. Who won’t will be poor women.”
This is the prevailing position of today’s Democratic presidential candidates and the party generally, with the party’s old men no longer summoning the intestinal fortitude to oppose the hysterical pack. Biden is merely the latest Democrat man without a chest, an ongoing line of lily-livered gutlessness that the late Pennsylvania Democratic Governor Bill Casey foresaw over two decades ago. The Joe Biden of 2019 is selling his soul for the political approval of today’s unhinged Democratic Party, which has completely lost its mind on moral-cultural issues.
What’s especially sad is that Democrats are hellbent on this policy at a time when the number of abortions have been in decline. For those who hoped and prayed that the scourge of black abortion would likewise decline, well, too bad: the Democrats are doing their damnedest to ensure that when it comes to public funding of abortion, no child is left behind.
Liberal Democrats tell us they love blacks and the poor. They are just oozing with compassion for them. So much so that they will strive to ensure that you — as a taxpayer, and regardless of your religious or conscience objections — are forced by the state to help ensure that every black or poor woman who wants to terminate her child will not be financially prohibited.
Wow, what compassion."
They Didn’t Do It for Medals,spectator.org,Larry Alex Taunton,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/they-didnt-do-it-for-medals/,"They Didn’t Do It for Medals A tribute to our fathers who fought to give us freedom. 8th Ranger Company during the Korean War (courtesy of U.S. Army Heritage & Education Center in Carlisle, PA) Top Stories by Jared Whitley
“O nly you — only you! — could manage to get shot in the ass!”
The year was 1987. A group of middle-aged men sat under the umbrellas at the cheap fiberglass tables of the Holiday Inn in Columbus, Georgia not far from Fort Benning. They deserved a Ritz-Carlton, but this would have to do. The sign out in front of the hotel, the letters hanging somewhat askew, read:
WELCOME 8 TH AIRBORNE RANGER COMPANY
The comment about taking an unfortunate enemy round in the gluteus maximus was an affectionate jab from one member of the company to another, and it was met with howls of protest and laughter.
“Son,” a grizzled old veteran said gripping my shoulder while the other men tried to interrupt him. “Hush! Hush!” he said to them in mock annoyance before turning back to me. “I mean it went in one cheek and came out of the other just as neatly as could be! No bone, just flesh!”
The index finger of his right hand poked one of his own cheeks while the thumb of his left hand moved up and out on the other side, indicating the bullet’s exit.
The conversation turned to a man with an even more unfortunate war wound.
“I tell ya, he thought his life with the ladies was over. ” The other men listened expectantly for the ending of a story they knew well. “There was so much blood, we feared he had been gut shot! But, nooo!”
“No!” bellowed another, like a member of the choir in a good Pentecostal church.
The teller of the story continued: “So, I pull his pants down and guess what? It was just nicked!”
Again, howls of laughter.
My father finished the story: “We just told him he’d have a good story to tell when it came to explaining how he got that scar.”
Men wiped their eyes and guffawed.
This was a reunion of the 8 th Airborne Ranger Company, or what remained of it. The end of the American spear in Korea 1950-51, they were the handpicked elite from all airborne and subsequent Ranger units. Not surprisingly, 8 th Company had the highest qualification scores in the history of the Ranger Training Command (RTC).
Over the course of that weekend, the Ranger School at Fort Benning would honor them with a demonstration of modern Ranger skills and tactics. The latest generation of Rangers would rappel from helicopters, make a practice jump, and tour them around Benning, the place where 8 th Company was born in 1950. And, not coincidentally, it was where I was born.
The men of 8 th Company were much older now and not as lean as the men — boys, really — who appeared in the photos from 1950-51. Most carried extra weight around the middle, had the leathery skin that came with years of overexposure to the sun, and old tattoos that had purpled with age on biceps and calves that were not as hard and chiseled as they once were — but you didn’t try to tell them that . Like old athletes, they spoke with as much bravado as ever.
I had to smile. It had been my privilege to be raised in the company of such men. They could be profane and the jokes were always off-color. They were, to a man, hard-drinking and chain-smoking. They incessantly complained about the army and were fiercely proud of their part in it. Ornery and ready to fight each other, they were nonetheless ready to die for each other, too. Their vices were ever near the surface and yet, I cannot imagine where America would be without their kind.
I was 20 years old and sat silently watching and listening as I so often did when my father swapped war stories with other veterans. But this time it was different. These weren’t just any veterans; these were the men with whom he had shed blood. This would be his last reunion and it was important to him that I be there. As the son of an 8 th Company Ranger, I was, like other sons, an honorary member of this very exclusive club and therefore allowed to participate on the periphery of their banter — and fetch them beer . Lots of beer. Ranger reunions were impossible without beer. And with middle-aged men, that meant frequent trips to the bathroom.
With my father away for a moment on just that sort of mission, one of his old buddies leaned in as if to tell me a secret:
“If any man was ever born to be a soldier, it was your father. Some men have an instinct for the battlefield, and he damn sure did. Absolutely the best shot I ever saw. Could hit flies at a hundred yards. And, man, he was fearless…”
My father, returning, rolled his eyes: “That’s bulls–t, Mike. I was as afraid as any man.”
He turned to me. “It’s as I’ve told you before, son, a man who is truly fearless will get you killed. There’s something wrong with him. His instincts don’t tell him to be afraid when he should be. You want a man on point who wants to stay alive just like you do and whose senses are telling him ‘something’s not right here’ when there’s reason to believe you’re walking into an ambush. Now Mike here, was a helluva point man…” This was all very typical. They extolled each other’s battlefield heroics, but not their own.
Graduates of the 1950 RTC should not be confused with the more than 10,000 military personnel who wear Ranger tabs today and who do not serve in Ranger units. This is no slight to those who wear them. But as any Ranger will tell you, there is a difference between passing the Ranger course and serving as a Ranger, especially today where the standards have been watered down for political reasons . These men were truly elite as indicated by the high washout rate and the fact that of the 500,000 soldiers of the United Nations serving in the Korean War, there were never more than 700 Rangers.
Just as my father indicated, I had heard stories like this before, this old battlefield wisdom. My whole life, in fact. More stories followed. More laughter, backslapping, and beer. Indeed, the cans in the center of the table began to pile up and lips became looser.
Those of us who have heard a lot of old war stories, the wives, the sons and daughters, learn to distinguish the authentic from the fictional. Because the men who did the real fighting as these men had — and I mean the really brutal, prolonged, on the ground stuff where the sight and smell of the dead forever sears memories — they don’t like to talk about the details. Not even with each other. The guy who talks casually about what he did in combat? You can bet that he’s either a fraud or that battle has unhinged him.
“When your dad came home from Korea,” my Uncle recently told me, “he had a chest full of ribbons. He was a hero. But he wouldn’t talk about it in anything but general terms.” And nor did the rest of 8 th Company who had their share of ribbons, too. The stories they told on this reunion weekend were mostly amusing, but to the veteran listener of veterans’ stories, you knew that the humor masked a horror.
All of these men dealt with the psychological wounds of war whether they ever received a Purple Heart or not. My mother tells me that my father suffered from hideous nightmares to the day he died, a recurring one being that he had fallen into a thinly covered mass grave full of bodies in a state of decomposition. Though he fights to climb out over the bodies, the rotten flesh slides off the bones as he grips them and their flesh remained on him for days until he could bathe, a luxury not afforded to men behind enemy lines. Though he would never say, she thinks the nightmare reflected an actual occurrence. I wager all of these men had nightmares of war.
Years later, as he lay on his deathbed delirious from the heavy doses of morphine, he returned to the battlefield. I will never forget his words, a command shouted with urgency and authority: “Cover the left flank! Cover the left flank! Move! Move! Move! ” The order was repeated along with something about laying down suppression fire. Whatever the battle he was in, he was reliving it and he was determined to hold the line. In that moment, I prayed that the Lord would take him. He was suffering the horror of war all over again.
The next afternoon, his chest, heaving and belabored for days, relaxed and the air left his lungs in one long sigh. My father was dead.
A few days later, I sat solemnly with my mother going through his things. It was a joyless task. Buried among his memorabilia we found a letter from a fellow member of 8 th Ranger Company, Thomas Nicholson. It was an award of sorts, but deadly earnest, and, again, the humor here serves a purpose — it makes a terrifying memory more tolerable to recollect. It read:
During combat operations in the Republic of South Korea, Charles Taunton bravely, but unknowingly, earned life membership in The Noble & Ancient Order of the Combat Boot…. He deserves the acclaim and friendship of all who learn that he unselfishly, and with little regard for his own safety, went behind enemy lines to assist a fellow soldier. This act of courage, which epitomizes the U.S. Army tradition of ‘never leaving an injured or deceased soldier in enemy territory,’ is worthy of great praise. Be it therefore known that I, Thomas Nicholson, was the injured soldier he carried back to friendly lines, and that it is with everlasting gratitude that I certify the truth of this citation.
Napoleon said that “Men will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon.” Some men perhaps. But I never got the impression that the men of 8 th Company cared about such things. They valued, above all, the opinions of the other men in 8 th Company. To have the respect of the man who fought to your right and to your left, well, that meant something. In an interview with NBC News many years later, radio operator E.C. Rivera spoke with great emotion about his fellow Rangers and other Korean War veterans: “Nobody gave a rat’s ass about us. Nobody cared. They [i.e., people in America] were very cold to us.”
On July 27, 2013, the surviving members of the 8 th Airborne Ranger Company gathered at the Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Led once again by their former captain, James Herbert, who was now a retired Brigadier General, the half dozen men sat with their wives and families. Before them stood Son Se-joo, the Consul General for the Republic of Korea, who had come to honor them:
In the face of overwhelming danger, your stories of valor and sacrifice saved our country and made it what it is today. As we pay tribute to you, I can confirm that the Korean War is not a ‘Forgotten War’ and that the victory is not a forgotten victory. The Korean people will never forget your sacrifice.
It was an honor long overdue, but too late for most. Coming as it did sixty years after the end of the war, most of the men of 8 th Company were, by now, dead. Many had died on hills with no names, only numbers, in a country that was not their own, but in defense of principles they held dear. Others died later from wounds received in battle. And still more passed away as old men who fought in a war no one seemed to care about. Historian Thomas H. Taylor writes of 8 th Ranger Company:
[Their] only tribute has been from their own post-war lives. Their collective lack of bitterness. Their forbearance from bitching about the lack of deserved recognition. This may be because they were mobilized but their nation was not. They went to war while their countrymen remained at peace. They fought, they bled, they won. Then they returned. Having given their all, they asked for nothing — and that’s just what they got.
I would add to this that satisfaction for the men of 8 th Airborne Ranger Company came from something much more important to them than ribbons or recognition. It is something that only those who have known the battlefield can fully appreciate, but that the rest of us can glimpse in the terrible and inspiring story behind Thomas Nicholson’s humorous letter.
According to the Ranger Hall of Fame at Fort Benning:
On the 22 nd of April 1951, 350,000 CCF [Chinese Communist Forces] troops launched their largest offensive of the Korean War. The attack broke the 6th Republic of [South] Korea Division that retreated 21 miles, leaving the right flank of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division exposed. The Commanding General of the 24th Infantry Division sent the 90 men of the 8th Ranger Infantry Company into this void.
It was in that void, on Hill 628, a godforsaken, bleak mass, that Thomas Nicholson was shot up badly. Wounded and expecting to die as the battle raged around him, he sat propped against a tree, bleeding to death and holding a hand grenade. His plan was to pull the pin when the enemy that surrounded them drew near, thus killing himself and as many of the CCF as possible.
But that’s not what happened.
Instead, his fellow Rangers came for him just as they came for every other wounded or dead American on that hill. Calculating that the CCF who surrounded them would not expect them to abandon their fixed positions on 628 and attack, the Rangers closed ranks, formed a spearhead, put the wounded in the middle, and assaulted the side of the hill between them and a company of tanks in the valley below (see no. 2 on this list of most heroic acts of bravery). One platoon remained on the hill to provide cover fire as the other two platoons slammed into the unsuspecting Chinese. The effect was devastating. Writes Taylor: “As the Rangers approached, Chinese came out of their holes in a banzai attack. They were mowed down — nothing was going to stop 8 th Company unless every man took a bullet.”
They carried him off of Hill 628 just as a U.S. Navy gull wing Corsair fighter bomber descended, banked, and hit the mountain with napalm. Ranger Robert Black recalled it years later: “A black canister fell from beneath the plane and a moment later a towering gout of flame erupted from behind the hill.” For over a mile the Rangers fought their way through CCF lines until they reached the tanks where their wounded could be evacuated.
Thomas Nicholson spent the next 18 months in hospitals. He never rejoined 8 th Company, but he did live to become a husband and father. He also became a helicopter pilot in Vietnam. Thirty years after the war was over, he issued “citations” to the men responsible for his rescue. My guess is that this included every man who fought to get all of the dead and wounded — a third of 8 th Company — off of Hill 628.
When my father spoke with pride of his war record, it was never with a medal in mind. It was not in the recollection of some heroic act or a promotion. And it wasn’t in the body count of enemy dead, a statistic of which he never spoke. If I may borrow a phrase from E.C. Rivera, my father “didn’t give a rat’s ass” about any of that. No, he took great pride in one simple fact: in the history of 8 th Ranger Company, they never left a man behind be he wounded or dead. Never. And if I had to bet, I would wager that the rest of the men in this remarkable company felt the same way.
Perhaps that explains why his mind went back to a specific moment in battle as death, the enemy he could not escape, closed in on him. Even in dying, the men of the 8 th Airborne Ranger Company maneuvered to protect:
“Cover the left flank! Cover the left flank! Move! Move! Move! ”

Now Might Be a Really Good Time for Jehovah’s Witnesses to Start Voting,spectator.org,Jared Whitley,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/now-might-be-a-really-good-time-for-jehovahs-witnesses-to-start-voting/,"Now Might Be a Really Good Time for Jehovah’s Witnesses to Start Voting Neutrality will no longer do amid ever growing progressive assaults on religious freedom. The Jehovah’s Witnesses’ longtime Brooklyn offices (photo.ua/Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by Mytheos Holt
I n one memorable scene from The Lord of the Rings , the shield-maiden Eowyn says , “The women of this country learned long ago, those without swords can still die upon them.” It’s written as a female-empowerment moment, but it’s also good self-defense advice for everybody: simply because you decide to be peaceful doesn’t mean your enemies will.
This anecdote comes to mind with the news of persistent, organized, relentless attack on religious freedom — and Christianity writ large — by secular-leftist, so-called “progressives,” galling evidenced most recently by their refusal to even say the word “Christian” to describe the recent Islamist terrorist attack in Sri Lanka . To help fight back, there’s one group whose political support people of faith urgently need: Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The church shares values comparable to other conservative Christian faiths, but has a stance of absolute political neutrality, meaning members don’t run for office or even vote. But if they did, enemies of faith might not be so bold.
Secular-leftists have derided and attacked religion for years on college campuses, but that trend has now contaminated leftist-controlled mainstream media and even the mainstream Democratic Party. Prominent members of the party now freely and openly attack religious schools , pillory public figures for their religious affiliations, undermine historical preservation , push “Ban the Bible” laws in the name of being “anti” discrimination. The American Civil Liberties Union have long since abandoned religious freedom and Planned Parenthood conspires to force churches to pay for abortions .
Their profit motive is easy to see: there are a lot of lawsuits they can’t file because they’re protected by that pesky Constitution. One wouldn’t have thought that the basic foundations of our democracy could come under attack — certainly not by those who ironically call themselves “Democrats” — but here we are.
So-called progressives have particularly focused their attacks on Catholicism — such as the baseless attacks on children from Covington Catholic School in January. If they feel comfortable attacking Catholicism, how will they treat smaller faith groups with much less clout?
Jehovah’s Witnesses have a history of standing up to tyrants: when their faith refused to support Hitler’s National Socialist (or Nazi) movement, many Witnesses were sent to their doom in concentration camps . Commendable: standing up to Hitler is a pretty impressive line item to put on anyone’s résumé.
While it would be overblown (and cliché) to compare modern secular-leftists to Nazis — no matter how power-hungry they are — it would not be out of line to suggest that they must be likewise opposed. Because the assault on our values isn’t restricted to the left’s religious bigotry, but also includes disturbing trends like the normalization of pedophilia , depriving parental rights over transgenderism, and the new trend of Blue State abortion-upon-birth .
The injunction “Give unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s” is a masterful motto for the separation of church and state… but it’s presaged on the idea that Caesar won’t take something that isn’t his .
One reason for Witnesses’ political neutrality is so — in their own words — they “are able to speak freely to people of all political persuasions about the good news of God’s Kingdom,” but if secular-leftists can topple religious freedom in America, there will be repercussions everywhere. “When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.” If Witnesses don’t help save religious freedom here, they may not be able to speak freely about the good news anywhere.
And better representation in American government could bring additional clout to protect Witnesses from religious persecution, as they frequently experience aboard. Russia’s campaign against JWs right now is particularly horrifying , as is the news that Christian persecution is “ at near genocide levels .”
This is just one plea from someone that the Jehovah’s Witnesses have no reason to listen to. But if, for instance, Vice President Mike Pence were to pay a visit to the Witnesses’ Governing Body in New York, he might be able to articulate the stakes even better.
It’s time for everyone of faith to pick up their sword, so to speak, because those without swords can still die on them. Those who don’t participate in the political process can still be crushed by it. Jehovah’s Witnesses have already played a pivotal role in shaping much of our early First Amendment case law, such as Murdock v. Pennsylvania , which held that requiring door-to-door solicitors to purchase a license was an unconstitutional tax on religious exercise, and West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette , which protected Americans from government-compelled speech.
Victories at the ballot box may curtail the need for victories in court. There are almost 2.5 million Jehovah’s Witnesses in America, according to the church’s data , and if they register to vote for values-friendly candidates in 2020, they would be like the cavalry coming to the rescue."
The Deficit in Media Questioning,spectator.org,Debra J. Saunders,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-deficit-in-media-questioning/,"The Deficit in Media Questioning Multi-trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see — and the press couldn’t care less. CNN’s Manu Raju interviewing Nancy Pelosi (YouTube screenshot) Top Stories
W ashington
Trade secret: We in the news media often hate the media, too.
I had such a moment Tuesday at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation’s annual summit when CNN senior congressional correspondent Manu Raju interviewed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The topic was supposed to be “fiscal sustainability” — a Washington phrase for curbing spending and slowing the growth of the $22 trillion debt.
Deficit spending affects every American in the pocketbook. The federal debt is an IOU that amounts to $49,000 for every man, woman and child in America. Still, Raju barely touched on the subject.
The CNN reporter began with a question about President Donald Trump’s remarks from Normandy, where world leaders had gathered to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Trump — reacting to a Politico report that Pelosi told her caucus she wanted to see Trump “in prison” — told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham that Pelosi was a “nasty, vindictive horrible person” and a “disgrace.”
“What bothers me is that we’re talking about that instead of how to reduce the national debt,” Pelosi responded, as she criticized Trump for being overly political while overseas.
Raju followed up with a question wondering how Pelosi can work with someone who insults her. “I just consider the source,” Pelosi countered.
Here’s the short version of Raju’s other questions: Do you think Trump should be in prison? Why aren’t you for impeachment? Would you support impeachment if the majority of Democrats supported impeachment? You believe he committed crimes in office, right? So isn’t it your obligation to pursue impeachment?
When Raju asked about Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Mexico, Pelosi offered that she would have declined to come to the event if she had been invited to discuss Trump. The audience clapped in approval.
Around minute 18, Raju asked: “Right now, the debt is like $22 trillion. How come dealing with the national debt in a serious way is not a bigger priority with this Congress?”
It was an odd question coming from someone who didn’t think the debt was important enough to address in the first half of a talk that was supposed to be about the federal government’s unsustainable spending trajectory.
Pelosi faulted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by the GOP Congress and signed by Trump in December 2017, for adding $2 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the measure would increase the projected deficit by $1.9 trillion through 2028.
When Raju asked Pelosi if she supports “Medicare for All” and the New Green Deal — the latest fashion in left-leaning policy — Pelosi responded, “Everything is on the table to be reviewed, but what I do support is pay as you-go.” Pelosi did not offer exactly how she would pay for those massively expensive programs. But at least there were two spending questions in the half-hour debate.
Otherwise, there were so many things not to like — the obsession with Trump, a clear bias against the president and the usual lack of self-knowledge about exactly how off the mark this approach appears to the news-consuming public.
And there was the cheesy pursuit of a sound bite to “make news” on the story of the day, which is always Trump. And the big revelation? As CNN hyped it, “Pelosi: Impeachment is ‘not off the table’“ — as if that is news to anybody in America.
It was frustrating to watch because the summit provided an opportunity for follow-up questions — an opportunity unavailable to reporters during White House pool sprays and departure gatherings, where the best one can do is shout a question that reaches Trump’s ears and awakens his fancy.
Also at the summit, CNBC’s Eamon Javers managed to squeeze hot news topics into a meaty half-hour exchange with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Since Trump took the oath of office, the national debt rose from $19.9 trillion to more than $22 trillion. The 2019 deficit is on track to exceed $1 trillion.
Prompted by Javers, Mulvaney admitted he did not know whether the administration could get the annual deficit below $1 trillion while Trump is in office.
It was a chilling admission about out-of-control spending that will haunt the taxpaying public for years to come.

J ordan Peterson, New York Times best-selling author and vocal advocate of free speech, says he will be launching a new social media platform that is free of restrictive censorship. With a terms of service predicated on free-speech policies, ThinkSpot (sign up for a Beta invite here ) will seek to provide a voice for any and all, regardless of politics or viewpoint. Per the Joe Rogan podcast this week, I’m backing a new platform called thinkspot, currently in Beta. Get on the waitlist here, exciting announcements coming very soon. https://t.co/3xQ78Iqc0h
— Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) June 10, 2019
As a subscription service, ThinkSpot will also allow users to monetize their content and thus fill the vacuum created by Big Tech’s admonishing treatment of voices outside the Leftist mainstream. Coming on the heels of social media site Pinterest’s indefinite blocking of pro-life group Live Action under a “pornography block list”, the announcement couldn’t seem to be at a more opportune time. This type of behavior shouldn’t surprise anyone who has been following the increasingly tyrannical oversight of tech companies on the content that is shared through their platforms.
Peterson was initially prompted to begin exploring possible alternatives to the current social media landscape as early as December 2018 . After Patreon, a crowdfunding website, banned user Carl Benjamin (or Sargon of Akkad as he is known online) for engaging in what it determined was hate speech – even though it happened on YouTube, a platform not owned by Patreon – Peterson decided he had had enough.
Indicative of what he saw as a larger phenomenon of Big Tech moderating its platforms so as to censor any material it personally deemed outside the bounds of acceptable discourse, Peterson along with political commentator Dave Rubin announced their leaving of Patreon. They also vowed to begin exploring the feasibility of launching some type of alternative platform free of arbitrary censorship.
Enter ThinkSpot. “Once you’re on our platform we won’t take you down unless we’re ordered to by a US court of law,” Peterson explained . Good news for those who wish to express viewpoints outside the corridors of university gender studies departments.
One feature of the sight worth noting is the fresh approach on the user comment section. Limiting each comment to a maximum of 50 words, the idea is to require that user’s invest more thought into their responses. “Even if you’re being a troll, you’ll be a quasi-witty troll,” according to Peterson.
Some users will of course work hard to encapsulate heinous and vile remarks within that word limit. As remedy, the site potentially offers a voting feature in which comments receive either upvotes or downvotes, requiring viewers to click on those receiving more of the latter than the former in order to view the content.
The main challenge is in creating enough of a user base to make the site a viable endeavor. The tech giants currently reign supreme in the realm of online public discourse fora. But maybe dethroning Big Tech isn’t necessary for success . Simply providing an alternative platform, where tolerance of opposing viewpoints is the standard, may attract enough support to create a niche for ThinkSpot in regard to political conversation rather than as an alternative to Twitter, Facebook, and the like.
At best this would filter out intolerant users who seek to censor opposing viewpoints. As Dave Rubin recently pointed out , however, this fact would likely be weaponized by the Left to paint the new platform as the gathering place for the alt-right – a safe-space for racists, misogynists, and homophobes. This argument would then be used to dissuade others from signing on to the service, particularly those of a more centrist (or certainly Leftist) bent in their political beliefs.
The open exchange of ideas, from as many viewpoints and as many commentators as possible, is undoubtedly the best way to refine political thought and establish shared values. ThinkSpot provides an excellent template for what a social media platform in an open society should resemble. It will have to stay vigilant, however, that this reality is not simply used as another tool of censorship."
"Cato: Sanctions Impediment to North Korean Peace, Aid",spectator.org,John Jiang,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/cato-sanctions-impediment-to-north-korean-peace-aid/,"by Mytheos Holt
A t a recent Cato Institute conference, speakers from various NGOs discussed their efforts to assist desperately impoverished civilians in North Korea and the challenges that they face due to the various sanctions imposed on the country. The event was moderated by Doug Bandow , a senior fellow at Cato and a frequent contributor to The American Spectator .
One of the recurring issues mentioned by the speakers was the impact of international sanctions and restrictions, spearheaded by the United States, on aid efforts. Daniel Jasper of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) related his organization’s struggles with the bureaucracy associated with recent American travel restrictions. AFSC, which provides aid shipment to North Korea, has also seen its efforts seriously hampered by various sanctions imposed since 2017, particularly on certain metals. The organization has been constricted to shipping “strictly food and medicine”, according to Mr. Jasper, and many vital medical items that contain metal such as hypodermic needles face punishing restrictions. It now takes months and expensive legal counsel for relief efforts to get through sanctions.
These frustrations were echoed by Heidi Linton of the Christian Friends of Korea, who spoke of the “unintended impact” of sanctions on civilians living under the Juche dictatorship. Linton described how vital farm equipment is breaking down due to a lack of replacement parts. “The sanctions have given us a workload perhaps ten times what it was pre-2017,” she said.
Critics of sanctions generally contend that they hurt the innocent civilians of countries more than their leadership or government. In North Korea’s case, sanctions could be adjusted fairly easily to accommodate humanitarian groups without abetting the Kim regime or its military and nuclear programs. Speaking on recommendations for the US government, Mr. Jasper recommended creating a “white list” that would include “goods and services required for humanitarian purposes.”
Besides benefits for ordinary North Koreans, greater consistent access to the country is also a possible path to peace. “All of the mistrust that Americans have for North Korea is mirrored by North Koreans,” Randall Spadoni of World Vision told the conference. “For 15 years… we’ve been able to develop greater relationships within the country.” Propaganda ensures that North Koreans see the United States as a monolithically hostile power and their government as their sole protector. Reform is unimaginable until these misconceptions are dispelled, and that may need to be done one charity worker at a time.
From a strategic perspective, the relaxing of sanctions will be a necessary component of any path that the Trump Administration takes toward peace with North Korea. Mr. Bandow, the event moderator, has argued repeatedly in this magazine for a grand bargain in which the US withdraws its military presence in South Korea in exchange for the North’s denuclearization. If Kim gives up his weapons, the US should commit to ending interference in Korea, both militarily and economically. It would be for the good of North Koreans and the world.

Billion Dollar Boondoggle Act: Making Washington Squeal,spectator.org,Ali Atia,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/billion-dollar-boondoggle-act-making-washington-squeal/,"by Mytheos Holt
S enator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is on a mission: to expose the wasteful government spending that balloons the federal deficit and provides nothing of value to taxpayers. Her Billion Dollar Boondoggle Act (S.565), introduced in February 2019, promises to do just that.
The Act, which she cosponsors along with Senators Mike Braun (R-IN) and Rand Paul (R-KY), requires the creation of an annual report that lists all federally-funded projects which exceed their budget by over $1 billion dollars, or are at least 5 years behind schedule.
The Act provides several helpful examples of projects which have become “bottomless money pits for taxpayer dollars.” The California bullet train is perhaps the epitome of a boondoggle. Thanks to poor planning and a lack of accountability, the project is now 13 years behind schedule and $44 billion over-budget. The train network, in addition to misusing billions of Californian and federal tax dollars, has also been plagued by mismanagement and bureaucratic delays in its attempts to acquire land. California’s new Governor Gavin Newsom, cowed by renewed criticism of the so-called “train to nowhere,” was forced to scale the once-ambitious project back heavily during his 2019 State of the State address . He added that California needed to “be real” about the situation.
Several other examples are the East Side Access Project in New York, the 2020 census count, and a waste clean-up project in Washington State. These are only the projects which taxpayers are aware of. With a federal budget of over $4 trillion, there are undoubtedly numerous other boondoggles. It is only fair that taxpayers know why the projects they are funding are so behind.
Of course, as is noted in the Act itself, not all such projects are boondoggles. Often, useful and worthwhile projects are blindsided by mismanagement or other failures by bureaucratic bodies. The Billion Dollar Boondoggle Act, rather than arbitrarily canceling such projects, would bring projects to the attention of legislators and taxpayers. If a project has access to billions of federal dollars, it is important that legislators are aware of what is being done with that money and how it can be done better. With this knowledge, legislators could help ensure that projects are streamlined and optimized, saving taxpayers billions. Even more importantly, the Act would increase much-needed accountability and oversight over government, which could incentivize public servants to waste fewer taxpayer dollars.
This is not the only money-saving bill proposed by Senator Ernst. She has also introduced the Common-CENTS Act, which would allow the Treasury Department to change the metal alloy used to make nickels, dimes, quarters, and half-dollars. It is estimated that making certain changes to the composition coins could save taxpayers up to $150 million.
These two bills are useful tax-saving initiatives which could help bring the deficit under control. By introducing them to her fellow legislators, Ernst is showing that she has taxpayers in mind. She is delivering on her promise to Iowans to make Washington squeal ."
The CIA Is Running Scared,spectator.org,Jed Babbin,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-cia-is-running-scared/,"The CIA Is Running Scared Barr’s bloodhounds are sniffing up Langley’s skirts. by William Murchison
L ast Wednesday the intelligence community launched its first attack on Attorney General William Barr’s investigation into its illegal acts and abuses of power during the 2016 election. In a New York Times article entitled “Justice Department Seeks to Question CIA in its Own Russia Investigation,” the IC makes clear its fear of the results of Barr’s investigation of their spy operation on candidate Trump in 2016 that continued through his early presidency.
The article, obviously written at the behest of its intelligence community sources — “current and former American officials” — is the first of many concerted attacks on Attorney General William Barr’s investigation of the joint CIA/FBI spy operation. Many other articles, based on carefully crafted leaks to the media and Congress, are sure to follow because current and former high-ranking officials of those agencies (and probably the NSA as well) have a lot to lose.
John Durham, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, is running the investigation under Barr’s direction. From the Times report, we can easily deduce the fact that those who ran the spy op — including CIA Director Gina Haspel — are running scared from the Durham investigation.
Start with the sourcing: “current and former American officials.” That includes all of the people who were in the Obama White House, Comey’s FBI, Brennan’s CIA, and everyone else who’s ever held a government job in, for example, the Obama White House.
The third paragraph says, in part:
While the Justice Department review is not a criminal inquiry, it has provoked anxiety in the ranks of the C.I.A., according to former officials. Senior agency officials have questioned why the C.I.A.’s analytical work should be subjected to a federal prosecutor’s scrutiny.
Two points are made there and both are clearly wrong.
It damned well is an investigation not a “review.” James Comey — probably at the behest of then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch — only referred to the FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s felonious use of a private, unsecured email system as a “matter.” By doing so he tried to exclude the possibility that it was a criminal investigation despite the fact that it very much was one. So is the Barr/Durham investigation. It’s not a “review.” By definition, such an investigation is an investigation into possible criminal actions.
The reason the CIA’s “analytical work” is being subjected to a federal prosecutor’s scrutiny is that there is a lot of evidence of criminal conduct by the CIA and FBI. That’s one of the fundamental differences between the Barr/Durham investigation and the Mueller investigation into the imaginary conspiracy between candidate Trump and his campaign and the Russians.
Mueller & Co. had no evidence that a crime had been committed before their investigation began. (Or after, for that matter.) The Mueller investigation was, as I’ve noted elsewhere, consistent with the method used by Stalin’s secret police chief Lavrenti Beria: show me the man and I’ll show you the crime.
In the Barr/Durham investigation, it’s pretty damned clear that in their abuse of power under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act the FBI, and possibly the CIA, made false statements to the FISA court, under oath, to justify surveillance warrants on Carter Page and others. Those false statements — sworn affidavits in support of the FISA warrants — are, at least, violations of 18 U.S. Code Section 1001 which bars such false statements. Those are real crimes, not imaginary ones. Whatever other crimes are discovered while investigating them will come out as well.
In my May 27 column I described President Trump’s May 23 executive order, which is in two parts. The first part requires the intelligence community to cooperate with Barr’s investigations. The second part gives Barr the authority to declassify — or reduce the level of classification of — anything pertinent to his investigation.
But the CIA isn’t going to cooperate. As the Times article says, Haspel has told her officials to cooperate but — and here’s the big catch — still work to protect “… critical pieces of intelligence whose disclosure could jeopardize sources, reveal collection methods or disclose information provided by allies, according to current and former American officials…”
Either the CIA is going to cooperate — as the president ordered — or it isn’t. Clearly, it isn’t. There’s no limitation on the cooperation Trump ordered, but Haspel and her people are going to drag their feet, and probably hide evidence and lie to protect themselves from the investigators.
That part of the Times story reveals the CIA’s attitude, which may be imputed to Haspel. Again, it says, “Senior agency officials have questioned why the CIA’s analytical work should be subjected to a federal prosecutor’s scrutiny.”
That’s it in a nutshell: the CIA believes it should not be accountable for its misdeeds, even if laws have been broken.
The Times report says that Durham’s investigators intend to question senior CIA officials — presumably under oath — and are partly focused on the CIA’s conclusion that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was intended to benefit Donald Trump.
They will be intensely interested in the facts and opinions that drove the IC’s judgment. The January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment concluded that the Russians interfered to benefit Trump. As I wrote in my June 3 column , either John Brennan, Obama’s CIA director, or then-FBI director James Comey insisted on using the unverified information from the Steele Dossier (the opposition research paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign) in the ICA to reach that conclusion.
The January 2017 ICA has been used by the media incessantly to prove their assertion that Trump conspired with the Russians to rob the election from Clinton. Durham will find out who insisted on using the Steele Dossier — when it was known to be unverified — to make a devastating conclusion on behalf of the entire intelligence community.
The senior CIA officials Durham’s investigators will question will obviously include CIA Director Gina Haspel, who has the most to lose. She could be fired from her position, lose her reputation, and — if the evidence proves that she violated the law — sent to jail. She and several (many?) other current and former CIA and FBI officials have just as much at risk.
The leaks the Times published say, among other things, that one of the CIA officers that Durham wants to question works at the CIA’s counterintelligence branch and would have been a conduit to pass intelligence to the FBI on Russian attempts to reach out to the Trump campaign.
Another person to be questioned was involved in the CIA’s assessment of Russian activities in 2016.
These people would obviously be on Durham’s list. It’s not rocket science — just thorough investigative technique — to find out what those people did and what they know. Who did they talk to? What emails and text messages did they send? There’s a ton of information to be had.
Durham’s investigators will begin with people such as those but first they’ll want to get the relevant documents from the CIA. Those documents will include an enormous volume of classified emails, text messages, and other communications among the top CIA officials and between them and the FBI’s senior officials — James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, James Baker and Bruce Ohr — who ran the FBI’s part of the spy op on Trump from the Justice Department.
The CIA will stall as much as it can and — despite the president’s order to cooperate with the DoJ investigation — hide or destroy documents. And, of course, the CIA officials will lie to protect themselves. They have too much at stake to do otherwise.
The Times story goes on to say that,“Critics of the administration say the review is simply an attempt to discredit the Russia inquiry that was taken over by Mr. Mueller and could threaten to reveal closely guarded secrets. They have pointed to Mr. Barr’s adoption of ‘spying,’ a term invoked by critics of the Russia inquiry, to describe investigative activities.” (Again, “review” not investigation.)
Of course those unnamed critics would say that. They — be they the current and former intelligence community officials on whose behalf the article was written or just reporters and editors of the New York Times — desperately want to keep the credibility of their case against Trump alive. To do that they have to attack Barr to diminish the investigation’s credibility.
There’s more, so much more, for Durham’s team to dig into at the CIA, the FBI, and, probably, the NSA. They’re going to be very busy for the rest of this year and probably into 2020.
When Durham’s results are finally published, the reason that many in the intelligence community are now running scared will be too obvious for any except the Democrats and the Trump haters in the media to ignore."
Will Roberts Get Rolled on Census Case?,spectator.org,David Catron,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/will-roberts-get-rolled-on-census-case/,"Will Roberts Get Rolled on Census Case? The ACLU asks SCOTUS to delay ruling in Department of Commerce v. New York. by William Murchison
S ometime during the next two weeks, the Supreme Court is expected to hand down its ruling on whether the Census Bureau may include a question in the 2020 census asking if the person filling out the form is a U.S. citizen. If you think that’s a sensible question to ask in a nation whose population swells every year with immigrants from all over the planet, that means you’re in step with 60 percent of registered voters. It does, however, put you at odds with the Democrats, various leftwing activist groups, and an Obama-appointed judge in New York. Enter SCOTUS.
The Supreme Court took up the case early this year and heard oral arguments on April 23. It’s always difficult to predict a SCOTUS ruling by analyzing the questions asked by the justices during these hearings, but most Court watchers came away with the impression that the “conservative majority” would rule in favor of the Trump Commerce department. At which point, the Democrats did what they always do when they fear they are about to lose a Supreme Court Case — they sought some way to intimidate Chief Justice John Roberts. The ACLU came to their rescue :
The ACLU asked the Supreme Court to wait until the fall to decide if it will reject or allow the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. We requested the Supreme Court send the case to a lower court to consider new evidence showing the question was added for political purposes.
The “new evidence” consists of some information found on the hard drive of a Republican consultant named Thomas Hofeller. This fortuitous discovery allegedly shows that advisers to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross discussed the citizenship question with Hofeller and is thus inconsistent with the sworn testimony of department officials concerning the real purpose of the census question. Never mind that it isn’t unethical or unusual for political appointees to consult with outside experts. The idea is to make Chief Justice Roberts worry about appearances.
The Washington Post did its bit to support that effort in a Sunday article titled , “Chief justice assures the Supreme Court is apolitical. He’s facing his next big test.” The author, Robert Barnes, inevitably reminds us that Roberts admonished President Trump last fall for criticizing an “Obama judge.” Adopting his most schoolmarmish tone, the Chief Justice fumed, “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.” Barnes suggests that Roberts will have failed to live up to his own prim standards if he doesn’t adopt the role of a centrist:
Roberts sits physically at the middle of the bench in the grand courtroom and now, for the first time since he joined the court in 2005, at the center of the court’s ideological spectrum. With the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy last summer, the most important justice on the Roberts Court became Roberts himself.
Barnes evidently believes that Roberts’ primary job as Chief Justice is to maintain an ideological balance rather than interpret the law and the Constitution. But opponents of a citizenship question will need to convince Roberts and the other justices that it would violate one or both. Indeed, the Commerce Department and the DOJ insist that the addition of the question to the census will augment enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. It asks nothing about the legal status of anyone, and it is by no means a novel idea. All of which leaves us with one unsolved mystery.
Why is this issue being raised only by Democrat-controlled states like New York? If such states are, as they claim, primarily concerned that the citizenship question will create so much fear among illegal immigrants that they will fail to respond to the census and cause their populations to be understated, this should be a bipartisan issue. There are obviously Republican-controlled states whose populations certainly include many undocumented aliens. One of the most obvious is Texas. And yet that state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, defends the question in the Hill :
The citizenship question recurred multiple times from 1820 to 1890. And from 1890 to 1950, it appeared on every census. Since then, it has been included on every long-form census questionnaire from 1970 to 2000. To this day, the question is still asked on the American Community Survey, an annual supplement to the decennial census.
You will be shocked to discover that the difference involves political power. Edward Blum, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, writes : “There is speculation that some red states will draw districts equalized on their citizen population, rather than their total population, thus disadvantaging Democrats.” The Constitution requires U.S. House districts to be drawn based on total population, but the door was left slightly ajar by SCOTUS regarding the possibility of districting based on the count of citizens in its 2016 Evenwel v. Abbott ruling.
Why? Because the “total population” requirement conflicts with the constitutional doctrine of “one-person, one-vote.” As Blum puts it , “ Evenwel v. Abbott expanded their options to include equalizing for total population or citizen population. Equalizing for citizen population, rather than total population, will have the effect of giving eligible voters equality of electoral power.” If contiguous districts contain equal populations but widely divergent numbers of actual citizens, the district with the lowest number of citizens wields more electoral power per eligible voter.
That injustice can’t be fixed until SCOTUS allows the citizenship question to be included in the census. The Democrats and the ACLU will prevent that if possible. They know it will shift electoral power away from states like New York and toward states like Texas. The former is hemorrhaging genuine citizens due to high taxes and cost of living. And those people are moving to… well… Texas. If the Dems can’t win Department of Commerce v. New York on the merits, they’ll try to force John Roberts to roll over. Can the Chief Justice take the pressure this time?"
"Mr. Biden: President Trump Is an Existential Threat to Your Legacy and Obama’s, Not to National Security",spectator.org,Fred Gedrich,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/mr-biden-president-trump-is-an-existential-threat-to-your-legacy-and-obamas-not-to-national-security/,"by William Murchison
I n a recent Iowa speech former U.S. Vice President and Democrat presidential aspirant Joe Biden claimed President Donald Trump and his policies are an existential threat to Americans. It seems quite odd that he would say such a thing, especially since many security-conscious Americans consider the Obama/Biden administration’s eight-year foreign policy record a colossal failure, which threatened Americans and tens of millions of others.
In 2008, then Senator and Democrat presidential nominee Barack Obama chose Senator Biden to be his presidential running mate. Obama considered Biden, with his 36-year U.S. Senate tenure, a leading foreign policy authority as well as a seasoned legislator and Washington hand well-experienced in D.C. ways. Before leaving office, President Obama awarded Vice President Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his service to country and his administration.
When they took office in January 2009 many Americans believed the Obama/Biden administration would offer the country a welcome change in direction from the previous George W. Bush administration and the Afghanistan and Iraq wars which consumed it. Consequently, it raised expectations for a better and safer world, not only for Americans but everyone else. During their administration, Obama and Biden followed their global worldview impulses and displayed a willingness to make greater use of the United Nations and other international institutions in resolving the world’s most difficult problems. The centerpiece of their foreign policy and national security strategy was “strategic patience,” a concept built around not immediately reacting to global crises, and instead, looking to the international community to resolve them.
How well did the Obama/Biden approach work? The 2016 U.S. Intelligence Community’s Worldwide Threat Assessment provides a glimpse of what the world looked like after eight years of pursuing Obama/Biden administration policies. It isn’t a pretty picture. For example, the Obama/Biden administration’s U.S. Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, briefed Congress on the security threats identified by 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. Mr. Clapper, among other things, reported :
Violent extremists were operationally active in about 40 countries. Seven countries experienced a collapse of central government authority, 14 others faced regime threatening or violent instability or both. And another 59 countries faced a significant risk of instability.
There were more Sunni violent extremist groups, members, and safe havens than at any time in history. The rate of foreign fighters traveling to the conflict zones in Syria and Iraq in the past few years was without precedent. At least 38,200 foreign fighters — including at least 6,900 from Western countries — traveled to Syria from at least 120 countries since 2012.
The Iranian Shiite regime continued to be the foremost state sponsor of terrorism and exerted its influence in regional crises in the Mid-East through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Quds Force. And its terrorist partner Lebanese Hezbollah remained a continuing terrorist threat to U.S. interests and partners worldwide.
North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test; China continued to modernize its nuclear missile force and is striving for a secure, second-strike capability; Russia continued to have the largest and most capable, foreign nuclear-armed ballistic missile force, and developed an intermediate range cruise missile that violated the INF Treaty; and Iran likely viewed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as a means to remove sanctions and preserve nuclear capabilities.
A record level of migrants, more than one million arrived in Europe, and was predicted to grow in number. Migration and displacement strained countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Overall, there were some 60 million people displaced globally.
And other non-government and government organizations confirmed the U.S. intelligence community’s bleak assessment.
Freedom House’s 2016 report stated that “Global freedom (e.g., democracy and human rights) declined for the 10th consecutive year as economic pressures and fear of unrest led authoritarians to crack down on dissent, while migration and terrorism fueled xenophobia in democracies.”
The 2016 Institute for Economics and Peace’s Global Peace Index showed a decade-long decline in peace with terrorism at an all-time high, battle deaths from conflict at a 25-year high, and the number of refugees and displaced people at a level not seen in 60 years. [PDF] Global Peace Index 2016 – Institute for Economics and Peace
The 2016 U.S. State Department’s annual report on terrorism listed 59 foreign terrorist organizations (about 75 percent of them having gestated and operating in Muslim-majority countries) that threaten U.S. citizens and interests — a growth of 34 percent since its 2009 report.
More recently, former Vice President Biden chastised President Trump for attempting to treat communist China — the world’s most populated country, with one of the world’s largest militaries, a large nuclear capability, and with a history of cyber-thievery against American businesses and citizens) as an unfair competitor to the United States. In doing so, he greatly understated the national security threat China poses to the United States even though China engaged in hostile acts against the U.S. during the Obama/Biden administration.
In 2013, a Virginia-based cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, in a report titled , “Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” reportedly traced 141 major hacking attempts to China’s People’s Liberation Army spanning 20 major industries since 2006 — 115 of them against U.S. targets. China’s top U.S. targets were aerospace, energy, information technology, satellites and telecommunications, public administration, and consulting information. The stolen information used to wage economic, military, and political sabotage and warfare against the United States.
In 2015, the U.S. government disclosed that Chinese hackers breached U.S. Office of Personnel Management computer system and accessed the personnel and security records of some 22 million Americans — likely for nefarious purposes.
In sum, the Obama/Biden approach to handling world affairs and U.S. security during the eight years of their administration did not succeed — with global terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and human suffering rising and global freedom retreating. Additionally, communist China increased its activities against the United States, and according to the CIA World Factbook, emerged as the world’s largest economy.
It’s rather remarkable that Biden, who was the architect and champion of many of these failed foreign policies, would deign to label the incumbent U.S. President as an existential security threat when so many foreign policy calamities happened on his watch.
President Trump won a free and fair presidential election by offering American voters a stark change in direction from the Obama/Biden globalist policies and the established D.C. national security and crony capitalist order. He promised to avoid unnecessary future wars, curb illegal immigration, have recalcitrant international allies pay their fair share for common defense, redo trade deals that harm American businesses and consumers, and serve as Free World leader in protecting American interests and people. It is how a constitutional republic should operate. And if President Trump poses an existential threat to anyone or anything it’s to the Obama/Biden way of doing things, not to U.S. national security.

The Orwellian Attack on Section 101,spectator.org,Mytheos Holt,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-orwellian-attack-on-section-101/,"The Orwellian Attack on Section 101 A Republican senator joins in the effort to destroy the language of patent law. Sen. Thom Tillis (C-Span/YouTube screenshot) Top Stories by William Murchison
I magine the following scenario: You spend your life slaving away at building some ingenious new device in your garage. After years of painstaking work, testing, and sleepless nights, you finally produce your device, patent it, and take it to market.
However, before you can take it to market, someone serves you with a lawsuit. Another person has apparently “patented” the machine you just built, and even though they’ve never put one second into developing it, they claim to own the product of your work. But, they say, if you just pay them a few thousand dollars, they’ll go away and not threaten your business. Being someone with pride, who doesn’t approve of protection rackets, you tell them to stuff it.
So, you fight. And wouldn’t you know it, you take your case to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO), and their Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) finds that the “patent” you’re being sued over isn’t valid. The trial lawyers who tried to extort you slink away for the day. But then, they come back with a different “patent.” You see, your machine includes one part that spins, and they have a patent for “spinning metal things” that you now have to contest before you can take your world changing invention to the market.
Under modern patent law, this second lawsuit would get slapped down so fast that it would make your head spin. But, thanks to the patent snowflakes among America’s trial lawyers, who find any judgment on the merits of their bogus patents triggering, and thanks to enablers of theirs in Congress, that may soon cease to be the case.
This is because the lawyers and their corrupt friends have come up with a way to do an end-run not just around the numerous Supreme Court cases that have smacked them down over and over, but around one of the key, foundational tenets of American patent law. That tenet is expressed in Section 101 of the Patent Act, passed in 1870, which states:
Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.
The relevant phrase here is “new and useful,” a set of requirements that seems commonsensical, but that in actuality provides the basis for distinguishing patents for genuine inventions from mere pieces of paper meant to prop up lawsuits over unenforceable nonsense. In other words, it’s what prevents someone from simply patenting “spinning metal things,” which is neither a new invention nor, by itself, a useful one. In practice, this means that Section 101 is for frivolous patent litigants what Room 101 is to dissidents in George Orwell’s 1984: the equivalent of being broken by their worst fear.
It’s no surprise, then, that trial lawyers and vampiric patent-holding companies known colloquially as patent trolls, hate Section 101 with a passion and want to defang it. And, ironically, Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) have proven what a bad idea this is by introducing a bill that may be new, but is anything but useful. Among other changes, the bill removes the language requiring that patentable inventions be “new and useful” altogether, instead relying on a legal framework for patents that can best be summarized as “patent first, and ask questions later.” In so doing, the bill aims to wipe out over a century of patent law, and return America to the bad old days when trial lawyers could make endless hay off of suing inventors, who were forced to spin their wheels… wait, am I still allowed to say “spin their wheels”? Who knows, that might be patentable under the Coons and Tillis bill.
Let’s be absolutely clear: this bill, and the coalition of leeches pushing it, is anti-American garbage. It is impossible to sustain the rule of law surrounding intellectual property in a world where almost everything can not only be patented, but also be the subject of contradictory, overlapping patents, with the only way to tell which of those patents is legitimate being a legal war of all against all. And while the patent bloodsuckers like to wrap their policies in the mantle of property rights, a world where those property rights are the subject of endless haggling is one where the concept of property rights will come to be seen as useless, when properly applied, it should be the fruit of innovation. It is not surprising that the vampires lurking in America’s patent system, having lost so often in the existing legal system, might seek to ban the legal equivalent of holy water and stakes. But we can only hope that Congress is not taken in by their hypnosis."
"Yes, Trump Can Win Again",spectator.org,Jeffrey Lord,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/yes-trump-can-win-again/,"Yes, Trump Can Win Again Polls that were wrong in 2016 are repeating their mistake. by Betsy McCaughey
T here they go again.
Today, in Orlando, Florida, President Trump will make his formal announcement that he is indeed running for re-election.
And like clockwork, the same un-wisdom that insisted he could never win in 2016 is being trotted out yet again. That un-widsom is, yet again, the polls, the polls, the polls. The headlines scream: Biden beats Trump! Sanders beats Trump! Warren beats Trump! Harris beats Trump! Buttigieg and Booker beat Trump!
Right. Recall this headline from the New York Times that ran — yes, indeed — the morning of the 2016 election?
Hillary Clinton has an 85% chance to win.
Got that? The very morning of the election — not 500-plus days out — the New York Times was telling its readers that Trump had a bare 15% chance of winning. The following day, with Trump now officially president-elect, Politico was headlining this :
How did everyone get it so wrong?
Polls and predictive models failed to predict Trump’s strength.
The Politico story said, in part, this:
Everybody was wrong. Again.
When Election Day dawned, almost all the pollsters, analytics nerds and political insiders in the country had Hillary Clinton waltzing into the White House.
By the time polls had closed nationwide on Tuesday night, those projections had been left in shambles — just like the ones a year ago that all-but ruled out the possibility of Donald Trump winning the Republican Party’s presidential nomination.
Here’s an entirely different headline in the Orlando Sentinel — from yesterday, Monday. In Orlando, Tuesday — tonight — the President will be in Orlando to make his formal announcement for re-election. The headline:
Trump supporters line up 42 hours early for Orlando campaign rally at Amway Center
This story began as follows:
With tents, sleeping bags and coolers of water in tow, Donald Trump supporters began lining up for Tuesday’s campaign rally in Orlando, nearly two full days before the event.
Outside the Amway Center, where President Trump will officially kick off his 2020 re-election bid at 8 p.m. Tuesday, about two dozen people and counting had staked out a spot along Division Street as of Monday morning.
“This is the big one,” said Jennifer Petito, 54, of Melbourne. “This is the mother of all rallies.”
Petitio, who was wearing a pink “Women for Trump” hat and a red-and-white striped fanny pack, was second in line. She said she got there around 2 a.m. — 42 hours before the rally’s start.
The Amway has capacity for about 20,000 people. Trump tweeted Monday that there had been more than 100,000 requests for tickets. People in line said they had been told the first 100 people would get to sit in the front row.
City officials had previously said they expected people to start lining up Monday.
You would think that by now those supposed wizards of political smarts would have learned — but, alas, not so. Yet with the evidence of Trump’s support right there in Orlando for all to see, the same pollsters who got both Trump’s nomination and election wildly wrong in 2016 — are at it again.
Well on top of Trump’s obvious support with the same people who got him elected the first time, there is the historical record. This one.
Here’s a simple historical fact. Of America’s 45 presidents (actually 44 except that Grover Cleveland is usually counted twice for two non-consecutive terms), only 10 who sought re-election lost a second term. And as mentioned, Cleveland lost his re-election bid in 1888 to Benjamin Harrison, who in turn lost his 1892 re-election to Cleveland. The ten re-election losers were:
John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, Cleveland, Harrison, William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush.
To a person, the ten second-term losing presidents have one of two things in common — and sometimes both things. Number one: the economy has gone badly in their presidency, angering voters. Or number two, the president is representing three-terms of his party being in the White House, two terms for his immediate predecessor and one for his own. And the American people were ready for change.
Of those ten one- term presidents?
– John Adams in 1800 was in the third term of what had become the Federalist Party, preceded by the two-term Founding Father first president, George Washington. And it was a party that was so divided that the Alexander Hamilton faction contributed to Adams’ defeat.
– John Quincy Adams in 1828 lost with the economy playing a big role in his defeat by the populist Andrew Jackson.
– In 1840 Martin Van Buren’s second term bid went down, in considerable measure because of the economy — the Panic of 1837.
– In 1888 once again it was the economy in several forms. Cleveland supported tariff reductions — seen as a threat to the jobs of emerging factory workers. Harrison appealed to those workers — and won.
– In 1892, the reverse occurred. Voters were unhappy with the Harrison economic record — and, with a third party populist on the ballot — Cleveland became the only president in history to win a second, non-consecutive term.
– The 1912 election was to some degree unique. President William Howard Taft had been president Theodore Roosevelt’s chosen successor as the GOP nominee, and Taft won. By 1912 Teddy Roosevelt was furious his successor had abandoned TR’s increasingly progressive policies and challenged him for the nomination. The battle was bitter, with TR losing at the convention and promptly declaring he would run as the “Bull Moose” candidate with a Progressive Party nomination. After three GOP terms, the GOP split gave Democrat Woodrow Wilson the victory.
– In 1932 the Great Depression was in its fourth year — and incumbent Herbert Hoover the successor to two GOP presidents. The combination brought a historic landslide defeat at the hands of Franklin Roosevelt.
– In 1976, with the economy idling and scandal — Watergate — in the recent past, President Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter.
– Four years later in 1980 the Jimmy Carter economy was even worse, his second term blocked by Ronald Reagan.
– In 1992, George H.W. Bush stumbled on going against his 1988 pledge not to raise taxes, and the Clinton presidency began.
In 2020? If President Trump’s economy is still roaring along as it is today — the best economy since 1969 — the historical record would suggest a strong re-election victory. As noted over at Newsmax whether the economic variable is unemployment, GDP, wages, the stock market, gas prices, the unemployment rate for minorities, manufacturing jobs, taxes and regulations, Nasdaq, and various other issues — all collectively have produced this vibrant economy.
All of which says that the polls out there today that suggest — 500 days out — that any of those top Democrats can beat President Trump — are sadly mistaken. Just as they were in 2016.
And if there is any doubt?
Take a look at all those Americans lining up for that Trump rally in Orlando."
"Basically, Bernie Sanders Is a Communist",spectator.org,Dov Fischer,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/basically-bernie-sanders-is-a-communist/,"Basically, Bernie Sanders Is a Communist In his case, it’s not an epithet. by Betsy McCaughey Certain Strong Political Pejoratives Are Thrown Around Viciously, Irresponsibly, and With No Relation to Their Meaning.
Responsible people recoil when politically pejorative terms are hurled around. The Left, for example, now calls opponents “Racist!” without any basis. The Southern Poverty Law Center, once an address for identifying true prejudice, now has lost all claim to seriousness by defaming even morally decent, mainstream legal-defense groups like Alliance Defending Freedom as bigots — even as their own conduct has been rife with sexual abuse creating a hostile work environment . On campuses across the country, some professors who cannot be fired, because their academic tenure protects them even when they spout irresponsible and even insane notions, hurl the term “Racist!” at any conservative who comes their way. People who believe in the truth of religious scripture are denounced as homophobes — and, sure, may as well call them “Racist!” too. People who believe that public bathrooms should be individuated by gender are called haters and homophobes — and of course “Racist!” People who condemn Islamic terror are tagged as Islamophobes. Oh, yeah — and “Racist!”
The word “Racist!” has no meaning anymore. During the Wasted Obama Decade , Holy War rampages by Arab Muslims on Jihad were called “ workplace violence ,” but opponents of Obamacare were called “Racist!” When one compares a contemplative reasoned federal judge who is pro-life with David Duke and Adolf Hitler — well, “Racist!” means nothing. Maybe that is the reason that the true racists — Al Sharpton , Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory , etc. — never are called “Racist!” but instead hurl the epithet at others who simply agree with the economic principles of Milton Friedman or the founding principles of the Constitution.
There is no end to the outrageous defamation and hyperbolic character assassination. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is tagged as “ racist ” by Buttigieg, a squirt from South Bend, who quickly has emerged as strangely obsessed with a perception that Israel is one of the world’s greatest problems. President Trump now regularly is tagged as “Racist!” — a term never used against him through the decades upon decades that he was in public life among the New York glitterati, left and right, Democrat and Republican, Clinton and Bush, and even hosted a wildly popular weekly television program on Leftist NBC. He was the darling of late-night talk shows. Jesse Jackson associated with him, Don King, Jim Brown. Suddenly, as he entered a Presidential race and emphasized the need to gain control over the national emergency at our southern border, he was coronated “Racist!” When he saw the chaos and violence and murder at Charlottesville, he forcefully condemned neo-Nazis and White Supremacist extremists, but he also observed that Antifa fascists on the Left also were in the mix and also are despicable, and he correctly distinguished that others among the demonstrators that day were decent people who simply wanted to protect historic monuments to great fallen Civil War heroes like Gen. Robert E. Lee. To this day, the Charlottesville “Racist!” hoax that has been leveled against the President is despicably employed whenever the Left and their media wing have an opportunity.
Indeed, in the early days of the Trump Presidential campaign, a similar concerted lie was propagated, tagging him as “anti-Semitic.” As insane as the charge was when leveled against a father of an Orthodox Jewish daughter whom he continues to cherish, a grandfather of Orthodox Jewish grandchildren he loves, a defender and supporter of Israel, and a lifelong friend of Jewish colleagues and employees, nothing seemed capable of stopping that defamation. CNN, MSNBC, all the Left media vehicles on air and in print, just kept pouring it on: “Racist!” “Anti-Semite!” “Homophobe!” “Islamophobe!” All lies, big lies. Damned Lies. And yet more Damned Lies. Such Left Media epithet-hurling now is part of the modern diction and practice of chilling speech and stifling honest debate. Irresponsible name-calling and lying.
When Laura Ingraham warmly waved to an audience at the 2016 Republican Presidential nominating convention, the photograph of her outstretched arm was circulated with lies that she was offering a Nazi salute. The Left Media tagged Sean Hannity as an “anti-Semite” for a while. And yet, to paraphrase that infamous Lloyd Bentsen debate moment, I know anti-Semites. I have lived among anti-Semites. And, no, those wonderful people — the Trumps, Ingrahams, and Hannitys — could not be more decent to Jews. If you want to find anti-Semites, look for Linda Sarsour , Tamika Mallory, Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan. But CNN and MSNBC will not speak that truth. Nor will the New York Times or Washington Post . And, again, keep your eyes on Buttigieg as he gets increasingly desperate; this squirt is revealing a serious Jewish Problem, and his fixation against Israel is starting to take hold.
The vicious name calling. When Vice President Mike Pence defended his Christian faith and his wife’s teaching at a Christian school, the Pences were blasted as haters and homophobes. Any time any honest comment is made about the prevalence of violence and terror in Arab regimes, or the Islamic undercurrent behind a terror attack, the Linda Sarsours try diverting focus by leading the charge of “Islamophobe!” and “Racist!” When the same Pence explained that he does not go on dinner meetings with women unless accompanied by his wife, the shrill screams of “mysoginist!” filled the air. When a Vermont Screwball Advocates Communism, It Is Fair to Call Him a Communist — Even If He Prefers to be Called “Socialist.”
In a world now sullied and tarred by vicious name-calling in politics, a responsible conservative is duty-bound to pause before calling a Left-extremist a “Communist.” That term has been abused and misapplied, often in terrible ways, so should be employed but gingerly. Nevertheless, the time has come. Basically, Bernie Sanders is a Communist.
The fact that Sanders has not shot people at midnight nor put people in a Gulag prison chain nor forced normative Orthodox Jews like me to be concentrated in a Reeducation Camp means nothing. He never has had the power to do so. But what does he really stand for? What would he do if he had the power that he realistically never will have?
We know he would give the Boston Marathon bomber the right to vote, that he would extend that franchise to all American terrorists. Thus, if John Hinckley misses Reagan the first time, he still gets to vote against Reagan. Or those two crazy women in northern California — Squeaky Fromme and Sarah Jane Moore — who made history by each trying to be the first female American Presidential assassin, each trying to assassinate the same President, seventeen days apart, and each missing. Sanders would let them each vote against Ford afterward, assuming they did not miss the ballot chad hole. But that alone does not make him a Communist, just a lunatic. Or, as they say in Democrat Presidential Clown Car: “Yes, that is a conversation we should be having.”
How to know whether Sanders merely is a Vermont socialist, a redistributionist from the state of Ben & Jerry’s and maple syrup, who wants to seize other people’s hard-earned assets and then redistribute them to the socially favored — or a true dyed-in-the-red Communist?
A first indicator has got to come from his having opted to honeymoon in the most repressive, criminally evil empire of its time: the former Soviet Union. What kind of American would honeymoon in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? Of all the places to choose — Hawaii, the Caribbean, Costa Rica, London, Paris (of yore), Rome, Athens… heck, even the Dominican Republic — he goes to Communist Russia ? To the place and government system that gave the world the Ukrainian Golodomor Holocaust, Babi Yar, the Stalin show trials, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, the Gulag Archipelago? A Purgatory in which Christians were begging the world to take note of their plight, and from which Jews throughout the world were fleeing by the hundreds of thousands to Israel and America, this Communist went to the Soviet Union and partied ?
Nor was he jolted or stunned into reality by what he saw. Rather, he stood by his praises of Communist bread lines: “That’s a good thing!” Praised the beautiful train stations. Yes, and Mussolini made the trains run on time.
Likewise he praised Castro’s Communist Cuba. He attended the Communist Sandinista celebrations in Nicaragua and praised them . He described the Sandinistas as heroic, encouraging them to keep fighting to victory.
In 1974, running unsuccessfully in Vermont for the Senate, Sanders advocated the “public takeover of all privately owned electric companies in Vermont.” That is how it works in Communism. The Government takes over private sectors, one at a time, for the “common good.” Then, for the common good, the Government assures that everything will be free. Higher education — college tuition — will be free; it is a basic human right, like breathing. Medical care will be free. All people, regardless of whether they work, will be guaranteed a weekly or monthly paycheck from the Government to assure a good living wage. As Mark Levin has noted , the entire Bernie Sanders agenda is a page taken straight out of Josef Stalin’s Bill of Rights. Truly — The Bernie Sanders “Bill of Rights” nearly identically parallels Articles 118-122 from Stalin’s 1936 Constitution.
Where will the money come from to support Bernie’s Stalinism? He answers: “The People will be delighted to pay higher taxes for it.” It is good for the social weal, so it is called “Socialism.” That sounds nice. “Socialism,” as in “Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.” Or another nice lyric: Adolf Hitler’s “National Socialism .”
In the end, it never works for long before tyranny sets in. It has been tried so many times these past two centuries that it no longer is a political theory . For example, the Left likes to talk about “Climate Change Deniers,” a term they heap on Climate Realists . Well, on the subject of “Socialism,” the political science has been settled, and it never works when Government takes other people’s money in the name of spending it more wisely, effectively, and efficiently than can the people who actually work for it, earn it, and know what they actually need and want. In time, everyone cheats the system, each in his or her own way. Conservatives may deeply despise Bezos of Amazon and Zuckerberg of Facebook, among others in that Left bubble, but fair-minded conservatives will recognize that those guys earned their gazillions. They created entities that impacted the world. Yet, under true socialism, they would have to settle for the same measly stipend that the lazy and driftless get paid. Sure, they now pay lip service to such “justice” because it is good for their businesses — but they immediately would be the first ones to find ways to cheat a communist system. Indeed, they already outflank even the free-market system. In 2016, Amazon earned $5.6 billion but paid essentially no federal taxes. That is how it works.
It always happens that way. They move money offshore and overseas. Some stash cash in floor tiles. Others get paid “off the books.” Some create a black market economy. Others trade in-kind services to avoid cash transactions. And they shmear the public officials, the constables, the cops, the politicians, directly or otherwise. In the worst case, they move their assets to Switzerland or the Caymans, and then they leave the country the next day.
The ones who get away with it become wealthy expatriates and even buy sports teams. The ones who stay behind do well, as do all the highest-ranking Socialist political leaders, who receive special dispensations, special housing, special clothing allowances, special housing, special everything. And then, one day, the Bezos or Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett inadvertently lands on the wrong side of the politician then in power, and that night he is taken out of bed in the middle of the night by a cadre of NKVD police, brought to a clandestine location where he is put on trial for “Crimes Against the People,” is found guilty, is allowed an appeal before a learned tribunal five minutes later, is found guilty, may appeal to a highest tribunal and is found guilty five minutes later, then is shot to death in a small room with a floor drain in the middle of the room, so that the blood quickly can be shpritzed away, leaving behind no evidence that he ever existed. His name is removed from all books. The People seize all his assets. His family is sent to a life of hard labor, while his closest relatives and associates next are arrested and likewise drained away.
That is how it works. That is how it always works.
Bernie Sanders is just crazy enough, just old enough, just irrelevant enough so that, for all the static he generates, he never will be elected anything of consequence outside Vermont. He could gain currency outside Vermont only in a race against someone as hated as Hillary, where the result of the nomination process was assured in advance anyway, where the fix was in, so he was allowed to play with the children outside. They let him rant and ramble because, unknown to him and his army of The Sophomoric undergrads, Hillary was assured the nomination. The DNC will let him play in the sandbox again this season. He will get his applause, and he will raise his millions. He will never get elected President. Obama’s handpicked CIA chief, John Brennan, never got to see Gus Hall, the Communist for whom he voted , become our president. Nor will Crazy Bernie become our first Communist President.
But we must be ever so vigilant to assure that no one else for whom Gus Hall and Bernie Sanders have broken ice ever becomes that either."
Archbishop Viganò Confirms Allegations About Monsignor Rossi,spectator.org,George Neumayr,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/archbishop-vigano-confirms-allegations-about-monsignor-rossi/,"Archbishop Viganò Confirms Allegations About Monsignor Rossi “You can read about him online on The American Spectator website,” he says. Cardinal Viganò with Pope Francis (Catholic News Service/YouTube screenshot) Top Stories by John Jiang
“A rchbishop Carlo Maria Viganò is confirming that, as papal nuncio, he received complaints of homosexual predation and harassment by Msgr. Walter Rossi, rector of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.,” reports Christine Niles of Church Militant .
Speaking to the Italian journalist Marco Tosatti recently, Viganò said, ”Monsignor Rossi is, without a doubt, a member of the ‘gay mafia.’ You can read about him online on The American Spectator website.”
“I can say that, while I was a nuncio in the United States, I received the documentation that states that Msgr. Rossi had sexually molested male students at the Catholic University of America,” according to Viganò. “The Vatican, in particular Cdl. [Pietro] Parolin, is well aware of the situation of Msgr. Rossi, as is Cdl. Wuerl.”
“I can finally testify that Rossi’s name was proposed for promotion to my predecessor, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, who blocked his progress,” Viganò added. “These facts clearly show how the ‘gay mafia’ operates.”
The American Spectator articles to which Viganò refers are “ Monsignor Rossi, Wuerl’s Gay Mafioso at the Basilica ” and “ The Day of Reckoning for Monsignor Rossi and the Hierarchy .”
In those pieces, I reported:
A number of alumni from the Catholic University of America (CUA) have told me that Rossi “hit” on them and “groomed” them. In one case, I was told, Rossi asked a CUA student about his gay roommate (with whom Rossi was overly familiar) and insinuated that the three of them should get together for group sex.
“Rossi is a gay sexual harasser of CUA students,” said this alumnus to me… “Rossi would groom CUA students,” says a D.C. archdiocesan source. “If they submitted to him, he would reward them; if they didn’t, he would treat them poorly, and if they worked at the Basilica, he would make life miserable for them until they left.”
Imitating his boss [Theodore] McCarrick and his old boss [confirmed gay predator Bishop Michael Bransfield], Rossi arrogantly assumed that no member of the faithful would ever dare call him out on his scandalous life. If they could get away with it, he appears to have reasoned, why can’t I?
Yet the day of reckoning approaches. Members of the Gay Mafia, of which that trio is emblematic, have exploited the naïveté and docility of the Catholic faithful for years, who are now wising up to that mafia’s grotesque decadence.
That day of reckoning is now emerging in the form of whistle-blowing from Viganò, an archbishop and former papal nuncio in the U.S., whose powerful testimony has been consistently vindicated and can’t be dismissed as the carping of a layman. To understand the turbulence and scandal of this period in the Church’s life, clearly one of its most corrupt, future Church historians will rely heavily on Viganò’s testimony. Until Viganò no one that high in the Church had ever provided such specific confirmation of details shedding light on the gay mafia in the Church.
Last week Viganò commented to the Washington Post :
Not only have my testimonies not been denied, but some of the facts they contain have been independently confirmed. To cite just two examples, the letter of [then-Archbishop Leonardo] Sandri to [New York] Father [Boniface] Ramsey confirmed my assertion that Vatican officials knew of the McCarrick allegations as early as 2000, and Cardinal [Marc] Ouellet, in his open letter to me, confirmed that he told me in person and then put in writing the restrictions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick.
As for Pope Francis, his answer to my testimony was “I will not say a single word about this.” Would he have said that if he knew my testimony were false?
Monsignor Rossi, through a spokeswoman, furnished a lawyerly, beside-the-point, and vague denial to Church Militant about Viganò’s latest testimony:
The National Shrine has never received any credible allegations of improper conduct by Monsignor Rossi. To the contrary, in 2018 Monsignor Rossi publicly condemned the issues of abuse that have plagued the Catholic Church (statement attached). The recent claims by Archbishop Viganò are baseless and without merit or substantiation.
Notice that the statement says the “National Shrine” has not received any complaints. That wasn’t Viganò’s testimony. He said that as the pope’s representative in the U.S. he had “received the documentation that states that Msgr. Rossi had sexually molested male students at the Catholic University of America.” Rossi can’t deny that, so instead says “recent claims” without specification.
Let’s hope Viganò continues to unravel the web of corrupt clericalism that McCarrick, Bransfield, and Wuerl, among others, spun in the Church — a signal service to her reform."
The Catastrophic Costs of Weed Culture,spectator.org,John Jiang,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-catastrophic-costs-of-weed-culture/,"Blog The Catastrophic Costs of Weed Culture The New York Times and Washington Post join in raising serious alarm about the damage marijuana does to young minds. by William Murchison
E vidence is beginning to mount that marijuana may cause lasting brain damage, even when used by people in their mid-20s.
At a time when politics and culture appear to be increasingly pro-pot— two-thirds of Americans now support legalization—scientists have provided yet another reason to exercise caution. A piece published by the New York Times on Sunday, written by two physicians, warns that repeat use of the popular drug causes measurable IQ declines in young people. Another article published around the same time by the Washington Post raises similar alarms and also links marijuana usage to misuse of nicotine and even opioids.
These warnings come at a time when it seems that the United States is barrelling toward total pot legalization. Recreational use of marijuana is already legal in ten states, D.C., and multiple U.S. territories, and medical-only use is permitted in a further 23 states. The Washington Post article suggests that state legalization is exacerbating already-dire drug problems in public high schools. Colleges students, who are old enough to purchase pot but young enough to be hurt by it, have it even worse. Every major candidate running for the Democratic nomination in 2020, with the possible exception of Joe Biden, has endorsed federal legalization at least implicitly — and even Biden is likely to fold once he begins feeling the heat from progressive activists.
That is not to say that the right should necessarily double down and oppose legalization. Whether legalization should be permitted on a state level or even enforced on a federal level is a debate worth having between those on the right with socially conservative sensibilities and those that consider themselves libertarian. For one, the argument that being dangerous to adolescents warrants banning a substance for all adults has relatively few legs to stand on. Furthermore, it appears that leniency has the advantage even among Republicans, with President Trump endorsing bipartisan measures toward clemency for low-level drug offenders. Jeff Sessions, who was for two years the most anti-drug cabinet member in the Trump administration, resigned from his position as Attorney General in late 2018 having mostly failed to impede the momentum toward legalization.
If nationwide legalization is inevitable, however, social conservatives still have a role to play in correcting the excesses of progressive thinking. Through internet culture and Hollywood, toking is marketed as an integral aspect of youth culture. Bragging about getting high is now a political strategy for appealing to young voters. Binge drinking is portrayed as antisocial, chain-smoking as unspeakably dangerous, but being a college stoner is often cast as harmless, fun, even profound. Never mind the risk of reduced quality of life and hidden economic damage due to permanently decreased intelligence, poorer memory, and hindered ability to concentrate. Never mind the risk of escalation into opioid use. Using weed is cool , damn the consequences.
Whether conservatives should endorse the suggestion advanced in the New York Times piece and push for a legal minimum age of 25 for purchasing marijuana is up for debate. Perhaps the solution is more fundamental, part of the long-running conservative effort to restore stable families with responsible parental guidance, insulated from drug-fueled escapism. In any case, the science now confirms that marijuana is more dangerous to more people than is popularly believed. Armed with these facts, conservatives must redouble their efforts to reintroduce much-needed moderation into the national dialogue on drugs."
And We Did It!,spectator.org,William Murchison,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/and-we-did-it/,"by John Jiang
W here do the Hong Kong Chinese get these notions: such as that the right to a fair trial is rock-bottom basic to every democratic concept of justice? And the notion that freedom of speech underpins the whole, so to speak, democratic shooting match? Where’d that come from?
From us, that’s where — from the British and their American legatees, in whose minds and historical experience originated the understanding that you can’t let government have its own way, no questions asked; because when and where you do, it’s all over for freedom.
You have to have rules. You need procedures and guarantees: constitutions, written (as in the U.S.) or unwritten (Great Britain). According to the rules, you do things in certain and particular ways: the selection of leaders, the writing of legislation, the review of disputes by impartial courts.
Which isn’t — not totally — how they do things in today’s Hong Kong, where hundreds of thousands march in defense of the rules under which the former British colony prospered for a century and a half. It is inspiring to see these people march. It is urgent to remember why they march. They march for human fulfillment: with the same spirit in which present-day Americans might march should they stop screaming insults at each other and call to mind how much they agree on, when it gets down to brass tacks.
Even in a culture riven by strife — guess whose culture? — the principle of liberty under law makes possible human fulfillment in its broadest terms. I did not say it guaranteed anything of the kind. I said it made fulfillment achievable, with generosity and toleration: human attributes of which dictators like Xi Jinping make short work.
The defects of human nature, which political figures are always trying to cure, foil the finest schemes of Ultimate Improvement. Ultimate Improvement is what we have always relied on heaven to furnish; but, then, as we know, political figures get no credit for acknowledging as much. With their quest for instant rewards, conferred through elections and polls, we’re all too familiar. At least where the rule-of-law principle prevails, they can’t go completely overboard, as in Communist China, where the only obstacle to the party bosses’ total domination is the bosses’ private sense of what they can get away with. I mean, look. An American Republican would rightly prefer Nancy Pelosi to Xi. An American Democrat, swallowing hard, would rightly give Xi the go-by in favor of Him Who Must Not be Named.
Proving what? That democracy isn’t easy? Of course it’s not easy. Consider Hong Kong, whose turmoil stems from a communist initiative, only half-thwarted, to merge that semi-independent territory’s justice system into the dark and inexplicable system under which the rest of China squirms.
Not a few American and British, shall we say, Thought Leaders mop brows in mortification over wrongs, fancied or actual, committed by their countrymen in pursuit of national greatness. We need to mark well what those quests for greatness produced in addition to the acquisition of territory. They spread respect for the rule of law. As in Hong Kong.
Among history’s indisputable facts is that British dominance over a quarter of the globe in the Victorian age and afterwards spread a human rights-concept of justice to regions and peoples who had no concept of such a concept. The late British Empire, for such reasons, was one of civilization’s great success stories. A corollary narrative concerns the spread, under American patronage, of the same British-derived principles of government to allies and clients in the years after World War II.
Sometimes we blew it: supposing, wrongly, that everyone in the world hungers for what Britain and America have, grand as it might be. It’s an imperfect world, as theologians properly remind us. Humanity never gets things exactly right. But when, under the terrible burden of insufficiency you get things righter than others get them, a deep bow still is in order. Like this minute.
Hong Kong’s peril remains unresolved. But what a mighty example these people set for other peoples who hunger for freedom and fulfillment; who may yet find it, the way having been shown, ironically, by those given to questioning the value and integrity of their own glorious achievement.
Meaning us? Meaning us, precisely.

Bernie’s (Almost) Good Idea,spectator.org,Hunt Lawrence and Daniel J. Flynn,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/bernies-almost-good-idea/,"Bernie’s (Almost) Good Idea Employee ownership, properly understood and implemented, strengthens capitalism. by John Jiang
W hat Vox calls Bernie Sanders’s “most socialist idea yet” may instead prove his most capitalist idea. The presidential candidate unveiled a plan to encourage companies to grant employees a stake in the business. Whether this idea comes to fruition as a plan that forces or facilitates employee ownership tells us whether we can call it Sanders’s most socialist, or most capitalist, idea yet.
The legislation sponsored by Sanders does not inspire confidence. It launches a new federal bureaucracy and spends billions of dollars toward the end of employee ownership. It is unclear how “acting as a clearinghouse,” “disseminating information,” “the organization of workshops and conferences,” or other provisions of the bill do much to encourage employee ownership.
A better way exists, and one that increases rather than helps empty the federal treasury.
The tax model preferred by most businesses in the United States remains the limited-liability company (LLC), a legislative construct that originated in Wyoming in 1977. Businessmen like it because it does not impose double-taxation, as experienced by C-corporations, and allows them to pay taxes similar to what an individual filer pays. The downside involves the great difficulty in granting to workers shares of companies taxed as LLCs.
In other words, the tax-code discourages employee ownership by making it incredibly difficult in the tax code that governs most businesses in the United States.
By taxing all companies as C-corporations, the IRS could help transform workers into bosses. To do this without alienating those who prefer the LLC model, legislators should allow stockholders to exercise options without tax on exercise and gain levied at capital gains rates upon selling them. Employee shares/options should be taxed on death after application of marital deduction and other provisions based on the capital gains tax at the time. Stock options in already public companies could also defer tax at exercise and have gains at capital-gains rates. Founders of private businesses will pick C‐corps over LLCs if double tax on dividends and sale proceeds is eliminated.
This may seem more complicated than allocating billions and starting a new Employee Ownership and Participation Initiative within the Department of Labor, as the Sanders legislation proposes. But really it makes life simpler for businessmen and makes the tax code less opaque. Better still, it achieves the objective Bernie Sanders ostensibly wants: more employee ownership.
Sanders’s home state trails only North Dakota and Iowa in its percentage of employee-owned businesses. A nonprofit, the Vermont Employee Ownership Center, exists to aid companies looking to transform workers into capitalists in the Green Mountain State.
Workers owning the means of production may seem like a Marxist dream. But like so many of Marx’s dreams, reality does not conform to it.
“So, for the 1,290 appliances moving in and out of Ritchie Trucking every day, employees see a return when the company is profitable,” The Business Journal reports about a company in Fresno, California. “This has created a culture company-wide where employees have taken it upon themselves to cut costs where they can to increase profitability.”
The article notes that employees, who once enjoyed free coffee cups from their employer, now charge a quarter for each one. Sanders might regard this as proof of capitalism’s greed if Employ by an employer. But when the workers own stakes in the company, miraculous things occur: they become conscious of costs and strive to become more productive. Incentives work that way.
“By expanding employee ownership and participation, we can create stronger companies in Vermont and throughout this country, prevent job losses and improve working conditions for struggling employees,” Senator Sanders explains. “Simply put, when employees have an ownership stake in their company, they will not ship their own jobs to China to increase their profits, they will be more productive, and they will earn a better living.”
This is all true. But it is also the case that workers receiving profits — what Marxists deride as theft in the theory of surplus value — toil longer hours and eliminate fringe benefits (like free coffee). Employees owning the means of production transforms workers into owners more so than the reverse.
More capitalists seem less like the Marxist’s dream than the Marxist’s nightmare.

Sudan Crisis Reveals Shortcomings of Social Media Coverage,spectator.org,John Jiang,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/sudan-crisis-reveals-shortcomings-of-social-media-coverage/,"Sudan Crisis Reveals Shortcomings of Social Media Coverage As mainstream outlets fail Sudan, social media scammers exploit the information gap. by William Murchison
S udan-related posts taking over Instagram feeds are providing irresistible, effort-free opportunities to make a difference in the world: for nothing more than a few taps on your phone, you can provide a meal to a starving Sudanese child.
Unfortunately, the Instagram accounts responsible for the posts, along with dozens of others like them, are fake. There are no meals and no mechanisms for providing aid to Sudan. In fact, the current crisis roiling the country is primarily political and not food-related. Many of the accounts pushing these fake initiatives mishandle basic facts, such as conflating Sudan and South Sudan (where there are indeed famine-like conditions ). Nonetheless, these accounts effortlessly accrue thousands of followers and millions of impressions from armchair activists.
For the Sudan crisis, precipitated after the Sudanese armed forces deposed longtime strongman Omar Al-Bashir and then threatened to install a military dictatorship, coverage by mainstream outlets has been sluggish and hard to come by . The story is currently absent from the home page of BBC World News as well as the World section of the New York Times , despite mass murder and rape by the Sudanese security apparatus and the fate of a potential democracy hanging in the balance. Stories chosen to be displayed in its place include people being chased by elephants and camera filter mishaps .
Mainstream media failure, slacktivist culture, and the impressions-over-depth nature of social media have coalesced into a perfect storm of misinformation and scams. The various aesthetics being employed, from official solidarity profile images to the awareness-for-its-own-sake posts being churned out by the dozen, push it to the point of self-parody.
All this is evocative of Kony 2012 , the slickly-produced YouTube video about the eponymous African warlord that effectively founded the genre of viral awareness campaigns and which has since become a byword for their impotency: all of the attention paid to Kony amounted to very little, and as of 2019 he is still alive and at large in the forests of Uganda. We can anticipate similar results from all of the liking, retweeting, and reblogging being done on behalf of Sudan. Meanwhile, scammers are having a great time. A playbook is emerging: find a trending slacktivist cause, lie your way into going viral, and then use your newfound audience to peddle your own product or business. The absence of rigorous reporting and informed readers leaves behind only empty hype and cynical exploitation."
The Democratic Twenty Plus Three,spectator.org,"R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-democratic-twenty-plus-three/,"by Christian Josi
W ashington
Last week I suggested that convicted felons would be running for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. Well, now it looks like that will not be the case. Crazy Bernie suggested a few weeks back that sex offenders and the Marathon bombers should be free to vote, and what is the difference between a felon’s voting for president and a felon’s actually running for the Democratic nomination? They all look the same to Crazy Bernie and doubtless to dozens of other Democratic candidates. But now this reform seems a bit premature. On Friday the Democratic National Committee settled on 20 of the candidates who are running to appear in debates on two separate nights this month, June 26 and June 27. Mark your calendars.
Three candidates did not meet the polling and fund-raising criteria. They are Governor Steve Bullock from Montana, the Hon. Seth Moulton allegedly from a congressional district in Massachusetts, and Mayor Wayne Messam from somewhere in Florida (I hope I have spelled his name right). They will perhaps be carrying placards outside the debate venues at the end of the month. So do not count any of them out this early in the race, especially Governor Bullock.
The lucky 20 include former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who looks much younger than he did when he first ran back in 1987, Kamala Harris who is very pretty if you will allow me to say so, and a woman named Marianne Williamson whom I do not know. Her picture was included in the 20 pictures that the New York Times ran in its Saturday edition, but I have no idea who she is. Frankly, I would appreciate it if one of my readers could identify her for me. She appeared just to the right of Mr. Andrew Yang, who is apparently an entrepreneur and wants to give everyone in America $12,000 a year.
Now the problem for the Democrats remains the problem that I mentioned last week. No candidate wants to disagree with any of the other candidates except perhaps Ms. Williamson, about whom we know nothing. Certainly, l know nothing. This means that there is virtually no way for any of the candidates to distinguish himself or herself from all of the rest.
Already their highly paid and skilled strategists are preparing catchy one-liners, which it is hoped will snag attention for their candidates, but each candidate will get no more than 10 minutes and then it is oblivion for the rest of the evening. Possibly former congressman Beto O’Rourke can drop a “F” bomb on President Donald Trump or Senator Kirsten Gillibrand can engage in bathroom humor while denouncing him. Both have inclined in this direction, but off-color language has little effect in a presidential race. Americans still have their standards.
My guess is that something more dramatic is necessary to attract the attention of the average Democratic voter. How about one of the candidates becoming sick on stage and continuing to orate until his/her 10 minutes are up? Really lay it on. What if Mayor Pete Buttigieg insists on appearing on stage with his wife or husband or whatever? No one has ever done that before. Congressman Eric Swalwell could bring along a used car, put it on stage, and sell it within his allotted 10 minutes (plant a shill in the audience, Congressman). Pocahontas could arrive on stage in Native American garb, or good old Joe could appear on stage delivering his famed speech that he plagiarized from Neil Kinnock but with a lower class English accent.
Former Speaker Newt Gingrich was called upon by the Times asking what advice he would give the 20 aspiring presidential candidates. He was helpful. He said, “Your biggest goal has to be to be likable and acceptable.” Watch for Joe Biden to steal a page from Gingrich’s playbook and hand out candy to the audience.
Do you get my drift? This is the most goofball collection of candidates for the presidency that has ever been gathered. Actually it is inconceivable that any party in American history could summon such a collection of mediocrities and frauds. Plagiarists, charlatans, liars, nonentities — it is amazing that Mr. Yang or maybe even Ms. Williamson would want to be seen in such a crowd.
Many years ago seasoned observers of politics were given to lamenting that the discipline instilled by the political party system was breaking down. I have not heard anyone repeat these warnings in years. They all vanished in a haze created by complaints about “the smoke-filled rooms,” about “party bosses,” or political parties controlling conventions. Now the control political parties have over elections is almost nonexistent. If you want to run for the highest office in the land go ahead and do what Ms. Williamson has done or Mr. Yang. Declare your candidacy and see what happens. Jimmy Carter did that years ago, and he actually won. Thankfully, a few years later there was a more seasoned candidate willing to step in and President Ronald Reagan won the Cold War and enlivened the economy. "
President Trump Awards Arthur Laffer The Presidential Medal of Freedom,spectator.org,Ralph Benko,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/president-trump-awards-arthur-laffer-the-presidential-medal-of-freedom/,"President Trump Awards Arthur Laffer The Presidential Medal of Freedom A world $100 trillion richer. by Jeffrey Lord
T he White House has announced that President Trump is awarding Dr. Arthur B. Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 19th. That, along with the Congressional Gold Medal, is America’s highest civilian award. It is well deserved.
Robert Mundell and Arthur Laffer were Supply-Side Economics’ premier intellectual architects. Supply-Side was roundly mocked by establishment Republicans such as George H.W. Bush, Reagan’s then-rival. Bush memorably dismissed it as “Voodoo Economics.” Most, though not all, Democrats mocked it. Many still do.
Who were the Supply-Siders? Jack Kemp was the political principal and Jeff Bell the political pioneer. Jude Wanniski was our Minister of Propaganda, Robert Novak served as the reporter-of-record and Warren Brookes, the columnist-in-chief. Bob Bartley turned “The Page” of the Wall Street Journal into a morally courageous beacon of sanity in stagflation’s darkness.
Bob Mundell later collected a Nobel Prize in Economics “for his analysis of monetary and fiscal policy under different exchange rate regimes and his analysis of optimum currency areas.”Businessman/philanthropist Lewis E. Lehrman and Kemp aide John Mueller, the American apostles of Jacques Rueff, prevailed with Kemp in their advocacy of the classical gold standard. And let us recall Supply-Side veterans Charles Kadlec, Alan Reynolds, Paul Craig Roberts, and Steve Entin. And Bruce Bartlett, who later apostatized.
Among its titans count publisher and presidential candidate Steve Forbes, George Gilder, author of Wealth and Poverty , “the Bible of Reaganomics,” and Larry Kudlow, now Director of Trump’s National Economic Council. Stephen Moore (with whom I have from time to time been professionally associated) flies the Supply-Side flag high.
I was the most junior member of the Supply-Side in its misty origins. What happened? Call me Ishmael, for I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
On November 13, 1979 Ronald Reagan officially declared for the presidency. On the day of Reagan’s announcement the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 814. As of this writing the Dow closed at 26,014. That’s not adjusted for inflation or population growth. Still, you get the gist.
Reagan campaigned on — while being ridiculed for — Supply-Side Economics. Elected, he put it to good effect. He backed Fed Chairman Paul Volcker’s actions to slay inflation. Reagan crusaded for the Kemp-Roth 30% across-the-board marginal tax rate cut. With full bipartisan support, Reagan also cut the top rate from 70% to 28%. And what followed?
There are not enough fingers among the thought leadership in Washington to count the 25,200 points the Dow then gained. Moreover, in 1979 world GDP was $11T. Now it’s $83T. A billion people or so arose from abject poverty. Much of this prosperity is due to the worldwide embrace of much of Supply-Side Economics.
So what is this much ridiculed, highly successful, thing, Supply-Side Economics? To oversimplify (but not by much), Supply-Side Economics calls for a stable currency. Most of its proponents favored the gold standard to seal the deal.
And tax rates are to be kept low. That will maximize economic growth and optimize federal revenue. Tax rates above a certain level — “Point E” on the Laffer Curve — reduce federal revenue much as overcharging for goods reduces an enterprise’s sales and, thus, revenue. Common sense, really.
The 1975 issue of Irving Kristol’s National Affairs presented its manifesto, by Wanniski: The Mundell-Laffer Hypothesis . Noting that excessive marginal tax rates reduce revenue is a footnote. Most of this essay called for monetary stability to quell the virulent inflation and the sky-high “Misery Index” and restore vibrant economic growth. Wanniski concludes:
“Theirs may or may not be the ‘Copernican revolution’ in economics that is needed. But at the very least, one suspects, it can legitimately claim a proto-Copernican status.”
Forbes.com columnist Nathan Lewis calls stable money (preferably gold) and moderate tax rates in his columns and his most recent book the “ Magic Formula . ” He marvels at why such a simple thing as gold-defined money and low marginal tax rates were, and are, anathema to the policy elites.
My guess? It affronts their vanity. Mundell, in his 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics acceptance speech, observes that it “did not require a great theoretical genius to run gold standards.… It was automatic.” There is little glory in maintaining a system on autopilot, however successful.
A few years ago I estimated the capitalized value of the additional world income created by Mundell and Laffer and their political team to be $100 trillion. It’s even higher now. Thus, Donald Trump’s awarding Arthur Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom is profound. Next… to make America fully great again… on to the gold standard as prescribed in the Mundell-Laffer hypothesis and commended by Candidate Trump!
Ralph Benko founded The Prosperity Caucus in 1985, served as a deputy general counsel in the Reagan White House and is the editor-in-chief of the Supply-Side Blog currently hosted by the Committee to Unleash Prosperity of which Arthur Laffer, Steve Forbes, and Stephen Moore are principals and which Lawrence Kudlow co-founded."
Multiculturalism Is a Nation Killer,spectator.org,Abraham H. Miller,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/multiculturalism-is-a-nation-killer/,"Multiculturalism Is a Nation Killer Identity politics, mobilization, and political devolution.
P olitics is about power, how to get it and how to keep it.
Politics is about mobilizing votes.
It should come as no surprise that candidates can say one thing on one day and another on another day because they will say whatever needs to be said to appeal to the electorate.
Joe Biden instantaneously flip flops on abortion. Barack Obama and Bill Clinton were as much against illegal immigration as is Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton was once against gay marriage .
In totalitarian societies, the truth is what the dictator says at any given moment. In democratic societies, the truth is what the mass public wants to hear at any given moment.
Faced with the outpouring of civil rights demonstrations in American streets, Kennedy said that he needed to get people off the streets, not that he needed to find dignity for the plight of black Americans. That would come later when it would be palatable to mainstream America.
Politics in America is about the competition of interest groups for political power. Once victorious an interest group does not go away; it escalates its demands.
The civil rights movement started out with demands for basic human dignity. Once those were met, it legitimately demanded equality of opportunity, and once that was achieved, it demanded preferential treatment where equality of opportunity was redefined, in Orwellian fashion, as equality of result.
Flush with success, it now demands reparations where those who never were enslaved will receive compensation from those who never owned slaves, all in the name of virtue and justice.
By nature, humans are tribal. Tribalism is the easiest way to organize people and mobilize them politically.
Until very recently, America was a multi-ethnic society with a dominant culture. That culture is breaking apart as we become more tribal, and we begin to think of ourselves in terms of tribal loyalties, as reinforced by political elites.
Multiculturalism is the great myth of our time. The cliché is, “Our strength is our diversity.” But is it? Military officers sent to Vietnam learned that the enemy’s strength was a homogeneous culture, language, and identity.
There is no real multicultural society on the planet that has not tumbled into barbarism or devolution. Whether Lebanon, which institutionalized multiculturalism in its constitution and exploded into ethnic warfare, or Rwanda, where tribalism descended into barbarism, multiculturalism does not work.
Switzerland is not a multicultural society. It has different language groups with one strong, unshakeable identity. The Swiss know who they are. Something we seem to be forgetting.
Ask the white farmers who are being hunted in South Africa like animals, with the eager justification of some black political elites, if Nelson Mandela’s vision of the rainbow society is working.
Minorities will support the idea of multiculturalism as long as it advances their own interests. Consequently, tribalism ironically finds its justification in multiculturalism. In the name of multiculturalism, Muslims want public schools closed on Muslim holidays and halal food in the school cafeterias.
Somehow the tribal aspirations of all cultures are legitimate, unless those tribes are white or Christian.
In the name of multiculturalism, schools have segregated dormitories, student unions, and even graduations .
But imagine if whites wanted to segregate the student union, to have white-only dormitories and graduations? The virtue signalers would descend on the campus in outrage.
Muslims in Seattle wanted their public-school students greeted with a Koranic blessing during Ramadan but let a dozen Christians stand beneath the flag and silently pray in the name of Jesus, and one would think the Constitution was being eviscerated.
The advocates of affirmative action hiring in the name of diversity almost never seek to hire whites where there is a preponderance of minority employees. Diversity is only good when it means hiring minorities in white-dominated situations, not the other way around.
No man or woman wants to be a stranger in their own land, told their culture is illegitimate, or the aspirations of their children must be sidelined because of historic injustices of which they had no part, save that someone with similar skin color was advantaged by them.
We are told it is the essence of bigotry to see the disproportions of black crime and not look beyond race to social and economic factors, but when it comes to the evils of enslavement, all whites are guilty, even those whose ancestors never owned slaves or had not stepped foot in America until slavery was long gone.
The mobilization of tribal instincts is the means for elites — especially the identity-obsessed left — to advance their quest for political power. But in politics, as in physics, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Newton’s Third Law embraces the political world.
Do not expect whites to sit by idly and be told their culture is illegitimate, and they are responsible for all the evils in the world. Expect that they too will be mobilized on the basis of identity.
In the end, if we devolve into a multicultural society, we will have the same political instability as other multicultural societies. The mobilization of people by identity will create a society that is inherently not viable. It is what the left’s myopic obsession with phony multiculturalism and identity politics will bring.

"Dems’ Agenda: Kill Jobs, Pander to Freeloaders",spectator.org,Betsy McCaughey,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/dems-agenda-kill-jobs-pander-to-freeloaders/,"by Abraham H. Miller
N ine Democratic presidential hopefuls, including front-runners Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Liz Warren, flocked to the Poor People’s Moral Action Congress on Monday, each trying to out-pander their rivals and promise the most government handouts.
It was an alarming spectacle for anyone who works for a living. These Democratic candidates don’t believe jobs are the way to end poverty. For them, “work” is a four-letter word. Their approach is to take money from working stiffs and give it to slackers.
Don’t be fooled by the name “ Moral Action Congress .” There’s nothing moral about forcing hard-working people to support indolence.
One in every five American households already lives entirely or mostly off government benefits . A shocking three-quarters of able-bodied food stamp recipients with no children to care for still don’t work, even part time .
President Trump is trying to change that, with new requirements that healthy adults who don’t have to care for family either look for a job, or go to school. In short, get off the couch. Democrats call it “ cruel .”
Monday’s poverty extravaganza was led by agitators claiming to be disciples of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. They’re distorting King’s message. The organizers demand that Uncle Sam guarantee everyone an annual income, free college, free healthcare for all, and a “ decent house to live in .” They claim these are “ rights .” So does Sanders. But people who work for a living know better. These aren’t rights government owes you. These are things you earn yourself.
Forum organizer Rev. William Barber rails that nearly half the nation — 140 million people — are mired in poverty and suffering. That’s a blatant lie, though none of the candidates set the record straight.
Truth is, 40 million people — about 12% of the population — earn less than the federal poverty line, which is currently $12,490 for a single person and $25,750 for a family of four . But almost no one actually lives on that. All but 3% collect welfare payments that lift them out of poverty. They depend on government, instead of themselves.
Our booming economy is a chance to turn that around and help the poor escape dependence. Employers are dropping requirements like college and prior experience to hire more people. Jobs aren’t scarce. Workers are.
Stunningly, no one at the poverty event talked about jobs. When a homeless woman from Washington State asked Kamala Harris for help, Harris proposed expanding subsidies for renters. All the candidates came with a long list of freebies. Biden promised “ total health care ” for everyone. Warren upped the ante, pledging free childcare for all, free pre-school, free college, and student debt forgiveness.
When King declared, “ free at last ,” that’s not what he had in mind.
Far from promoting work, the Dems running for president don’t hesitate to throw millions of Americans out of work. The Dems’ major policy proposals, Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, open borders for illegals, and tax hikes on corporations, are all job killers.
Medicare for All would cause 2.5 million people — mostly hospital workers and medical administrators — to lose their jobs.
The Green New Deal scheme to reduce carbon emissions threatens the jobs of millions of workers in mining, drilling, refining, the auto industry, and trucking. Bernie Sanders, who says there can be no middle ground on carbon emissions, claims he’s leading a “ movement of working people .” The AFL-CIO isn’t fooled. They see it’s a disaster for working people. The union leaders warned, “ We will not stand by and allow threats to our members’ jobs and their families’ standard of living .”
With open borders, illegal immigrants are driving down wages for low-skilled American workers, according to Harvard economist George Borjas. No wonder polls show three-quarters of voters in the battleground states oppose illegal immigration and support enforcing E-verify to prevent illegals from taking jobs .

C ertain media report that the president is considering roundups of non-citizen illegals, with deportation en masse to follow. These reports lack credibility.
Until it happens, on the issue of clandestine residents we have played the Charlie-Brown-and-the-kickoff often enough, so forget it. If our mighty federal government cannot deal with what any normal man from Mars would describe as an alien invasion, then we must consider other means of fulfilling the Constitutional requirement of the “common defense.”
However, there is something we can suggest as we think about it. While the august and revered branches of our federal government dither and hesitate in their posh and well-guarded surroundings at the expense of the people of this great Republic, we can propose an alternative to the border controls and influx controls that manifestly are beyond the capacity and competence of the federals.
Incarceration.
Yes, that is the ticket. We can build detention centers. We have plenty of empty space in the distant icy regions of Alaska. Or the arid, warm deserts of our great Southwest. You want to live in America? we say as we put out the welcome mat at the points of entry. Welcome! Pick a card (offer a deck). Red? That sends you to the Hot Zone, please come to this side. Black? You go to the Cold Zone, step over to the other side.
Now folks, not to worry. You are being sent to a detention center, otherwise known as a prison, or if you want a camp, a reservation, a gated community. Call it what you want. Why, you can learn some history, including American history, by studying up on the varieties of population control. Reservations… ghettos… concentration camps…
Let’s be honest: population control historically has been a grim and often an appalling business. We, as Americans, regard it with distaste and even horror and are not proud of our own contributions to the genre.
On the other hand, we are not without historical perspective — at least those of us who consider ourselves serious about what being American means and entails. We do not think history began yesterday and we do not think the day before yesterday is best understood, and surely not best judged, from the perspectives (for they are many and manifold) of today’s weird and weirder political and cultural fashions.
On the contrary, we think our ancestors were sometimes in error and resorted to policies, in population control as is other areas, that we would eschew, though not without reasoned and reasonable discussion. We also happen to think our ancestors were often right, however it may be difficult for certain tender sensibilities to admit it, to do things they had to do that we consider might be done differently, or not at all, today.
They did what had to be done in the circumstances, and, more quickly than any other society or nation known to man, they stopped doing it when it was no longer circumstantially necessary or impossible to prevent, which is to say we had other ways of doing things while preserving the integrity of our nation and constitutional system.
We can say that. We therefore can say that maybe that is the ticket, indeed, the best solution to the invasions which currently are if not our number one national security issue than surely up there in the top five. The ticket is mass incarceration.
Camps.
Now of course, times have changed and we are not talking here about putting people in flimsy structures in the harsh conditions of northern Alaska or of central New Mexico or west Texas. We will provide. Because we are good and strong, innovative and imaginative, creative. We will build. Decent places. But escape proof.
In fact, we can build places several notches higher in quality than the federal penitentiaries designed for white-collar types. You know what I mean — those corrections centers that are in fact country clubs, complete with amenities and room service. We will do better.
For all these wretched people claiming to be fleeing oppression and yearning to be free, there will be places in the extreme cold north or the extreme hot south of our country, but completely climate controlled. Comfortable beds in nice dorms, fully-equipped gyms and well-stocked libraries. Tennis courts, baseball diamonds (American sports). Excellent and health-minded dining, including vegetarian options, fruits and vegetables galore and plenty of milk and clean water, not too much coffee, and alcohol in moderation. Instruction in English and a choice of many other languages, plus vocational training, with strong emphasis on moral, philosophical, and civic subjects.
After a minimum of five years, the residents will be given the option of leaving if they can find a sponsor. The sponsor would be an employer willing to refund the state or locality that built and maintained the detention center (can’t expect the federals to do this) for time served while getting educated and Americanized, and able to prove he has a job opening for which the candidate qualifies.
The candidate himself would be able to, in turn, refund the employer for bailing him out, but that is between them, private contract. During those years in the camp, there would have been, additional to other learning experiences, heavy instruction in American history, Constitutional topics, and the canon of Judeo-Christian thinking.
Thus we’d get a steady supply grateful hard-working people who chose America. And really know what that means."
Can Congress Help Americans Save for Retirement?,spectator.org,Joe Barnett,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/can-congress-help-americans-save-for-retirement/,"Can Congress Help Americans Save for Retirement? A sensible bipartisan effort is underway. Bacho/Shutterstock.com Top Stories by Abraham H. Miller
D espite the legislative gridlock and Washington’s political fixations, legislation is advancing through Congress with bipartisan support that would make it easier for Americans to enjoy financial security when they retire.
Presently, too many Americans rely on Social Security for most or all of their retirement incomes, even though the program was originally intended to keep the elderly and disabled from poverty. Today, everyone knows Social Security is not going to be able to support future generations.
In other words, to avoid a significant fall in their standard of living when their work life ends, Americans need to save more for retirement. And because of increased lifespans, income from those savings needs to last decades more for future retirees.
Unfortunately, many middle-aged, part-time, and lower-income workers do not save and invest for retirement. Shockingly, more than one in five working Americans does not have any retirement savings , according to a March 2019 Bankrate survey. The problem is even more widespread among lower-income workers. “More than 4 in 10 households (45 percent) earning less than $30,000 per year aren’t saving any money,” states Bankrate.
Fortunately, Congress is responding to this problem. By an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of 417 to three on May 23, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that could improve the retirement prospects for millions of workers .
The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act would allow more workers to save in tax-advantaged retirement plans, make it easier for small employers to sponsor plans, and broaden the options for individuals to draw on their savings.
“If passed, the changes would be the most significant to retirement plans since 2006 , when Congress made it easier for employers to enroll workers automatically in 401(k)-type plans and invest their money in funds that shift from stocks to bonds as people age,” reported Anne Tergesen and Richard Rubin in the Wall Street Journal .
Among the 29 provisions of the bill are measures that would make it easier for small businesses to offer employees tax-deferred retirement savings plans by allowing them to band together to share administrative expenses. The bill would require employers to offer 401(k) plans to part-time workers and would allow businesses to auto-enroll employees at a savings rate of up to 6 percent of their wages or salary, instead of the current 3 percent limit.
The SECURE Act would also broaden options for taking distributions from retirement savings by removing the current 70 and one-half year age limit on workers’ contributions to an Individual Retirement Account. The bill would also simplify the paperwork for workers who roll over their retirement savings accounts when they change jobs.
The bill raises the age at which individuals are required to begin drawing down their accounts by taking distributions — which are likely taxed at a lower rate — to age 72, rather than the current 70 and one-half years.
The legislation would also encourage employers’ plans to offer annuities, which provide a steady lifetime income based on the balance in a worker’s account at retirement, by limiting the employer’s liability for the performance of annuities, which are insurance products.
A measure similar to the House bill, the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act (RESA) , is under consideration in the U.S. Senate, which could take up the issue in the next few weeks.
Improving retirement security for Americans is an obvious need, and there is widespread support for this in Congress, the financial services community, and the Trump administration.
It would be a refreshing change for the federal government to encourage financial independence for seniors by making it easier for Americans to save for retirement.

New Minnesota Poll Could Spell Bad News for Biden,spectator.org,Dominick Sansone,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/new-minnesota-poll-could-spell-bad-news-for-biden/,"New Minnesota Poll Could Spell Bad News for Biden Biden’s vanilla approach to 2020 may prove less effective than at first glance Drop of Light/Shutterstock.com Top Stories by Abraham H. Miller
R evelation 3:16 “So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.”
A poll of Minnesota voters conducted on June 8-12 by Change Research that has Elizabeth Warren ahead of Joe Biden could represent an important shift in expectations for 2020. If these trends prove to be representative of voters in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and caucuses more generally, Sleepy Joe Biden and his Warren G. Harding-esque “Return to Normalcy” campaign may be seeing its moment in the sun coming to an end.
Breaking down 1,568 registered voters (of which 772 were reported as “likely 2020 Democratic Primary voters”) over various demographic classifications, the poll shows a narrow preference for Warren over Biden (21% vs. 20%, in sharp contrast to the more common result of Biden handily outpolling his Democratic adversaries). Bernie Sanders additionally comes in with a notable 19%. It is important to note, however, that Sanders defeated opponent Hillary Clinton in Minnesota’s 2016 Democratic Primary by nearly 20% . Three years later and a sustained shift to the Left from the Democratic base , this seeming endorsement of socialism will bode even worse for Biden.
The primary conclusion that can be derived from the data collected by Change Research: among Democrat voters, a big thumbs up for both socialism and intersectionality.
Warren continues to strengthen her bonafides. Her own creeping tack to the Left has allowed her to steal (or at least co-opt) some of Sanders’ socialist thunder, coming out ahead in a number of Democratic Primary polls (including Nevada). In the Change Research poll, Warren reported higher numbers compared to Biden among subsets of younger voters (ages 18-34 and 35-49) while losing out among older voters. Sanders comes in ahead of both among the younger voter blocks. As the latter tend to view socialism in a more positive light compared to those in later generations, this will have important implications in Democratic Primaries across the nation.
In regard to intersectionality, 27% of women voters supported Warren, followed by Biden at 20% with Sanders not even medaling. The opposite was the case for men, with Sanders in first, Biden in second, and Warren finding herself fifth down the list. The one common thread running through both is that for the Minnesota Democrat voters polled here, having a candidate who is pro-socialism is of paramount concern.
In a state where Hillary Clinton barely edged out Donald Trump to secure its 10 electoral votes, these numbers are not only significant for Minnesota. As things heat up closer to 2020, Joe Biden will continuously have his record thrown in his face. As he struggles to defend the 1994 Crime Bill , his treatment of Anita Hill , and his flavor-of-the-week stance on abortion , maintaining his current position at the top will be increasingly unlikely. The tug of war between the two socialists will likely determine the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee."
Ohio SB 3 Would be a Big Step for Criminal Justice Reform,spectator.org,Paige Lambermont,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/ohio-sb-3-would-be-a-big-step-for-criminal-justice-reform/,"Ohio SB 3 Would be a Big Step for Criminal Justice Reform The state is poised to move its drug possession laws in the right direction Photo Kittirat Roekburi, Shutterstock Top Stories by Abraham H. Miller
O hio lawmakers are taking aim at drug sentencing laws. Their ultimate goal is to make drug possession offenses misdemeanors rather than felonies. The bill, SB 3 states, “It is the intent of the General Assembly to develop and enact legislation to reform Ohio’s drug sentencing laws.” It would require the state legislature to get to work on reforming the state’s drug sentencing practices, and is a meaningful step for reform.
This has important implications for rehabilitation. A felony drug charge carries a lifetime of consequences that significantly reduce an individual’s ability to participate meaningfully in society. It becomes harder to get jobs, find housing, and do a whole host of other things. These barriers also make it far more likely that someone will re-offend.
Being unnecessarily punitive toward people who are drug abusers or addicts, but are not dealers or traffickers, only furthers the cycle, by forcing them further toward the fringes of society.
The bill sponsors, John Eklund (R-SD 18) and Sean O’Brien (D-SD 32), first proposed the legislation in February, and it has been through the wringer of Senate Judiciary Committee hearing since then. The sixth set of hearings were held this month.
Testifying as a proponent during the bill’s third hearing in the committee, Mark Holden on behalf of Koch Industries and Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce described the laudable intentions of the bill , “We believe SB 3 can effectively address the ineffective and counterproductive trend of incarcerating people with addiction issues. The reclassification of low-level drug possession as a misdemeanor is an important component to better address the addiction crisis. It would help stem the revolving door of people with addictions cycling in and out of state prisons.”
This bill’s assertion that the Ohio legislature intends to work toward significant sentencing reform is a major step, but not all involved parties see it as a step forward.
During the sixth set of hearings, David Marcelli, of The Ohio Association of Chiefs of Police, opposed the bill because he believes that changing the status of drug possession charges would cause police to lose leverage in searches that in the past has allowed them to find more serious drug criminals after initial suspicions of possession.
There has been significant back and forth during the hearings on the bill, which will hopefully be brought to a vote before the legislative session ends on December 31st."

A Complete Clownshow — With a Few Notable Exceptions | The American Spectator,spectator.org,Scott Mckay,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/a-complete-clownshow-with-a-few-notable-exceptions/,"A Complete Clownshow — With a Few Notable Exceptions The House Democrats stage a reparations circus. Coleman Hughes (YouTube screenshot) Top Stories by Jeffrey Lord
T here are actually things Congress could be doing, you know.
Things which are of more value than putting on demagogic expositions like allowing Sheila Jackson-Lee, the utterly moronic Democrat congresswoman from the slums of Houston, to stage a hearing on the urgent necessity of paying reparations to the black community for slavery.
This wasn’t a hearing to discuss a true reparations plan, mind you. No, what Wednesday’s circus involved was a hearing to talk about creating a commission — surely a blue-ribbon outfit that will be! — to create a study of whether reparations would be practical. From the text of the bill Jackson authored (and a number of other lesser lights in the Democrat Party)…
To address the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the 13 American colonies between 1619 and 1865 and to establish a commission to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery, its subsequent de jure and de facto racial and economic discrimination against African-Americans, and the impact of these forces on living African-Americans, to make recommendations to the Congress on appropriate remedies, and for other purposes.
In other words, a dog-and-pony show and a pity party for Black America, sponsored by the Democrat Party which defended the “peculiar institution” from its formation to the end of the Civil War — and then wholly owned the racial oppression which followed for the next 100 years. More on that later.
And Lee’s circus, as anyone might expect, was an opportunity to trot out media and pop culture celebrities for some high-level bloviation. That’s why we got to see Danny Glover, the washed-up zillionaire mediocrity who earned his reputation playing straight man to Mel Gibson and Chris Rock in the Lethal Weapon movies (his most believable role was of the abusive moron husband in The Color Purple ), babble about the iniquities visited upon black people. This is the Danny Glover who spent a decade touting the social-justice and economic achievements of Hugo Chavez’s Venezuela; he has less to say on that subject now that Chavismo is exposed as an unmitigated, miserable disaster.
Not to mention Ta-Nehisi Coates, who might be the most overrated scribbler on the American political scene.
Not everyone on the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which put on this ghastliness, was enthused about She-Jack’s exposition. The ranking Republican on the committee, Rep. Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), who was a noted constitutional scholar and a highly successful attorney in constitutional cases, thought he’d offer a critique of exactly how well an idea like the one being discussed would pass muster on its immediate court challenge…
…Any monetary reparations that might be recommended by the commission created by HR 40 would almost certainly be unconstitutional on their face. The reason for that…
At that point Johnson had to stop, because he was being hooted down by the assembled rabble in the hearing room. When the gavel came down and quieted the boo-birds, he continued…
The reason for that is a legal question. See, the legal question is: the federal government can’t constitutionally provide compensation today to a specific racial group because other members of that group, maybe several generations ago, were discriminated against and treated inhumanely.
The holding of the 1995 case Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. is that racial set asides and other entitlements are only constitutionally permissible to remedy the present effects of the government’s own widespread in recent discrimination. The federal government is not allowed to provide race-based remedies that are “ageless in their region of the past and timeless in their ability to effect the future.”
This wasn’t overly well-received, which is understandable — the boo-birds and hecklers were there because they’d been promised free stuff from Uncle Sugar and they’ve been trained to hurl epithets at anyone who tells them no.
But Johnson’s critique wasn’t the most colorful. That one came from former NFL defensive back Burgess Owens, a Fox News contributor and frequent critic of the Left on racial and economic issues who took to the witness stand with a rhetorical flamethrower in tow.
“I used to be a Democrat until I did my history and found out the misery that that party brought to my race,” he said. “Let’s point to the party that was part of slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, that has killed over 40 percent of our black babies, 20 million of them.”
He wasn’t done.
“Let’s pay restitution,” he agreed. “How about the Democratic Party pay for all the misery brought to my race and those, after we learn our history, who decide to stay there, they should pay also. They’re complicit. And every white American, Republican or Democrat, that feels guilty because of their white skin, you should need to pony up also — that way we can get past this reparation and recognize that this country has given us greatness,” Owens said.
There was more. “Look at this panel,” he noted, seeing a row of rich black people in the witness chairs. “It doesn’t matter how we think. It doesn’t matter our color. We have become successful in this country like no other because of this great opportunity to live the American dream. Let’s not steal that from our kids by telling them they can’t do it,” he added.
And Owens wasn’t the only one to note that the discussion of slavery reparations was an entirely counterproductive idea. Coleman Hughes, a Columbia University college student and columnist for a range of publications, questioned the purpose of the hearing…
In 2008, the House of Representatives formally apologized for slavery and Jim Crow. In 2009, the Senate did the same. Black people don’t need another apology. We need safer neighborhoods and better schools. We need a less punitive criminal justice system. We need affordable health care. And none of these things can be achieved through reparations for slavery.
Nearly everyone close to me told me not to testify today. They said that even though I’ve only ever voted for Democrats, I’d be perceived as a Republican—and therefore hated by half the country. Others told me that distancing myself from Republicans would end up angering the other half of the country. And the sad truth is that they were both right. That’s how suspicious we’ve become of one another. That’s how divided we are as a nation.
If we were to pay reparations today, we would only divide the country further, making it harder to build the political coalitions required to solve the problems facing black people today; we would insult many black Americans by putting a price on the suffering of their ancestors; and we would turn the relationship between black Americans and white Americans from a coalition into a transaction — from a union between citizens into a lawsuit between plaintiffs and defendants.
Two things should be said about this issue, which is a waste of America’s time and yet another stain on the escutcheon of the Democrat Party to even bring it up in 2019. First, America didn’t create slavery, we inherited it from every other society on earth — the Europeans, the Africans, the Turks, and the Arabs, most specifically. We spent 600,000 lives in shedding that inheritance.
And second, the reason we inherited slavery from all of those other societies is that before the advent of the Industrial Revolution, which may have started in Europe but was perfected in this country, slavery or something like it was a sad economic necessity in all human societies. That’s not to minimize the moral degeneracy of the institution, which by the way is still alive and well in places like Libya and Somalia — something nobody at Wednesday’s ridiculous hearing seemed interested in discussing. It is to say that the prosperity and technological innovation brought on by free-market capitalism is what made slavery obsolete.
And the same political party which promoted slavery and racial oppression in America throughout its existence has spent the last 30 years trashing the capitalism which ended it.
Which is something very much in evidence watching the Democrats in Congress and on the presidential hustings — at least when they’re not attempting to pander to the descendants of their old policies."
Big Abortion in the Big Apple,spectator.org,Daniel J. Flynn,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/big-abortion-in-the-big-apple/,"Big Abortion in the Big Apple Social justice has never been more out of wack. A Katz (Bill de Blasio/Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by Jeffrey Lord
O ne can never start too early to plan for retirement, and a sound strategy for longevity begins by convincing your parents not to conceive you in the Big Apple, where 35 percent of all pregnancies end in a Big Abortion. New York City sees about four times more late-term abortions (after 21 weeks) than homicides.
Although the odds of an unborn baby making it through the birth canal alive in New York City fall shy of the chances of a Warriors gang member completing the perilous trek from Van Cortlandt Park to Coney Island, Mayor Bill de Blasio — steadfast in the conviction that equality is always greater than inequality — grasps that the city could do more to achieve parity between live births and abortions.
So, New York City, long a draw for immigrants, now calls for, in addition to the tempest-tossed, huddled masses, and wretched refuse, pregnant women in search of medical miscarriages.
New York became the first city in the United States to directly fund abortions this week. The city had already indirectly funded abortion through allocations to city hospitals and Planned Parenthood, and New York state subsidizes it through Medicaid. But here the mayor and city council agreed to a budget that includes a $250,000 allocation to the New York Abortion Access Fund (NYAAF), a nonprofit whose charitable works focus on terminating children in the womb, to pay specifically for abortions.
Like a free spray paint program for low-income youths during Abe Beame’s administration, de Blasio subsidizing abortion would seem unnecessary given the local enthusiasm for the procedure. The state already witnesses more abortions per capita than any other. But elsewhere — Alabama, Missouri, and Georgia, to name three places — politicians work to limit abortion. So, in addition to Broadway, Central Park, and the Empire State Building’s observation deck, abortion looks to become a magnet for travelers to the Big Apple.
“We heard the news on the abortion bans across the country,” City Councilwoman Carlina Rivera told the New York Times . “Many of us in New York felt helpless. We wanted to do more.”
This means a third of the fund goes to women traveling from outside New York to procure an abortion. Ms. Rivera believes free abortion (and not the Statue of Liberty?) makes the city a “beacon for the rest of the country.” One thinks of L. Brent Bozell Jr.’s Triumph magazine featuring a pregnant Lady Liberty holding a coat hanger to the skies on its cover. Parody becomes prophecy.
Speaking of satire, though the NYAAF grasps “that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,” it takes a less inclusive tone toward class. The group excludes people of means from the pool of candidates deserving of their free abortions by focusing on “people [who] may be too poor to pay for abortion procedures.” The zeal to kill the unborn children of the disadvantaged recalls not only the overtly eugenic aim of early Planned Parenthood but Jonathan Swift’s eat-the-poor “Modest Proposal” as well. Some love the poor so much that they volunteer to play hit man on their children gratis.
The program pays for an estimated 500 abortions, less than one of percent of the 60,000 performed in the city annually. So, it works more as a symbolic middle finger to local taxpayers whose consciences reject abortion than it does as a substantive, comprehensive program. But with local leaders increasingly living by an all-politics-is-national ethos one could see politicians prioritizing abortion over education, trash collection, law enforcement, and other services better suited for city government.
Indeed, the “NYAAF does not try to speak for the motivations of our clients by framing abortion as an issue of choice. Reproductive freedom is a matter of social justice, not just an individual choice.” If increasing numbers truly see eliminating the most defenseless as a matter of justice, then it becomes a matter of time before freedom of choice becomes an entirely free choice — at least for the customer, repeat or otherwise.
And then those youngsters who survived public policy encouraging their destruction can sing, with new meaning, along with Frank Sinatra, “And you bet baby/If I can make it there/You know, I’m gonna make it just about anywhere.”"
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Should Go to Poland,spectator.org,Abraham H.

Tomas Fabian/Shutterstock.com Top Stories by Jeffrey Lord
T he concentration camps were not just barbaric, they also served a political function. They made death anonymous. They removed any meaning from death as they made the extinction of life, in such a mechanized fashion, a statement about its worthlessness.
When you are slaughtered like an animal and harvested for the meager remains of your belongings, the intention is to redefine your life as if you were an animal, nothing worthy of commemorating.
It was not just Jews who went to the slaughter, not just gypsies, but Slavic peoples such as Poles, Russians, and Ukrainians who entered the vacuum of anonymous death, bereft of meaning.
Exact numbers of Poles killed at the Auschwitz compound are hard to gauge, but the brutal Nazi genocide resulted in millions of Poles exterminated and probably 500,000 sent to their deaths in the concentration camps.
Contrast that few non-Jews of Western Europe ended up in concentration camps to what happened to the Slavic peoples of Eastern Europe, and you see the genocidal savagery of the Nazi concept of the “Untermensch” at work.
If you were a Pole living in Warsaw in 1939, you had a 5% chance of surviving the end of the war.
So, when the insipid and grossly ignorant Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez compares the detention camps at the border with concentration camps, she smears not just Jews but every group of people whose death was made as meaningless as that of an animal on the assembly line at the stockyards.
She does not act alone. Those who rise to justify her boorish obliviousness help perpetuate this insult. Those who do not condemn her are not neutral but tacit accomplices.
Given the devastation of Poland by the Nazis, that the Nazis built extermination camps on Polish soil, and that the suffering of the Polish people is usually a footnote in the history of World War II, it was altogether appropriate that Dominik Tarczynski, a member of the Polish Parliament, extended an invitation for Ocasio-Cortez to see what real concentration camps look like.
For Ocasio-Cortez and her enablers, standing on the corpses of all those who died at the hands of Nazism in order to score political points is an obscene desecration of those victims’ deaths and is a further attempt to defile their lives.
Yes, Ocasio-Cortez should go to Poland and get the education she obviously did not get at Boston University. She should see what real fascism looks like and the horrors it wrought through mechanized death and genocide.
And maybe she and her enablers will understand that Auschwitz did not rise up overnight. It started with the demagoguery of brutal name calling and demonization of political opponents, not all that different from the politics she and her defenders practice when they invoke Nazi imagery where it has no place.
Jews were not the first victims of concentration camps. The first people sent to concentration camps were political opponents, some of whom, like my colleague, the Polish intellectual Theodore Abel, survived.
When the civility of political discourse and respect for our opponents becomes shrouded in demonization, we do not debate people, we send them to concentration camps because they and their ideas are evil.
Ocasio-Cortez needs to walk the soil of Poland and see where her hyperbolic ignorance took Europe. Poland has much to teach her.
Dominik Tarczyński might yet save America from the ignorance of her children. All Americans should applaud him.

Perhaps other descendants are deserving of reparations… Surgeons of the 4th Division, 9th Army Corps during the siege of Petersburg (Wikimedia Commons) Top Stories by Jeffrey Lord
O n June 15, 1864 the Army of the Potomac established what became the siege of Petersburg, which acted as the gateway to Richmond, Virginia, the capital of the Confederate States of Virginia. Although the city was not enveloped, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant managed a feat that eluded a succession of eastern Union commanders: he fixed Gen. Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia in place, preventing any repetition of Lee’s military wizardry evident in such victories as Second Manassas and Chancellorsville. Once the battle became a siege, Lee admitted, the end “will be a mere question of time.”
Yet Petersburg was a relief for brave and capable troops of both sides. President Abraham Lincoln brought Grant east to deal with the South’s only winning army. (Southern forces out west suffered under a gaggle of mediocre generals rather like the blundering Union generals who fought outside Washington; the Confederacy’s only major victory was Chickamauga, the benefits of which Gen. Braxton Bragg promptly squandered.) However, despite possessing overwhelming advantages in manpower and materiel, Grant quickly found that there was no easy way through Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia.
During the so-called Overland Campaign, which began in the Wilderness in May and concluded with the move on Petersburg, the Army of the Potomac suffered around 55,000 casualties, roughly the size of Lee’s forces and twice the latter’s losses. Cold Harbor, the last battle before Petersburg, was a particularly hideous blunder for Grant; the federals attacked well-entrenched Confederates, suffering about 7,000 men killed or wounded, compared to barely 1,500 southern casualties. Union morale was low even before the disastrous assault: soldiers contemplating the southerners’ fortifications morbidly sewed labels with their names on their uniforms to allow identification of their bodies, an innovation later turned into dog tags.
The seemingly endless casualties lists almost sunk Lincoln’s reelection. After the Wilderness slaughterfest, Sen . Henry Wilson of Massachusetts reflected : “ If that scene could have been presented to me before the war, anxious as I was for the preservation of the Union, I should have said: ‘The cost is too great; erring sisters, go in peace.’” Too late, this ardent nationalist was forced to ask, how many lives was political unity worth?
Petersburg offered no magic elixir to repair the public’s disenchantment. Casualties mercifully fell dramatically when sedentary sharp-shooting replaced large-scale assaults, but the conflict stagnated: the Army of the Potomac did not break through until April the following year. Shortly thereafter Lee surrendered, effectively ending the Confederacy’s resistance, though some smaller military commands remained and President Jefferson Davis went on the run.
Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman’s capture of Atlanta in September did more than anything else to reelect the president in 1864. The conflict’s sacrifice no longer seemed futile. Victory suddenly looked achievable. In fact, the Confederacy’s defeat by then was inevitable, irrespective of Lincoln’s political fate. Even had he lost he would not have surrendered his office until March 4 (later changed to January 20), which would have allowed him to bring the war almost to a close anyway.
The consequences of the conflict were horrendous. Recent scholarship suggests that battle deaths ran as much as 750,000. Overall at least one million Americans are thought to have died. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced as the South was ravaged, suffering the sort of destruction commonly afflicting combatants in European wars. Agriculture, community, and property were destroyed in the south, while civil liberties and constitutional limits were violated in the north. The impact on the former Confederates was disproportionate: one out of every five military age men was killed, treble the proportion in the North. Union campaigns by Sherman, on his famous “march to the sea,” and Gen. Phil Sheridan, while fighting through the Shenandoah Valley, adopted modern total war techniques to devastate civilian lands and resources. And southerners paid for their reliance on slaves, which reflected a huge share of the South’s wealth, that was wiped away. Today’s massive centralization of national power, intensified in every succeeding crisis, is a tragic testament to the Civil War.
It is said that the victors write the histories and that certainly is the case in the Civil War — more accurately characterized as the War Between the States, since the South sought separation, not domination. Normally a civil war entails a common struggle to control the whole.
Most American history books admit of no doubt regarding the necessity of the conflict, which according to national myth was a harrowing fire through which the country was refined and tempered. It was a grand moral crusade against slavery and the genesis of a beneficent activist national government. Affirmation of the Civil War’s virtues is reflected by the unanimous ranking of Lincoln as America’s greatest president. After ordering the invasion of his onetime countrymen which ended up killing a million Americans.
The question whether the war was justified has been forever overshadowed by the retrospective treatment of the conflict as directed against slavery. It was not. The number of abolitionists was small. Many critics of slavery, like Lincoln, favored colonization, that is, sending freed slaves back to Africa (the genesis of the modern nation of Liberia). The Republican Party campaigned to limit slavery, barring its spread to the territories, not free the slaves. Had the war ended quickly — the likely result, for instance, had Lee accepted command of the Union forces, offered in early 1861 — slavery would have survived, largely undisturbed. Liberation became a war measure; the famed Emancipation Proclamation, purporting to free slaves under enemy control — which it obviously could not do so until they were out of southern control — was only issued on January 1, 1863.
To understand the cause of the conflict one must ask, first, why did the South secede? Second, why did the North stop its brethren from departing?
Whether the southern states had constitutional warrant to secede from the Union is a fascinating intellectual dispute with no accepted answer. In this case force of arms supplied the answer. Nor does it matter much whether the South had a more respectable reason to secede than slavery. Why should Northerners kill former fellow citizens for wanting to leave for whatever reason? It is hard to see why secession warranted war.
Still, slavery was the triggering event. There were other issues, such as tariffs, but none would have animated the white populations to leave the union. Although Lincoln pledged to respect the institution of slavery, it would have become much less secure facing hostile national executive and legislative branches. His election sparked the almost instantaneous walk-out by seven deep South states, starting with South Carolina.
However, eight slave states remained. Had all gone out the North’s task would have been far greater. But the eight remained loyal until Lincoln called up 75,000 militiamen to suppress the rebellion. Notably, this was no campaign to free the slaves. Although the president genuinely loathed slavery, he famously wrote Horace Greeley: “My paramount object in the struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery.” Lincoln’s overwhelming concern was to preserve the national government; the status of the slave system that so distorted the government was secondary.
Only after the president announced his plan to coerce the seceded states did the upper South — Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia — leave the Union. They were willing to subordinate slavery to national unity but would not join an effort to suppress states with which they had more in common than with most of the North. The border states of Kentucky and Missouri divided and fought their own mini-civil wars, while Union occupation preserved Maryland’s loyalty and tiny Delaware never had a choice. One North Carolina unionist complained: “Union sentiment was largely in the ascendant and gaining strength until Lincoln prostrated us. He could have adopted no policy so effectual to destroy the union.… Lincoln has made us a unit to resist until we repel our invaders or die.”
The issue of coercion was critical to many Americans. Before leaving U.S. army service, Col. Robert E. Lee wrote: “I can anticipate no greater calamity for the country than a dissolution of the Union.… Still, a Union that can only be maintained by swords and bayonets, and in which strife and civil war are to take the place of brotherly love and kindness, has no charm for me.” Horace Greeley could have been plagiarizing Lee when the former editorialized in the New York Tribune : “We hope never to live in a republic whereof one section is pinned to the residue by bayonets.”
It is hard to disagree with such sentiments. If Californians today declared that they wanted to separate from the rest of America — perhaps with the enthusiastic encouragement of many conservatives! — should Washington send in the army? Conduct terror bombing from the sky? Set up a naval blockade, an updated “Anaconda Plan” of sorts? Hopefully not. Whether the Golden State’s departure was “legal” would matter little. Washington would have to choose between wishing 40 million Californians well or killing them. The first would be the better option.
Why did Northerners respond differently in 1860? They viewed Southern states, especially South Carolina, as breaking the democratic bargain and refusing to play by the rules when they lost. In his inaugural address Lincoln argued that “the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy” through its rejection of majority rule. In fact, he was spinning: the South rejected not majority (of white men, of course, in both sections) rule, but national majority rule. There was no anarchy: secessionists bypassed the radical “fire-eaters,” replicating established institutions and leaders, including most of the federal Constitution. And even if southerners were heading toward “anarchy or despotism,” as the president argued, was that a good reason to lay waste to their homes, families, communities, and states?
Some in the North feared that the Confederacy would close the Mississippi. A few nationalists worried that a passive response to Southern secession would tempt other sections of the nation, such as the northwest, to secede. A number of abolitionists saw a chance to end slavery, though others were pacifists.
Perhaps most important was raw nationalism, the belief that the American nation was indivisible and would inevitably overspread the entire continent, the malignant doctrine of Manifest Destiny. Lincoln spoke of “The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land.” Eloquent sentiments to be sure, but no justification for war — thereby creating more battlefields and graves to be connected by nightmares of fighting each other. How could the Union be such a good institution if only “maintained by swords and bayonets”?
Unfortunately, far too many people imagined that resolution of the dispute wouldn’t require many swords or bayonets, that victory would come easily. A few shots would be fired and the cowardly Yankee shopkeepers would flee north or the cowardly secessionist blowhards would fade away.
South Carolina committed an act of war by firing on Fort Sumter, but there was no need to open general hostilities in response to such a limited act. However, Lincoln left the indefensible U.S. garrison in place, inviting such an incident. That probably was his intent, since he carefully calculated all his policies. The Sumter attack galvanized support for raising troops for coercion, which he desired. Although Fort Sumter did not cause the states to fight, it greatly aided Lincoln’s ability to invade the South to suppress secession.
Much of the enthusiasm for war on both sides reflected tragic illusions about the conflict’s consequences. Both Lee and Sherman foresaw a long, bloody war, but they were in the decided minority. Sen. James Chestnut of South Carolina, for one, offered to drink all the blood that would be shed as a result of secession. Soon oceans of blood were spilled in individual battles consuming more lives than all of America’s previous wars together. Americans learned their mistake, but too late. Wilson was not alone in wishing he could roll back time.
There was one, huge, initially unintended benefit from the war — the destruction of slavery. One can admire the heroic struggle against long odds undertaken by Confederates, but the South was no beau ideal of a good civilization. Slavery was brutal, immoral, dehumanizing, and corrosive. The seeming gentility of the South was built atop stolen humanity, dignity, and labor. The system’s destruction was long overdue.
However, only one other slave society eliminated the odious practice through war, Haiti. Everywhere else the practice was peacefully abandoned. For instance, Brazil lagged behind the U.S. in emancipation, but eventually acted without its national government killing anyone, let alone a million people. Moreover, through “Redemption” white southerners reimposed white supremacist rule. This blight on American society survived for decades, leaving ill effects that persist today. Peaceful separation in 1861 conceivably could have resulted in justice for African-Americans sooner than did coercive union.
Most important, when it comes to secession, the one and most obviously beneficial outcome of the war was actually unplanned. At the outset abolition was rejected by almost everyone, north and south. Preserving the Union simply wasn’t a moral cause. It didn’t warrant mass slaughter.
In June 1864 the ultimate denouement of the Civil War approached. Once the Confederacy’s most effective army and talented general were stuck defending Petersburg, defeat was inevitable. Soon racial problems and conflict would shift back to the political realm. There never was any adequate justification for either secession or coercion, which together tragically turned northern Virginia into an open air abattoir in Spring 1864.

Burgess Owens: Democrats Should Pay Reparations,spectator.org,Jeffrey Lord,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/burgess-owens-democrats-should-pay-reparations/,"by Abraham H. Miller
S o amidst the chaos of that congressional hearing on reparations for slavery, former NFL star Burgess Owens got straight to the point, saying this, as reported by BizPac Review :
“I used to be a Democrat until I did my history and found out the misery that that party brought to my race,” Owens said.
He added, “I do believe in restitution. Let’s point to the party that was part of slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, that has killed over 40 percent of our black babies, 20 million of them. State of California, 75 percent of our black boys can’t past standard reading and writing test, a Democratic state. Let’s pay reparation. Let’s pay restitution. How about a Democratic Party pay for all the misery brought to my race.”
Bingo.
Yet somehow, some mysterious way, the hard facts of history are blithely ignored by members and sycophants of the Democrats, the latter without doubt the Party of Race.
Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert of Texas had the audacity to quote from a 2008 article of mine that originally appeared in this space and was reprinted in the Wall Street Journal . Among other things in that article I noted these hard facts about what was missing from the website of the Democratic National Committee as it tried to portray itself as the champion of civil rights by leaving out the hard facts of the party’s horrendous actual history on race: There is no reference to the number of Democratic Party platforms supporting slavery. There were six from 1840 through 1860. There is no reference to the number of Democratic presidents who owned slaves. There were seven from 1800 through 1861 . There is no reference to the number of Democratic Party platforms that either supported segregation outright or were silent on the subject. There were 20, from 1868 through 1948. There is no reference to “Jim Crow” as in “Jim Crow laws,” nor is there reference to the role Democrats played in creating them. These were the post-Civil War laws passed enthusiastically by Democrats in that pesky 52-year part of the DNC’s missing years. These laws segregated public schools, public transportation, restaurants, rest rooms and public places in general (everything from water coolers to beaches). The reason Rosa Parks became famous is that she sat in the “whites only” front section of a bus, the “whites only” designation the direct result of Democrats. There is no reference to the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, which, according to Columbia University historian Eric Foner, became “a military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party.” Nor is there reference to University of North Carolina historian Allen Trelease’s description of the Klan as the “terrorist arm of the Democratic Party.” There is no reference to the fact Democrats opposed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution. The 13th banned slavery. The 14th effectively overturned the infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision (made by Democratic pro-slavery Supreme Court justices) by guaranteeing due process and equal protection to former slaves. The 15th gave black Americans the right to vote. There is no reference to the fact that Democrats opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1866. It was passed by the Republican Congress over the veto of President Andrew Johnson, who had been a Democrat before joining Lincoln’s ticket in 1864. The law was designed to provide blacks with the right to own private property, sign contracts, sue and serve as witnesses in a legal proceeding. There is no reference to the Democrats’ opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1875. It was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses Grant. The law prohibited racial discrimination in public places and public accommodations. There is no reference to the Democrats’ 1904 platform, which devotes a section to “Sectional and Racial Agitation,” claiming the GOP’s protests against segregation and the denial of voting rights to blacks sought to “revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country,” which in turn “means confusion, distraction of business, and the reopening of wounds now happily healed.” There is no reference to four Democratic platforms, 1908-20, that are silent on blacks, segregation, lynching and voting rights as racial problems in the country mount. By contrast the GOP platforms of those years specifically address “Rights of the Negro” (1908), oppose lynching (in 1912, 1920, 1924, 1928) and, as the New Deal kicks in, speak out about the dangers of making blacks “wards of the state.” There is no reference to the Democratic Convention of 1924, known to history as the “Klanbake.” The 103-ballot convention was held in Madison Square Garden. Hundreds of delegates were members of the Ku Klux Klan, the Klan so powerful that a plank condemning Klan violence was defeated outright. To celebrate, the Klan staged a rally with 10,000 hooded Klansmen in a field in New Jersey directly across the Hudson from the site of the convention. Attended by hundreds of cheering convention delegates, the rally featured burning crosses and calls for violence against African-Americans and Catholics. There is no reference to the fact that it was Democrats who segregated the federal government, at the direction of President Woodrow Wilson upon taking office in 1913. There \is a reference to the fact that President Harry Truman integrated the military after World War II. There is reference to the fact that Democrats created the Federal Reserve Board, passed labor and child welfare laws, and created Social Security with Wilson’s New Freedom and FDR’s New Deal. There is no mention that these programs were created as the result of an agreement to ignore segregation and the lynching of blacks. Neither is there a reference to the thousands of local officials, state legislators, state governors, U.S. congressmen and U.S. senators who were elected as supporters of slavery and then segregation between 1800 and 1965. Nor is there reference to the deal with the devil that left segregation and lynching as a way of life in return for election support for three post-Civil War Democratic presidents, Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. There is no reference that three-fourths of the opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Bill in the U.S. House came from Democrats, or that 80% of the “nay” vote in the Senate came from Democrats. Certainly there is no reference to the fact that the opposition included future Democratic Senate leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia (a former Klan member) and Tennessee Senator Albert Gore Sr., father of Vice President Al Gore. Last but certainly not least, there is no reference to the fact that Birmingham, Ala., Public Safety Commissioner Bull Connor, who infamously unleashed dogs and fire hoses on civil rights protestors, was in fact–yes indeed–a member of both the Democratic National Committee and the Ku Klux Klan.
Tellingly, when Congressman Gohmert was finished reciting these hard, cold, and quite accurate facts of history, someone in the audience yelled out, “You lie!” An unwitting admission of absolute historical ignorance or maybe just plain denial. And over at the website Splinter writer Samantha Grasso assailed Gohmert as the “dumbest Republican in the room” for daring to cite the Democrats’ appalling historical record.
The real problem here is that the Party of Race has never let go of its racism. It has moved from support of slavery to support of segregation to the support of identity politics, the latter the son of segregation. Note as well that in that Grasso article I was assailed for ridiculing the leftist thugs over at Media Matters for their repeatedly flagged anti-Semitism. The rise of anti-Semitism on the Left — anti-Semitism being exactly racism — is a part and parcel of the racist support by Democrats for slavery, segregation, and identity politics.
Note that the congressional hearing on reparations was spearheaded by Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. She has introduced legislation described this way by MSN:
Under Jackson Lee’s bill, a 13-member commission would be created to study the role of slavery in the U.S. and the “lingering negative effects of the institution of slavery” in America. The bill calls on the commission to consider reparations and how any compensation to descendants of enslaved Africans would be calculated.
“The role of the federal government supporting the institution of slavery and subsequent discrimination directed against blacks is an injustice that must be formally acknowledged and addressed,” Jackson Lee said during a 10-minute introduction of the legislation.
Notice the very careful language about “the role of the federal government”? The federal government was, then as now, run by political parties elected after campaigns to hold federal — and for that matter state and local — office. And the historical fact that both Congressman Gohmert and Burgess Owens were citing is that Democrats of the day campaigned enthusiastically as supporters of slavery and later segregation, which is how they won the elections that enabled them to run the “role of the federal government.” Then — and now — they rely on using race to win elections.
Out there on the campaign trail, Business Insider lists the Democratic presidential candidates who support reparations: senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris along with former HUD Secretary Julian Castro and Marianne Williamson have all endorsed reparations. But they are studiously ignoring the idea that their own party pony up and pay reparations — much less are they pledging to use some of their own millions in campaign contributions to chip in.
All of this is part and parcel of the Democrats refusal to issue an apology for their support of slavery and segregation.
In short? The call for reparations has now backfired on the Democrats and their presidential candidates. They are all for reparations — but refuse to have their party and candidates pay for it. And they certainly don’t want to acknowledge their party’s role in the wholesale repression of black Americans.
Much less will they stop using identity politics — because they cannot shake their 219-year-old culture of using race to win elections."
Broward County Has Another Extremism Problem,spectator.org,Christina Armes,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/broward-county-has-another-extremism-problem/,"Broward County Has Another Extremism Problem A deputy sheriff who offers firearms training to mosques around the country. Sheriff Scott Israel (YouTube screenshot) Top Stories by Abraham H. Miller
I n June, South Florida Muslim (SFMF) Federation Executive Director Nezar Hamze, along with SFMF communications director Wilfredo Ruiz, partnered with the U.S. Attorney’s South Florida office to participate in the Group Violence Initiative , a government anti-violence program comprising law enforcement, clergy, community members, and former gang leaders.
SFMF director Nezar Hamze is also an armed public servant — a Deputy Sheriff of Broward County. Since the February 2018 shooting in Parkland at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the Broward County Police Department has been embroiled in scandal. The Sheriff at the time, Scott Israel, has since been dismissed for his negligence of duty during the shooting. Earlier this month, Deputy Sheriff Scot Peterson was arrested following a 15-month investigation into his actions during the shooting as well.
While Florida officials have addressed the failure of Broward County Sheriff’s department to prevent violence, they have kept quiet about one of its other Deputy Sheriffs’ own radical ties.
Hamze’s SFMF is an umbrella group for a number of Islamic organizations in Florida. Both SFMF and several of its member-bodies boast ties to extremist operatives. On June 2, for example, just a week before the Group Violence Initiative event, SFMF promoted an event featuring hardline Islamist speakers and hosted by one of its member-organizations. The Islamic Foundation of South Florida’s “Grand Iftar” featured prominent Islamist activist Yusuf Abdallah as a keynote speaker . In February, Abdallah was the subject of international news coverage after it emerged that he was to share a stage with Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, despite Abdallah’s well-documented history of violently-themed anti-Semitism. On his Facebook account, Abdallah posted a “very beautiful” story about a “resistance hero” named Zharif al-Tawl, who took revenge against Jewish “gangs” by providing guns to “kill more than 20 jews” and “fire rockets at Tel Aviv.”
This dangerous rhetoric is typical of the company that SFMF officials keep. Before leading SFMF, Hamze served as the “executive and operations director” of the Florida branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Under his watch, in July 2014, CAIR-Florida sponsored a pro-Hamas rally in Miami, at which participants chanted “We are Hamas! We are Jihad!” CAIR has repeatedly denied involvement, yet CAIR was listed on Facebook as a sponsor of the event and CAIR affiliates organized and attended the event.
In fact, Hamze’s SFMF and CAIR-Florida continue to share officials.For example, Wilfredo Ruiz is an Executive Committee Member for Public Relations at SFMF, and also the communications director for CAIR Florida. Ruiz’s history, like many others at CAIR and SFMF, is riddled withworking with pro-Hamas and anti-Semitic groups. In an article Ruiz wrote for a Spanish Islamic website , he offers an anti-Semitic conspiracy that the Talmud, an ancient Jewish text, instructs Jews to “throw dead dogs and monkeys” at the graves of Jesus and Mohammad. In another instance, Ruiz “ liked” a Facebook post denying the Holocaust and claiming “Hitler was not to [sic] bad after all.”
Currently, SFMF’s Facebook is managed by Abdur Rahman al-Ghani, who offers similar extreme rhetoric. He has used his personal Facebook page to denounce Jews, calling them “demonic” and “the most evil on earth.”
Nezar Hamze was recommended to the Deputy Sheriff position by disgraced former Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel. This important community role has not stopped him from openly consorting with extremists. In August 2016, Hamze met with Mohamad al-Ali al-Halabi, who has shared Hezbollah content on Facebook, in which the Secretary General of Hezbollah refers to America as the “mother of terrorism.” Al-Halabi’s caption for the photo was “Nice words.”
Hamze has used his position as Deputy Sheriff and his strong ties to CAIR to work with various extremist institutions in Florida. As part of Hamze’s role as Deputy Sheriff of Broward County, and with the blessing of Scott Israel, Hamze has offered firearms training to various mosques.
On December 14, 2015 , Hamze gave weapons training at Masjid Jamaat Al-Mumineen (MJAM), located in Margate, Florida, whose imam was arrested in 2011 on charges of funding the Taliban. He was eventually acquitted due to insufficient evidence, although his father was found guilty .
By the end of 2015, counter-terrorism expert Joe Kaufman reports, Hamze had given weapons training to at least 17 mosques, with many more trainings since. The Broward County Sheriff’s office also offered conceal-carry training to a mosque in March of last year , citing the freedom of the Second Amendment and the “right to return fire. ”
While these weapons and self-defense trainings seem innocent in their intention to protect Muslim communities from violence, especially in the wake of the horrors in New Zealand, Hamze’s myriad of connections to Islamists with histories of justifying violence or supporting violent causes are cause for great concern.
Despite his deputy’s extremist links, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has supported Hamze in his efforts, even appearing at one of Hamze’s weapons training sessions .
Israel dismissed concerns over Hamze’s connections to terrorism, citing the fact that CAIR is not listed as a terrorist organization by the FBI, although neatly ignoring the fact that the FBI has blacklisted CAIR since 2008, after it was named by prosecutors as an unindicted coconspirator in a federal terror finance case.
Florida governor Ron DeSantis suspended Scott Israel on January 11, 2019 for “neglect of duty and incompetence” during the 2018 Parkland shooting. Hamze, meanwhile, has retained his position as Deputy Sheriff.
If Broward County is serious about fixing its Sheriff’s department, then punishing those law enforcement members who failed to prevent a single act of violent extremism is of course necessary. But it is even more important to address the fact that another member in the department actively enables a culture of extremism.
It would seem rather counterproductive to punish Scott Israel’s negligence in addressing violence, while Hamze’s years-long armed outreach to Islamists is protected — and even encouraged — by the state, as evinced by the U.S. attorney’s cooperation with SFMF and the Group Violence Initiative. But in Florida, terror-tied Islamism carries a badge and a gun.

"The Dems’ 2020 Election Strategy: Feeding, Clothing, and Housing Your Loved Ones on a Diet of Investigations, Open Borders, Climate, and Impeachment",spectator.org,Dov Fischer,06-22-2019,2019,6,https://spectator.org/the-dems-2020-election-strategy-feeding-clothing-and-housing-your-loved-ones-on-a-diet-of-investigations-open-borders-climate-and-impeachment/,"by Daniel J. Flynn I am sure the Democrat-controlled House has passed several bills and resolutions, maybe even some that matter, maybe even some that we conservatives would endorse. The thing is, most of us average American lugs do not live in Washington, D.C. We do not sit all day in the House of Representatives or attend legislative meetings, marveling at all the legislative hours of “hard work.” We do not watch day-long C-SPAN coverage of the House. Rather, we go about our lives. Most of us lugs follow the main top news stories of the day: two or three aggravating things emanating from D.C., one or two world stories where a Tyrannical Purgatory is threatening regional or world peace, and maybe a story or two about some homegrown maniac murdering people. Indeed, the people who least know what is happening in the world know the details of those other stories the best: the Hillside Strangler, Ted Bundy, Richard Speck, Son of Sam, O.J. and Nicole, Jeffrey Dahmer, AOC, John Wayne Gacy, Monica Lewinsky, vacationing in the Dominican Republic, Mary Jo Kopechne. Few know about House Bill 1234 or 4321. We know that Trump colluded with Putin, or used to collude with Putin until Mueller or Muller or Miller decided that he never colluded with Putin. But they still sent a SWAT team and a CNN crew to pull some 70-year-old guy named Stone out of bed in the middle of the night. So maybe Trump did this or tweeted that. Or maybe he didn’t. And now they want my grandmother from Poland or Italy and my grandfather from Ireland whose grandfather or whatever died when he was drafted in Boston or New York by Lincoln to fight slavery in the Civil War to pay reparations to LeBron James, Al Sharpton, Beyoncé, and Barack Obama. We figure, regardless of our personal politics, that the Clintons definitely were crooks at the felon level, but we pretty-much realize there is two-tier justice in America, one standard for Clintons and another for Trump; one for Liberals in Hollywood who do not harass women and another for those who do. We know that Indians, or whatever Elizabeth Warren wants to be called, got the shaft a few centuries ago, but we gave them casinos, so both sides smoked a peace pipe and called it even. And we know that Africans got the shaft half a millennium ago — shafted by their own people in Africa who sold them into slavery and bondage for rum, so now should be paying reparations from that rum money with 500 years of interest compounded quarterly, and then the Africans got shafted when they got here. We know that, somewheres around fifty years ago, the Great Society decided to make amends somehow by changing rules so that fairness would balance out by giving the shaft to everyone else. So we paid increased taxes to provide welfare like crazy, food stamps, paying even more money each time the mother had another kid, and even more money if the father abandoned the family — and we topped it off with racial quotas that we called “Affirmative Action” (because we like gentle aphorisms — e.g., “pro-choice” instead of “suctioning the limbs off a life,” or “Affordable Care Act” instead of “Mandating That Men Pay for Pre-Natal Health Coverage In Case They Get Pregnant”). We lugs don’t trust anyone in Washington, and we have kind-of figured out finally that the system is too unwieldy, too corrupt ever to fix. The Swamp, we now know, cannot be drained because it is not a marsh or everglade but an ocean of sludge filled with plastic straws, unrecyclable paper, Strzok-Page love notes, and 33,000 bleached messages about yoga and wedding dresses. The System betrays all. Half of us vote for a liberal like Clinton, only to be presented with an end to Welfare, a tough crime bill, and a dry-cleaning bill for a dress stain. At least he delivered Midnight Basketball. The other half of us, deep-rooted patriotic conservatives, vote for Republicans and end up with Justices like David Souter and Harry Blackmun, with wage and price controls, and with international “free-trade” agreements that all-but-destroy our steel and aluminum industries, while decimating our manufacturing. We elect Liberals who run on peace agendas, like Woodrow Wilson (“He Kept Us Out of War”) or JFK/LBJ who swear they will not allow a Goldwater to embroil us in military catastrophe, and we end up with our boys dying overseas in huge numbers in Vietnam. Or the other half of us go with our more conservative “America First” approach, and we end up with reckless adventurism aiming for regime change in the Arab Muslim world, based on the delusion that there beats in the heart-and-soul of every resident of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria a passion to actualize the writings of Rousseau, Locke, and Thoreau. We watch our borders overrun brazenly, shamelessly. No control, with millions teeming to enter illegally, lecturing us: “We have a right to be here!” They could lecture us “Yankee Go Home!” but we cannot send them back? They don’t speak a word of English except the one sentence they have been taught by American Leftist activists to memorize: “I claim asylum because of well-founded fear of persecution based on my ethnicity, race, and religion. Para todas las demás preguntas, marque 2 por Español .” (For all other questions, dial 2 por Español. ) We see the Democrats swear for decades to guard the border, build a wall, and protect the endangered lower economic class and African Americans from a swarm of cheap labor, until the Democrats figure out that the lower economic class and African Americans are in their pockets anyway, while the New Illegals actually turn Republican strongholds into Democrat states. So we turn to Republicans, who promise to fix the border. Next thing you know, the capitalist big business “Chambers of Commerce” are in cahoots with the Left, importing the same Illegals for cheap labor. We turn to Reagan for some conservative rugged patriotism and firm strength, and he grants universal amnesty to Illegals. Then Bush-the-First promises to be even kinder and gentler. Then Bush-the-Next decides that, since he has Spanish-speaking relatives who can pronounce “nookyuluh” as well as he can, we may as well let the Illegals keep coming in because, unknown to the Liberals, the Illegals all are small-business owners and all are devout Hispanic Catholics who are pro-life and anti-abortion like the Pope, pro-family, conservative Republicans at heart. And then Bush!-the-Last comes in, with Ana Navarro as his political advisor, telling us that we don’t want to keep the millions out because we are “better than that.” So we elect Trump, who promises to deport 10 million Illegals, and we give him a Republican House and a Republican Senate, and we oust John Boehner for a new young dynamic GOP House Speaker who was the Vice Presidential nominee and conservative conscience of the losing Romney campaign, and that guy turns out to be Whatever. He gets his one “Budget Reconciliation” chance in a two-year legislative term to pass a budget that will build a border wall because that is the one bill every two years that does not require a filibuster-proof 60-vote Senate vote for passage, so it’s a piece of cake. And he “pulls a Bill Buckner ” (rest his soul) and leaves it out. So even though the President proves to be a once-in-a-generation Transformational President who brashly eliminates swaths of economy-strangling regulations, who dramatically renegotiates one after another terrible international trade treaty, who fearlessly pulls out of cockamamie international fiascoes like the Iran Deal and the Paris Climate Nonsense, who moves the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognizes United Jerusalem as Israel’s eternal capital and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, who directs laser-focused attention at the border crisis and tries one-after-another-after-another stratagem to deal with the morass, who waves a magic wand and resurrects a Dead Economy with bold tax cuts and even more determined deregulating and converts it into a blazing-hot engine, who reduces African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American, and female unemployment to historic lows, who changes the face of the Supreme Court and nominates more than one hundred solid conservative federal district and appellate judges, who reimagines America’s energy-producing capabilities and converts America into a net exporter of energy and the world’s largest energy producer, who recalibrates the Veterans Administration and V.A. health care, who forces through a “Right to Try” initiative that allows Americans with perilous ailments access to cutting-edge medical research possibilities — despite all that, and so much more , the GOP House not only drops the ball but butt-fumbles . No solutions or meaningful fixes to medical coverage, health care, and the mess exacerbated many times over by Obamacare. No solutions to the Southern Border national emergency. No groundbreaking ground-breaking infrastructure legislation. And so the American voters throw the bums out in 2018. The Left Democrat districts were going to vote Democrat no matter what. The conservative Republican districts were going to vote GOP no matter what. But in 2018, Democrats targeted more moderate, though conservative-leaning swing districts, and they campaigned on promises. We will do it. We will fix health care. We will find a fix for the border. We will rebuild the infrastructure. The message and that promise won the day. The same moderate, conservative-leaning swing districts that repeatedly had given the Republicans control of the House for much of the past two decades switched over for a better way. They were promised an end to the old Obama-era shenanigans. No more Democrats Gone Wild. No more Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. We Promise. It may well be that today’s House Democrats have been advancing the most exciting legislative agenda in American history, fixing more problems than ever imagined. But here is what Congress looks like to us lugs outside their bubble: 1. Investigations. 3. Climate. 4. Impeachment. Investigations . Every single day’s news is dominated, day after day, week after week, month after month by investigations of the President, subpoenas to his executive branch, his friends and associates, his family. Investigations that go from Michael “Cash Cab” Cohen as the very first sworn witness of the Congressional term to Mueller to John Dean, who masterminded Watergate. It’s like swearing-in Harvey Weinstein to testify about Bill Clinton. And never-ending daily discussions of: FISA warrants. Redactions. Grand jury transcripts. Hold the Attorney-General in contempt. Hold the Secretary of the Treasury in contempt. Hold the Secretary of Commerce in contempt. Demand the President’s taxes. Subpoenas and litigation for his taxes. Open borders . Racing to California-Hawaii-Washington-Oregon so that one single Obama lifetime ally in one discrete judicial district in one room in one nook of San Francisco where climate-altering air conditioning can filter out from one courtroom the stench of the sidewalk feces and urine of The Homeless just outside, can issue a nationwide injunction imposing whatever the ACLU or the Democrats propose that one Obama Judge impose on 300 million unsupposing Americans, thus tying up one Presidential initiative after another. Each injunction begins to age not like a fine wine but like a rancid vinegar, awaiting its slowly trickling journey through the appellate circuit, typically the Obama Ninth, until it perhaps will see its day of adjudication at the Supreme Court someday, but only if the justices grant certiorari for the appeal to be heard. Meanwhile, the Sanctuary Cities and their Brazen Mayors defy the law of the land, even as their Sanctuary Gothams teem with tens of thousands of Homeless whom they cannot afford to clothe or shelter or even protect from rats and typhus outbreaks, amid the shooting galleries (heroin, bullets) in Sanctuaries like Chicago and Baltimore. Record numbers to our South flock to our border and brazenly cross in, sometimes haplessly swimming across in a lake until our Coast Guard saves them from drowning, sometimes climbing over walls or contending with barbed wire, often first renting a child en route so they can claim “Family” and the “ Flores Decree ” — all in the desperate hope that, instead of being turned back whence they came, they will be permitted by our compassionate border guards to find food, shelter, medical care, and safety in one of our facilities that a former bartender cum laude with studies in international affairs, economics, and mixology calls “concentration camps.” Climate . Green New Deal. The world to end in twelve years if we do not outlaw meat, plastic straws and bags, raise taxes by the trillions to retrofit every building in America. Presumably require that all cattle be force-fed tablets of Tums or spoonsful of Mylanta to control their flatulence and breaking bad. End reliance not only on coal but also on oil and even on clean natural gas. Rather, more solar energy like the advances charted by Solyndra. More windmills. Perhaps generating the power needed to air condition the Cannon, Longworth, and Rayburn House Office Buildings by having teams of hamsters generate energy by running on wheels throughout D.C. And always back to Impeachment . Every day another call by the Left Media and their Democrat patrons for impeachment. When November 2020 rolls around, the defrauded, cheated “Swing Voters” will be situated to say: “You promised health care, a fix to the border crisis, and infrastructure. You played us for chumps. All you gave us were Investigations, Climate, Open Borders, and Impeachment. We were sick of Republican lies, so we threw those bums out. Now we are sick of you once again, so we are throwing you out.” It turns out they may be the ones doing the Impeaching."
