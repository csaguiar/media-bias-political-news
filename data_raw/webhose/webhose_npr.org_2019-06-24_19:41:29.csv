It's day two of the French Open. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks to Sports Illustrated executive editor Jon Wertheim about what to expect from tennis' aging greats and up-and-comers.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
How much longer will the aging greats of tennis remain the best in the game? Or, put another way, when might we see a new generation of tennis greats take over from the likes of Serena Williams and Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal? Well, if the past couple of days on the clay courts of Paris are any indication, they are not yielding the mantle just yet.
It is Day 2 of the French Open. Here to talk predictions and catch us up on the latest in the world of tennis is Jon Wertheim. He's in Paris for Sports Illustrated. Jon Wertheim, welcome.
JON WERTHEIM: Thank you. Good to be here.
KELLY: Good to have you with us. Start with today's big match, Serena Williams, who was looking a little rocky at the start. And then what happened?
WERTHEIM: She lost the first set. And then, as if it were no more difficult than this, flicking a switch, she then lost only one more game the rest of the afternoon. And you said it. The pillars are not yielding lightly. She is 37 years old. She is a mother. And she is into Round 2 and really has as good a chance of anyone in the women's field of winning this.
KELLY: Who else are you watching in the women's field?
WERTHEIM: It's a great question. I mean, the men's have these two players that are head and shoulders above the field. They're sort of, you know - I said the other day they were - they were first class, and everyone else was business or coach.
KELLY: (Laughter).
WERTHEIM: The women's is a lot of business class.
KELLY: OK.
WERTHEIM: The defending champ in Simona Halep, but she has not won a title this year. Already two top players have been eliminated. Naomi Osaka is the No. 1 seed. She's going for her third straight major. But she's never won a tournament of any size on clay. So you go down the list, and I sort of like the one that's won 23 majors, even if she is 37 years old. I wouldn't be surprised if Serena stole this.
KELLY: All right, and back over on the men's side, you were talking about the first class of Nadal and Federer. I mean, is it - does it make any sense to anyone anywhere to bet against Nadal on clay?
WERTHEIM: That's a great question. He's only won this event 11 times prior.
KELLY: Yeah, only 11.
WERTHEIM: It's - it's absurd. I mean, he's going for his 12th title. That's more than any player has won any major. The No. 1 player right now is Novak Djokovic. But really, I don't know how you bet against Nadal. And as wide open as the women's field is, it would really be, I'd say, a considerable upset if Nadal and Djokovic don't play in the final a week from Sunday. I mean, they're really - given Nadal's clay record and given that Djokovic has won three straight majors, they're really the overwhelming favorites.
KELLY: So what do you make of this whole changing of the guards question, with all these greats, the first-class players here, all well into their 30s?
WERTHEIM: I was going to say, the guards do not change in this sport. I love it. I mean, I think the why is really interesting. Is it financial incentives? Is it technology? Is it that these players now have the means to travel with trainers and therapists? But it's terrific. I mean, these careers are extending longer than ever. Roger Federer first played this event in 1999. I mean, Serena won her first major in 1999.
KELLY: Is that right - 1999? - 20 years ago. Wow.
WERTHEIM: She got a congratulations from Bill Clinton.
KELLY: Yeah.
WERTHEIM: And I think it allows fans to have these longer bonds. Sponsors love it. I think everybody wins here. But it's remarkable. And you asked initially - and I think it's a really good question - where is the next generation? And the truth is, this generation we're quite familiar with has no intention of retreating.
KELLY: You're calling it terrific. Is it also, for somebody in your line of work, just the tiniest bit boring (laughter)...
WERTHEIM: (Laughter).
KELLY: ...That you could - you could almost pre-write the lead?
WERTHEIM: I will take sustained excellence, as I'm sure my colleagues that cover golf will say about Tiger Woods. Give me sustained excellence over unpredictability. No, I mean, I think it's a good question. And it would be nice if occasionally, especially on the men's side, we saw a little fresh blood. But I think what we're seeing are - with Djokovic, Nadal, Federer and Serena - these are four of the great, great titans of tennis.
I mean, these - in Federer and Serena right now - are probably the two best players ever. And the fact that all four of them are coexisting, and you have - especially on the men's side, you have these individual rivalries...
KELLY: Right.
WERTHEIM: ...And these matches. But really, three guys playing for history is sort of a subtext of all these tournaments. Give me four titans over any given Sunday parity any day of the week.
KELLY: Jon Wertheim, good luck with your hardship assignment there in Paris.
WERTHEIM: (Laughter) That I'll take.

"As Floodwaters Threaten To Wash Away WWII Sub, Crews Race To Sink It",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358663/as-floodwaters-threaten-to-wash-away-wwii-sub-crews-race-to-sink-it,"A World War II-era submarine is again in the water after flooding in Oklahoma inundated the park where the submarine was housed. It's part of extensive flooding in the Missouri River basin.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Let's go next to Muskogee. That's another of the many Oklahoma towns where, as we just heard, flooding has driven people from their homes. Muskogee is also where the USS Batfish usually sits on dry land. The Batfish is a submarine, a World War II-era submarine. And rising waters at the Muskogee War Memorial Park are testing whether it is still watertight. The park's executive director Brent Trout is keeping tabs on the Batfish. He joins me now. Brent Trout, welcome.
BRENT TROUT: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.
KELLY: So what's going on today? What's the latest situation around the Batfish?
TROUT: We're playing the waiting game. We had a submarine try to break loose on us in Muskogee, and it's a completely unique problem. When you talk to the state emergency management officials, they don't know how to handle a World War II submarine.
KELLY: So let's paint a picture for people listening, trying to imagine what you are able to see. Usually, the Batfish, which is how many feet long?
TROUT: Three hundred eleven feet long.
KELLY: Normally, it sits in the middle of a big kind of lawn - meadow. Is that right?
TROUT: Yeah, we have it actually sat in the middle of what we call a berm. It's kind of a bowl that we anticipate if there is any minor flooding that the bowl will keep it isolated in the area.
KELLY: How many feet of water where the Batfish is right now?
TROUT: It's probably about 15 to 18 feet.
KELLY: Wow. I guess the submarine floats. It's still watertight.
TROUT: Well, you know, we were wondering about that because, you know, it was built in America - built to last. So would it still be floating after all these years? And the answer is, yes, it is floating. Half of it is floating. So we had to strategically float some aspects of it and bury some aspects of it. The goal was to get the rudder to dig into the ground almost as an additional anchor point, which is something that, you know, for a bunch of museum professionals, you'd never anticipate having to do.
KELLY: Now, I gather there is some concern if the Batfish were to break free of the lines you're trying to secure it with and - what? - float on down the river, what would - what are you preparing for here?
TROUT: Well, that was a huge concern on Thursday and Friday. So some of the lines started snapping, and we were actually on-site when the lines started snapping, and it was probably one of the scariest things I've seen in my life. So it was in danger of floating down the river, which the main concern would be that it would float down and hit a dam. And if it would have hit the dam - see, Muskogee already had a problem with loose barges. Had they actually breached a dam, it would have wiped out communities completely instead of just giving communities time to evacuate.
KELLY: How did a submarine end up in landlocked Oklahoma, by the way?
TROUT: Well, you know, it's a long - it could be its own series on NPR, but basically...
KELLY: (Laughter) Give us the short version of the story.
TROUT: The World War II submarine veterans that survived - most people don't know this, but submarine service was the deadliest service to be in during World War II. So these guys wanted to honor all their lost friends. And ironically, they had to use spring floods to actually put it in place, and we're going to have to use spring floods or early summer floods to put it back in place, so full circle, you know?
KELLY: Yeah. So I'm talking to you, of course, on Memorial Day. You had a whole ceremony planned at the memorial park. What did you all have planned?
TROUT: Well, another thing that we have on the ground is a piece of the USS Oklahoma, one of the battleships that sunk at Pearl Harbor. And we were actually going to do what we call a tolling for all the people who perished on board the USS Oklahoma. So it's over 400 people. It's a beautiful ceremony. And that's the painful thing is that everybody's off today, but we don't feel complete because we're not doing what we want to do. We're not honoring the people that have given their lives for this country. And it's kind of - I don't know. I don't know how to take it. It's weird.
KELLY: Well, Brent Trout, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. And we wish you luck in the coming days as you watch what happens with the water there.
TROUT: Yeah. I appreciate it. Thanks for having me on. And just, you know, pray for us up in Muskogee, and keep an eye on us. And I always have to mention we're going to rebuild, and we'll be better than ever. I promise.
KELLY: Brent Trout - he is executive director of the Muskogee War Memorial Park in Muskogee, Okla.

Disasters Pile Up As Storms Continue Plowing Through Oklahoma,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358656/disasters-pile-up-as-storms-continue-plowing-through-oklahoma,"Severe weather has walloped Oklahoma this month. First major flooding hit much of the state, then a tornado shredded a small town, killing two people. More floods are forecast for later this week.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Oklahoma has been walloped by severe weather this past week. First there was major flooding in many parts of the state. Then this past weekend, a brief but powerful tornado slammed a small town west of Oklahoma City. Two people were killed. Meanwhile the forecast this week is calling for more rain, which, in turn, would lead to more flooding. We're joined now by Rachel Hubbard. She's been covering this from member station KOSU. Hi, Rachel.
RACHEL HUBBARD, BYLINE: Hi.
KELLY: Hi. So start with the tornado this weekend. What exactly happened?
HUBBARD: Well, there was a line of thunderstorms that was moving across Oklahoma. And most people were aware of it. But it spun up this brief tornado called a QLCS tornado. These are the specific kinds of tornadoes that happen in these lines of thunderstorms. And they're known for being brief and weak. But they're also known for coming with very little warning.
And this came at night. It only stayed on the ground for just four minutes. It was only 75 yards wide. But it hit right at this point - if you look on either one side or the other side of this 75-yard section, there's a car lot and a boat lot. It hit a motel and a trailer park. So two people died, and it was terrible.
KELLY: And do you know what the situation is today in El Reno, how they're doing?
HUBBARD: Well, they had already activated their severe weather plan. And this town is well-practiced because it was hit just six years ago by the largest tornado on record. They were already dealing with flooding that had happened earlier in the week. The governor of Oklahoma visited today. And President Donald Trump did call Governor Kevin Stitt while he was out and about saying that the nation's prayers were with Oklahoma.
KELLY: And I imagine everybody who was in this trailer park has had to find somewhere else to stay for the meantime.
HUBBARD: They have been evacuated. It tossed these trailer homes like tin cans. And there was one woman that said that she had turned in early and felt her bed bouncing. And she was evacuated and is staying elsewhere now.
KELLY: The flooding - this is not restricted to just this small part of the state. This is the whole state of Oklahoma that's going through this. Is that right?
HUBBARD: Yeah, 25% of the state has had at least 14 inches of water in the last 30 days. And if you look at towns in northeast Oklahoma like Skiatook - they've had 21 1/2 inches, Nowata 23 inches. It's just crazy. And this is all coming to a head in Tulsa along the Arkansas River.
KELLY: And what exactly is happening in Tulsa?
HUBBARD: Well, so all of this water from upstream that's coming from northeast Oklahoma is heading downstream into Tulsa. They have these aging levees. Many of them were built in the 1940s. The Keystone Dam is releasing huge amounts of water, and that has led to thousands of people being evacuated from their homes in the Tulsa area.
And then if you go down river, as you get closer to Arkansas, some communities, like Braggs and Webbers Falls, have been totally emptied out. One mayor earlier this week told people that if they refuse to evacuate, they should write their identification on their arm.
KELLY: Wow. I mean, it does sound as though it's just an overwhelmingly awful combination of floods and tornadoes and bad weather. What are people saying as you are out and about interviewing people and, I guess, just talking to your own neighbors?
HUBBARD: Well, people here are well-practiced. When we went into the basement on Saturday night with a tornado warning that hit near our home, our neighbors had their medication already prepared in plastic bags to take into the basement. But this has just been every day for nearly a month. And when you constantly have warnings coming through on your cell phone for floods and tornado watches and thunderstorms, it is hard to not just shut down.
KELLY: Yeah. Today, of course, is a holiday, Memorial Day. But are schools on track, businesses on track for business as usual tomorrow?
HUBBARD: Well, if it's not in a flooding area. So in Tulsa, there are hotels and businesses that have been evacuated. And they are expecting that it will be at least a week before they'll be able to return. And that's if they don't receive additional rainfall.
KELLY: Rachel Hubbard of member station KOSU in Oklahoma City - thank you, Rachel.
HUBBARD: You're welcome.

NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Staff Sgt. Tim Chambers, who spends hours each year saluting Rolling Thunder bikers.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
This weekend in Washington, D.C., the air was full of this sound.
(SOUNDBITE OF MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING)
KELLY: That would be motorcycles - a lot of them. It was the 32nd annual Rolling Thunder ride for Freedom. Hundreds of thousands of riders honor military members captured, missing or killed in combat. This year may have been the last Rolling Thunder ride. Organizers say the event has gotten too expensive and too big.
Marine veteran Staff Sergeant Tim Chambers was there for it. He comes every year. He stands for hours, holding a salute as fellow vets ride by. Yesterday he did it for his 18th time as temperatures soared and D.C.'s infamous summer humidity set in. I spoke with Chambers today, and he told me about the first time he held the salute back in 2002. He was on the National Mall by the Korean War Memorial when he saw a number of vets on bikes passing by.
TIM CHAMBERS: I thought, how can I thank them? So I just jumped off the curb and popped up a salute. And I saw tears rolling by on their faces. And that's what kept me driving throughout that salute until the last bike rolled around me. And then both sides of the street just rushed me and said thank you, Marine.
KELLY: So tell me about yesterday. Did you pick a certain place where you're going to be?
CHAMBERS: Yeah, it's become my memorial post. It's at 23rd and Constitution, right behind the Lincoln Monument.
KELLY: And you're full uniform.
CHAMBERS: Yeah.
KELLY: What's going through your head as you stand there?
CHAMBERS: I'm hoping I don't let anyone down. I didn't go to war, but I still care so much for those that did and the families left behind. So there's a lot riding on my shoulders.
KELLY: Not letting anybody down - what do you mean? just being able to hold the salute for so long.
CHAMBERS: Yeah, maintain my position and in life. You know, it's much more than one day out of the year thing. The families that lost their loved ones, they're like, wow, my son wanted to be that. And it kind of honors them, in essence, because it doesn't let the sacrifice go in vain.
KELLY: This seems to resonate with Korean vets, who are getting older now, vets from Vietnam, same thing - also Iraq, Afghanistan. I mean, it's all generations.
CHAMBERS: Yes, and it's very humbling. I was in a diner in Lexington, Ky. And this guy saw a shirt I had with my salute on the back that said, thank you, veterans in all the wars. And he goes, I know that Marine. And I'm like, well, I'm that Marine. He started to cry. He said, please keep doing it. He had to give up his motorcycle when he came home from war. And now he bounces and tries to go to school and is trying to find his way.
But somehow that resonates with him. And I never thought that would come from a combat veteran - a young buck, especially, that did get welcomed home. So that was probably the most humbling thing that really validated my existence of doing it, was from one of my own that did a lot more than me.
KELLY: That the respect is mutual.
CHAMBERS: Yes, that I was accepted. That meant the world to me.
KELLY: So there's the possibility that this weekend's was the last national Rolling Thunder ride on the National Mall. How do you feel about that?
CHAMBERS: I just go day by day. And, you know, things change, things happen, and we have to adapt.
KELLY: And I gather some plans to do this locally in different cities, maybe in different forms.
CHAMBERS: Oh, yes, they're going to do it, like, regional. You know, so that'll be able to reach more people throughout the country, which is good because not everyone can make it to D.C. And it doesn't start in D.C. It starts in every community where the blood flowed for our freedoms.
KELLY: Well, Tim Chambers, thank you for stopping by and sharing a little bit of your story with us. Thank you.
CHAMBERS: My pleasure.
KELLY: That's Marine Corps veteran Tim Chambers, also known as the Saluting Marine.

Rather than arresting rival Juan Guaido, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is targeting lower-ranking members the opposition party stripping their legal immunity and threatening them with arrest.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Now to Venezuela, where the government is going after those involved in the botched effort last month to oust authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro. One opposition lawmaker who took part in the uprising has been arrested. Others have taken refuge in foreign embassies or gone underground or fled the country. Reporter John Otis has more.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking in Spanish).
JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: This panel discussion in Caracas about the government crackdown was supposed to include opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro. But he's been targeted for arrest and is nowhere to be found. Simon Gomez, a human rights lawyer who helped organize the event, explains why.
SIMON GOMEZ: He is definitely into peril. He can be detained at any moment. So that's why he decided not to be with us this afternoon. He should be here in a free country.
OTIS: Pizarro isn't the only lawmaker in trouble. On April 30, the opposition tried to convince the armed forces to stage a coup against Maduro. His government responded by jailing the vice president of the National Assembly, Venezuela's congress. Other legislators have been stripped of their diplomatic immunity, often a prelude to arrest. Luis Vicente Leon is a Caracas political analyst.
LUIS VICENTE LEON: They tried to kick Maduro out with the military. And Maduro now is answering with radical actions against the civil politicians, trying to destroy them.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DIOSDADO CABELLO: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: On his TV program last week, Diosdado Cabello, the second most powerful figure in the Maduro government, pointed at photos of the targeted legislators. Among those he singled out was Winston Flores.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CABELLO: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: Flores helped last month's rebellion by bringing supporters into the streets. But few showed up. The uprising collapsed, and Flores fled the country. He spoke to NPR by phone from Ecuador.
WINSTON FLORES: (Through interpreter) The feeling is overwhelming. I'm outside my country without my family and without much money.
OTIS: Flores doesn't know when he'll be able to go back to Venezuela, but he plans to spend his time in exile traveling around South America, drumming up support for the opposition. Five more legislators have sought refuge in foreign embassies in Caracas. But that doesn't bother supporters of the Maduro government, who are gathered outside the National Assembly building downtown.
(SOUNDBITE OF DEMONSTRATION)
UNIDENTIFIED MADURO SUPPORTERS: (Chanting in Spanish).
OTIS: ""We'll always be loyal and never traitors,"" they chant.
AMILCAR MIRANDA: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: One of the demonstrators, Amilcar Miranda, is an agricultural technician. He says the lawmakers are getting what they deserve for supporting an illegal coup. The exodus of lawmakers has further hollowed out Venezuela's National Assembly, the only branch of government controlled by the opposition. Even before they fled, Maduro had ignored its laws and stripped the body most of its powers.
This is the entrance to the National Assembly building, and we're not going to be able to get in because it's blocked off by riot police with shields that - forming a big line here, blocking off all the journalists.
One of the lawmakers entering the building is Renzo Prieto. He spent four years in prison for protesting against Maduro. Prieto tells me that he and his colleagues remain undeterred.
RENZO PRIETO: (Speaking Spanish.)
OTIS: He says, ""unfortunately, the tyrant keeps abusing power, but we will keep up the fight.""

'American Soil' Is Increasingly Foreign Owned,www.npr.org,Ty Higgins,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/723501793/american-soil-is-increasingly-foreign-owned,"Enlarge this image A loaded combine harvester during a late corn harvest in Hamilton, Ohio. John Minchillo/AP hide caption

John Minchillo/AP American soil.
Those are two words that are commonly used to stir up patriotic feelings. They are also words that can't be taken for granted, because today nearly 30 million acres of U.S. farmland are held by foreign investors. That number has doubled in the past two decades, which is raising alarm bells in farming communities.
When the stock market tanked during the past recession, foreign investors began buying up big swaths of U.S. farmland. And because there are no federal restrictions on the amount of land that can be foreign owned, it's been left up to individual states to decide on any limitations.
It's likely that even more American land will end up in foreign hands, especially in states with no restrictions on ownership. With the median age of U.S. farmers at 55, many face retirement with no prospect of family members willing to take over. The National Young Farmers Coalition anticipates that two-thirds of the nation's farmland will change hands in the next few decades.
""Texas is kind of a free-for-all, so they don't have a limit on how much land can be owned,"" say's Ohio Farm Bureau's Ty Higgins. ""You look at Iowa and they restrict it — no land in Iowa is owned by a foreign entity.""
Ohio, like Texas, also has no restrictions, and nearly half a million acres of prime farmland are held by foreign-owned entities. In the northwestern corner of the state, below Toledo, companies from the Netherlands alone have purchased 64,000 acres for wind farms.
There are two counties in this region with the highest concentration of foreign-owned farmland — more than 41,000 acres each. One of those is Paulding County, where three wind farms straddle the Ohio-Indiana line.
Once a foreign entity buys up however many acres they want, Americans might never be able to secure that land again. So, once we lose it, we may lose it for good.
Ty Higgins
Higgins says that this kind of consumption of farmland by foreign entities is starting to cause concern. ""One of the main reasons that we're watching this ... is because once a foreign entity buys up however many acres they want, Americans might never be able to secure that land again. So, once we lose it, we may lose it for good.""
His other concern is that every acre of productive farmland that is converted over to something other than agriculture is an acre of land that no longer produces food. That loss is felt from the state level all the way down to rural communities, where one in six Ohioans has ties to agriculture.
Angela Huffman is a sixth-generation farmer in Wyandot County, which, along with Paulding County, has more than 41,000 acres of foreign-owned farmland. Her modest, two-story white farmhouse has been in her family for almost 200 years. Her grandfather was the last person to actively farm the land here. When he got out of farming due to declining markets, none of his five children wanted to take over, and the cropland is now leased.
But Huffman, a young millennial who lives here with her mother, wants to try to keep the farm going and revive her family heritage.
Walking out to the barn, a huge white Great Pyrenees dog watches over a small flock of sheep. Huffman says she's worried about the effects of foreign land ownership on her rural community — which she describes as similar to Walmart pushing local businesses out of the market.
""Right out my back door here, Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the world, has recently bought out a couple grain elevators,"" Huffman says, pointing across the field behind her house, ""basically extracting the wealth out of the community.""
To be fair, U.S. farmers and corporations also invest in overseas agriculture, owning billions of dollars of farmland from Australia to Brazil, but the Smithfield Food buyout has really raised concerns with American farmers. As part of that 2013 sale , a Chinese company now owns 146,000 acres of prime U.S. farmland.
Business U.S. Prepares Tariffs On Additional $300B Of Imported Chinese Goods Back in the Huffman farmhouse, Joe Maxwell is typing on a laptop at the kitchen table. Maxwell is a fourth-generation farmer from Missouri. He and Huffman are part of the Organization for Competitive Markets , an advocacy group of farmers and ranchers across the nation.
Maxwell points to the Smithfield Foods elevators across the field: ""The money that those elevators used to make stayed within the community. Today the money those elevators make will go into the pocket of someone thousands of thousands of miles away. This is going on across America.""
Maxwell is concerned that, as other states put restrictions on foreign purchases in place, Ohio in particular is being targeted. ""So when they're looking for investments in the U.S. and agriculture,"" he says, ""Ohio's a great ag state, and you don't have any restrictions like other states.""
Nationwide, Canadian investors own the most farmland. In Ohio, it's Germany, with 71,000 acres.
On the southern central part of the state, John Trimmer manages 30,000 acres of corn and soybeans for German investors. He's been working with German families that have wanted to get into U.S. agriculture since the 1980s. ""They started to buy land in Iowa and Minnesota,"" Trimmer explains, ""but right when they started, [Iowa and Minnesota] passed state laws which restricted foreign ownership.""
""None of them have an interest in the farm.""
Instead, the Germans turned to Ohio.
But, Trimmer says, there is a misconception about foreign owners — that they aren't good neighbors or good stewards of the land. What he sees is a growing divide between older family members who still live on the farm, and their children who have no interest in the family business and want to cash out the land.
""The last two farms we bought here, through an owner, her and her brothers and sisters inherited it from their mother, and none of them wanted to farm. None of them have an interest in the farm."" Trimmer explains that his German clients have established a reputation in the community for letting the tenants — often aging parents or grown children — continue to live in the houses on the farms they buy.
Sellers work directly with his German clients — instead of putting the property up on the market, the sale ensures that family members can live out their lives in the family homestead, while still getting cash value for the farmland."
"As Asia Transforms, Abe Looks To Clarify U.S.-Japan Alliance In Trump Meetings",www.npr.org,Mary Louise Kelly,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358635/as-asia-transforms-abe-looks-to-clarify-u-s-japan-alliance-in-trump-meetings,"NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Sheila A. Smith of the Council on Foreign Relations about the goals of the U.S.-Japan summit, including clarity on North Korea and economic deals.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
All right, well, let's dig in on that pomp with purpose and the blossoming bromance we just heard playing out there between Prime Minister Abe and President Trump. And to do that, we are joined by Sheila Smith. She is a senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Sheila Smith, welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
SHEILA SMITH: Thank you for having me.
KELLY: Start with trade. I wonder what the headline for you seems to be from this meeting so far in terms of progress made or not made in what we just heard President Trump there call a - an unbelievably large imbalance.
SMITH: Well, I think what I heard - and I heard it over the three days - is that the president is not going to let up pressure on Japan, on Prime Minister Abe on trade. Despite the close personal relationship, despite all the pageantry of this visit, it was just at the surface that the president was getting a little irritated with the arguments that Japan has been making on trade.
I think that this is not going to bode well for how this is going to end up. Mr. Abe doesn't have a lot of latitude to give the president what he wants. But I think they're trying very hard to keep it from bursting the seams, so to speak, on the overall political strategic relationship.
KELLY: What about on North Korea? As Anthony alluded to there, President Trump contradicted not only his host, the prime minister, but his own national security adviser, John Bolton, on the significance of these recent missile launches from North Korea and whether they violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. How significant a disagreement is that between Tokyo and Washington?
SMITH: I think that will be a disappointment for Prime Minister Abe for a couple of reasons. You know, again, President Trump said he was not personally concerned about the tests, still trying to lay out what I think he thinks is the base for a bargain with Kim Jong Un, and that is an economic development strategy by North Koreans that will then mitigate the military challenge.
But what Abe wanted to hear, really, was what John Bolton brought to the table and what he said the day before the president arrived, which was, yes, those missile tests violated U.N. sanctions. In other words, we are not going to soften our approach to the North. We're going to continue to maintain maximum economic pressure on the North. The president gave a very mixed signal here.
KELLY: So two areas there we've identified where maybe Prime Minister Abe did not hear exactly what he was hoping to hear from the president - what does Japan walk away from this summit with?
SMITH: Well, I think the message that Abe wanted to convey was first and foremost obviously to the Japanese people that their relationship is very close. I thought the imperial visit was very successful largely because the new emperor and empress looked very relaxed. They spoke in English. There were no interpreters. It was a very strong debut, if you will, for the new emperor and empress on the global stage.
I think there's also a message to be had in the region. Mr. Trump in Tokyo, with all the pomp and circumstance, with even the irritations on trade and that mixed signal in North Korea - it was clear that this is an alliance that was vibrant, that was coherent and that was still being deeply supported by both countries. That's the message Mr. Abe wants to send to Pyongyang and certainly the message he wants to send to Beijing.
KELLY: That pomp and circumstance extended to the appearance of Trump 2020 campaign banners. They were visible as the president was making his way through Japan's streets. Another of the events that he attended was this sumo tournament. Why is Prime Minister Abe so intent on courting President Trump?
SMITH: Well, you know, you - the backdrop here, too, is the Japanese people are not as critical of President Trump as many of the citizens of our other allies in Europe, for example. The president and the prime minister do have a reasonably strong working relationship. The Japanese diplomats pointed out before the visit that they've spoken or met 42 times since the president came into office.
KELLY: Forty-two times, wow.
SMITH: An unprecedented amount of contact. So I think there's still this sense that this is a good partnership and that Mr. Abe can make it work.
KELLY: When you look at what the U.S. walks away from this summit with, was it a success from the U.S. point of view?
SMITH: Well, the one thing - yes, obviously the president, I think, was happy. The president was happy to have been celebrated in the way he was celebrated. Clearly he repeated the mantra of, you know, this imperial visit was the first and most important thing in 200 years.
But I think it's also true that on Iran, they may have gotten a little bit of assistance from Mr. Abe. He offered to mediate. He's going to be visiting in Iran. And Mr. Abe and Mr. Trump both said nobody wanted war; nobody wanted rising conflict. And that may be helpful to the president, who has tried to put the damper just a little bit on the kind of drumbeat that looks like the United States and Iran could end up in a military conflict.
KELLY: That's Sheila Smith of the Council on Foreign Relations. She's also author of the book ""Japan Rearmed."" Sheila Smith, thank you.
SMITH: Thank you, Mary Louise.

"Prelude To A Rumble: In Visit Including Wrestling Match, U.S.-Japan Rifts Exposed",www.npr.org,Anthony Kuhn,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358628/prelude-to-a-rumble-in-visit-including-wrestling-match-u-s-japan-rifts-exposed,"President Trump's ceremony-laden Japan visit featured a sumo match and an audience with the new emperor. Despite talk of an ironclad alliance, rifts over trade, Iran and North Korea stood out.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
In Japan today, a first for President Trump. He became the first foreign dignitary to meet that country's new emperor. There was a lot of pageantry on display around Trump's visit, pageantry orchestrated to show an iron-clad alliance between Japan and the U.S. But as NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Tokyo, policy rifts were also on plain view.
ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: President Trump has been grumbling for decades that Japan takes advantage of the U.S. economically. He offered a slightly more polite version of that argument in his press conference today with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have an unbelievably large imbalance, as you know - trade imbalance, which has been there for many, many years, Japan having the big advantage. They are brilliant business people, brilliant negotiators and put us in a very tough spot.
KUHN: Abe responded by updating an argument Japan has made for years.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE: (Speaking Japanese).
KUHN: ""Since President Trump came to office,"" he said, ""Japanese companies have decided to make new investments in the U.S. worth $24 billion, creating some 45,000 new jobs.""
Trump, though, did not offer to remove the threat of tariffs on Japan's top export, cars. On North Korea, President Trump repeated that he's not bothered by Pyongyang's launch this month of short-range missiles which cannot hit the U.S. That's not very reassuring to Japan, which they can hit. The U.S. and Japan also differ on Iran, with which Japan has had close ties. Abe offered to mediate.
The rifts were almost forgotten amidst the pageantry of Trump meeting the new Japanese emperor and watching a sumo match. But Jeff Kingston, a Japan expert at Temple University in Tokyo, says that for Abe, the pomp has a purpose.
JEFF KINGSTON: For Abe, this is a crisis-management strategy. This is the way to deal with an erratic Trump. And he's really hoping that his blossoming bromance will, in some way, convince Trump to cut him some slack. And I'm skeptical about that.
KUHN: Kingston says Trump and Abe have simply put off the hard bargaining until after Japanese elections in July. Anthony Kuhn, NPR News, Tokyo. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Thailand's ruling junta has enacted harsh laws aimed at punishing those who ""defame"" the country's monarchy. That's led many dissidents to flee the country, but that hasn't guaranteed their safety.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Thailand's new king was formally crowned this month, and the ruling military junta has put a priority on protecting his image. It is jailing citizens who defame, insult or threaten the monarchy. As Michael Sullivan reports from Bangkok, Thai dissidents may not find safety even when they flee the country.
MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Sixty-four-year-old Tanya Tirawut’s son Siam fled to Laos shortly after the coup after running afoul of the military. But the two stayed in touch via social media until a few months ago when he went quiet. Two weeks ago, she heard from activists that he and two other dissidents had been forcibly returned to Thailand after trying to enter Vietnam on false passports. She hasn't heard anything since but fears the worst.
TANYA TIRAWUT: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: ""Yes,"" she says, ""I think all three of them are dead."" They wouldn't be the first. Two years ago, at least two Thai dissidents were forcibly disappeared while living in Laos and then there was this grisly discovery just a few months back.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: In January, Thai television showed pictures of the bodies of two antimonarchists on the Thai side of the Mekong River. They'd disappeared in the Lao capital a month earlier, along with another prominent activist. The dead men's hands and feet were bound with rope. They'd been disemboweled and stuffed with concrete.
SUNAI PHASUK: Thai authorities and Lao authority in the beginning totally deny knowledge of their disappearances. It took a long time for them to confirm that those were the bodies of missing activists.
SULLIVAN: And even after they did, says Sunai Phasuk, senior Thai researcher at Human Rights Watch, the authorities offered no assurances of a proper investigation, which surprised him not at all.
PHASUK: Human Rights Watch has seen paper evidence, even official requests from Thai goverment to the Lao government of names that the Thai want the Lao's authority to help arresting and handing them over. And these names include those who have gone missing, those who have been murdered.
SULLIVAN: Despite this, Thai authorities deny having any role in the disappearances of any Thai activists, including the three allegedly returned to Thailand from Vietnam earlier this month.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Thai).
PRAWIT WONGSUWAN: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: Deputy prime minister and former general Prawit Wongsuwan says the government has no idea what's become of the three. The Vietnamese government isn't talking either - not surprising given that a Vietnamese blogger who applied for refugee status at the U.N. in Bangkok disappeared right after filing his application in January. He turned up a few days later in jail in Hanoi. Human Rights Watch researcher Sunai Phasuk says there seems to be a quid pro quo among Southeast Asian governments these days to help each other hunt down asylum-seekers.
PHASUK: Enforced disappearances of dissidents and critics of governments in fact routine in Vietnam and Thailand, but now it has reached a new level of danger for activists.
SULLIVAN: Activists like Nithiwat Wannasiri of the folk group Fai Yen currently in hiding with two other band members who also fled after the coup and have written songs critical of both the military and the monarchy.
NITHIWAT WANNASIRI: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: Nithiwat says he's sure they'll be targeted next. ""We're on their list,"" he says. ""We just have to stay alert and try to be ready if they come."" Sixty-four-year-old Tanya Tirawut is pretty sure they already came for her son, Siam. All she wants is closure.
TIRAWUT: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: ""I can't get any answer,"" she says. ""If someone took your son, how would you feel? Is he dead or not? Just give me an answer,"" she says. ""I need an answer.""

From
In Arizona, prisoners are being charged for medical procedures the state is supposed to pay for. The bills can ruin inmates' credit, adding to their challenges when they rejoin society.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Now to Arizona, where prison inmates are being charged for medical procedures that should be paid for by the state. And many don't know about the charges until debt collectors come calling. As Jimmy Jenkins of member station KJZZ reports, the unpaid bills are damaging credit and making it more difficult for former inmates to start over after they've been released.
JIMMY JENKINS, BYLINE: Ashley Wilkeyson and her friends were happy to be outside. It was a beautiful day for softball at the Perryville women's prison in Goodyear, Ariz. Wilkeyson had just taken her place as shortstop when she heard the crack of the bat.
ASHLEY WILKEYSON: It was a grounder. I went down to go get it, tossed it to second. And then...
JENKINS: She heard another loud crack.
WILKEYSON: I guess misfooting or something - I don't even know.
JENKINS: She had broken her ankle - snapped it almost entirely in half. The prison sent Wilkeyson to the hospital, where they took X-rays, reset her bones and scheduled her for surgery.
WILKEYSON: And then they sent me back to the prison.
JENKINS: And that's when the bills started coming.
WILKEYSON: I called my grandma one day, and she was like, I just want you to know that we received a bill for about $2,907. It was almost three grand.
JENKINS: Wilkeyson is one of more than a dozen current and former inmates who say they are being erroneously charged for medical treatment performed while they were incarcerated in an Arizona prison. Inmates aren't supposed to pay for their health care in Arizona. They pay $4 to be seen by the health care provider for their first visit, and all services after that are performed, contracted and paid for by Corizon Health.
RITA LOMIO: The state pays Corizon almost $200 million to provide these health care services.
JENKINS: Rita Lomio is an attorney with the Prison Law Office. She represents the health care concerns of men and women in Arizona prisons in a separate class-action settlement.
LOMIO: There's no one who's really helping them. There's no one who's taking care of it. And we want to try to do what we can, but it's not, you know, really squarely part of the case or part of any case.
JENKINS: Keith Jones is a representative for one of the Arizona hospitals that contracts with Corizon. He says the bills inmates are receiving are actually coming from individual doctors, not the hospital.
KEITH JONES: There's independent service providers, like emergency physicians, that have separate agreements with third-party health plans.
JENKINS: Corizon contracts with the hospital. The hospital contracts with doctors. And doctors contract with billing services. So it's difficult to find out where exactly the process is breaking down. After KJZZ inquired about Wilkeyson's bill, the hospital says it asked the service providers to review the way claims are handled.
Rita Lomio is worried the bills will have devastating consequences for her clients as they try to rebuild their lives.
LOMIO: Undeserved bad credit due to a state contractor's failure to pay its bills only makes it harder to find housing and gain full employment and to support a family.
JENKINS: Lomio says she has collected inmate medical bills totaling more than $50,000. She says despite sending multiple letters to Corizon attorneys, the Prison Law Office has had little success getting the bills resolved. A spokesperson for Corizon said when the company is notified of unpaid medical services, it resolves them immediately. But a year after her release from prison, Ashley Wilkeyson is still fighting bills she doesn't owe.
WILKEYSON: I feel like I'm just banging my head up against a brick wall at this point, you know, because I keep getting the runaround. Like, oh, you need to reach out to this person. Oh, you need to reach out to this person. And I've gotten nowhere.
JENKINS: And the collection notices keep coming. For NPR News, I'm Jimmy Jenkins in Phoenix.

Jackie Fortier/StateImpact Oklahoma All eyes will be on Oklahoma this week when the first case in a flood of litigation against an opioid drug manufacturer begins on Tuesday.
Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter's suit alleges Johnson & Johnson, the nation's largest drugmaker, helped ignite a public health crisis that has killed thousands of state residents.
National Teva Pharmaceuticals Agrees To $85 Million Settlement With Oklahoma In Opioid Case With just two days to go before the trial, one of the remaining defendants, Teva Pharmaceuticals of Jerusalem, announced an $85 million settlement with the state on Sunday. The money will be used for litigation costs and an undisclosed amount will be allocated ""to abate the opioid crisis in Oklahoma,"" according to a press release from Hunter's office.
In its own statement , Teva said the settlement does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of the company, adding Teva, ""has not contributed to the abuse of opioids in Oklahoma in any way.""
That leaves Johnson & Johnson as the sole defendant.
Court filings accuse the company of overstating the benefits of opioids and understating their risks in marketing campaigns that duped doctors into prescribing the drugs for ailments not approved by regulators.
The bench trial — with a judge and no jury — is poised to be the first of its kind to play out in court.
We have looked at literally millions of documents, taken hundreds of depositions, and we are even more convinced that these companies are the proximate cause for the epidemic in our state and in our country.
Mike Hunter, Okla. Attorney General
Nora Freeman Engstrom, a professor at Stanford Law school, said lawyers in the other cases and the general public are eager to see what proof Hunter's office offers the court.
""We'll all be seeing what evidence is available, what evidence isn't available and just how convincing that evidence is,"" she says.
Most states and more than 1,600 local and tribal governments are suing drugmakers and distributors. They are trying to recoup billions of dollars spent on addressing the fallout tied to opioid addiction.
Initially, Hunter's lawsuit included Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. In March, Purdue Pharma settled with the state for $270 million. Soon after, Hunter dropped all but one of the civil claims , including fraud, against the remaining defendants. Teva settled for $85 million in May, leaving Johnson & Johnson as the only opioid manufacturer willing to go to trial with the state.
Hunter believes the state has a strong case.
""We have looked at literally millions of documents, taken hundreds of depositions, and we are even more convinced that these companies are the proximate cause for the epidemic in our state and in our country,"" Hunter says.
Precedent-setting case
The companies involved have a broad concern about what their liability might be, says University of Kentucky law professor Richard Ausness .
""This case will set a precedent,"" he says. ""If Oklahoma loses — of course they'll appeal if they lose — but the defendants may have to reconsider their strategy.""
National Criminal Trial Of Opioid-Peddling Drug Company Execs Goes To The Jury Shots - Health News Purdue Pharma Agrees To $270 Million Opioid Settlement With Oklahoma With hundreds of similar cases pending — especially a mammoth case pending in Ohio — the state's strategy will be closely watched.
""And of course lurking in the background is the multi-state litigation in Cleveland, where there will ultimately be a settlement in all likelihood, but the size of the settlement and the terms of the settlement may be influenced by Oklahoma,"" says Ausness.
'There's nothing wrong with producing opioids'
But the legal case is complicated. Unlike tobacco, where states won a landmark settlement , Ausness points out that opioids serve a medical purpose.
""There's nothing wrong with producing opioids. It's regulated and approved by the Federal Drug Administration, the sale is overseen by the Drug Enforcement Administration, so there's a great deal of regulation in the production and distribution and sale of opioid products,"" Ausness explains. ""They are useful products so this is not a situation where the product is defective in some way.""
There's nothing wrong with producing opioids. ... They are useful products so this is not a situation where the product is defective in some way.
Richard Ausness, University of Kentucky
It's an argument that has found some traction in court. Recently, a North Dakota judge dismissed all of that state's claims against Purdue, a big court win for the company. In a written ruling that the state says it will appeal, Judge James Hill questioned the idea of blaming a company that makes a legal product for opioid-related deaths.
""Purdue cannot control how doctors prescribe its products and it certainly cannot control how individual patients use and respond to its products,"" the judge wrote, ""regardless of any warning or instruction Purdue may give.""
Now the Oklahoma case rests entirely on a claim of public nuisance, which refers to actions that harm members of the public, including injury to public health.
""It's sexy,"" Ausness says. ""You know 'public nuisance' makes it sound like the defendants are really bad.""
If the state's claim prevails, Big Pharma could have to spend billions of dollars in Oklahoma helping ease the epidemic. ""It doesn't diminish the amount of damages we believe we'll be able to justify to the judge,"" Hunter says, estimating a final payout could run into the ""billions of dollars.""
Hunter's decision to go it alone and not join with a larger consolidated case could mean a quicker resolution for the state, or no money all, Ausness says.
""Particularly when we're talking about [attorneys general], who are politicians, who want to be able to tell the people, 'Gee, this is what I've done for you.' They are not interested in waiting two or three years [for a settlement], they want it now,"" he says. ""Of course the risk of that is you may lose.""

Jackie Fortier/StateImpact Oklahoma Looking for treatment
Oklahoma has the second highest uninsured rate in the nation and little money for public health. The state is trying to win money from the drug companies to pay for treatment for people like Greg, who uses drugs and is afraid he'll lose his job if we use his last name.
Greg and his wife Judy say they haven't been able to find the integrated treatment that Greg needs for both his opioid addiction and his bipolar disorder. It's either one or the other.
""They don't give you ... a treatment plan for both,"" Judy says. ""They just say, 'Here, you can talk to this person.' They don't recognize that it's like self-medicating.""
The couple live in Guthrie, Okla., about an hour north of the courthouse where the opioid trial will take place. Greg says he's been addicted to opioids for 11 years. People with prescriptions sell him their pills — sometimes Greg binges and takes 400 milligrams of morphine at once, a huge dose.
Of the $270 million Purdue settlement, $200 million is earmarked for an addiction research and treatment center in Tulsa, though no details have been released. An undisclosed amount of the $85 million Teva settlement will also go to abating the crisis.
Judy hopes that the treatment center may eventually help Greg.
""I wish he would stop using [opioids], but I love him. I'll always be here,"" she said.

John Minchillo/AP American soil.
Those are two words that are commonly used to stir up patriotic feelings. They are also words that can't be be taken for granted, because today nearly 30 million acres of U.S. farmland are held by foreign investors. That number has doubled in the past two decades, which is raising alarm bells in farming communities.
When the stock market tanked during the last recession, foreign investors began buying up big swaths of U.S. farmland. And because there are no federal restrictions on the amount of land that can be foreign-owned, it's been left up to individual states to decide on any limitations.
It's likely that even more American land will end up in foreign hands, especially in states with no restrictions on ownership. With the median age of U.S. farmers at 55, many face retirement with no prospect of family members willing to take over. The National Young Farmers Coalition anticipates that two-thirds of the nation's farmland will change hands in the next few decades.
""Texas is kind of a free-for-all, so they don't have a limit on how much land can be owned,"" say's Ohio Farm Bureau's Ty Higgins, ""You look at Iowa and they restrict it — no land in Iowa is owned by a foreign entity.""
Ohio, like Texas, also has no restrictions, and nearly half a million acres of prime farmland are held by foreign-owned entities. In the northwestern corner of the state, below Toledo, companies from the Netherlands alone have purchased 64,000 acres for wind farms.
There are two counties in this region with the highest concentration of foreign-owned farmland — more than 41,000 acres each. One of those is Paulding County, where three wind farms straddle the Ohio-Indiana line.
Once a foreign entity buys up however many acres they want, Americans might never be able to secure that land again. So, once we lose it, we may lose it for good.
Ty Higgins
Higgins says that this kind of consumption of farmland by foreign entities is starting to cause concern. ""One of the main reasons that we're watching this ... is because once a foreign entity buys up however many acres they want, Americans might never be able to secure that land again. So, once we lose it, we may lose it for good.""
His other concern is that every acre of productive farmland that is converted over to something other than agriculture, is an acre of land that no longer produces food. That loss is felt from the state level all the way down to rural communities, where one in six Ohioans has ties to agriculture.
Angela Huffman is a 6th generation farmer in Wyandot County, which, along with Paulding County, has over 41,000 acres of foreign-owned farmland. Her modest, two-story white farmhouse has been in her family for almost 200 years. Her grandfather was the last person to actively farm the land here. When he got out of of farming due to declining markets, none of his five children wanted to take over, and the cropland is now leased.
But Huffman, a young millennial who lives here with her mother, wants to try and keep the farm going and revive her family heritage.
Walking out to the barn, a huge white Great Pyrenees dog watches over a small flock of sheep. Huffman says she's worried about the effects of foreign land ownership on her rural community — which she describes as similar to Walmart pushing local businesses out of the market.
""Right out my back door here, Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the world, has recently bought out a couple grain elevators,"" Angela says pointing across the field behind her house, ""basically extracting the wealth out of the community.""
To be fair, U.S. farmers and corporations also invest in overseas agriculture, owning billions of dollars of farmland from Australia to Brazil, but the Smithfield Food buyout has really raised concerns with American farmers. As part of that 2013 sale , a Chinese company now owns 146,000 acres of prime U.S. farmland.
Business U.S. Prepares Tariffs On Additional $300B Of Imported Chinese Goods Back in the Huffman farmhouse, Joe Maxwell is typing on a laptop at the kitchen table. Maxwell is a fourth generation farmer from Missouri. He and Huffman are part of the Organization for Competitive Markets , an advocacy group of farmers and ranchers across the nation.
Maxwell points to the Smithfield Foods elevators across the field: ""The money that those elevators used to make stayed within the community. Today the money those elevators make, will go into the pocket of someone thousands of thousands of miles away. This is going on across America.""
Maxwell is concerned that, as other states put restrictions on foreign purchases in place, Ohio in particular is being targeted. ""So when they're looking for investments in the U.S. and agriculture,"" he says, ""Ohio's a great ag state and you don't have any restrictions like other states.""
Nationwide, Canadian investors own the most farmland. In Ohio, it's Germany, with 71,000 acres.
On the southern central part of the state, John Trimmer manages 30,000 acres of corn and soybeans for German investors. He's been working with German families that have wanted to get into U.S. agriculture since the 1980s. ""They started to buy land in Iowa and Minnesota,"" Trimmer explains, ""but right when they started then [Iowa and Minnesota] passed state laws which restricted foreign ownership.""
'None of them have an interest in the farm'
Instead, the Germans turned to Ohio.
But, Trimmer says, there is a misconception about about foreign owners — that they aren't good neighbors or good stewards of the land. What he sees is a growing divide between older family members who still live on the farm, and their children who have no interest in the family business and want to cash out the land.
""The last two farms we bought here, through an owner, her and her brothers and sisters inherited it from their mother, and none of them wanted to farm. None of them have an interest in the farm."" Trimmer explains that his German clients have established a reputation in the community for letting the tenants — often aging parents or grown children — continue to live in the houses on the farms they buy.
Sellers work directly with his German clients — instead of putting the property up on the market, the sale ensures that family members can live out their lives in the family homestead, while still getting cash value for the farmland."

MLB Great Bill Buckner Dead At 69 : NPR,www.npr.org,Gabe O'Connor,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727355557/former-red-sox-first-baseman-bill-buckner-dies-at-69,"Enlarge this image Boston Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner, shown in March 1986, died Monday at the age of 69.

toggle caption AP Boston Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner, shown in March 1986, died Monday at the age of 69. Despite a well-regarded 22-year career, he was best-known for an infamous gaffe in the 1986 World Series.
AP Being remembered for a mistake is hard. Being the living symbol of 86 years of futility is just about impossible.
But that's exactly what Bill Buckner was to Boston Red Sox fans for nearly 20 years.
Buckner, an All-Star baseball player who played in the major leagues for 22 years, died Monday. He was 69.
""After battling the disease of Lewy Body Dementia, Bill Buckner passed away early the morning of May 27th surrounded by his family,"" according to a statement from his family shared by the Red Sox. ""Bill fought with courage and grit as he did all things in life. Our hearts are broken but we are at peace knowing he is in the arms of his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.""
Buckner built up an impressive record as a player, with more than 1,000 runs scored during his career. He was an All-Star in 1981 while playing for the Chicago Cubs. But Buckner found it hard to shake a mistake he made during Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets.
The Sox had a two-run lead, and were one strike away from winning their first World Series championship since 1918. But the Mets clawed back from the brink to tie the game in the 10th inning. With a runner on second base, a base hit would give the Mets the win and force a Game 7.
It turned out they only needed the most famous error in baseball history.
YouTube Mets player Mookie Wilson hit a grounder toward first base — as the announcer called it, ""a little roller up along first."" Buckner ran toward the ball, took a wide stance, reached down to scoop it up — and the ball rolled right between his legs.
""It gets through Buckner!"" the announcer says, shocked, as a Met crosses home plate. ""The Mets win it!""
The error forced a Game 7, which the Mets won. And the error turned Bill Buckner into New England's scapegoat.
""People always ask me what I thought about when I missed the ground ball,"" he told NPR in 2011 . ""My first thought was, 'Wow, we get to play in the seventh game of the World Series. ... We'll get 'em tomorrow.' ""
Buckner played for a few more years, retiring in 1990 and moving his family to Meridian, Idaho — where most people hadn't heard of him, or his World Series gaffe. It wasn't until 2004 that Buckner finally found redemption, once the Red Sox finally won their first World Series in 86 years.
Time and winning heal all sports wounds — and the fans and media were no longer so angry at Buckner. When Buckner returned to Fenway Park for the 2008 Red Sox home opener, he was greeted with open arms — and a two-minute ovation.
""It was awesome,"" Buckner told NPR. ""The real cool thing about it was the fans ... were sincere,"" he said. ""I think they understood all the crap I went through, and they were always good to me.""
Perhaps the fans' sentiment was best summed up by the the next day's cover headline in the Boston Herald: ""All is Forgiven.""

Brian Mann for NPR Brian Mann for NPR Volunteers help pay for and disseminate overdose kits, including the overdose antidote, naloxone, in Summit County, Ohio. The costs of battling the addiction crisis are a burden on many local municipalities.
Brian Mann for NPR As pharmaceutical companies prepare to square off with states and local communities in courts around the U.S., a growing number of state and local officials say the industry should pay to cover the cost of the nation's deadly opioid epidemic.
""I think they are as complicit in this as the dealers that are dealing on the streets and for that I think they should pay a price,"" says Gerald Craig, executive director of the Alcohol, Drug Addiction and Mental Health Board in Summit County, Ohio. That county is involved in a lawsuit against drugmakers that's slated to go to trial later this year.
A first test case begins this week in Oklahoma , a trial that will test the limits of the drug industry's liability. Two of the defendants have already settled claims with state officials there. Purdue Pharma agreed to pay $270 million back in March and this week, Teva Pharmaceuticals settled for a $85 million payment.
National Majority Of Americans Say Drug Companies Should Be Held Responsible For Opioid Crisis Shots - Health News Lawsuit Details How The Sackler Family Allegedly Built An OxyContin Fortune The trial will go forward against the only remaining defendant, Johnson & Johnson, the nation's biggest drug-maker. In legal filings last week, the company argued that it sold only small amounts of opioids in Oklahoma and bears no responsibility for opioid overdoses in that state.
This is one many lawsuits in jurisdictions across the country. In Cleveland, Ohio, a judge is overseeing hundreds of lawsuits filed against manufacturers and distributors of opioids by local municipalities. The first of several trials is planned for October, according to the Associated Press.
These cases come at a time when opioid addiction continues to claim thousands of lives across the country. And local and regional leaders tackling the problems brought by addiction struggle to do so with insufficient resources.
Expecting big payouts
Local officials say they deserve big payouts because they have faced the brunt of an epidemic that began when companies began marketing highly addictive opioid medications in the 1990s. They argue that that drugmakers and distributors made misleading claims about the safety of their drugs.
Excessive prescribing of these medications led to record numbers of people consuming opioids, fueling soaring levels of addiction and overdose deaths. When the legal supply started to dry up, desperate people turned to the black market, buying heroin often laced with deadly synthetics like fentanyl.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 200,000 Americans died from overdoses linked to prescription opioids from 1999 to 2017.
Though overdose deaths involving fentanyl now greatly surpass those involving prescriptions opioids, pills continue to claim lives — accounting for 35% of opioid overdose deaths in 2017.
In Ohio, the numbers are particularly bad , with some of the highest year-over-year overdose increases of any state. ""We had 340 overdose deaths [in 2016] in Summit County alone,"" says Craig. ""Our overdoses went from three a day to over twelve a day.""
A dearth of funds on the ground
So far, most of the resources to respond to the crisis have come from local taxpayers and nonprofit donations. Many places have had to cobble together sources of funds to meet the growing demands of the epidemic.
In Summit County, Ohio, alone, taxpayers have paid out roughly $70 million dollars to tackle the problem.
""We had no cash on hand,"" says Donna Skoda, chair of the county's health department. ""We had to start looking for grants.""
Funding is needed for a wide range of services to help individuals and communities affected by addiction to opioids.
Skoda points to the rapid expansion of foster care in Summit County — a growing number of children have ended up in foster care in recent years around the country, largely due to the opioid crisis.
""The number of children they've had to take [in] for safety reasons, it's just doubled, not to mention the children who've been orphaned,"" says Skoda.
It's not just the county facing new budget pressure. Dozens of organizations have found themselves responding to the epidemic, including schools, police departments, courts, non-profit groups and hospitals. ""We knew we had to do something different,"" says Dr. Michael Hughes at Summa Health Hospital in Barberton, Ohio.
""There was no place in this community where you could call and say, 'I need treatment.' It was a three to nine-day wait,"" he says.
In order to prevent people from relapsing, the hospital launched a pilot program last year inviting anyone suffering from opioid addiction to come to the emergency room. The project cost half a million dollars a year, which the hospital didn't have. The local chapter of United Way stepped in with donations.
""It was not the plan, that's for sure,"" says Jim Mullen, the CEO of Summit County United Way. His organization never involved itself with addiction issues before, he notes.
""But the reality was that there was this huge epidemic happening in our community,"" says Mullen. ""We couldn't ignore it.""
His group is now spending more than $800,000 a year on local opioid recovery projects. Much of the opioid response in Summit County is happening on a shoestring, using donations, volunteers, used equipment and revenue from local property taxes.
But it's just not enough, says Craig, because people are still dying. ""We're still in the midst of this crisis. We want to be proud of how the community has reacted to this but at the same time we just know that we have so much more to do.""
Craig says if money does come to Summit County from the lawsuit against Purdue Pharma and other drug companies, he has a wish list ready for new projects that could help people addicted to opioids rebuild their lives, including job training and long-term housing for people in recovery.
If trials now getting underway around the U.S. find the industry liable, payouts could escalate quickly into billions of dollars.

Evan Vucci/AP President Trump repeated a false claim to reporters Tuesday, wrongly blaming the Obama administration for instituting a policy in which children were separated from their parents at the Southern border.
""I'm the one that stopped it,"" Trump said. ""President Obama had child separation.""
Trump made the comments during a photo op prior to his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.
Asked whether the administration was considering reinstating the policy of child separation to curb the number of migrant families crossing the border from Mexico, Trump responded that ""We're not looking to do it.""
But he seemed to imply it was an effective means of stemming border crossings, and he compared families attempting to cross into the U.S. to visitors to an amusement park. ""I'll tell you something, once you don't have it that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like, 'Let's go to Disneyland.' President Obama separated children. They had child separation; I was the one that changed it,"" Trump said.
Politics An Acting Government For The Trump Administration Trump also denied that he is ""cleaning house"" at the Department of Homeland Security, in light of the departure of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles this week.

Medical Debt From In-Prison Injuries Is Chasing Inmates After Release,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727373494/medical-debt-from-in-prison-injuries-is-chasing-inmates-after-release?station=KXJZ_FM,"In Arizona, prisoners are being charged for medical procedures the state is supposed to pay for. The bills can ruin inmates' credit, adding to their challenges when they rejoin society.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Now to Arizona, where prison inmates are being charged for medical procedures that should be paid for by the state. And many don't know about the charges until debt collectors come calling. As Jimmy Jenkins of member station KJZZ reports, the unpaid bills are damaging credit and making it more difficult for former inmates to start over after they've been released.
JIMMY JENKINS, BYLINE: Ashley Wilkeyson and her friends were happy to be outside. It was a beautiful day for softball at the Perryville women's prison in Goodyear, Ariz. Wilkeyson had just taken her place as shortstop when she heard the crack of the bat.
ASHLEY WILKEYSON: It was a grounder. I went down to go get it, tossed it to second. And then...
JENKINS: She heard another loud crack.
WILKEYSON: I guess misfooting or something - I don't even know.
JENKINS: She had broken her ankle - snapped it almost entirely in half. The prison sent Wilkeyson to the hospital, where they took X-rays, reset her bones and scheduled her for surgery.
WILKEYSON: And then they sent me back to the prison.
JENKINS: And that's when the bills started coming.
WILKEYSON: I called my grandma one day, and she was like, I just want you to know that we received a bill for about $2,907. It was almost three grand.
JENKINS: Wilkeyson is one of more than a dozen current and former inmates who say they are being erroneously charged for medical treatment performed while they were incarcerated in an Arizona prison. Inmates aren't supposed to pay for their health care in Arizona. They pay $4 to be seen by the health care provider for their first visit, and all services after that are performed, contracted and paid for by Corizon Health.
RITA LOMIO: The state pays Corizon almost $200 million to provide these health care services.
JENKINS: Rita Lomio is an attorney with the Prison Law Office. She represents the health care concerns of men and women in Arizona prisons in a separate class-action settlement.
LOMIO: There's no one who's really helping them. There's no one who's taking care of it. And we want to try to do what we can, but it's not, you know, really squarely part of the case or part of any case.
JENKINS: Keith Jones is a representative for one of the Arizona hospitals that contracts with Corizon. He says the bills inmates are receiving are actually coming from individual doctors, not the hospital.
KEITH JONES: There's independent service providers, like emergency physicians, that have separate agreements with third-party health plans.
JENKINS: Corizon contracts with the hospital. The hospital contracts with doctors. And doctors contract with billing services. So it's difficult to find out where exactly the process is breaking down. After KJZZ inquired about Wilkeyson's bill, the hospital says it asked the service providers to review the way claims are handled.
Rita Lomio is worried the bills will have devastating consequences for her clients as they try to rebuild their lives.
LOMIO: Undeserved bad credit due to a state contractor's failure to pay its bills only makes it harder to find housing and gain full employment and to support a family.
JENKINS: Lomio says she has collected inmate medical bills totaling more than $50,000. She says despite sending multiple letters to Corizon attorneys, the Prison Law Office has had little success getting the bills resolved. A spokesperson for Corizon said when the company is notified of unpaid medical services, it resolves them immediately. But a year after her release from prison, Ashley Wilkeyson is still fighting bills she doesn't owe.
WILKEYSON: I feel like I'm just banging my head up against a brick wall at this point, you know, because I keep getting the runaround. Like, oh, you need to reach out to this person. Oh, you need to reach out to this person. And I've gotten nowhere.
JENKINS: And the collection notices keep coming. For NPR News, I'm Jimmy Jenkins in Phoenix.

"To Control Wildfires, Western Officials Are Urged To Follow South's Lead",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358726/to-control-wildfires-western-officials-are-urged-to-follow-souths-lead?station=KXJZ_FM,"The South is the nation's leader in setting small wildfires on purpose, to prevent massive ones like those out West. One big reason is that so much land in the South is privately owned, not public.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
In the American West, wildfires are growing bigger and more intense as the climate warms. There is a push to prevent them by setting smaller fires on purpose. As Grant Blankenship of Georgia Public Broadcasting explains, that's a technique the South has been using for years.
GRANT BLANKENSHIP, BYLINE: I'm standing in a grassy valley in the low mountains of west Georgia. Smoke is rising from the trees on the ridge, and a helicopter is raining fire from the sky.
(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTER WHIRRING)
BLANKENSHIP: It's dropping thousands of little incendiary devices. They look like pingpong balls. When they hit the ground, they ignite and spread more flame.
(SOUNDBITE OF FIRE CRACKLING)
BLANKENSHIP: Then at just the right moment, two firefighters on ATVs with flamethrowers set fire to the grass at the edge of the road, robbing the main blaze of fuel and stopping it dead.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Look, look.
BLANKENSHIP: This 900-acre fire stayed low to the ground, out of tree canopies, and after about 15 minutes, all that's really left to do is clean up just as Nathan Klaus promised when he briefed the fire crew earlier in the morning.
NATHAN KLAUS: This probably never - hopefully never going to go without fire again. And it certainly won't be at the risk that it was for a wildfire.
BLANKENSHIP: When he isn't the burn boss, Klaus is an ornithologist with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The DNR has been burning these woods for 17 years. Now there's no more duff or kindling for wildfire on the forest floor. That's the kind of stuff that contributes to the massive wildfires in the West. Plus the Bachman's Sparrow, a bird that's been missing here since the 1960s, it's been coming back.
KLAUS: We've got bobwhite quail. We're hoping for northern pine snake.
BLANKENSHIP: Every year, Georgia intentionally burns around a million acres of forest. That's close to 30 times the size of California's prescribed burns. That's according to data from the National Interagency Fire Center and compiled by the nonprofit Climate Central. So why does the South burn so much more of its forests? In part, that has to do with who owns the trees.
WALKER RIVERS: This is my 40th season of performing prescribed burns.
BLANKENSHIP: That's Walker Rivers. He's a consulting forester, a fire freelancer. He's showing me a plot he's been burning for its owner since 1995. It's tall pines, low grasses and blackberries. Those are for the turkeys.
RIVERS: They love blackberries.
BLANKENSHIP: Oh, turkeys do?
RIVERS: Oh, yes.
BLANKENSHIP: And the owners love hunting as much as they love selling pine trees. According to the Georgia Forestry Commission, 90% of the state's forests are privately owned. Trees are family wealth in the South. When a plot of pine trees matures about once a generation, a family will cut them and cash in. But the slow-growing knotty hardwoods crowd out the pines, so they get burnt out along the way. Rivers says out West where the federal government owns most of the land, there isn't the same profit motive to burn out the wildfire kindling. And there are other challenges, too.
RIVERS: They need to be doing prescribed burning. They need to be managing the fuel. But they don't do it. It's hands off. So you see the results of that.
BLANKENSHIP: In the Pacific Northwest, the results have been decades of wildfire fuel piling up largely unchecked in the region's forests. That's the major finding of a new study by Ryan Haugo of the Nature Conservancy and others. And Haugo says climate change will only make Western wildfires more destructive in the future.
RYAN HAUGO: Yes, that's definitely a concern of ours that with repeated or with large, extensive, high-severity fire, some areas that are forest now will no longer be forest in the future.
BLANKENSHIP: Haugo says grasses could take over where today ponderosa pines stand. To prevent that, he says, Western states need to find a way to make controlled burning as routine and common as it is in the South. For NPR News, I'm Grant Blankenship in Macon, Ga.

Hollywood's Best Hopes To Keep Moviegoers Engaged After 'Endgame',www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358733/hollywoods-best-hopes-to-keep-moviegoers-engaged-after-endgame?station=KXJZ_FM,"Hollywood's summer blockbuster season got a $2 billion head start this year from Avengers: Endgame . Now, with summer actually getting under way, how will Tinseltown keep the momentum going?
Movies NPR's Summer Movie Guide: 27 Films Coming Soon To Theaters MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
""Avengers: Endgame"" has given Hollywood's summer movie season a very healthy head start, but maybe you're looking for something different. Or maybe you just can't get enough of superheroes and their super-issues. Our critic Bob Mondello has this summer preview.
BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE: What's it been, six weeks since ""Endgame""? And already there's another Marvel movie. But in fairness, its teen superhero is angling for a vacation far from home...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME"")
HEMKY MADERA: (As Mr. Delmar) Planning a trip?
TOM HOLLAND: (As Peter Parker) Going to Europe.
MONDELLO: ...Until...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME"")
JON FAVREAU: (As Happy Hogan) Heads up - Nick Fury is calling you.
HOLLAND: (As Peter Parker) I don't really want to talk to Nick Fury.
FAVREAU: (As Happy Hogan) Answer the phone.
HOLLAND: (As Peter Parker) Why?
FAVREAU: (As Happy Hogan) Because if you don't talk to him, then I have to talk. I don't want to talk to him. You sent Nick Fury to voicemail.
HOLLAND: (As Peter Parker) I got to go.
FAVREAU: (As Happy Hogan) You do not ghost Nick Fury.
SAMUEL L JACKSON: (As Nick Fury) You're a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.
MONDELLO: ""Far From Home"" turns out to be not far enough when you have responsibilities. Marvel will also be unleashing a lot of X-Men to try to help a newbie X-person keep her emotions in check in ""Dark Phoenix.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""DARK PHOENIX"")
SOPHIE TURNER: (As Jean Grey) I'm scared. When I lose control, bad things happen to people I love.
MONDELLO: Actually it's not just people she loves. In ""Dark Phoenix,"" the whole world is at risk, which will also be true in ""The Dead Don't Die,"" an uncommonly corpse-filled movie from hip indie director Jim Jarmusch.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE DEAD DON'T DIE"")
BILL MURRAY: (As Cliff Robertson) So what are you thinking?
ADAM DRIVER: (As Ronnie Peterson) I'm thinking zombies.
MURRAY: (As Cliff Robertson) What?
DRIVER: (As Ronnie Peterson) You know, the undead.
MONDELLO: That's Adam Driver talking to Bill Murray. Elsewhere in the world-in-peril division, there will be an old franchise with a new cast...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""MEN IN BLACK: INTERNATIONAL"")
CHRIS HEMSWORTH: (As Agent H) We are the men in black...
MONDELLO: ...And a new twist on its usual formula.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""MEN IN BLACK: INTERNATIONAL"")
HEMSWORTH: (As Agent H) The men and women in black.
KUMAIL NANJIANI: (As Pawny) Yeah, perfectly done.
MONDELLO: They'll be battling otherworldly critters in ""Men In Black: International,"" whereas a lethal virus is the threat in a simple tale of a career law man and a loose cannon who work beautifully together...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""FAST & FURIOUS PRESENTS: HOBBS & SHAW"")
DWAYNE JOHNSON: (As Luke Hobbs) Pick a door.
JASON STATHAM: (As Deckard Shaw) One right there.
JOHNSON: (As Luke Hobbs) No. That's my door. Pick another door.
STATHAM: (As Deckard Shaw) What is wrong with you?
MONDELLO: ...""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""FAST & FURIOUS PRESENTS: HOBBS & SHAW"")
STATHAM: (As Deckard Shaw) You know what? You were right. This is your door.
JOHNSON: (As Luke Hobbs) What's the matter? You got a lot of bad guys behind that door?
MONDELLO: Yeah, that's pretty much it. And with a little less at stake, another action franchise comes knocking.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""SHAFT"")
JESSIE T USHER: (As John Shaft Jr.) Hi. I'm just - I'm looking for...
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Shaft.
JACKSON: (As John Shaft II) Who's asking?
USHER: (As John Shaft Jr.) John Shaft Jr., your son.
JACKSON: (As John Shaft II) My son - Junior?
MONDELLO: The ""Shaft"" reboot is a full-fledged family affair with the original, Richard Roundtree, on hand as grandpa. For a look back at the era of the original ""Shaft,"" there's Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"" in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays a TV star...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ONCE UPON A TIME ... IN HOLLYWOOD"")
LEONARDO DICAPRIO: (As Rick Dalton) Actors are required to do a lot of dangerous stuff.
MONDELLO: ...And Brad Pitt is his significantly less famous double.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ONCE UPON A TIME ... IN HOLLYWOOD"")
DICAPRIO: (As Rick Dalton) Cliff here is meant to help carry the load.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Is that how you describe your job, Cliff?
BRAD PITT: (As Cliff Booth) What, carrying his load? Yeah, that's about right.
MONDELLO: A comedy about TV of a more recent vintage called ""Late Night"" stars Emma Thompson as a popular-but-fading TV host...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LATE NIGHT"")
EMMA THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) That's our show, everyone.
MONDELLO: ...Who discovers she's got a problem.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LATE NIGHT"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) Do you think women are funny?
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) Funny is funny.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) As long as you're white, male and from an elite college like your writing staff.
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) We need to hire a woman.
DENIS O'HARE: (As Brad) Would a gay guy work?
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) No.
MONDELLO: Who they hire is Mindy Kaling, who just happens to have written this movie's script.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""LATE NIGHT"")
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) I need you to help me change this show.
MINDY KALING: (As Molly Patel) No more tantrums and no withering looks like that one.
THOMPSON: (As Katherine Newbury) That's my face.
MONDELLO: ""Late Night"" leads a parade of films that center on women this summer, including ""Where'd You Go, Bernadette"" based on the bestselling novel of that title and starring Cate Blanchett.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE"")
CATE BLANCHETT: (As Bernadette Fox) I have this one shot to launch my second act, so step aside 'cause I am about to kick the hell out of life.
MONDELLO: Awkwafina plays a woman in the drama ""The Farewell"" whose family is keeping a secret.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE FAREWELL"")
AWKWAFINA: (As Billi) What's wrong, Dad?
DIANA LIN: (As Jian) Your nan is dying.
TZI MA: (As Haiyan) She doesn't know, so you can't say anything. The family thinks it's better not to tell her.
AWKWAFINA: (As Billi) Why is that better?
MONDELLO: There's also a feminist take on ""Hamlet"" called ""Ophelia"" and told from her point of view.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""OPHELIA"")
DAISY RIDLEY: (As Ophelia) Hamlet, we can escape now. Come.
CLIVE OWEN: (As Claudius) I think Ophelia is dangerous.
MONDELLO: Elsewhere a woman journeys from Scotland to Nashville to become a country singer in ""Wild Rose."" ""The Kitchen"" features Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish as mob wives who take over when their gangster husbands go to prison. An all-female nautical team circles the globe in the documentary ""Maiden,"" and the author Toni Morrison waxes irreverent in another documentary, ""The Pieces I Am.""
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""TONI MORRISON: THE PIECES I AM"")
TONI MORRISON: A friend of mine called me up early in the morning and said, Toni, you won the Nobel Prize. And I remember holding phone thinking she must be drunk.
MONDELLO: While we're talking documentaries, let's mention a couple about musicians, another theme of the summer. There's ""David Crosby: Remember My Name"" about the 77-year-old rock star's often-challenging journey through life and Ron Howard's affectionate operatic portrait ""Pavarotti.""
(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, ""PAVAROTTI"")
LUCIANO PAVAROTTI: I learned to love people.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You're a trusting person.
PAVAROTTI: Are you joking? I will not exist if I don't trust people.
MONDELLO: There's also a musical biopic that got a four-minute standing ovation last week at the Cannes Film Fest.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ROCKETMAN"")
TARON EGERTON: (As Elton John) So how does a fat boy from nowhere get to be a soul man?
MONDELLO: It's called ""Rocketman.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""ROCKETMAN"")
EGERTON: (As Elton John) I'm thinking of changing my name to Elton.
EVAN WALSH: (As Elton Dean) That's my name.
EGERTON: (As Elton John) Yeah, I know.
MONDELLO: Taron Egerton did his own singing as Elton John, and the director is the guy who got called in at the last minute to rescue ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" a film to which ""Rocketman"" would very much like to be compared. Two other films take a sideways look at famous musicians. ""Blinded By The Light"" is the true story of a kid who grew up in Maggie Thatcher's England obsessing over a singer who was not popular with his friends or with his Muslim Pakistani family.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""BLINDED BY THE LIGHT"")
VIVEIK KALRA: (As Javed) Who's that?
AARON PHAGURA: (As Roops) The boss.
KALRA: (As Javed) Whose boss?
PHAGURA: (As Roops) Springsteen - he's more what your dad listens to.
KALRA: (As Javed) Not my dad.
MONDELLO: And the most eccentric musician movie this summer is ""Yesterday"" about a band that suddenly disappears from the memory of everyone in the world except one guy who's been doing cover versions of their songs for years.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""YESTERDAY"")
HIMESH PATEL: (As Jack Malik, singing) Yesterday...
LILY JAMES: (As Ellie Appleton) When did you write that?
PATEL: (As Jack Malik) I didn't write it. Paul McCartney wrote it - the Beatles.
JAMES: (As Ellie Appleton) Who?
MONDELLO: No one except Jack has ever heard of the Fab Four.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""YESTERDAY"")
PATEL: (As Jack Malik) John, Paul, George and Ringo, the Beatles.
MONDELLO: Not a glimmer.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""YESTERDAY"")
PATEL: (As Jack Malik) Do you genuinely not know who the Beatles are?
JAMES: (As Ellie Appleton) Genuinely.
PATEL: (As Jack Malik) Then I'm in a really, really, really complicated situation.
MONDELLO: Also a situation where he could get really, really, really rich releasing their songs. Other comedies include the social satire ""The Last Black Man In San Francisco"" about gentrification and reclaiming your heritage; a wonderfully shaggy, entirely improvised goof involving civil war memorabilia called ""Sword Of Trust"" and ""Stuber"" about an extremely mild-mannered guy named Stu who drives for Uber. He's played by Kumail Nanjiani. And one night...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""STUBER"")
DAVE BAUTISTA: (As Vic) Compton.
MONDELLO: ...He picks up Dave Bautista.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""STUBER"")
BAUTISTA: (As Vic) I'm LAPD. Let's go.
NANJIANI: (As Stu) Well, do you have a more specific address?
BAUTISTA: (As Vic) Compton.
NANJIANI: (As Stu) Stop yelling neighborhoods. That's not how Uber works.
MONDELLO: Also mild-mannered - Jesse Eisenberg determined to become bolder in ""The Art Of Self-Defense"" by enrolling in a very weird karate class.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE ART OF SELF-DEFENSE"")
ALESSANDRO NIVOLA: (As Sensei) Today's lesson - to kick with your fists and punch with your feet.
JESSE EISENBERG: (As Casey) That makes perfect sense.
MONDELLO: The opposite of mild-mannered are the kids in ""Good Boys,"" an R-rated comedy that's sort of an elementary school ""Superbad.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""GOOD BOYS"")
BRADY NOON: (As Thor) Two weeks into sixth grade, and I'm already a social piranha.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters, chanting) Sippy cup, sippy cup.
NOON: (As Thor) Does this look like a sippy cup? No, it's a [expletive] juice box 'cause I'm not a [expletive] child.
MONDELLO: ""Good Boys"" is clearly not suitable for children. But there are plenty of films that are, many of them with Roman numerals after their titles - ""Angry Birds 2"" (ph), ""Secret Life Of Pets 2,"" ""Toy Story 4""...
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""TOY STORY 4"")
TOM HANKS: (As Woody) Bonnie made a friend in class.
(CROSSTALK)
BONNIE HUNT: (As Dolly) Oh, she's already making friends.
HANKS: (As Woody) No, no, she literally made a new friend. I want you to meet Forky.
TONY HALE: (As Forky) Hi.
TIMOTHY DALTON: (As Mr. Pricklepants) He's a spork.
MONDELLO: ...And the digital live-action remake that's been wetting appetites since the vocal cast was first announced.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE LION KING"")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Nants ingonyama...
MONDELLO: ...""The Lion King"" with Donald Glover as Simba, Beyonce as Nala and, as Mufasa, bringing us full circle in the circle of life, the familiar rumble of James Earl Jones.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""THE LION KING"")
JAMES EARL JONES: (As Mufasa) Remember.
MONDELLO: A summer where everything you see exists together in a delicate balance. I'm Bob Mondello.

"Bill Buckner, Red Sox Scapegoat Later Embraced By Fans, Dies",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358719/bill-buckner-red-sox-scapegoat-later-embraced-by-fans-dies?station=KXJZ_FM,"Former Boston Red Sox first-baseman Bill Buckner has died at 69. Best known for a fielding error that helped cost Boston the 1986 World Series, Buckner was cheered by Red Sox fans in recent years.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Being remembered for a mistake is hard. Being the living symbol of 86 years of futility is just about impossible. That is what Bill Buckner was to Boston Red Sox fans for two decades.
Buckner died today at the age of 69. He was an All-Star player, won the National League batting title in 1980. He had a very good 22-season career, might have been remembered as a great career, if not for one moment. 1986 - the World Series between the Red Sox and the New York Mets.
Late in Game 6, the Red Sox had a two-run lead. They were one strike away from winning their first world championship since 1918. But the Mets tied the game in the 10th inning with a runner on second base. A hit would give them the win and force a Game 7. Turns out all it actually took was the most famous error in baseball history.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
VIN SCULLY: Little roller up along first, behind the bag. It gets through Buckner. Here comes Knight. And the Mets win it.
KELLY: That little roller went right though Bill Buckner's legs. The Mets won, and then they went on to win the World Series the next night. Buckner's error turned the first baseman into a scapegoat. ""Buckner Boots Big Grounder"" was the next day's headline in the Boston Herald. Fans piled on. The media piled on. One reporter allegedly called Buckner's wife to ask if Buckner was contemplating suicide. And Buckner received death threats.
The public scorn was so intense that after he retired, he moved his family to Idaho. Few people there cared who Buckner was or what role he'd played in the 1986 World Series. It wasn't until 2004 that Buckner and Boston were on their way to making peace.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOE BUCK: Back to Foulke. Red Sox fans have longed to hear it. The Boston Red Sox are world champions.
KELLY: It started with the Red Sox finally winning their first World Series in 86 years' time. And, of course, sweet victory heal all wounds. Still, it took another four years for Buckner to come home to Fenway Park.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Won't you please welcome him back to Boston and let him know that he is welcome always? No. 6, Bill Buckner.
(CHEERING)
KELLY: Fans there giving Buckner a two-minute ovation. Later, when he was asked if he'd had second thoughts about returning to Fenway, Bill Buckner struggled to hold back tears.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BILL BUCKNER: I really had to forgive the - not the fans of Boston, just per se, but I would say - I would have to say, in my heart, I had to forgive the media, you know, for what, you know, they put me and my family through. So you know, I've done that. I'm over that.
KELLY: In the next day's Boston Herald, the headline was, ""All Is Forgiven.""
Bill Buckner died today, surrounded by family, after a long battle with dementia. He was 69 years old.

"France Won't Take ISIS Fighters Back, But Doesn't Want Them Executed Either",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358705/france-wont-take-its-isis-fighters-back-but-it-doesnt-want-them-executed-either?station=KXJZ_FM,"France doesn't want to bring back French ISIS members captured in Iraq, but French authorities are dismayed that an Iraqi court has sentenced four of them to death.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
In Iraq, a court has sentenced four French members of ISIS to death. They're among a dozen French citizens who were captured and handed over to Iraqi authorities to be tried. And they illustrate what happens when a country - in this case, France - decides not to try their citizens at home. NPR's Jane Arraf has been following the trial. She joins us from Irbil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq in the north of Iraq. Hi, Jane.
JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.
KELLY: So tell us more about who these ISIS fighters are.
ARRAF: So a lot of these are dual nationals, some from North Africa. The ones that have been sentenced to death Sunday and Monday, they include a postal worker, a truck driver, a military contractor. And they're all appearing in Baghdad's counterterrorism court. So these prisoners come in, and they're dressed in yellow shirts and trousers. There are rows of seats with French consular officials as well as journalists watching. And they're brought in, and they stand in this wooden dock kind of like a cage.
So one of the men was brought in. He's an Algerian French citizen, 33 years old. And he told the judge he was actually tortured in detention. So the judge postponed his case for a medical investigation. Another one came in. He actually started to cry. I mean, very often, they don't react at all, but this man started to cry. And the judge asked him to lift up his shirt to see if he'd been tortured. He appeared not to have been, according to the judge, and they proceeded with it. And he was sentenced to hang.
A lot of these people are saying that they didn't fight for ISIS, but Iraq says it has evidence that they did. And even if they didn't fight, its terrorism laws are so sweeping that even being convicted of being a member of ISIS can land you with the death penalty.
KELLY: And why does France not want to try these? You mentioned some of them are dual nationals, but they're French citizens. Why don't they want to try them in France?
ARRAF: Well, part of it is France was the country where most of the Western Europeans who went to fight for ISIS came from. And France, like other countries, is worried that if they bring them back, they won't have the evidence to convict them there. It's a much higher bar there, particularly since the crimes were committed in this region. Also there's a lot of public opposition to bringing them back.
KELLY: And opposition, I guess, to if they're not able to convict based on evidence in Western Europe, then these people might just be let go and released back onto the streets.
ARRAF: Absolutely. But here's the big problem. They've been sentenced to death. And France, along with almost every other European country, bans the death penalty. At the same time, it did not oppose them being brought to Iraq from Syria where they were captured knowing that they could well be sentenced to the death penalty.
KELLY: So what has been the reaction in France to these sentences?
ARRAF: So France is basically saying that ISIS members need to be held accountable for their crimes where they committed the crimes, in this case partly Iraq. And it said they were making sure that they had the assistance of defense lawyers. And there is an automatic appeal for this. It normally doesn't result in overturning the conviction, but France has said that it is noting to Iraqi authorities that it opposes the death penalty. Now, that's not expected to carry a lot of weight. But there you go.
KELLY: You mentioned that some of these people were transferred over from custody in Syria. What happens to - there's something like 1,200 foreigners still in custody in Syria. What happens to them?
ARRAF: So that is a really big question because these are people from more than 30 different countries. And the Kurdish Syrian forces there can't really handle them. They don't have the capacity. Also it's a region that's not really recognized by anyone. They have all these people because that's where ISIS made its last stand in Syria. That's where they were defeated. The Kurds there are saying they need an international tribunal. They need other countries to step up and put these people on trial, put their own citizens on trial but preferably somewhere here in the region.
KELLY: And transferring more to Iraq, is that another option?
ARRAF: That is a possible option. And Iraq is seemingly willing to put some of these people on trial if, of course, it's compensated for the cost of doing so. But there, again, as we saw today in the trial, there is the risk of torture. There is the fact that these trials aren't considered being run to international human rights standards or Western legal standards. But ISIS and what's left of ISIS and the trials are this huge, lingering problem that everyone is still trying to grapple with.
KELLY: NPR's Jane Arraf in Irbil that's in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, thanks very much.
ARRAF: Thank you.

Analysis: Voters Choose A New Direction For Europe's Future,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358698/analysis-voters-choose-a-new-direction-for-europes-future?station=KXJZ_FM,"Roger Cohen, columnist for The New York Times , analyzes the European Union vote for NPR's Mary Louise Kelly, including the high turnout and the success of the EU's green parties.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Roger Cohen is here to help us understand a little bit more about what these election results mean. He is a columnist for The New York Times. He joins us now from Paris.
Roger Cohen, welcome.
ROGER COHEN: Thank you, Mary Louise.
KELLY: So the story going into the elections here was that they would reflect the rise of the far-right, the rise of the populist parties in Europe. And those parties did make gains, but they didn't win as big as a lot of people were expecting. What do you think happened?
COHEN: Well, there were significant gains for the populist far-right, particularly in Italy, where Matteo Salvini got 34% of the vote compared to about 6% five years ago - and also in Britain, where Nigel Farage, with his Brexit Party, also got over 30%. But I think in the end, there was also a reaction to the current situation from the Greens, who did very well. And the liberal democratic parties managed to maintain a majority.
It was never thought that the far-right parties would gain a majority in the Parliament. It was thought that they would make headway, and they did - just not quite as dramatic. Still, you get somebody like Viktor Orban in Hungary getting 54% there. So I would say it's still significant. And what's very significant is the collapse of a lot of the mainstream parties.
Here in France, you have the complete collapse of the Socialist Party. You have the complete collapse of the moderate right. In Britain, you have the collapse of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. So there are new forces emerging in Europe, and that's not going to change.
KELLY: Well, let me tease out a couple of things you touched on there. Number one, Green parties did very well. What does that tell us about the state of Europe?
COHEN: Well, it tells us that despite the nationalist surge, there are a lot of people - young people, in particular - who are deeply concerned about climate change and who understand that this issue, like, I would say, most issues in the world today, cannot really be tackled at a national level. They require a transnational response. They require a European response. And so in this European election, they mobilized.
KELLY: Is there a generational thing going on here, too? Younger voters tend to skew...
COHEN: Definitely, definitely.
KELLY: ...Toward the Green parties.
COHEN: These are younger voters. Look, there's a great deal of weariness, even disgust, with politics as usual. We've been seeing that since 2008. It's given birth to the populist, rightist surge that we all know about and that we've observed, also, in the United States.
But that's not the only form it takes. It's also taken the form of this sudden rise of the Greens. There are various splinter parties also on the left. And if I was to name one overwhelming characteristic of this election, it's that the parties that we've gotten used to having govern Europe are fading away.
KELLY: So big picture - if you look at these election results and you're trying to figure out where Europe is headed, what message did voters deliver?
COHEN: Well, it was not a bad day for Europe. The European Union is not about to disappear. It's not about to be taken over by far-right, anti-European populist parties. That said, there's immense dissatisfaction across Europe with the way politics have been conducted over the last five to 10 years, certainly since the economic meltdown of 2008. And that is expressed in the virtual demise of parties that have been at the center of European politics for decades, like the Socialist Party in France, like the two main parties - centrist parties in Italy.
And you're seeing a lot of dissatisfaction expressed but not a demand for the complete breakup of the European project. On the contrary, people voted in far greater numbers in these elections for a long time. What does that mean? That means they're engaged in the European idea.
KELLY: Roger Cohen, thanks so much.
COHEN: Thank you very much indeed.
KELLY: He's a columnist for The New York Times, speaking to us there from Paris about this past weekend's European elections.

"Far-Right, Green Parties Break 40-Year Centrist Majority In EU Parliament",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358691/far-right-green-parties-break-40-year-centrist-majority-in-eu-parliament?station=KXJZ_FM,"Far-right wins in Sunday's EU parliament elections produced more of a strong ripple than a wave, but the centrist coalition that has governed for 40 years did lose its majority.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
The elections for the EU Parliament are over. The results are in, and the dust is settling. There was not a massive far-right populist wave as many had predicted, though populist wins did cause - call it a strong ripple. And the coalition of mainstream centrist parties lost the majority after dominating the European Union for the last 40 years. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley is in Paris, and she begins our coverage.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: In France, the European Parliament election was also about President Emmanuel Macron. The fervently pro-EU leader invested hugely and personally in the campaign. So when Marine Le Pen's National Rally narrowly beat Macron's party, she used her victory speech to press for change at home.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French).
BEARDSLEY: Le Pen demanded that Macron dissolve the French National Assembly to reflect the new reality. The elections for the EU Parliament had implications for domestic politics in many countries. In Britain, where the Brexit Party added 24 seats while the mainstream Tories and Labour were pummeled, Nigel Farage called the vote a mandate for a hard Brexit now.
Turnout was more than 50% across the EU, the biggest in 25 years. At this polling station in Paris, 30-year-old physiotherapist Jean Baptiste Perche (ph) said he felt a sense of duty.
JEAN BAPTISTE PERCHE: You can't judge what's going on in Europe if you don't vote, so I think it's important.
BEARDSLEY: Green parties made huge gains, and environmentalists are now the third largest bloc in the Parliament.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian).
BEARDSLEY: As expected, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's right-wing League came in first place in Italy. The populist darling aims to bring Europe's far-right together.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SALVINI: (Speaking Italian).
BEARDSLEY: ""The vote shows the rules must change,"" he said. ""A new Europe is born, one that is tired of the elites being in power and of finance and multinationals."" But European Union expert Douglas Webber doesn't believe the disparate Euroskeptic parties will be able to come together to make big change. He says they don't agree about relations with Russia, free markets or even about migration.
DOUGLAS WEBBER: For example, Italy would like other member states to take more of the refugees that are currently in Italy. But governments, such as that of Mr. Orban in Hungary, of course, are opposed to this.
BEARDSLEY: Webber says the new parliament, now more fragmented, will have to build new coalitions and alliances to govern. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris.

Need A Child Care Subsidy? This Mom Would Tell You Not To Hold Your Breath,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358684/need-a-child-care-subsidy-this-mom-would-tell-you-not-to-hold-your-breath?station=KXJZ_FM,"Nationwide, the demand for subsidized child care exceeds the supply: Only 1 in 6 eligible kids actually get subsidies. In Sacramento, mom Jacquelyne Gettone has been on the waiting list for a decade.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
To another story now, finding quality, affordable child care, which can be tough, especially for families living paycheck-to-paycheck. Every state in the country follows - every state in the country offers federally subsidized child care, which is meant to offset some of the costs. But only about 1 in 6 kids who qualify for the care actually receive it. From member station KQED, Katie Orr reports on what daily life is like for one mom on the waitlist for subsidized child care.
KATIE ORR, BYLINE: It's 5:30 in the morning, and like every weekday, Jacquelyne Gettone is up preparing for the day. She quickly irons the blazer she'll wear to work and the shirt her 2-year-old son, Matthew, will wear to day care. Before too long, she hears Matthew crying in the bedroom, and she goes to scoop him out of bed.
JACQUELYNE GETTONE: Good morning, Matty (ph).
MATTHEW GETTONE: (Crying).
GETTONE: Come on, Papa.
ORR: The toddler is still sleepy and a bit fussy. But there's little time to ease him into the day. They need to be out the front door by 6. She takes Matthew to a day care she can afford about 30 minutes away. She works in downtown Oakland, another 40 minutes away from there. Without a car, they face a complex commute involving a combination of Uber rides and commuter train trips that can take anywhere from 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
GETTONE: In between waiting on Ubers, depending on if an Uber is three minutes away or 20 minutes away, it's, like, a gamble.
ORR: After a short ride to the station, Gettone hurries to catch her train. Little Matthew has chosen this very moment to have a meltdown, as 2-year-olds do.
MATTHEW: (Crying).
GETTONE: I feel like that too, sometimes.
ORR: So Gettone picks him up while I grab the toddler-sized car seat she carries with her each day. She sprints down the stairs to the train and just barely makes it. As she and Matthew settle in, I have to wonder, how does she do this each day on her own?
But while she's alone in handling her daily commute, Gettone is not alone in waiting for a subsidy that would help her afford child care. Katie Hamm, with the Center for American Progress, says in most of the country, it costs about $10,000 a year to enroll a child in a day care center. And she says a lot of people just can't afford that without subsidies.
KATIE HAMM: So in nearly every state there is either a long waiting list or there are just a lot of families turned away, and the state doesn't even bother keeping a waiting list.
ORR: For Gettone, a subsidy could help her save money for other things, like a car. But it's unlikely she'll receive one. Matthew's been on the waiting list for over a year. Her 12-year-old daughter, Margeaux, has been waiting since she was a baby and never got off the waitlist. Hamm says that's also a common occurrence. One reason for that, there simply aren't enough child care providers.
HAMM: There's not a lot of profit to be made in child care. So to operate a child care, to have highly qualified teachers and a curriculum and materials, is an expensive proposition.
ORR: In fact, Hamm says, about half of Americans live in child care deserts, where the need for care far outweighs the supply of licensed care providers. But while the picture looks bleak, there may be some reason for hope. Child care is still a rare bipartisan issue in Congress. As part of a two-year federal spending agreement in 2018, lawmakers allocated about $5 billion to support state-subsidized child care, the largest ever increase. This year, Congress is proposing an additional 2.4 billion. For NPR News, I'm Katie Orr in Sacramento.

Veteran Tennis Stars Still Prove Le Creme De La Creme In Paris,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358677/veteran-tennis-stars-still-prove-le-creme-de-la-creme-in-paris?station=KXJZ_FM,"It's day two of the French Open. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks to Sports Illustrated executive editor Jon Wertheim about what to expect from tennis' aging greats and up-and-comers.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
How much longer will the aging greats of tennis remain the best in the game? Or, put another way, when might we see a new generation of tennis greats take over from the likes of Serena Williams and Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal? Well, if the past couple of days on the clay courts of Paris are any indication, they are not yielding the mantle just yet.
It is Day 2 of the French Open. Here to talk predictions and catch us up on the latest in the world of tennis is Jon Wertheim. He's in Paris for Sports Illustrated. Jon Wertheim, welcome.
JON WERTHEIM: Thank you. Good to be here.
KELLY: Good to have you with us. Start with today's big match, Serena Williams, who was looking a little rocky at the start. And then what happened?
WERTHEIM: She lost the first set. And then, as if it were no more difficult than this, flicking a switch, she then lost only one more game the rest of the afternoon. And you said it. The pillars are not yielding lightly. She is 37 years old. She is a mother. And she is into Round 2 and really has as good a chance of anyone in the women's field of winning this.
KELLY: Who else are you watching in the women's field?
WERTHEIM: It's a great question. I mean, the men's have these two players that are head and shoulders above the field. They're sort of, you know - I said the other day they were - they were first class, and everyone else was business or coach.
KELLY: (Laughter).
WERTHEIM: The women's is a lot of business class.
KELLY: OK.
WERTHEIM: The defending champ in Simona Halep, but she has not won a title this year. Already two top players have been eliminated. Naomi Osaka is the No. 1 seed. She's going for her third straight major. But she's never won a tournament of any size on clay. So you go down the list, and I sort of like the one that's won 23 majors, even if she is 37 years old. I wouldn't be surprised if Serena stole this.
KELLY: All right, and back over on the men's side, you were talking about the first class of Nadal and Federer. I mean, is it - does it make any sense to anyone anywhere to bet against Nadal on clay?
WERTHEIM: That's a great question. He's only won this event 11 times prior.
KELLY: Yeah, only 11.
WERTHEIM: It's - it's absurd. I mean, he's going for his 12th title. That's more than any player has won any major. The No. 1 player right now is Novak Djokovic. But really, I don't know how you bet against Nadal. And as wide open as the women's field is, it would really be, I'd say, a considerable upset if Nadal and Djokovic don't play in the final a week from Sunday. I mean, they're really - given Nadal's clay record and given that Djokovic has won three straight majors, they're really the overwhelming favorites.
KELLY: So what do you make of this whole changing of the guards question, with all these greats, the first-class players here, all well into their 30s?
WERTHEIM: I was going to say, the guards do not change in this sport. I love it. I mean, I think the why is really interesting. Is it financial incentives? Is it technology? Is it that these players now have the means to travel with trainers and therapists? But it's terrific. I mean, these careers are extending longer than ever. Roger Federer first played this event in 1999. I mean, Serena won her first major in 1999.
KELLY: Is that right - 1999? - 20 years ago. Wow.
WERTHEIM: She got a congratulations from Bill Clinton.
KELLY: Yeah.
WERTHEIM: And I think it allows fans to have these longer bonds. Sponsors love it. I think everybody wins here. But it's remarkable. And you asked initially - and I think it's a really good question - where is the next generation? And the truth is, this generation we're quite familiar with has no intention of retreating.
KELLY: You're calling it terrific. Is it also, for somebody in your line of work, just the tiniest bit boring (laughter)...
WERTHEIM: (Laughter).
KELLY: ...That you could - you could almost pre-write the lead?
WERTHEIM: I will take sustained excellence, as I'm sure my colleagues that cover golf will say about Tiger Woods. Give me sustained excellence over unpredictability. No, I mean, I think it's a good question. And it would be nice if occasionally, especially on the men's side, we saw a little fresh blood. But I think what we're seeing are - with Djokovic, Nadal, Federer and Serena - these are four of the great, great titans of tennis.
I mean, these - in Federer and Serena right now - are probably the two best players ever. And the fact that all four of them are coexisting, and you have - especially on the men's side, you have these individual rivalries...
KELLY: Right.
WERTHEIM: ...And these matches. But really, three guys playing for history is sort of a subtext of all these tournaments. Give me four titans over any given Sunday parity any day of the week.
KELLY: Jon Wertheim, good luck with your hardship assignment there in Paris.
WERTHEIM: (Laughter) That I'll take.
KELLY: Jon Wertheim of Sports Illustrated, talking to us about the French Open, which is on until June 9.

"Thai Dissidents Disappear Or Turn Up Dead, Even After Escaping Nation",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358670/thai-dissidents-disappear-or-turn-up-dead-even-after-escaping-nation?station=KXJZ_FM,"Thailand's ruling junta has enacted harsh laws aimed at punishing those who ""defame"" the country's monarchy. That's led many dissidents to flee the country, but that hasn't guaranteed their safety.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Thailand's new king was formally crowned this month, and the ruling military junta has put a priority on protecting his image. It is jailing citizens who defame, insult or threaten the monarchy. As Michael Sullivan reports from Bangkok, Thai dissidents may not find safety even when they flee the country.
MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Sixty-four-year-old Tanya Tirawut’s son Siam fled to Laos shortly after the coup after running afoul of the military. But the two stayed in touch via social media until a few months ago when he went quiet. Two weeks ago, she heard from activists that he and two other dissidents had been forcibly returned to Thailand after trying to enter Vietnam on false passports. She hasn't heard anything since but fears the worst.
TANYA TIRAWUT: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: ""Yes,"" she says, ""I think all three of them are dead."" They wouldn't be the first. Two years ago, at least two Thai dissidents were forcibly disappeared while living in Laos and then there was this grisly discovery just a few months back.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: In January, Thai television showed pictures of the bodies of two antimonarchists on the Thai side of the Mekong River. They'd disappeared in the Lao capital a month earlier, along with another prominent activist. The dead men's hands and feet were bound with rope. They'd been disemboweled and stuffed with concrete.
SUNAI PHASUK: Thai authorities and Lao authority in the beginning totally deny knowledge of their disappearances. It took a long time for them to confirm that those were the bodies of missing activists.
SULLIVAN: And even after they did, says Sunai Phasuk, senior Thai researcher at Human Rights Watch, the authorities offered no assurances of a proper investigation, which surprised him not at all.
PHASUK: Human Rights Watch has seen paper evidence, even official requests from Thai goverment to the Lao government of names that the Thai want the Lao's authority to help arresting and handing them over. And these names include those who have gone missing, those who have been murdered.
SULLIVAN: Despite this, Thai authorities deny having any role in the disappearances of any Thai activists, including the three allegedly returned to Thailand from Vietnam earlier this month.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Thai).
PRAWIT WONGSUWAN: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: Deputy prime minister and former general Prawit Wongsuwan says the government has no idea what's become of the three. The Vietnamese government isn't talking either - not surprising given that a Vietnamese blogger who applied for refugee status at the U.N. in Bangkok disappeared right after filing his application in January. He turned up a few days later in jail in Hanoi. Human Rights Watch researcher Sunai Phasuk says there seems to be a quid pro quo among Southeast Asian governments these days to help each other hunt down asylum-seekers.
PHASUK: Enforced disappearances of dissidents and critics of governments in fact routine in Vietnam and Thailand, but now it has reached a new level of danger for activists.
SULLIVAN: Activists like Nithiwat Wannasiri of the folk group Fai Yen currently in hiding with two other band members who also fled after the coup and have written songs critical of both the military and the monarchy.
NITHIWAT WANNASIRI: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: Nithiwat says he's sure they'll be targeted next. ""We're on their list,"" he says. ""We just have to stay alert and try to be ready if they come."" Sixty-four-year-old Tanya Tirawut is pretty sure they already came for her son, Siam. All she wants is closure.
TIRAWUT: (Speaking Thai).
SULLIVAN: ""I can't get any answer,"" she says. ""If someone took your son, how would you feel? Is he dead or not? Just give me an answer,"" she says. ""I need an answer."" For NPR News, I'm Michael Sullivan in Bangkok.

It's part of extensive flooding in the Missouri River basin.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Let's go next to Muskogee. That's another of the many Oklahoma towns where, as we just heard, flooding has driven people from their homes. Muskogee is also where the USS Batfish usually sits on dry land. The Batfish is a submarine, a World War II-era submarine. And rising waters at the Muskogee War Memorial Park are testing whether it is still watertight. The park's executive director Brent Trout is keeping tabs on the Batfish. He joins me now. Brent Trout, welcome.
BRENT TROUT: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.
KELLY: So what's going on today? What's the latest situation around the Batfish?
TROUT: We're playing the waiting game. We had a submarine try to break loose on us in Muskogee, and it's a completely unique problem. When you talk to the state emergency management officials, they don't know how to handle a World War II submarine.
KELLY: So let's paint a picture for people listening, trying to imagine what you are able to see. Usually, the Batfish, which is how many feet long?
TROUT: Three hundred eleven feet long.
KELLY: Normally, it sits in the middle of a big kind of lawn - meadow. Is that right?
TROUT: Yeah, we have it actually sat in the middle of what we call a berm. It's kind of a bowl that we anticipate if there is any minor flooding that the bowl will keep it isolated in the area.
KELLY: How many feet of water where the Batfish is right now?
TROUT: It's probably about 15 to 18 feet.
KELLY: Wow. I guess the submarine floats. It's still watertight.
TROUT: Well, you know, we were wondering about that because, you know, it was built in America - built to last. So would it still be floating after all these years? And the answer is, yes, it is floating. Half of it is floating. So we had to strategically float some aspects of it and bury some aspects of it. The goal was to get the rudder to dig into the ground almost as an additional anchor point, which is something that, you know, for a bunch of museum professionals, you'd never anticipate having to do.
KELLY: Now, I gather there is some concern if the Batfish were to break free of the lines you're trying to secure it with and - what? - float on down the river, what would - what are you preparing for here?
TROUT: Well, that was a huge concern on Thursday and Friday. So some of the lines started snapping, and we were actually on-site when the lines started snapping, and it was probably one of the scariest things I've seen in my life. So it was in danger of floating down the river, which the main concern would be that it would float down and hit a dam. And if it would have hit the dam - see, Muskogee already had a problem with loose barges. Had they actually breached a dam, it would have wiped out communities completely instead of just giving communities time to evacuate.
KELLY: How did a submarine end up in landlocked Oklahoma, by the way?
TROUT: Well, you know, it's a long - it could be its own series on NPR, but basically...
KELLY: (Laughter) Give us the short version of the story.
TROUT: The World War II submarine veterans that survived - most people don't know this, but submarine service was the deadliest service to be in during World War II. So these guys wanted to honor all their lost friends. And ironically, they had to use spring floods to actually put it in place, and we're going to have to use spring floods or early summer floods to put it back in place, so full circle, you know?
KELLY: Yeah. So I'm talking to you, of course, on Memorial Day. You had a whole ceremony planned at the memorial park. What did you all have planned?
TROUT: Well, another thing that we have on the ground is a piece of the USS Oklahoma, one of the battleships that sunk at Pearl Harbor. And we were actually going to do what we call a tolling for all the people who perished on board the USS Oklahoma. So it's over 400 people. It's a beautiful ceremony. And that's the painful thing is that everybody's off today, but we don't feel complete because we're not doing what we want to do. We're not honoring the people that have given their lives for this country. And it's kind of - I don't know. I don't know how to take it. It's weird.
KELLY: Well, Brent Trout, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. And we wish you luck in the coming days as you watch what happens with the water there.
TROUT: Yeah. I appreciate it. Thanks for having me on. And just, you know, pray for us up in Muskogee, and keep an eye on us. And I always have to mention we're going to rebuild, and we'll be better than ever. I promise.
KELLY: Brent Trout - he is executive director of the Muskogee War Memorial Park in Muskogee, Okla.

Disasters Pile Up As Storms Continue Plowing Through Oklahoma,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358656/disasters-pile-up-as-storms-continue-plowing-through-oklahoma?station=KXJZ_FM,"Severe weather has walloped Oklahoma this month. First major flooding hit much of the state, then a tornado shredded a small town, killing two people. More floods are forecast for later this week.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Oklahoma has been walloped by severe weather this past week. First there was major flooding in many parts of the state. Then this past weekend, a brief but powerful tornado slammed a small town west of Oklahoma City. Two people were killed. Meanwhile the forecast this week is calling for more rain, which, in turn, would lead to more flooding. We're joined now by Rachel Hubbard. She's been covering this from member station KOSU. Hi, Rachel.
RACHEL HUBBARD, BYLINE: Hi.
KELLY: Hi. So start with the tornado this weekend. What exactly happened?
HUBBARD: Well, there was a line of thunderstorms that was moving across Oklahoma. And most people were aware of it. But it spun up this brief tornado called a QLCS tornado. These are the specific kinds of tornadoes that happen in these lines of thunderstorms. And they're known for being brief and weak. But they're also known for coming with very little warning.
And this came at night. It only stayed on the ground for just four minutes. It was only 75 yards wide. But it hit right at this point - if you look on either one side or the other side of this 75-yard section, there's a car lot and a boat lot. It hit a motel and a trailer park. So two people died, and it was terrible.
KELLY: And do you know what the situation is today in El Reno, how they're doing?
HUBBARD: Well, they had already activated their severe weather plan. And this town is well-practiced because it was hit just six years ago by the largest tornado on record. They were already dealing with flooding that had happened earlier in the week. The governor of Oklahoma visited today. And President Donald Trump did call Governor Kevin Stitt while he was out and about saying that the nation's prayers were with Oklahoma.
KELLY: And I imagine everybody who was in this trailer park has had to find somewhere else to stay for the meantime.
HUBBARD: They have been evacuated. It tossed these trailer homes like tin cans. And there was one woman that said that she had turned in early and felt her bed bouncing. And she was evacuated and is staying elsewhere now.
KELLY: The flooding - this is not restricted to just this small part of the state. This is the whole state of Oklahoma that's going through this. Is that right?
HUBBARD: Yeah, 25% of the state has had at least 14 inches of water in the last 30 days. And if you look at towns in northeast Oklahoma like Skiatook - they've had 21 1/2 inches, Nowata 23 inches. It's just crazy. And this is all coming to a head in Tulsa along the Arkansas River.
KELLY: And what exactly is happening in Tulsa?
HUBBARD: Well, so all of this water from upstream that's coming from northeast Oklahoma is heading downstream into Tulsa. They have these aging levees. Many of them were built in the 1940s. The Keystone Dam is releasing huge amounts of water, and that has led to thousands of people being evacuated from their homes in the Tulsa area.
And then if you go down river, as you get closer to Arkansas, some communities, like Braggs and Webbers Falls, have been totally emptied out. One mayor earlier this week told people that if they refuse to evacuate, they should write their identification on their arm.
KELLY: Wow. I mean, it does sound as though it's just an overwhelmingly awful combination of floods and tornadoes and bad weather. What are people saying as you are out and about interviewing people and, I guess, just talking to your own neighbors?
HUBBARD: Well, people here are well-practiced. When we went into the basement on Saturday night with a tornado warning that hit near our home, our neighbors had their medication already prepared in plastic bags to take into the basement. But this has just been every day for nearly a month. And when you constantly have warnings coming through on your cell phone for floods and tornado watches and thunderstorms, it is hard to not just shut down.
KELLY: Yeah. Today, of course, is a holiday, Memorial Day. But are schools on track, businesses on track for business as usual tomorrow?
HUBBARD: Well, if it's not in a flooding area. So in Tulsa, there are hotels and businesses that have been evacuated. And they are expecting that it will be at least a week before they'll be able to return. And that's if they don't receive additional rainfall.
KELLY: Rachel Hubbard of member station KOSU in Oklahoma City - thank you, Rachel.
HUBBARD: You're welcome.

"As Silence Looms For Rolling Thunder, A Vet Explains What It's Meant To Him",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358649/as-silence-looms-for-rolling-thunder-a-vet-explains-what-its-meant-to-him?station=KXJZ_FM,"Thousands of motorcyclists ride to Washington, D.C., every Memorial Day. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Staff Sgt. Tim Chambers, who spends hours each year saluting Rolling Thunder bikers.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
This weekend in Washington, D.C., the air was full of this sound.
(SOUNDBITE OF MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVVING)
KELLY: That would be motorcycles - a lot of them. It was the 32nd annual Rolling Thunder ride for Freedom. Hundreds of thousands of riders honor military members captured, missing or killed in combat. This year may have been the last Rolling Thunder ride. Organizers say the event has gotten too expensive and too big.
Marine veteran Staff Sergeant Tim Chambers was there for it. He comes every year. He stands for hours, holding a salute as fellow vets ride by. Yesterday he did it for his 18th time as temperatures soared and D.C.'s infamous summer humidity set in. I spoke with Chambers today, and he told me about the first time he held the salute back in 2002. He was on the National Mall by the Korean War Memorial when he saw a number of vets on bikes passing by.
TIM CHAMBERS: I thought, how can I thank them? So I just jumped off the curb and popped up a salute. And I saw tears rolling by on their faces. And that's what kept me driving throughout that salute until the last bike rolled around me. And then both sides of the street just rushed me and said thank you, Marine.
KELLY: So tell me about yesterday. Did you pick a certain place where you're going to be?
CHAMBERS: Yeah, it's become my memorial post. It's at 23rd and Constitution, right behind the Lincoln Monument.
KELLY: And you're full uniform.
CHAMBERS: Yeah.
KELLY: What's going through your head as you stand there?
CHAMBERS: I'm hoping I don't let anyone down. I didn't go to war, but I still care so much for those that did and the families left behind. So there's a lot riding on my shoulders.
KELLY: Not letting anybody down - what do you mean? just being able to hold the salute for so long.
CHAMBERS: Yeah, maintain my position and in life. You know, it's much more than one day out of the year thing. The families that lost their loved ones, they're like, wow, my son wanted to be that. And it kind of honors them, in essence, because it doesn't let the sacrifice go in vain.
KELLY: This seems to resonate with Korean vets, who are getting older now, vets from Vietnam, same thing - also Iraq, Afghanistan. I mean, it's all generations.
CHAMBERS: Yes, and it's very humbling. I was in a diner in Lexington, Ky. And this guy saw a shirt I had with my salute on the back that said, thank you, veterans in all the wars. And he goes, I know that Marine. And I'm like, well, I'm that Marine. He started to cry. He said, please keep doing it. He had to give up his motorcycle when he came home from war. And now he bounces and tries to go to school and is trying to find his way.
But somehow that resonates with him. And I never thought that would come from a combat veteran - a young buck, especially, that did get welcomed home. So that was probably the most humbling thing that really validated my existence of doing it, was from one of my own that did a lot more than me.
KELLY: That the respect is mutual.
CHAMBERS: Yes, that I was accepted. That meant the world to me.
KELLY: So there's the possibility that this weekend's was the last national Rolling Thunder ride on the National Mall. How do you feel about that?
CHAMBERS: I just go day by day. And, you know, things change, things happen, and we have to adapt.
KELLY: And I gather some plans to do this locally in different cities, maybe in different forms.
CHAMBERS: Oh, yes, they're going to do it, like, regional. You know, so that'll be able to reach more people throughout the country, which is good because not everyone can make it to D.C. And it doesn't start in D.C. It starts in every community where the blood flowed for our freedoms.
KELLY: Well, Tim Chambers, thank you for stopping by and sharing a little bit of your story with us. Thank you.
CHAMBERS: My pleasure.
KELLY: That's Marine Corps veteran Tim Chambers, also known as the Saluting Marine.

"After Failed Coup, Maduro Moves Against Members Of Venezuelan Opposition",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727358642/after-failed-coup-maduro-moves-against-members-of-venezuelan-opposition?station=KXJZ_FM,"Rather than arresting rival Juan Guaido, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is targeting lower-ranking members the opposition party stripping their legal immunity and threatening them with arrest.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Now to Venezuela, where the government is going after those involved in the botched effort last month to oust authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro. One opposition lawmaker who took part in the uprising has been arrested. Others have taken refuge in foreign embassies or gone underground or fled the country. Reporter John Otis has more.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking in Spanish).
JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: This panel discussion in Caracas about the government crackdown was supposed to include opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro. But he's been targeted for arrest and is nowhere to be found. Simon Gomez, a human rights lawyer who helped organize the event, explains why.
SIMON GOMEZ: He is definitely into peril. He can be detained at any moment. So that's why he decided not to be with us this afternoon. He should be here in a free country.
OTIS: Pizarro isn't the only lawmaker in trouble. On April 30, the opposition tried to convince the armed forces to stage a coup against Maduro. His government responded by jailing the vice president of the National Assembly, Venezuela's congress. Other legislators have been stripped of their diplomatic immunity, often a prelude to arrest. Luis Vicente Leon is a Caracas political analyst.
LUIS VICENTE LEON: They tried to kick Maduro out with the military. And Maduro now is answering with radical actions against the civil politicians, trying to destroy them.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DIOSDADO CABELLO: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: On his TV program last week, Diosdado Cabello, the second most powerful figure in the Maduro government, pointed at photos of the targeted legislators. Among those he singled out was Winston Flores.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CABELLO: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: Flores helped last month's rebellion by bringing supporters into the streets. But few showed up. The uprising collapsed, and Flores fled the country. He spoke to NPR by phone from Ecuador.
WINSTON FLORES: (Through interpreter) The feeling is overwhelming. I'm outside my country without my family and without much money.
OTIS: Flores doesn't know when he'll be able to go back to Venezuela, but he plans to spend his time in exile traveling around South America, drumming up support for the opposition. Five more legislators have sought refuge in foreign embassies in Caracas. But that doesn't bother supporters of the Maduro government, who are gathered outside the National Assembly building downtown.
(SOUNDBITE OF DEMONSTRATION)
UNIDENTIFIED MADURO SUPPORTERS: (Chanting in Spanish).
OTIS: ""We'll always be loyal and never traitors,"" they chant.
AMILCAR MIRANDA: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: One of the demonstrators, Amilcar Miranda, is an agricultural technician. He says the lawmakers are getting what they deserve for supporting an illegal coup. The exodus of lawmakers has further hollowed out Venezuela's National Assembly, the only branch of government controlled by the opposition. Even before they fled, Maduro had ignored its laws and stripped the body most of its powers.
This is the entrance to the National Assembly building, and we're not going to be able to get in because it's blocked off by riot police with shields that - forming a big line here, blocking off all the journalists.
One of the lawmakers entering the building is Renzo Prieto. He spent four years in prison for protesting against Maduro. Prieto tells me that he and his colleagues remain undeterred.
RENZO PRIETO: (Speaking Spanish.)
OTIS: He says, ""unfortunately, the tyrant keeps abusing power, but we will keep up the fight.""

"Tornadoes Reported In Dayton, Ohio And Surrounding Area: Warning To Take Cover : NPR",www.npr.org,Vanessa Romo,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727439670/multiple-tornadoes-touch-down-in-dayton-ohio-catastrophic-damage-reported,"Enlarge this image Storm-damaged homes after a tornado passed through the area the previous evening in Brookville, Ohio. John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP Storm-damaged homes after a tornado passed through the area the previous evening in Brookville, Ohio.
John Minchillo/AP Updated at 12:41 p.m. ET
Several tornadoes touched down in highly populated areas of Dayton and other Ohio communities late Monday night, causing catastrophic damage. The storms devastated dozens of buildings and trees. One death has been reported, officials said Tuesday morning.
The National Weather Service says that ""at least an EF3 tornado with winds up to 140 mph"" struck the city of Beavercreek in Greene County, Ohio. It says similar winds hit Trotwood in Montgomery County — and that it's too early to know whether the same tornado passed through those counties. On the tornado strength scale , an EF3 is designated as ""severe.""
As it announced those designations, the NWS office in Wilmington said it's still analyzing the storm's effects in other areas.
The lone reported death occurred in Celina in Mercer County, where Melvin Dale Hanna, 81, was killed during the storm ""as the direct result of a vehicle entering his house,"" Celina Mayor Jeffrey Hazel announced Tuesday.
""Frankly, back in the neighborhood, there's areas that looked really like a war zone,"" Hazel said after visiting one devastated area. ""So it's a tough one in there.""
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine toured the damage Tuesday, calling the damage ""devastating"" on Twitter and adding that dozens of homes have been destroyed.
The damage here in #Celina is devastating. The mayor tells me there are several serious injuries and a fatality. Dozens of homes destroyed here. Our prayers are with everyone impacted. pic.twitter.com/p6bvryvPHn
— Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) May 28, 2019 Given the terrible destruction and havoc that the storm system unleashed, officials in Dayton said they felt fortunate no deaths were reported there.
""Last night about 11:30, tornadoes struck the Dayton area,"" Dayton Fire Chief Jeffrey Payne said. ""However, we have yet to find one fatality, and we have had three minor injuries. I find that pretty miraculous.""
Officials in Dayton, Celina and nearby communities are still searching for potential victims after intense storms wreaked havoc. Suspected tornadoes also left behind destruction in the Indiana town of Pendleton, about 100 miles west of Dayton.
Dayton is currently under a boil-water advisory.

The storms were packed so closely together that one crossed the path carved by another. John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP Storm damage litters a residential neighborhood, in Dayton, Ohio, Tuesday, after a rapid-fire line of apparent tornadoes tore across Indiana and Ohio overnight. The storms were packed so closely together that one crossed the path carved by another.
John Minchillo/AP ""The first tornado warning went out one minute before 9 p.m. in Wayne County, West of Richmond. The last warning was issued a few minutes before 2 a.m. in Hocking County,"" member station WYSO reports . ""In all, officials issued 36 tornado warnings, one flash flood warning, and recorded multiple instances of golf ball-sized hail in the Dayton area Monday night.""
In addition to Dayton and Celina, extensive damage has been reported in New Madison, Laura and Laurelville in Ohio, the National Weather Service says. The agency adds that due to ""the magnitude and expanse"" of the devastation, it will take several days for its crews to conduct damage surveys.
Celina officials said Tuesday that a tornado rampaged through the town's northwest section, leaving ""significant damages and injuries.""
The list of injured people in Dayton includes some who had to be pulled out of severely damaged buildings, Payne said. He credited the early warning system that informed the public of an impending dangerous tornado system — and he praised residents for following instructions to seek shelter.
Images from the scene show residential neighborhoods that have seemingly been turned into disaster areas. Officials say they're still tallying the number of damaged buildings.
""The sun just came up,"" Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley said at a news conference Tuesday.
The area suffered a ""tornado outbreak,"" the NWS says, posting a map showing more than a dozen places where tornadoes may have struck, from the Ohio-Indiana border to several spots east of Columbus. In at least one spot northwest of Dayton, two circulation systems capable of generating tornadoes crossed each other's paths.
""Tornadoes did not necessarily occur in every indicated area, but multiple tornadoes have occurred,"" the weather service says.

John Minchillo/AP The NWS sent out urgent bulletins overnight, warning that dangerous twisters were causing considerable damage and urging people to stay out of harm's way.
Tornadoes were reported in Mercer, Darke, Miami and Montgomery counties. Search and rescue crews are now combing through the area, including ""live find"" crews and dogs that can help find victims of the powerful storm, officials said.
Several areas of Dayton were hit hard, fire officials said, along with nearby areas of Troy and Stanley. In addition to trees and power lines, the tornadoes peeled roofs off of houses, brought down businesses' walls and collapsed ceilings.
""Debris being lofted into the air by a tornado south of Circlevile, Ohio,"" the NWS tweeted just after 1 a.m. ET.

Reports of gas leaks came in all night long, fire officials said Tuesday, adding that with a new day starting, new risks could arise as people turn on their home appliances.

— Michael Armstrong (@KOCOMichael) May 28, 2019 Due to widespread power outages, the city of Dayton is asking residents throughout Montgomery County to conserve water. ""We have lost power to both water plants and pump stations,"" officials said on Twitter. Those plants will rely on generator power until electricity can be restored.
The last large storm to hit Dayton came in 2008, when Hurricane Ike knocked the city into a blackout for about a week. But in that case, its water supply was not affected, officials said Tuesday.
Due to the widespread power outages we are asking all Dayton and Montgomery County Customers to conserve water. We have lost power to both water plants and pump stations. First Responders are performing search and rescue operations and debris clearing. #daytontornado
— City of Dayton, Ohio (@cityofdayton) May 28, 2019 Even before the tornadoes hit, an earlier storm already had raged through the Miami Valley, knocking out power to tens of thousands of residents. Dayton Power and Light reported more than 64,000 customers were without power as of 2 a.m. By 7:30 a.m., that figure had dropped to 55,000 of the utility's 520,000 customers.
""We expect this will be a multi-day restoration,"" DP&L said on Tuesday.
The NWS office in Wilmington, Ohio, estimated that at the worst point, the storms and tornadoes left about 5 million people without power.
From around 11:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m., Dayton's emergency crews responded to 41 fire reports, Payne said. Police Chief Richard S. Biehl said his department received around 244 calls for service in a slightly shorter time frame, ranging from reports of downed traffic lights to trees blocking roadways.
In some hard-hit neighborhoods, people were trapped in collapsed buildings, the NWS reported. And to reach those storm victims, firefighters and EMTs had to navigate streets that were littered with debris and downed wires.

Another shows a two-story house with one of its walls ripped out. Remnants of commercial buildings whose brick or cinder block walls have collapsed are also depicted.
The city of Celina, northwest of Dayton, was particularly hard hit. Police are asking people to avoid driving into the city due to live wires and severe damage.
Local school districts have canceled classes after sustaining damage to school buildings.
Emergency crews are still working through a backlog of calls, Payne said. He added that regional task force teams had been activated to help with the effort, bringing crews from Cincinnati and other cities.

Debris from the storms blocked parts of I-75, forcing the Ohio Department of Transportation to ask motorists to avoid the interstate. The agency posted photos to Twitter showing snow plows being used to push fallen trees off I-75 north of Dayton. After it was cleared, the DOT said motorists were causing new delays — by slowing down to gawk at the storm's effects.
""If you want to look at storm damage we ask that you exit the interstate and pull over,"" the agency said.

— ODOT Dayton (@ODOT_Dayton) May 28, 2019 NWS forecaster David Roth told NPR the violent weather is part of an unusual pattern that has also brought flood worries to Arkansas and Oklahoma, where a tornado in El Reno left two people dead on Saturday. Roth said it may take up to a week for the weather pattern to change and return to calmer conditions.
The storms hit Dayton just two days after the city's police were called on to maintain peace during a Ku Klux Klan rally on Saturday.
The Red Cross has set up a number of shelters to help people whose homes were damaged by the storm. One challenge in opening shelters, officials said, was to find large spaces that still had power. Other organizations are also working to aid recovery and shelter efforts, as member station WVXU reports .

What Parliamentary Elections Could Mean For The Future Of The EU,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727279774/what-parliamentary-elections-could-mean-for-the-future-of-the-eu?station=KXJZ_FM,"Steve Inskeep talks to former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who discusses the EU parliamentary elections that concluded Sunday. Bildt is now co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
How do Europe's election results look to a politician in the center? The European Parliament elections did not go well at all for traditional parties of the center-right and center-left. Populist parties gained. Far-right parties gained. Euroskeptic parties gained. More Liberal and Green parties also gained. Our next guest once led a center-right party in Sweden. In the 1990s, Carl Bildt was Sweden's prime minister and led his country into the European Union. He's now on Skype from Stockholm. Welcome to the program, sir.
CARL BILDT: Thank you.
INSKEEP: How do you read the election results?
BILDT: Well, what happened was not really what a lot of people were fearing, that there would be a surge of the far-right populists. I mean, they did fairly moderately increase, if you look at the overall figures - Italy being the disturbing example, where they did extremely well. Deputy Prime Minister Salvini otherwise didn't do particularly well.
So the big increases are really the Liberals and the Greens. And that means that is really shifting alliances in the center. As you pointed out the, center-right EPP lost somewhat. The Social Democrat lost somewhat. But that was sort of compensated by the Greens and the Liberals, while the extremes didn't do that well.
INSKEEP: I guess we should just explain for Americans who maybe don't follow this every day.
BILDT: Yeah.
INSKEEP: I'm looking at a chart of European Parliament seats. There are multiple parties, which I guess are actually party coalitions, since you have various parties with various names in various countries. And they have coalitions at the European Parliament level. The center-right and center-left are still there. They're still pretty big. But you do note the gain among the Greens.
But also there is this populist gain. I'm even thinking, particularly, of the United Kingdom, where there's this brand new Brexit Party that got more votes than any party, even as, as you note, the Greens did really well. And other parties that favor staying in the European Union went fairly well. I'm trying to find one unified message from all of that.
BILDT: Yeah. And I don't think you should look at the U.K. because that's a rather special case.
INSKEEP: OK.
BILDT: Because there's a sort of meltdown going on there. But as you pointed out, the Brexit Party became the biggest party. But they really only replaced the U.K. party that was there before. Farage was very strong in the 2015 or 2014 European elections as well. But overall, if you look at the trends, if you can see, as you say, this was 28 national elections, the populist right did extremely well in Italy, Salvini - didn't do well at all in Germany, lost their seats in the Netherlands. Marine Le Pen, that's sort of the far-right party in France...
INSKEEP: Right.
BILDT: ...Came on top of President Macron but did less well than five years ago. So it's difficult to see that as sort of surge in the support for her.
INSKEEP: OK.
BILDT: Really, sort of the Greens and the Liberals were the winners of the day, somewhat as a surprise - has to be said. And then another result that should be noted is the fairly significant increase in turnout - not in every country, but in most of the countries, significant increase in interest in these elections, which I think is a healthy sign.
INSKEEP: Is the danger that the European Union is seen as being in actually what's driving that higher turnout?
BILDT: Well, I think that, first, there has been a more interesting debate in a number of countries. Secondly, I think there's an increasing awareness of - that we live in a - we live in a world of Brexit, of Trump, of Putin, of China. And it is more important for Europeans to stay together and see what we can do together. That - that reluctant recognition, I think, has been one of the themes that have been there, in the debate, in virtually every country.
INSKEEP: So you are pushing, in a way - or not pushing. But you're - you're advocating a different view of these elections than some might see. Despite some gains from the populists, it sounds like you - you perceive some bedrock support for the idea of a united Europe.
BILDT: Yeah. I mean, there was an increase by the - by the far-right - but, I mean, fairly marginal (ph) and far less than most people had predicted or most people had feared. And there was a bigger gain for the Greens and the Liberals than people had anticipated. The decline for the main parties, the EPP, center-right main party and the Social Democratic Party, was broadly foreseen.
INSKEEP: When you mentioned the various threats that Europeans may feel that they face, you mentioned Vladimir Putin of Russia. Of course, there was a huge controversy over Russian interference in the U.S. election in 2016. There has been some investigation of Russian involvement in the Brexit debate in the U.K. Was Russia perceived as some kind of player in these elections?
BILDT: As some kind of player, most probably. But that's hardly news. I mean, the Russians have been active with propaganda and with political means to try to influence European countries forever. It normally backfires. There was, of course, the scandal in Austria - you might have noted that - where it was disclosed that they had been - or the far-right party have been trying to - believing that they went into some sort of agreement with Russia in selling out Austrian interests. That has collapsed the Austrian government and led, of course, to significant loss for that particular party.
INSKEEP: So when you look at this mix of seats and party groups in the European Parliament, do you see a parliament that can function and move forward on any particular agenda?
BILDT: I think it's going to be a more complicated parliament than before because in this - the still-sitting Parliament, you had the EPP, center-right and the center-left, grouping together, had a majority. And they often agreed on things. They no longer have that majority. And they will have to go into coalition agreements on different issues with, primarily, the Liberals, I would say - guess - and to some extent, the Greens - hardly with the far-right. So it's going to be a somewhat more complicated parliamentary work ahead, during the next five years. And then, of course - then of course, it's all done in a co-decision procedure, with the 27 or 28 governments.
INSKEEP: Going to be complicated.
Mr. Bildt, thanks so much.
BILDT: Thanks.
INSKEEP: Carl Bildt is the co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations and the former Swedish prime minister. He joined us via Skype.

Good morning. I'm Noel King, with the story of a pillow fight. I'm not talking about the childhood ritual. This is a highly orchestrated competition. It takes place in a small fishing town in Japan. When the game starts, five players are, quote, ""sleeping, all tucked in."" Then a whistle blows, and the fight begins. Reuters describes it as a mix between dodgeball and chess. The championship took place this weekend. The oldest contestant was 75. We're all kids at heart.

Former Green Bay Packers Quarterback Bart Starr Dies At 85,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260679/former-green-bay-packers-quarterback-bart-starr-dies-at-85?station=KXJZ_FM,"Legendary Bart Starr, who played for the Packers from 1956 to 1971, was the first quarterback to win five NFL championships. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
A list of the greatest football players ever might easily include Bart Starr. The Green Bay Packers quarterback died yesterday at age 85. The team said he had been in failing health since a stroke in 2014.
NOEL KING, HOST:
You can think of Starr as the Tom Brady of his time, or maybe Tom Brady is the Bart Starr of this time. He played from the 1950s to the 1970s, and his team won five titles, including the first two Super Bowls in 1967 and '68.
INSKEEP: His most famous victory was the NFL championship in 1967, which is known as The Ice Bowl. It was about 15 degrees below zero on New Year's Eve in Green Bay. The Packers were facing the Dallas Cowboys. And with seconds left...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TED MOORE: Here are the Packers. Third down, inches to go to pay dirt (ph), 17 to 14, Cowboys out in front. Packers trying for the go-ahead score. Starr begins the count, takes the snap. He's got the quarterback sneak, and he's in for the touchdown, and the Packers are out in front - 20 to 17.
INSKEEP: Quarterback sneak.
KING: Years later, Starr talked to ESPN about that moment.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BART STARR: Felt wonderful. It was just the greatest experience and feeling that you could imagine.
KING: After he retired from playing football, Starr went on to coach the Packers for several seasons.
INSKEEP: To this day, the NFL gives out the Bart Starr Award each year. Here's his wife Cherry explaining the award in - to the 2019 winner, Calais Campbell.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHERRY STARR: It's given to the NFL player who best exemplifies outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community.
KING: In 2014, Starr was able to give the award to one of his football heirs, Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers. In a statement yesterday, the Packers said Starr, quote, ""epitomized class.""

High Voter Turn Out For European Parliamentary Elections,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260672/high-voter-turnout-for-european-parliamentary-elections?station=KXJZ_FM,"Centrists in Europe have lost their majority. After Europe's parliamentary elections over the weekend, nationalist and far-right parties got a boost in their share of power.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Over the weekend, the European Union held parliamentary elections. And this morning, we're getting the results. Voter turnout was high, and it left the EU's traditional center splintered. OK. We're going to have two views from Europe this morning, starting in Rome with NPR's Sylvia Poggioli.
Hi, Sylvia.
SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Hi, Noel.
KING: So let's start with the 3,000-foot view of results across the European Union. Who gained and who lost?
POGGIOLI: Well, you know, the populists did well in some places, but there was no hard-right takeover of the EU Parliament. As you said, turnout was high - 51% compared to 43% five years ago. Many young pro-EU voters cast ballots for Greens Parties. They did very well in northern Europe.
The populists won enough to deprive the center-left and center-right parties of the parliamentary majority they held for 40 years. So the centrists will have to create a wider alliance with other parties, but they've ruled out a coalition with the hard-right. In the end, the populists will get only around 25% of Parliament's seats. Nevertheless, there were some big populist victories. Here's Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the victorious hard-right league.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian).
POGGIOLI: He said, ""not only is the League the top party in Italy, Marine Le Pen is the top party in France. Nigel Farage is the top party in the U.K."" So Italy, France, the U.K. - it's a sign of a Europe that's changing. In fact, Marine Le Pen's hard-right party came in ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron's party. That's seen as an embarrassment for the champion of a stronger EU. And Italy's League is now the biggest party in the EU Parliament, winning 34%.
KING: What is going on? What helped these far-right populist groups win so many seats this time around?
POGGIOLI: Anger at EU bureaucrats for failing to deal with the economic stagnation and high unemployment in southern Europe after the global financial crisis and security concerns after several terrorist attacks. But most of all, it's the huge migrant influx over the last several years. Populist parties whipped up fear and anxiety with slogans like, invasion, and the threat to Europe's Judeo-Christian values. One of the most outspoken populists on this issue is Hungary's autocratic Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose party scored more than 50% in the vote.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: We reject migration. And we would like to see leaders in position of European Unions who reject the migration, who would like to stop it and not to manage it.
KING: All right. So these far-right nationalist parties gained some seats in this election. What do they do with them now?
POGGIOLI: Well, they'll probably be more spoilers than promoters of radical change because they're divided on many issues. Italy's Salvini wants looser rules on budgetary discipline, but German and other northern European populists reject that. Salvini wants other EU states to take in many asylum-seekers who landed in Italy, but Hungary's Orban and other east Europeans say, no way.
And there's Russia. Salvini and Le Pen admire Vladimir Putin, while the ruling populist party in Poland and other east European parties are wary of Russia's aims. So populists won't be able to reshape the European Union in their image, but they could obstruct and seriously slow down the legislative process.
KING: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome.
Thanks, Sylvia.
POGGIOLI: Thank you, Noel.
KING: All right. Let's go over to the United Kingdom, where the new Brexit Party stormed to victory. Outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party suffered an historic defeat, and NPR's Frank Langfitt is traveling outside of London.
Hey, Frank.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, Noel.
KING: So we said that the Brexit Party did well. How well did they do exactly? And how did they pull this off?
LANGFITT: They did a fabulous job. They - most of the ballots are now counted, and they got over 30% of the vote. Remember, this is a party that hadn't been around - only been around for a number of weeks, really. The ruling Conservative's a completely different story. They're under 10%, ending up in fifth place. This is the worst showing by the Conservative Party since the 1830s. The other major party, Labour - they did badly as well. They ended up in third place.
And I think what's really going on here, Noel, is that neither of these major parties ever staked out a clear position on Brexit. We've had paralysis here for three years politically in the country. And this left space for the Brexit Party and, of course, Nigel Farage - he's a very charismatic leader of the party - to basically take this ground and scoop up lots and lots of voters who want to get out of the EU and, frankly, want to get out of it now.
KING: I mean, it doesn't change the fact that British politics broadly are still in chaos. What are...
LANGFITT: It is.
KING: ...The lessons from this vote?
LANGFITT: You know, I think the lessons here are voters want clarity. They want to know exactly what a party is going to do at this crucial moment in the country's history. And the parties that had clear positions on Brexit - like the Brexit Party - did very well.
What's interesting is that you're going to now see, I think, candidates for prime minister on the Tory side - they are going to be talking a lot more about the idea of a no-deal Brexit, of just walking away from the European Union, even though every economist you talk to - for the most part - says that's going to cause a lot of damage. But both parties, I think - what you've seen after, you know, years of fudging and kind of fumbling, they've got to stake out clear positions on this big issue.
KING: Well, going into this, we heard that this vote was seen as a proxy for a second referendum on Brexit. Given that the Brexit Party did so well, does that mean that Britons would vote to leave the EU again if they had the chance?
LANGFITT: No, not necessarily. And while I think the Brexit Party deserves a ton of credit for what they've done - they've only been around - they've been around for less than two months. So what we have is, three years on, still an incredibly polarized United Kingdom and no path forward. So even as we have these votes, you see just how people are so set against each other on this huge issue.
KING: NPR's Frank Langfitt outside of London.
Thanks, Frank.
LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Noel.

What Happens When A World-Class Athlete Decides To Have A Baby,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260658/what-happens-when-a-world-class-athlete-decides-to-have-a-baby?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Rachel Martin talks to sprinter Allyson Felix, an Olympic champion, about her contract with Nike through pregnancy.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Sprinter Allyson Felix has nine Olympic medals, including six gold medals. And she's not done. Yet contract talks with Nike, her sponsor, are at an impasse.
ALLYSON FELIX: And to me, you know, it's no longer about money. It's just about one thing simply, and that's the protection around maternity.
INSKEEP: She spoke with Rachel Martin about what to expect when a world-class athlete is expecting. Here's how she says Nike reacted to her news.
FELIX: The words, you know - they were congratulatory. And then things just got more difficult with the negotiations. And that's kind of where we became at a standstill - when I did want to push for, you know, protection around maternity. And it was something, you know, that I felt necessary just for the future and just how I know things to be around the culture in pregnancy in track and field.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: When you say you want protections for maternity, what does that mean explicitly?
FELIX: To me, that means that you don't have to rush back after pregnancies. Typically, also, your contract is pretty much kind of frozen when you become pregnant. And then it's kind of like, OK. You know, your job will be here when you get back. But you aren't paid, you know, in the meantime. And so that's something that, you know, I feel like definitely needs to change.
MARTIN: And then you mentioned the culture in professional sports around maternity and around pregnancy. What has been the culture?
FELIX: This is not, you know, just a Nike issue. This is - for me, this is the industry. And it's - you know, it's bigger than just one company. But what I have seen happen and witness happen with friends is that you typically, you know, become pregnant, and you feel that you have to hide it. You know, there's this feeling of fear.
MARTIN: I mean, presumably, Nike and other corporations - the argument is if you're not running, then we don't pay you.
FELIX: Yeah. And I definitely understand that. But I think that it becomes bigger than that, you know? When your image is being used, when you've been marketed for years and years and, you know, when your name is still out there, I do think that you are still being used, and your story is out there. And then, many times, you are still doing appearances, and you're doing work on behalf of the company. And you are still training. You know, you're not going to miraculously get back on the track and be on your top form. So I've worked much harder than ever before to be able to be back and be at top form when I do step back on the track.
MARTIN: There are other women in this fight with you. We saw Alysia Montano and Kara Goucher share similar stories. What does it mean to have them alongside you?
FELIX: Well, to me, Alysia and Kara are really just heroes, you know, to speak up on this. I just applaud them for starting this conversation. It's a tough thing to do, you know - to step out and not really know how you're going to be, you know, accepted. And they bravely started this conversation.
And so I think, you know, when a few people start talking, we see that change happens. We've seen these companies step up and say that they are going to change their policy. They are going to change the way that they do things. And none of this would have happened if no one would have said anything. You know, this has been going on for a very, very long time. So I'm grateful for them for stepping forward and for being brave and for speaking on something that can be hard to talk about.
MARTIN: Allyson Felix is a track and field sprinter. She's the only female track and field athlete to ever win six Olympic gold medals.
Thank you so much for talking with us.
FELIX: My pleasure.
INSKEEP: Now, on Friday, after Allyson Felix told her story to Rachel, Nike sent a letter to its athletes. Nike agrees that its contract terms have created, quote, ""unintended and unnecessary implications for our female athletes who become pregnant."" The company says it's working to fix that. So we called back Allyson Felix to ask if she is satisfied.
FELIX: I think it starts to, but there's definitely more to be done. I would - I have not seen any language of what those actual terms are going to be. And so I look forward to see what that looks like. And then, also, there's a lot of other companies that we hope will step up as well, you know? And this is an industry-wide problem. And I think it's great that, you know, Nike is taking a step in the right direction. But, you know, we'd love to hear these other companies as well. It would be great, you know, if everyone could really just get on board.
INSKEEP: Olympic sprinter Allyson Felix.

The High Cost Of The Opioid Epidemic For Communities,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260651/the-high-cost-of-the-opioid-epidemic-for-communities?station=KXJZ_FM,"State and local governments say the prescription opioid epidemic is costing them billions of dollars. They're suing big drug companies to recoup some of those costs.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The state of Oklahoma claimed another settlement with a drug company. Teva Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay the state $85 million. That's compensation for the company's role in the opioid crisis. Another company, Johnson & Johnson, has not settled, and a trial begins this week. This is all part of a sweeping trend. Hundreds of local and state governments across this country are suing pharmaceutical firms. North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann covers opioid litigation for NPR News.
Hi there, Brian.
BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.
INSKEEP: What are the costs that state and local governments are facing across this country that give them any standing to demand these big settlements?
MANN: Yeah. So what's really interesting here, Steve, is we've already seen more than 200,000 people die so far from prescription pain medication overdoses. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control. But there's still this big, expensive fight underway to keep opioid-dependent people alive. And I traveled to Summit County, Ohio, to learn more about how one community is responding. And I want to start with a guy named Richard Milhof. When the epidemic started, he saw it up close.
RICHARD MILHOF: A lot of my friends are passed way. They've overdosed and died.
MANN: I meet Milhof in the town jail and Barberton, a working-class town just outside Akron, Ohio. We actually talk through the bars of his cell. Police say they found him carrying a small amount of heroin, and they're holding him until he can see his caseworker. Milhof tells me a lot of people close to him got hooked on pain pills.
MILHOF: Almost every single friend that I had that I grew up with is dead because of it.
INSKEEP: Heroin used to be a painful but fairly manageable problem in Summit County. Then the number of prescriptions for opioid medications surged. Jerry Craig, who heads the county's main addiction treatment program, says drug companies created a vast, new hunger for opioids, snaring people who didn't know the risk.
JERRY CRAIG: I think they are as complicit in this as the dealers that are dealing it on the streets. And for that, I think that they should pay a price.
MANN: When the supply of prescription pain pills started drying up in 2016, Craig says desperate people turned to the black market. They bought heroin often laced with deadly fentanyl and carfentanil.
CRAIG: Three hundred and forty overdose deaths that year in Summit County alone - and our overdoses went from three a day to over 12 a day.
MANN: In this way, Summit County looks a lot like the rest of the country. The human cost has been enormous. But local officials around the U.S. say the epidemic also carries an actual dollar cost.
DONNA SKODA: We had no cash on hand. We had to start looking for grants.
MANN: Donna Skoda heads Summit County's public health department. She says everything had to change once the opioid crisis hit - more law enforcement, more rehab beds, needle exchange programs. She points to one aspect of the county's operations where the budget exploded - foster care.
SKODA: It's been the increase in the number of children they've had to take for safety reasons. I mean, it's just doubled. And then not to mention the children that have been orphaned - so it just complicates everything. But it has been devastating.
MANN: In this one Ohio county, taxpayers have spent nearly $70 million the last few years responding to the crisis. The cost of law enforcement alone rose more than 40%. But it's not just the county on the hook for this epidemic. In my three days on the ground in Summit County, I found city governments, schools, nonprofits, hospitals all scrambling to cope. Mike Hughes is a doctor at Barberton's hospital.
MIKE HUGHES: We knew that we needed to do something different.
MANN: They launched a pilot program last year, inviting anyone suffering from addiction to come to the emergency room. They started running ads on local television.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: They're open 24/7, 365. And when you need help, you can walk right in.
MANN: Hiring more nurses cost half a million dollars a year - money the hospital didn't have. Hughes says they didn't have any choice. People were dying, so they launched the program using donated money. A lot of the work in Summit County is still happening on a shoestring, through donations, volunteers and property-tax dollars.
INSKEEP: OK, so wow. Brian Mann, is this the kind of expense for which state and local governments want to be compensated?
MANN: That's exactly right, Steve. So Summit County alone - they told me that the price tag for this opioid epidemic there could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Multiply that times all the counties and cities around the U.S. struggling with this, and you'll get a sense for just how big the pressure is on drug companies as these lawsuits move forward.
INSKEEP: Now, we started with news that Teva Pharmaceuticals has settled with one state - the state of Oklahoma. What's Oklahoma do with that money?
MANN: Right. So $85 million - some of that will go to local governments, who need that cash to help pay for things like law enforcement and rehab programs. Experts say that could save lives. And I will say, Steve, this is beginning to look like a trend. More and more of these small and mid-sized drug companies are scrambling to get clear of these lawsuits through settlements. Again, the claims are that their marketing really got millions of Americans hooked. I do want to say it's important Teva denies any wrongdoing, despite this settlement. But Teva is still being sued by other local and state governments around the country.
INSKEEP: Wow - might face more pressure to settle elsewhere. But not everybody is settling everywhere. We should note that trial that is supposed to begin tomorrow, if I'm not mistaken, in Oklahoma also, against Johnson & Johnson - what's at stake?
MANN: Yeah, so Oklahoma's attorney general, Mike Hunter, is now focused on this one, big company. And this is where these lawsuits could get really interesting. If these huge companies with deep pockets, like Johnson & Johnson, are held liable for a sizable part of cleaning up the opioid epidemic, these payouts could jump very quickly. We've been talking about millions of dollars here, Steve. But this could jump into the billions, so people are watching Oklahoma closely this week. And they're going to be watching again when an even bigger test trial gets under way later in the year out in Ohio.
INSKEEP: This has got to be a challenge if you're a pharmaceutical company CEO because you can't just cut one check and settle one lawsuit. If you settle one, you have to anticipate more lawsuits all across the country.
MANN: That's right. And in some jurisdictions, people have been pushing for what's called a global settlement, similar to the tobacco settlements back in the 1990s, where it would sort of resolve all of this at once, get the industry out from under this and sort of, you know, mark a fresh beginning and also route billions of dollars to these communities that need this help desperately. But so far, that kind of big settlement just hasn't been reached.
INSKEEP: Brian, thanks.
MANN: Thank you, Steve.

Trump's Visit To Japan Is Overshadowed By Trade Tensions,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260644/trumps-visit-to-japan-is-overshadowed-by-trade-tensions?station=KXJZ_FM,"President Trump and his Japanese counterpart held a news conference Monday after the two met to talk about trade. Trump wants Japan to even out the trade imbalance with the U.S.
NOEL KING, HOST:
President Trump says he is not, quote, ""personally bothered"" by recent short-range missile tests that North Korea has been conducting. He said that this morning in a joint press conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The president is in Japan for a four-day state visit, and NPR's White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe is traveling with him.
Hi, Ayesha.
AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hello.
KING: All right, so President Trump says he is not personally bothered by these North Korean missile tests. What did Shinzo Abe, standing next to him, have to say about that?
RASCOE: Well, after Trump kind of downplayed North Korea's latest missile launches, Abe had this to say.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE: (Speaking Japanese).
RASCOE: So for those that don't speak Japanese, through a translator, we heard him call the test a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution. And he said it was regrettable that North Korea was taking these actions. So Trump and Abe say they're on the same page. And largely, they do seem to be. But there are some differences there.
KING: Trump also seemed to be making some promises today on the podium next to Abe. What was he offering? What was he saying he's going to do or the U.S. is going to do?
RASCOE: Well, over and over again, you had Trump talking about how he expects to make all these deals on national security or on trade with various countries. What you didn't hear was how he will actually make that happen. He said he expects an agreement with China. Here's more on that.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think some time in the future, China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal. And we look forward to that.
RASCOE: But he didn't say how those two countries will be able to come together. Talks have fallen apart, and the countries are now trading tariffs and retaliating against each other. He also says he wants a quick deal with Japan. He said there may be a big announcement on this in August, but he didn't say how the countries are going to kind of come together on the issue of car exports. Japan does not want tariffs, and Trump has said he's considering this. And he hasn't taken that option off the table.
KING: So this is interesting because Abe said today that Japan would be buying more than 130 F-35 - excuse me - more than 100 F-35 warplanes from the U.S. That is about trade, right? Explain what's going on there.
RASCOE: Well, it's about national security and building up the military, but it's also something that the Japanese can point to as helping to lower that trade deficit. These F-35s cost a lot of money, and it's a huge investment. And they can say, look. We're doing business with the U.S. We're not trying to take advantage of you on trade.
KING: This trip - the president's trip has gone on for the past several days. What has he been doing while he's been in Japan?
RASCOE: Well, this trip has really been all about kind of showing the close ties between Trump and Abe and Japan and the U.S., so there was some golf. And then there was also a sumo competition. There was the meeting with the new emperor. And so they have been really trying to show that the U.S. and Japan are united. And Abe's gone out of his way not to criticize Trump, even when it comes to North Korea, and, basically, really showered Trump with praise.
KING: Was there anything notable about the meeting with the new emperor? - anything interesting.
RASCOE: Well, it was interesting just to see President Trump and the first lady meet with the emperor. They shook hands. President Trump was standing on this kind of raised platform and listening to the national - U.S. national anthem and the Japanese national anthem. So, I mean, there was just a lot of ceremony that went on with this and a lot of - kind of historic.
KING: Pomp and circumstance - the president's going to be back in Japan at the end of June for the G20 summit. He's going to meet with world leaders there. He has a busy next month or so, doesn't he?
RASCOE: Yes, he's going to Europe next week - stopping in London, going to France. He may not get as warm a welcome, especially in London, where there were big protests the last time he was there.
KING: Yeah.
RASCOE: And at the end of June, Trump will be back in Japan for the G20.
KING: NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe.
Thanks so much, Ayesha.
RASCOE: Thank you.

"Sen. Cotton Keeps Politics Out Of His New Book, 'Sacred Duty'",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260637/sen-cotton-keeps-politics-out-of-his-new-book-sacred-duty?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Rachel Martin talks to Sen. Tom Cotton about his book: Sacred Duty: A Soldier's Tour at Arlington National Cemetery . Cotton served in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a platoon leader at Arlington.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Several times a day, members of the Army's Old Guard play ""Taps"" at Arlington National Cemetery at a funeral or at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
(SOUNDBITE OF BUGLE PLAYING)
KING: That lone bugle can signify both the end of the day and also a time to reflect. In the middle of all of the partisan fighting in this country, this Memorial Day, we're going to take a few moments to reflect with Tom Cotton. Cotton was a platoon leader in the Old Guard. He served at Arlington between tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Tom Cotton is now a Republican U.S. senator, and he's written a book called ""Sacred Duty: A Soldier's Tour At Arlington National Cemetery."" His book has nothing to do with politics. He told Rachel Martin that it was important to keep politics out of it when talking about Arlington.
TOM COTTON: It holds a special place in the hearts of our fellow citizens, that it's a place of unity and reconciliation, which is a bit of an irony because Arlington had its start in the Civil War, you know, a time in which Americans raised swords against each other - so much so that the Department of the Army had to take an old plantation across the river and turn it into a graveyard for our war dead because all the cemeteries in Washington were filling up. And I think probably because it had that origin in the ashes of the Civil War, as I describe in ""Sacred Duty,"" that it has become an almost mythic place in the hearts of our fellow citizens.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Who are the people who serve in the Old Guard?
COTTON: It's a diverse group. It's men and women. It's young and old. Some of these are privates coming straight from basic training at age 18. They were - they were plucked out because they were tall and physically fit and had high test scores. And some of them are sergeant majors who have had six or seven deployments.
MARTIN: The precision is notable. You stand at attention. You don't move for 75 minutes sometimes. You're supposed to carry a sword till its tip is a certain distance from the ground. These are just a few examples. But what is the relationship between that kind of precision and honor?
COTTON: When a family comes into the cemetery, we want them to have that last perfect image of honor. And everything that an Old Guard soldier does - whether it's his level of physical fitness and, therefore, his image, the cleanliness and precision of his uniform, the way he marches, the way he and his fellow soldiers carry a casket or fire the three-round volley - it's all designed to ensure that the family is focused solely on their fallen hero and the military honors rendered to them.
MARTIN: This is very important work, clearly. It's very sober work. But can you describe something called fallouts?
COTTON: Yeah, so a fallout is when a soldier falls out of ceremony. We have what's called a supernumerary, which is Latin for one above the number. And he generally comes out with the formation and hides behind a nearby tree or bush. So he's there in case someone falls out. So for instance, I recall a very hot summer day in August of 2007 when I was standing in formation, and the last man in the first rank passed out standing up, fell like a tree that had been cut - just face planted, face forward.
MARTIN: Oh, no.
COTTON: Now, we're all trained for this. So he just laid there, and no one else moved. The assistant non-commissioned officer in charge came over and scooped him up underneath, by putting his hand under his ceremonial belt and dragged him off the field. And the supernumerary marches out in ceremonial form, picks up that soldier's rifle, stands back up and falls into formation.
MARTIN: Wow.
COTTON: So you still have a perfect formation. It's an example of the level of detail that the Old Guard takes our ceremonial and our funeral planning to...
MARTIN: Yeah.
COTTON: ...That even for those very rare contingencies, when a soldier can't make it through a formation, that we have a plan in place to ensure that the ceremony or the funeral ends exactly as it would have even if nothing had happened.
MARTIN: You served in the Old Guard between two deployments. The United States was engaged in two wars at the time. And you saw, visibly, the cemetery change as a result of the remains that were coming home.
COTTON: I did, unfortunately. And I can see that today. In fact, I performed a group burial in October of 2007 for the crew and passengers of Easy 40, a Black Hawk helicopter shot down just outside of Baghdad earlier that year. And there are photos that you can see of me and the other Old Guard soldiers performing that funeral. And behind us is the eastern half of Section 60, where those killed in action in the war on terror are buried. And it's almost entirely green field.
And today if you go to the cemetery, you'll see that Section 60 is almost entirely filled with new headstones - not all from Iraq and Afghanistan but the lion's share. And that's a toll that is a reminder of us of just the kind of sacrifice that our warriors and their families have to lay down on the altar of freedom to keep this country free.
MARTIN: The book is called ""Sacred Duty: A Soldier's Tour At Arlington National Cemetery."" It's written by Senator Tom Cotton.
Thank you so much for talking with us.
COTTON: Thank you.

Stanley Cup Finals Action Begins Monday Night,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260630/stanley-cup-finals-action-begins-monday-night?station=KXJZ_FM,"The Boston Bruins return to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time since 2013, but the wait has been much longer for the St. Louis Blues. They were last in the finals 49 years ago.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
St. Louis hockey fans have been waiting almost half a century for this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KENNY ALBERT: For the first time in 49 years, the St. Louis Blues are headed to the Stanley Cup Final.
(CHEERING)
INSKEEP: That's Kenny Albert on the call for NBCSN last week. If you didn't hear him over the deafening roar, he was saying the St. Louis Blues haven't been in the Stanley Cup finals in 49 years. And tonight they are back facing the team that knocked them out of the series back in 1970, the Boston Bruins.
NOEL KING, HOST:
The Blues have never won the Stanley Cup, but when that franchise was first born they seemed like they'd be the next sports dynasty.
DAN O'NEILL: It's funny. They went to the finals their first three years - '68, '69 and '70. And, you know, you just sort of thought that that was just going to be a regular thing.
KING: Dan O'Neill is a sports reporter in St. Louis and wrote the book ""When The Blues Go Marching In."" He says the team's hard luck has made it pretty hard to be a hockey fan in a baseball town like St. Louis.
O'NEILL: People have the impression that St. Louisans get up in the morning and play catch before they eat breakfast. The Cardinals have dominated the landscape here, and so the Blues have always sort of played second fiddle. Now that's changed. If you drive around St. Louis now and you flip around the radio stations, they're talking about the Blues. And that's really unusual.
INSKEEP: Yeah. Because most years over the past half-century, the Blues have not given fans very much hope. Earlier this year, they were in last place, but since then they've thrilled St. Louis with a turnaround.
O'NEILL: They don't have a bunch of high-scoring forwards or household names, but they've just been an incredibly resilient team that doesn't get down. So that's why I think they have a chance, and it should be a terrific series.
INSKEEP: The Blues play the Bruins tonight in Boston.

"News Brief: Trump Visits Japan, European Parliament Elections, Opioid Case",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/27/727260606/morning-news-brief?station=KXJZ_FM,"President Trump meets with Japan's prime minister. It appears populists and nationalists are gaining more seats in Europe's Parliament. And, Teva Pharmaceuticals agrees to settle Oklahoma opioid case.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
President Trump's disagreement with Japan's prime minister demonstrates his personal brand of diplomacy.
NOEL KING, HOST:
That's right. The president has been visiting Tokyo. He met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Their summit came after North Korea tested missiles. Now, Japan and key figures in the Trump administration say that testing violates U.N. resolutions, but President Trump says he's not bothered by it.
INSKEEP: One of many things heard by NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe, who is traveling with the president - is currently in Japan. Hi there, Ayesha.
AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hello.
INSKEEP: So we should mention, the news conference at which the president made that remark next to Shinzo Abe came after a lengthy meeting. What came out of it?
RASCOE: So really, this trip overall was about showing how close the U.S. and Japan are, how close Trump and Abe are. And that was on display here at the press conference. Abe, in particular, was very complimentary of Trump. He repeatedly said how he wanted to praise Trump for taking a new approach with North Korea. He even said that Trump was responsible for cracking Kim Jong Un's shell of distrust. But, as you mentioned, there were some divisions there. Trump downplayed North Korea's latest missile launches. And Abe had this to say.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE: (Speaking Japanese).
INSKEEP: I guess we should do a little translation here...
RASCOE: For those that don't speak...
INSKEEP: Yeah. Go ahead, please.
RASCOE: Yeah. For those that don't speak Japanese, he called the test a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution. And he said it was regrettable that this happened. So even though the countries are saying they're on the same page - and, largely, they do seem to be - there are some differences there.
INSKEEP: What else was the president saying as he stood next to the Japanese prime minister?
RASCOE: Well, over and over again, Trump was talking about how he expects to make all these deals on national security or on trade with various countries. What you didn't hear was how he will actually make it happen. He said he expects an agreement with China. Here's more on that.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think sometime in the future, China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal. And we look forward to that.
RASCOE: But he didn't say how those two countries will be able to come together. Talks have really fallen apart. The countries are now trading tariffs and retaliating against each other. He's also talking about a quick deal with Japan and said there may be a big announcement on this by August.
But he didn't say how those countries are going to come together on the issue of car imports. Japan does not want tariffs. And Trump has said that he's looking at that. He's considering it, and he hasn't taken that off the table.
INSKEEP: Let me ask about one thing that was said there about China, Ayesha. Is this correct? The president also said China wants to make a deal. They're ready to make a deal with us, the United States, but we're not ready to make a deal. Did he say, again, he's comfortable just having higher and higher tariffs against China?
RASCOE: That was much of what he was saying. Obviously, he continues to state inaccurately that China is paying all the tariffs. It is importers who are paying - U.S. importers who are paying the tariffs. But he basically is now kind of saying that China wishes they would have made the deal; they're kind of suffering. And we - and now we're not ready to make a deal. They have to kind of come to us, basically - or come to the U.S. to make the deal.
INSKEEP: But the U.S. is selling a bunch of F-35 fighter planes to Japan.
RASCOE: Yeah. So this is a product of Japan's efforts, obviously, to build up their military, but also to win over some favor from the U.S. and lower that trade deficit which Trump is so concerned about. So this is a way - these F-35s are not cheap. And so they cost a lot of money.
INSKEEP: OK. Ayesha, thanks so much.
RASCOE: Thank you.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
INSKEEP: OK, huge election result here - centrists in Europe have lost their majority.
KING: That's right. Over the weekend, the European Union held parliamentary elections. Nationalist and far-right parties gained seats, but they did not win in a landslide that a lot of people had predicted. Liberals and Green parties also did very well. And it's notable that this was the highest turnout for European elections in 25 years.
INSKEEP: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli has been following the elections from Rome. Hi there, Sylvia.
SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.
INSKEEP: What do you make of all this?
POGGIOLI: Well, the bottom line is, as you said, the populists did well in some countries. But those fearful forecasts of a hard-right victory across the EU did not pan out. One reason seems to be a very high turnout - overall, something like 51% compared to 43% five years ago. And that's apparently thanks to young, pro-EU voters who cast ballots for Greens. Those parties scored very well in Northern Europe.
The populists did succeed in depriving the center-left and center-right parties of the majority they held for 40 years in the European Parliament. They've gained 5% from the last EU elections. But populists are expected to get only around 25% of Parliament seats. Nevertheless, there were some standout populist victories.
Here's the victorious Matteo Salvini, Italian deputy prime minister and leader of the hard-right League.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian).
POGGIOLI: So, clutching a rosary, Salvini said, ""not only is the League the top party in Italy. Marine Le Pen is the top party in France. Nigel Farage is the top party in the U.K. So Italy, France, the U.K. - it's a sign of Europe that's changing."" And, you know, Marine Le Pen's hard-right party came in ahead of the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, the champion of a stronger EU. And the League, here in Italy, scored 34%, and that makes it the biggest party in the EU Parliament.
INSKEEP: Well, what is driving the far-right in multiple countries to gain?
POGGIOLI: Well, you know, EU bureaucrats have been accused of dealing very poorly with many recent issues. There was the economic stagnation following the global financial crisis, very high unemployment rates, especially among the young in Southern Europe, mass-casualty terrorist attacks that raised concerns over lack of security - but of course, most of all, the refugee crisis that led to an influx of unprecedented numbers of migrants in Europe.
Populists have fueled fears and anxiety over what they call an invasion. Here's the autocratic prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, whose party scored more than 50% in the EU vote.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: We reject migration. And we would like to see leaders in position of European Unions who reject the migration, who would like to stop it and not to manage it.
INSKEEP: OK. Sylvia, from that one quote, we can figure out what far-right means in Hungary. But does it mean the same in all European countries? What do they all stand for?
POGGIOLI: No. There's a - you know, they're not united on all issues. For example, Italy's Salvini wants much looser rules on budgetary discipline. That's rejected by German and other North European populists. Salvini also wants other member states to take in many of the refugees that are in Italy. Hungary's Orban and other East Europeans rule that out. So they won't be able - the populists won't be able to reshape the European Union in their image, but they could seriously obstruct and slow down the whole legislative process.
INSKEEP: Sylvia, thanks for your insights.
POGGIOLI: Thank you, Steve.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
INSKEEP: In this country, the state of Oklahoma has settled with a second pharmaceutical company for its role in the opioid crisis. Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals will be paying the state $85 million. That follows an earlier settlement with Purdue Pharma, the makers of the painkiller OxyContin, for $270 million.
KING: Yeah, this case against Teva isn't unusual. It's one of hundreds happening across the country. Local and state governments are suing the drug industry. They say the companies marketed and incentivized the sale of opioids, and that contributed to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths across the country. In the state of Oklahoma alone, thousands of people have died.
INSKEEP: We're joined now by Brian Mann of North Country Public Radio, who covers opioid litigation for NPR - which, Brian, I guess, gives you a lot to do.
BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yeah, there's a lot these days.
INSKEEP: And good morning. How important is this latest settlement?
MANN: Well, there's a big practical side to this, Steve. Local governments in Oklahoma will now get some cash to help pay for things like law enforcement and rehab programs that could save lives. But this is also part of a growing trend, with drug companies around the U.S. trying to get out from under this legal and public-relations cloud. They're accused of getting millions of Americans hooked on opioid medications through the use of this aggressive and misleading marketing. And that's just been a huge burden on the entire industry.
INSKEEP: Now, the news here is out of Oklahoma. But we should note there are many governments - state and local governments - in many states who are suing pharmaceutical companies. And I gather you've been travelling around talking with people in some of the areas that are suing.
MANN: That's right. I traveled out to Summit County, Ohio, to see how that local community is dealing with this and the costs. And I spoke to Richard Milhof. He's struggled with addiction himself. And says a lot of his neighbors got hooked on these prescription opioid medications.
RICHARD MILHOF: A lot my friends are passed away. They've overdosed and died...
MANN: I'm very sorry. I hope...
MILHOF: Almost every single friend that I had, that I grew up with, is dead because of it.
INSKEEP: Wow. One sense of the human cost. And then there's the dollar cost in government after government after government.
MANN: That's right. This heavy burden is falling on local governments around the country. They're paying for everything from law enforcement to, you know, needle exchange programs. I spoke with Donna Skoda, who heads Summit County's public health department. And she told me about kind of a surprising aspect of this, Steve. The county's budget exploded because of the need for new foster care.
DONNA SKODA: The increase in the number of children they've had to take for safety reasons, I mean, it's just doubled - and then not to mention the children that have been orphaned. So it just complicates everything. But it has been devastating.
MANN: In this one Ohio county, taxpayers have spent nearly $70 million the last few years responding to this crisis. Local officials across the U.S. say this is the kind of financial burden that Big Pharma should pay for.
INSKEEP: Brian, I think your reporting is suggesting to us why it might be that not all pharmaceutical companies have settled their lawsuits - because they might face lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit in city after city and state after state, right?
MANN: That's exactly right. And of course, back in Oklahoma there is still a suit there against Johnson & Johnson, one of the nation's biggest corporations, the biggest drug maker. They've denied any wrongdoing. But, you know, if big firms like this are found liable for cleaning up the opioid mess, the payouts could grow fast from the millions of dollars into the billions. So this is going to be watched very closely.
INSKEEP: Brian, thanks so much.
MANN: Thank you, Steve.
INSKEEP: That's Brian Mann of North Country Public Radio.

Why Does Infants' Tylenol Cost 3 Times More Than Children's Tylenol? : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/27/726327937/tylenol-for-infants-and-children-is-the-same-why-does-1-cost-3-times-more?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Infants' Tylenol comes with a dosing syringe, while Children's Tylenol has a plastic cup.

toggle caption Ryan Kellman/NPR Infants' Tylenol comes with a dosing syringe, while Children's Tylenol has a plastic cup. Both contain the same concentration of the active ingredient, acetaminophen.
Ryan Kellman/NPR If you've ever had a little one at home with a fever, you might have noticed two options for Tylenol at the store.
There's one for infants and one for children. They contain the same amount of medicine — 160 milligrams of acetaminophen per 5 milliliters of liquid — but the infant version costs three times more.
What gives? It turns out, there's a backstory.
For decades, Infants' Tylenol was stronger than the children's version . The thinking was that you don't want to give babies lots of liquid medicine to bring down a fever — so you can give them less if it's stronger.
""It was three times more concentrated,"" says Inma Hernandez of the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy. Since it contained more acetaminophen, the active ingredient, she says, it made sense that it was also more expensive. ""The price per milliliter was five times higher,"" Hernandez says.
But there was a problem: Parents were making mistakes with dosing. Babies got sick — some even died . So in 2011, at the urging of the Food and Drug Administration, the maker of brand-name Tylenol, Johnson & Johnson, announced a change : Infants' Tylenol would be the same concentration as Children's Tylenol.
Shots - Health News Giving Medicine To Young Children? Getting The Dose Right Is Tricky Now it's the same medicine, but the price is still different.
A quick search online shows 4 ounces of Children's Tylenol selling for $5.99, and Infants' Tylenol also selling for $5.99, but for only 1 ounce of medicine. With many store brands of acetaminophen, it's the same story: The infant version is generally three times more expensive than the one for children.
Kim Montagnino of Johnson & Johnson said in a statement to NPR that Infants' Tylenol is more expensive because the bottle is more sturdy and it includes a dosing syringe, instead of a plastic cup. ""These safety features of Infants' Tylenol (dosing syringe, rigid bottle) are more expensive to manufacture than the dosing cup and bottle for Children's Tylenol,"" Montagnino wrote.
Hernandez doesn't buy it.
""The cup versus the syringe doesn't really explain the price difference in my opinion,"" Hernandez says. ""They're really cheap because they're just plastic. When we think of what's expensive in a drug, it's actually the active ingredient, and the preparation of that active ingredient in the formulation, not the plastic cup or the syringe.""
But Johnson & Johnson's explanation makes sense to Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and founder of the website Consumer World . ""There's an extra thing in the box, and extra things usually cost money,"" he says.
""Think of a spray cleaner. You can buy the spray cleaner in the spray bottle, and that costs a little more money. Or you can buy the refill that gives you more ounces but it doesn't have the sprayer on top — it's kind of the same concept.""
But this, of course, is not a spray cleaner. It's medicine. And parents are sensitive to marketing because the stakes are so high.
""I would certainly imagine that product-makers know that parents want to be very cautious when buying products for their kids,"" Dworsky says. ""Really, the lesson is — read the label. See what you're getting for your money.""
Pediatrician Ankoor Shah at Children's National Health System in Washington, D.C., knows how confusing all of this is for parents because he gets tons of questions from them about over-the-counter medications.
""The packaging and the dosing is not easy, it's not simple and — personal opinion — it's not parent-friendly,"" Shah says.
For instance, Infants' Tylenol doesn't say on the label what the correct dosing is for a baby under age 2. It just says ""ask a doctor."" Shah says he still uses a calculator to figure out how much to give a child, based on their weight, and gives slips to parents at kids' well visits. You can also find the information from reputable sources online .
He says whether you opt for the Children's or Infants' bottle of acetaminophen at the store, the most important thing is to get the dosing right.
""When you start giving more acetaminophen than recommended, there are serious side effects that could happen,"" he says.
The bottom line is: Know what you need. And if you need to spend that extra couple of dollars for the syringe and the special bottle to get the dosing just right, maybe the markup is worth it."
Training Police To Better Track Hate Crimes : NPR,www.npr.org,Hannah Allam,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/726545423/we-need-to-evolve-police-get-help-to-improve-hate-crime-tracking,"University of New Hampshire police recently participated in a training on hate crimes.

For the picturesque college town of Durham in southeastern New Hampshire, a reckoning came in 2017.
That was the year a complaint about the cultural appropriation of Cinco de Mayo spiraled into weeks of racial unrest, a boiling over of tensions that had simmered for years at the University of New Hampshire. Students who called out racist incidents faced a backlash of online bullying, swastikas and slurs, and the vandalism of sculptures that symbolized their cause.
Student activists blamed UNH leadership for allowing the problem to fester. Their criticism was backed up by news reports that showed the university hadn't reported a single hate incident for more than a decade before — an oddity for a campus its size.
""That time was sad,"" UNH Police Chief Paul Dean said. ""But there were opportunities.""
Dean was speaking from a campus auditorium this month as he welcomed guests to one of those opportunities: a hate-crime training for the university police and the Durham Police Department.
Dean and Chief Dave Kurz of Durham, N.H., where the college is located, were among the latest chiefs to enlist the help of a traveling workshop organized by two advocacy groups, the Matthew Shepard Foundation and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. In the daylong workshop, the officers learned about state and federal laws related to bias crimes, heard from black and Jewish activists who've had firsthand experience with hate incidents, and debated whether certain scenarios had all the legal requirements of a hate crime.
I just don't like the idea of somebody feeling uncomfortable in my community. UNH Police Chief Paul Dean
Dean said the workshop is one of many ways he's trying to make good on a promise to students to be more responsive to bias-motivated incidents.
""Just because something has always been the way it is doesn't necessarily mean that's the right way. We need to evolve,"" Dean said. ""I just don't like the idea of somebody feeling uncomfortable in my community.""
The idea for the mobile trainings came a couple of years ago, when FBI data showed a sharp increase in reported hate crimes — and that's with only spotty, voluntary reporting from law enforcement agencies around the country.
The trainers are former senior Justice Department prosecutors and agents with years of experience in bias-motivated crimes. They go from city to city teaching police about hate-crime laws in their states — not always an easy task given the debate in law enforcement circles over whether such laws are necessary or even constitutional.

""There's one set of the population that looks at hate crimes and sees laws that were passed to protect certain people. And why were those certain people more special than somebody else?"" said trainer Cynthia Deitle, a former FBI special agent who was in charge of the bureau's Civil Rights Unit and is now with the Matthew Shepard Foundation.
The workshop materials list some of the most common arguments of skeptical officers: Laws are already in place for crimes, so it's a waste of time and resources to add an extra charge for bias. Hate crimes aren't a major problem in our area. These laws are an exercise in political correctness.
The trainers don't shy away from the tough conversation; they open with it. In New Hampshire, trainer Albert Moskowitz, a former senior Justice Department prosecutor, stood before roughly 50 officers and posed the big question about hate-crime laws.
""Do we need them?"" Moscowitz asked. ""What do you think?""
At first, nobody responded. Then one officer said he supports the approach New Hampshire takes now — no state hate-crime law, but prosecutors can seek tougher sentencing when bias is a motivation.
""So you're saying that somehow these crimes are more serious than they'd otherwise be,"" Moscowitz said, prodding the officer to explain his thinking.
""I didn't say more serious,"" the officer said. ""An assault is an assault no matter how you look at it.""
""Because an assault against anybody is a serious crime, right?"" Moscowitz said. ""So why would it be more serious if the assault is substantially motivated by the person's race or religion?""
""It should be enhanced as far as penalties,"" the officer replied. ""But as far as seriousness? No."" San Francisco Approves Ban On Government's Use Of Facial Recognition Technology
Supporters of hate-crime laws say the idea is to acknowledge the sweeping impact of targeting someone simply for who they are. The torching of a mosque is felt by the larger Muslim community, for example, just like the murder of a trans woman sends a message to others who identify as LGBT.
Strafford County Attorney Thomas Velardi, who oversees Durham and the surrounding area, says he sees hate-crime laws as restorative.
""There are some people that are being singled out and in some instances hurt, and we need to do something about that. We're sort of struggling with how to respond to that – what do we do and how do we do it?""
The trainers are careful about the framing, stressing how it's just good police work to stay on top of hate incidents that might point to a trend or signal the formation of groups like the ones that wreaked havoc in Charlottesville, Va.
""None of us want you to be the next Charlottesville or the next Charleston or the next Pittsburgh,"" Deitle said, referring to cities where deadly hate-inspired attacks took place. ""We don't want you to be that. But we don't know. And you need to be prepared.""
During the training, few of the New Hampshire officers volunteered their thoughts, but they opened up a little more over lunch. The chiefs asked that the officers not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the topic and because some work undercover.
Sitting around a table in the campus cafeteria, the officers used some of the language of hate-crime skeptics. There's not an increase, it's just that there's more reporting now, they argued, or the media are quick to call something a hate crime without knowing the facts. Still, the officers said, they see the training as helpful even if they're still conflicted about the purpose of hate-crime laws.
""If we don't train, if we don't stay on top of the current changes and laws and the attitudes and the climate, then we're going to pay a big price for that,"" one veteran officer said, as others nodded in agreement. ""We'll lose the trust of the community, and we can't do that."" Facebook"
California Poised To Play Outsized Role For Democratic Candidates In 2020 : NPR,www.npr.org,Scott Detrow,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/726778193/california-rich-in-delegates-takes-on-new-importance-for-crowded-democratic-fiel,"Biden, Sanders Highlight Familiar Split In Democratic Party
""She's in the field, and she's going to be a big factor, but it's wide open,"" Boxer added.
But several other presidential campaigns worry California's massive size and prohibitively expensive TV advertising costs will lead to a race that's anything but wide-open, and that only brand-names with big budgets will be able to truly compete.
NPR spoke to multiple presidential campaigns about the California primary, and strategists repeatedly circled back to just three candidates they think, right now, could make viable runs for the state next March: Harris, Sanders, and Biden. Several campaign advisers pointed out the obvious factor more than six months before primary and caucus voting begins: that early wins in Iowa or New Hampshire could vault another candidate to the top of that list, even as millions of California voters cast ballots early.
Buttigieg has made repeated appearances in California in recent months, mostly for big-ticket fundraising events. And many candidates are packing their weekend schedules with other forums and campaign stops, in addition to the cattle call at the state party's San Francisco convention.
""A very issues-oriented state""
Boxer, who herself emerged from a crowded primary field when she first won the California Senate seat in 1992, said candidates will need more than money to compete there. ""It's a very issues-oriented state,"" she said. ""It's not a state that just says, 'Oh, I know her name or I know his name.' They're going to want to know what you're fighting for.""
And it just so happens that many of the top California political issues are the same ones currently motivating Democrats all over the country: immigration and climate change, in particular. Democratic Candidates Embrace The Risk Of Radical Ideas
Garcetti said he wants to hear more about those two topics — as well as housing affordability and infrastructure. He also made it clear he's in no rush to commit to any particular candidate.
""We may know you, and we may know you well,"" he said. ""But what will you do for us as president?"" Facebook "
Tampered Videos Threaten To Hijack 2020 Political Conversations : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727460042/tampered-videos-threaten-to-hijack-2020-political-conversations,"Videos suggesting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was drunk and slurring her words went viral. They were proven to be fake but the damage was done. Should Facebook have taken them down?
NOEL KING, HOST:
A doctored video posted on Facebook seemed to show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disoriented and slurring her words. It got millions of views. It also spread across social media. That video raises a question. As we get closer to the 2020 election, how worried should we be about misinformation hijacking the political conversation? NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik is on the line. Good morning, David.
DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Good morning.
KING: So we have a doctored video that was widely spread any way. Do videos like this influence what people think?
FOLKENFLIK: Sure, they do. I think that they do it on a couple of levels. The first level is that there are people for whom they say, oh, my gosh, the House speaker, you know, we've got to be concerned about her health. Or there may be people not predisposed to be favorable to Democrats, to liberals, to the House speaker, and happy to have this against her. So there are people who may believe something of this to be true. And there are people for whom it's a little bit like waving, I guess, the Terrible Towels for Pittsburgh Steelers fans, like David Greene. You know, it's a way for them to cheer on their side. And so they use that as a rallying call whether or not they believe fundamentally it's true.
But don't forget. Go back to the 2016 race. Hillary Clinton had videos like this circulate when she had the flu or a cough, when she stumbled once getting into an SUV and people claimed she was near death, you know, every few days, almost as though she had died hundreds of deaths between when the campaign started and when it ended.
KING: News organizations were able to prove very quickly that the video of Pelosi had been slowed down and edited. That's why it seemed like she was slurring. So it's been debunked. Does that change anything? Or once it's out there, it's out there?
FOLKENFLIK: Bit of both. I think there are people for whom they say, oh, maybe back off a bit. But it's still in your mind. That's a little bit like saying don't think about a pink elephant.
KING: Yeah.
FOLKENFLIK: They've planted the idea. Yasmin Green is with Jigsaw, which is kind of an offshoot of Alphabet Google, the think tank. She introduced me the idea of the liar's dividend, which is that whether or not something is true, whether or not it's fully believed, it's taking up oxygen. It's taking up mind space. So people are thinking about this issue. People are talking about this issue. Hey, you and I are, in a sense, talking about this issue.
KING: Yeah.
FOLKENFLIK: And it's an issue that has no grounding or validity whatsoever so far as we know.
KING: When the video came out, people alerted Facebook. And Facebook flagged it as fake. But Facebook didn't take it down. What was their explanation for not removing it, given that it's not real?
FOLKENFLIK: Well, there are a couple grounds, one of which is they say, you know, we want to give people sufficient information to be able to reach good, sound conclusions, make the choices they want to in life - which sounds a little bit like journalism. Facebook belatedly took some steps. After a few days, it flagged the video as problematic and offered users links to fact checks if they wanted to go there instead of to see the video itself. They also say they're not journalists.
They say, we are a social media platform. We want to connect people and allow them to talk. They are in the business of conveying content. And in that content is journalism and news and true information. And at the same time, they're very nervous about exercising that. And part of that is just the scope of what they wanted to do.
Mark Zuckerberg, the founder, CEO, recently boasted of how many billions of fake accounts they wiped out. But new studies reported on by BuzzFeed suggest actually they've done that. But also, there are more fake accounts on Facebook than ever. So it's an internal process in which they are eternally behind the curve in trying to catch up with things.
KING: And given the media landscape, it's probably not as easy as just saying Facebook should be more aggressive in taking these videos down, right?
FOLKENFLIK: Well, I think Facebook is incapable, really, of doing what it needs to do to show that it's a responsible steward of this. And there are those who say, look, there are First Amendment issues here. And do we want free speech calls being made by people in Silicon Valley, whose fundamental obligation is not to the citizen but their shareholders, who ultimately have a bottom-line profit motive to try to ensure we're fully engaged every minute they can get us to be so?
KING: NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. Thanks, David.
FOLKENFLIK: You bet.

10 Missouri Inmates Receive Associate Degrees From Washington University : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727460014/10-missouri-inmates-receive-associate-degrees-from-washington-university,"Washington University in St. Louis graduated its first class of people serving prison terms, thanks to a partnership with Missouri Eastern Correctional Center.
NOEL KING, HOST:
In Missouri last week, there was a graduation ceremony.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
All the typical things you would expect for the graduation - you know, caps and gowns and a stage and even a brass band - but this ceremony was different.
HARVEY GALLER: This is definitely not an educational environment in here. So we're up against a lot.
KING: In here is the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center in Pacific, Mo. Harvey Galler is incarcerated there. We talked to him on the phone about his graduation. He told us that he and nine other incarcerated men crossed the stage and got their associates degrees from Washington University in St. Louis.
GALLER: It was just so surreal. It was just like, I can't believe this is me that's doing this right now. I can't believe that we've done this.
KING: Galler says before he went to prison, education was not on his mind.
GALLER: I was living on the street, shooting heroin. You know, I was stealing from stores to support myself. Of course, I wasn't - this wasn't on my mind.
INSKEEP: Galler says that Washington University's prison education program provided him and his fellow inmates an opportunity. In order to earn their degree, the men had to complete 20 courses across disciplines while serving time.
GALLER: Being able to actually, like, sit in the same room with these professors that treat us like we're no less than any other student, that means a lot.
KING: Galler and his classmates were the program's first graduating class.
GALLER: It's going to open up a lot of doors for me. So you know, when I get out, I'm not just going to be one of those other individuals that came into prison and sat here and just warehoused for five years; I actually came in here and did something with my life. I changed myself.
INSKEEP: So he says when he gets out of prison, he's going to continue his education at Washington University and, eventually, he hopes, get a master's in social work.

Living In 'Songland': Reality Behind NBC's New Reality Show,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/726538847/life-in-songland-the-reality-behind-nbcs-new-reality-show,"May 28, 2019 5:00 AM ET Marissa R. Moss NBC/NBC NBC/NBC
""My parents have no idea what I do,"" says Shane McAnally, calling from the airport in Los Angeles as he shuffles between his many duties: as a Grammy-winning songwriter, producer and now co-host of NBC's Songland , a new musical competition show from the producers of The Voice that judges songs, not those who sing them. McAnally's mom and dad aren't alone in being a bit confused. The job of a songwriter is likely one of the most important and the least understood in the entire craft of music – and, these days, one of the most proportionately underpaid. All that said, probably not an immediate homerun for compelling TV.
But that's exactly why McAnally, who has written with the likes of Kacey Musgraves and Sam Hunt, signed on to Songland four years ago, without seeing much more than a preliminary concept. Though he's based in Nashville, a town that recognizes the songwriter more than perhaps anywhere on earth, McAnally still was mystified by how low on the totem pole of appreciation they actually are. And in today's climate, where songwriters are now positioned as anonymous faces in the fight for fair compensation against some of the world's most powerful media corporations – Spotify, Google and Amazon, to name a few – McAnally thought that could simply no longer stand.
McAnally, Ryan Tedder (lead singer of OneRepublic and Grammy-winning producer for Beyoncé, Adele and Taylor Swift) and Ester Dean (a Grammy-nominated songwriter and producer for Rihanna and Nicki Minaj) comprise the judging panel on Songland , premiering tonight at 10 p.m. ET. The concept is pretty simple: a songwriter pitches a piece of work they've created to the panel along with a guest artist, from the Jonas Brothers to Meghan Trainor to Kelsea Ballerini, who will then cut and release that song after it's massaged in a workshop setting. On this evening's premiere, piano man John Legend is on deck.
Not long into tonight's premiere, Tedder will pose a question to Tebby Burrows, one of the contestants. She's a Bahamian-born songwriter who lives in Miami, and is offering up a message-driven tune called ""We Need Love"" that she hopes Legend will choose. It's a big step up from the usual process of just shuffling a demo tape around – but, again, that's not exactly thrilling television.
""Do you make money as a songwriter?"" Tedder asks her.
The answer, like many in her position, is no. Burrows describes herself as ""a little bit like Clark Kent,"" working a marketing job during the day and gigging at night more for passion than profit. She's likely not alone. It's not easy to make a comfortable, or even passable, living as a songwriter. A first deal at an independent publisher, if a writer is lucky enough to snag one, barely equates to minimum wage, leaving ""successful"" songwriters to find a second revenue stream. Therein lies the rub. ""To be successful, it pretty much has to take 100% of your attention,"" says Abe Stoklasa, a songwriter (Chris Lane's ""Fix,"" Charles Kelly's ""The Driver"") who says his first publishing deal was worth $15,000 a year. And that's with no health insurance, either, which isn't customarily offered to songwriters through their publisher or performance rights organization (""PRO"") such as ASCAP or BMI. 'Songwriters Are Not Treated Fairly': Nile Rodgers On Streaming's Present And Future
Tedder agrees. Though his finances are no longer a worry, he admits on the premiere of Songland that he used to work at Pottery Barn, back when he couldn't afford furniture himself. He hopes that Songland helps songwriters in both direct and indirect ways: that the contestants, even if they don't win their respective episode, can use the visibility to score publishing deals or syncs (where a song is used for film or television), and that the public at large – and even some in the industry — might start to value songwriters as more than just a name on the back of a CD. But even if they do snag a publishing deal, is the path lucrative if their songs don't hit ""Old Town Road"" or ""High Hopes"" proportions?
""If a guy working in the mailroom of Sony comes across the next Beyoncé, he gets more notoriety for discovering that artist than the songwriter that writes the song that becomes that artist's hit,"" says Tedder. ""Not only are we on the bottom of the food chain, the way the payment structure is set up, we get paid the least. And with streaming, that income has dropped drastically.""
Indeed, things have gotten a lot more difficult for songwriters of late. It takes a massive hit for a songwriter to substantially profit from streaming services. And in the past two years, songwriters have been engaging in a score of battles, from lobbying to see the songwriter-focused Music Modernization Act signed into law – which it was, unanimously , last year — to fighting Spotify, Google, Amazon and SiriusXM/Pandora as they attempt to appeal a 2018 ruling that would substantially increase songwriter and publisher revenue. Both have been a struggle, in part because songwriters aren't generally celebrities, and it's a lot easier to garner support for a cause when there's a recognizable face at the helm. In $43 Million Settlement, Spotify Forced To Confront A Persistent Problem
Songwriting used to be a much more lucrative profession before the streaming era, and not just because of royalties. In a singles-centric landscape that is responding to rapidly declining album sales, that means fewer chances for a songwriter to even land a cut to begin with, let alone a radio hit. And with more and more writers collaborating on a track – a Kanye West song can have fifteen – that means a proportionally smaller share of any royalties. ""Back in the day, you could make millions from album cuts, and then just retire to the Bahamas,"" says Tedder. ""You could have the fourth or fifth single on a Maroon 5 record. These days, if you don't have the next single, with a release date in writing, you have nothing. All that to say, it's not an easy time to be a songwriter.""
Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics is one such writer happily (and literally) living in the Bahamas – though retired he is not. Stewart conceived Songland with Emmy Award-winning producer Audrey Morrissey ( The Voice ) and director Ivan Dudynsky, with Maroon 5's Adam Levine as an executive producer. Stewart came up with the seeds of the idea on a trip to Nashville. ""Nashville always stuck to this songwriting thing, and I just thought there should be a show to explore that,"" he says. ""It's not looking behind the curtains. It's like looking behind many curtains.""
Stewart's right – the songwriting world is indeed shrouded in mystery. Truth is, the life of a songwriter is much more regimented than one might imagine, publishing deal or no. ""Most write every day at 11 a.m.,"" says Stoklasa. ""Some do two times a day. When I am super motivated, I am writing five days a week."" All the while, for many, running a second shift to help pay the bills. ""I worked at night at a nursing home, and then I would go to the studio,"" says Dean.

NBC/Trae Patton/NBC
The technicalities of a songwriter's life don't quite make their way onto Songland , but there is some jargon: Tedder, working with a contestant, talks about the number of beats, and terms like tempo and pre-chorus work their way into the criticism. Tedder wasn't worried that this type of language might scare people off — after all, plenty have learned what a sous-vide is from watching Iron Chef . ""We know what kind of knife Jiro [Ono] uses to make his sushi, but we don't know Bernie Taupin wrote the lyrics for Elton John,"" says Tedder.
On Iron Chef and the like, however, the goal is to be as creative as possible, to wow the panel with an inspired use of mushroom here, a savvy twist on ice cream there. On most musical competition shows... perhaps not so much. Original material has long been taboo on programs like American Idol – it occasionally pops in during the audition phase, but it's generally frowned upon in favor of sport-singing successful hits.
Catie Offerman, a Nashville-based singer-songwriter, remembers trying out for American Idol when she was just 15. For the audition, she performed a song she wrote herself.
""When I finished, the judge looked at me said, 'don't ever come back and f sing an original song again,'"" she says. ""Honestly, that put everything into perspective for me."" Offerman is not on Songland , but she has run the gamut when it comes to reality programming, making it to Hollywood on Idol years from that first audition but dropping out before she could get any further.
""Talent goes way beyond how many notes someone can sing,"" she says. ""When I watch Idol , it doesn't speak to me. I would rather turn on a show and see someone who can't sing but has something to say. And having something to say is way more important than hitting a bunch of octaves.""
Without that vocal showboating, does Songland actually have anything to stand on? Turns out, the process itself is pretty entertaining – but that owes a lot to the panel themselves, and not just the songwriters. It's impressive to see Legend take a song and instantly shift the mood with a slower melody, or to see McAnally, Dean and Tedder make small but insightful snap suggestions that transform a nice tune into a possible hit. Like with most musical competition shows, the judges are the real stars, which falls pretty closely in line with how being a songwriter usually goes: hand the material over, watch it shine in the hands of another and then sit back and wait for your (inconsequential, in the case of streaming) royalties.
""You can be fifth place on the Voice and still be more famous than the most famous songwriter,"" says Tedder. ""It's time for songwriters to have a voice. We will be a lot harder to ignore once we do."" Facebook "

Sometimes, a Tiny Desk is just meant to be. NPR Music's Bobby Carter and I have been checking for Lucky Daye since last year when we dubbed him one of the "" Kings of R&B ."" Then, after seeing Lucky perform live in Washington D.C., we knew his charisma and control, even for a new name, would translate well to the Tiny Desk. The same week we saw him live for the first time, we knew he was ready for the challenge.
Hailing from New Orleans and inheriting a love of sticky, bass-bumping funk early on, Lucky wanted to bring the full flavor of his debut album, Painted to NPR. So he brought along a 10-person band, including a quartet of horns, and his go-to producer Dernst ""D'Mile"" Emile II on bass. Like the record, which incorporates bouncy pop, a light, wallowing nod to jazz and show-stopping soul (notice the dramatic pause of the beat during the final song, ""Late Night""), Lucky took the vibe of the Tiny Desk from chill to rowdy within the span of 15 minutes. He even let the audience in on a secret: ""I've never performed that song in front of anyone with a band,"" he said, trying to laugh off mid-set jitters and bask in the moment. ""This is amazing, y'all. I'm really grateful.""

""Not only are we on the bottom of the food chain, the way the payment structure is set up, we get paid the least. And with streaming, that income has dropped drastically.""
The Record In $43 Million Settlement, Spotify Forced To Confront A Persistent Problem Indeed, things have gotten a lot more difficult for songwriters of late. It takes a massive hit for a songwriter to substantially profit from streaming services. And in the past two years, songwriters have been engaging in a score of battles, from lobbying to see the songwriter-focused Music Modernization Act signed into law – which it was, unanimously , last year — to fighting Spotify, Google, Amazon and SiriusXM/Pandora as they attempt to appeal a 2018 ruling that would substantially increase songwriter and publisher revenue. Both have been a struggle, in part because songwriters aren't generally celebrities, and it's a lot easier to garner support for a cause when there's a recognizable face at the helm.
Songwriting used to be a much more lucrative profession before the streaming era, and not just because of royalties. In a singles-centric landscape that is responding to rapidly declining album sales, that means fewer chances for a songwriter to even land a cut to begin with, let alone a radio hit. And with more and more writers collaborating on a track – a Kanye West song can have fifteen – that means a proportionally smaller share of any royalties. ""Back in the day, you could make millions from album cuts, and then just retire to the Bahamas,"" says Tedder. ""You could have the fourth or fifth single on a Maroon 5 record. These days, if you don't have the next single, with a release date in writing, you have nothing. All that to say, it's not an easy time to be a songwriter.""
Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics is one such writer happily (and literally) living in the Bahamas – though retired he is not. Stewart conceived Songland with Emmy Award-winning producer Audrey Morrissey ( The Voice ) and director Ivan Dudynsky, with Maroon 5's Adam Levine as an executive producer. Stewart came up with the seeds of the idea on a trip to Nashville. ""Nashville always stuck to this songwriting thing, and I just thought there should be a show to explore that,"" he says. ""It's not looking behind the curtains. It's like looking behind many curtains.""

NBC/Trae Patton/NBC Stewart's right – the songwriting world is indeed shrouded in mystery. Truth is, the life of a songwriter is much more regimented than one might imagine, publishing deal or no. ""Most write every day at 11 a.m.,"" says Stoklasa. ""Some do two times a day. When I am super motivated, I am writing five days a week."" All the while, for many, running a second shift to help pay the bills. ""I worked at night at a nursing home, and then I would go to the studio,"" says Dean.
The technicalities of a songwriter's life don't quite make their way onto Songland , but there is some jargon: Tedder, working with a contestant, talks about the number of beats, and terms like tempo and pre-chorus work their way into the criticism. Tedder wasn't worried that this type of language might scare people off — after all, plenty have learned what a sous-vide is from watching Iron Chef . ""We know what kind of knife Jiro [Ono] uses to make his sushi, but we don't know Bernie Taupin wrote the lyrics for Elton John,"" says Tedder.
On Iron Chef and the like, however, the goal is to be as creative as possible, to wow the panel with an inspired use of mushroom here, a savvy twist on ice cream there. On most musical competition shows... perhaps not so much. Original material has long been taboo on programs like American Idol – it occasionally pops in during the audition phase, but it's generally frowned upon in favor of sport-singing successful hits.
Catie Offerman, a Nashville-based singer-songwriter, remembers trying out for American Idol when she was just 15. For the audition, she performed a song she wrote herself.
""When I finished, the judge looked at me said, 'don't ever come back and f*"

Iraq Sentences 4 French ISIS Fighters To Death,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727460028/iraq-sentences-4-french-isis-fighters-to-death,"Four French ISIS fighters are among the dozen French citizens transferred to Iraqi custody from Syria. They're illustrating a huge problem over the trials of ISIS fighters.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
We have some news from Iraq now. That country has sentenced six members of ISIS to death. All six are French. They're among a dozen French citizens transferred into Iraqi custody after they were captured in Syria as ISIS collapsed. Their case illustrates a big problem with the trials of former ISIS fighters. NPR's Jane Arraf has the story.
JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: The men left France to fight for and live under ISIS in Syria. Their journey ended in a Baghdad courtroom, sentenced to hang under Iraq's sweeping anti-terrorism laws. The prisoner sentenced on Monday, Mustafa Mohammed Ibrahim, told the judge he was brainwashed when he joined ISIS four years ago. He said he was struggling in France. And ISIS promised him work, a house and a job. Iraqi law means you can be sentenced to death just for joining a terrorist organization, even if you never carried out a violent act. The judge sentenced him to hang.
Another defendant said he had been tortured into a confession and lifted up his shirt to show scars. The judge postponed his sentencing. Human Rights Watch says torture is common to obtain confessions, which are then used to issue the death penalty.
This is Belkis Wille from Human Rights Watch by phone from Beirut.
BELKIS WILLE: The trials of ISIS suspects in Iraq are fundamentally unfair. We say this based on sitting through many of these trials over the last two years. And what we see is that defendants do not get any of their basic due process rights granted to them under international law, as well as under Iraqi law. There is absolutely no presumption of innocence when they walk into the courtroom. And many times, defendants are alleging that they have been tortured.
ARRAF: France doesn't have a death penalty. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said it would relay its opposition to sentencing the men to death. But it also said it respected Iraqi jurisdiction. The men were handed over by Kurdish Syrian forces to Iraq because the alleged crimes were committed in Iraq and Syria.
Like other European countries, France doesn't want to bring back its citizens to put them on trial at home. They worry it would be much harder to get witnesses and evidence there and that the accused fighters could go free. It's left Kurdish Syrian forces - U.S. allies - holding 1,200 foreign fighters captured in northeast Syria and facing a huge problem.
The head of external relations there, Abdulkarim Omar, is calling for countries to create an international tribunal.
ABDULKARIM OMAR: (Through interpreter) The crimes happened in this area. And also, the witnesses, proofs and evidence are in this area. That's why it is our right, based on international laws, to be sentenced in this area.
ARRAF: Sweden is convening a meeting next week to try to get more European support for a tribunal, possibly in Iraq. In Syria, I spoke to a counter-terrorism expert, American psychologist Anne Speckhard, about why so many Europeans joined. She said some joined the call to help Muslims in Syria, while others...
ANNE SPECKHARD: Wanted to escape problems in their lives. Some people thought that they were going to a utopia, where their housing would be provided. They'd have a job. They'd live in a true Islamic state. And some people were just really sick of living under discrimination.
ARRAF: She says she believes a lot of them can be rehabilitated, but that's not a common view. The Iraqi government is putting more accused French ISIS fighters on trial this week.

2 Killed During Stabbing Attack In Japan,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727460021/2-killed-during-stabbing-attack-in-japan,"A group of school children in Kawasaki were waiting for a bus when a man allegedly stabbed more than a dozen people. The suspect is in custody, but the motive for the attack is unknown.
NOEL KING, HOST:
It was just before 8 o'clock in the morning in a quiet residential neighborhood outside of Tokyo. A group of schoolchildren was waiting for a bus when a man armed with a knife in each hand attacked them. Two people died, including an 11-year-old girl. More than a dozen other people were injured. NPR's Anthony Kuhn has been following this story. He's on the line with me now from outside of the school the children attended. Hi, Anthony.
ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Good morning.
KING: I know that you just got a briefing this morning. What do we know about this attack?
KUHN: Yeah. I'm right outside the school. We just came out of a briefing with school officials, and there was a schoolteacher with the kids as they were lining up in the morning. And he said that the attacker came from behind the kids as they were lining up, and that's why they didn't really have time to flee. We know that one of the fatalities, an 11-year-old girl, is a sixth - and a sixth-grader. And another fatality was apparently a parent, a man in his 30s, who was an employee of Japan's Foreign Ministry.
KING: Anthony, do we know anything about the attacker's motivation, or is it just too early?
KUHN: Well, the attacker came with a knife in each hand. And after the attack, he turned the knives on himself. And police detained him, but he died. So what we heard at the briefing at the school is that nobody knows who this man is. There is no known connection that he has to the school. And nobody has any idea why he did this. No clear motivation.
KING: So a lot of questions yet to be answered. And as we said, you are in a town outside of Tokyo. Is violence common in this region, especially this kind of violence?
KUHN: No. It's most uncommon. It's unthinkable in a region like this. This is a city called Kawasaki on the outskirts of Tokyo. It's a little bit less than an hour from the city center by train ride. And people live here because it's cheaper than the city center. There are students. There are factories out here. It's an incredibly quiet and peaceful residential neighborhood. And Japan, Tokyo, are extremely safe and quiet places to live, for the most part. There is very little violent crime. Guns are very, very few here.
And so this kind of murder is really unthinkable. And clearly, just hearing the emotion in the voices of the teachers and the school authorities who spoke to us, people are clearly very shaken by this incident.
KING: Given how unusual this kind of violence is, how are people in this area responding? What are they saying and doing?
KUHN: Well, as I was waiting to get into the school, parents started filing in. And they were all dressed in dark suits and dresses, and you could hear their feet clicking on the sidewalk. And people's faces were very tense, and they had to run, go through a big crowd of journalists to get there. So it's a very difficult moment for people here. Obviously, not a lot of people want to talk about it. I did speak to a resident here and there, and they just found this really unimaginable for such a quiet place.
KING: Such a tragedy. NPR's Anthony Kuhn in Japan. Anthony, thank you.
KUHN: You're welcome.

Levees in Tulsa, Okla., are being tested as the Arkansas River swells to a level not seen in decades. Mayor G.T. Bynum tells NPR's Steve Inskeep that the city is preparing for more bad weather.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Residents of some neighborhoods in Tulsa, Okla., received a warning - be prepared to evacuate if the levees don't hold. Some parts of the city are already flooded, with parking garages and streets and large buildings filling with water. Massive storms have filled the Arkansas River, and Tulsa's levees have not held back this much water in decades. We haven't even mentioned Oklahoma's tornadoes. Days ago, Mayor G.T. Bynum of Tulsa shared a photo on social media. It showed Oklahoma's governor visiting the city's emergency operations center and leading people with bowed heads in prayer. Mayor Bynum is on the line from Tulsa.
Good morning, sir.
GT BYNUM: Good morning.
INSKEEP: You must get up first thing in the morning and ask how the levees are doing.
BYNUM: That is the first thing that I ask our team every morning when I see them.
INSKEEP: So what have you been hearing?
BYNUM: Overnight, they continue to operate the way they were designed. We're very fortunate. These are 70-year-old-plus earthen levees that were constructed in the '40s. And they have - while they've had higher water levels on them, that high-water level was for about 12 hours. We are looking at probably a week to 10 days of levels at this - this levee system has just never been tested the way it is right now.
INSKEEP: Because of the sheer extent - the amount of water that's having to be released from dams upstream, the amount of water that's raining and everything else.
BYNUM: That's exactly right.
INSKEEP: Although, we should mention some parts of your city have not been protected, right?
BYNUM: That's correct. This is the area west of downtown Tulsa in lower-lying areas. There are areas of higher elevation that don't have levees that are - we have a river park system that runs through our city that serves as a kind of buffer, if you will, for elevating water levels. And that's taking the brunt through much of our city of these increased water levels.
INSKEEP: How much damage is there, so far as you can tell?
BYNUM: Well, you really can't - we really won't know until the water goes back down. We've been very fortunate that, until recently, we really didn't have any structures inside the city of Tulsa damaged and, thankfully, not many injuries. We've had two people - two that we assume, at this point, fatalities. We don't know how they ended up in the river, but we haven't been able to find them. But overall, the system was designed to protect people from that river. And it's working the way it's supposed to in that regard.
INSKEEP: Mayor, I'm really interested to hear you talk about the design of the city - to try to be resilient in a situation like this. You mentioned the levees. You mentioned strategically located and designed parks that are designed to absorb water. There's a lot of talk elsewhere in today's program here about preparations for disaster as they become more common with climate change. People are asking if Paradise, Calif., could've been more properly prepared for fire, for example, or Puerto Rico for hurricanes.
Leading up to this crisis, did Tulsa have all of the resources that it needed?
BYNUM: We have spent decades preparing for this event, and so as the mayor who happens to be in office at this time, I'm just filled with gratitude. Tulsa, being next to a river, it was not unaccustomed to flooding. But you had generations of leaders in this community - one who saw that the levees were built, two that saw that we built a river park system along our river corridor that could absorb this flow. And it also is required in our building code that anything built along the river has to be one foot above the 100-year flood plain.
The problem is we're into that now. And so it would be a lot worse if we didn't have the leadership that we had in this community for decades to prepare for this moment. But the water continues to rise, and we have storms on the horizon.
INSKEEP: Yeah, so we can hope, but we don't know. We can hope that we're not talking to you about a major disaster in a few days. What do you need from the state and federal government beyond anything you may already be getting?
BYNUM: Well, I will say the support that we've received from the state and federal governments has just been extraordinary. As you mentioned, our governor, Kevin Stitt - he's been in our emergency operations center with us. President Trump was very quick to approve our emergency declarations so FEMA could assist us. We have National Guard personnel out walking those levees 24 hours a day to monitor their status, so the support we're receiving is just outstanding. And it's great to see everyone pulling together to protect the lives of the people in our community.
INSKEEP: Well, Mayor Bynum, maybe we'll check in with you again in a few days if you don't mind.
BYNUM: Thank you. That'd be great.
INSKEEP: Mayor G.T. Bynum spoke with us from Tulsa, Okla.
Thanks so much.

Why It's Time To Think About Self-Driving Cars In Regards To Parking,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727459993/why-its-time-to-think-about-self-driving-cars-in-regards-to-parking,"Self-driving cars may be great for those who don't want to own a car or get behind the wheel, but they promise to be a nightmare for parking enforcement.
RACHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: Self-driving cars are almost here. Or so we keep hearing from tech companies and their supporters. Some people swear these cars will revolutionize how traffic works. Others fear that more crashes are just around the corner. Few people, though, stop to ask about the implications for parking. To explain, we're joined by NPR's social science correspondent, Shankar Vedantam, who apparently is asking this question (laughter). So what's the deal, Shankar? What's the problem with self-driving cars and parking?
SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Well, on the surface, Rachel, we don't think of self-driving cars in the context of parking. But that's part of the problem. When we think about self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles, we usually think about using them to get someplace. We don't think about what happens once we get there.
MARTIN: Right.
VEDANTAM: I spoke to someone who has thought a lot about this. Here is Adam Millard-Ball at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
ADAM MILLARD-BALL: Autonomous cars can certainly easily evade a two-hour parking limit. They can just move themselves every two hours. They might even not have to pay the meter if they look and see whether an enforcement officer is coming.
MARTIN: What? Wait, can they do that? They can discern whether or not a law enforcement officer is coming?
VEDANTAM: It's not clear whether they'll have the AI to be able to discern whether a law enforcement officer is coming. But clearly, if they're self-driving cars, they don't actually have to park at all. They can drop you off at a restaurant while you go have lunch. And while they wait for you, instead of parking, they can simply drive around. Now, you might say that could be costly in terms of the amount of gas they would use.
MARTIN: Right, just inefficient.
VEDANTAM: Yes.
MARTIN: And, you know, carbon footprint, et cetera.
VEDANTAM: But there would be a way around that. Self-driving cars could create their own traffic jams.
MILLARD-BALL: And so in a place like downtown San Francisco that might be latching onto existing traffic jams, turning onto the most congested street every time they can make a turn or, more subtly, to try and find each other, to coordinate so you have this lazy river of slow moving cars that just want to drive as slowly as possible.
MARTIN: All these automated vehicles just, like, on slow cruise?
VEDANTAM: Exactly.
MARTIN: Making a traffic nightmare.
VEDANTAM: Precisely, and quiet residential streets could become a parking lot. In other words, you get dropped off at lunch at a restaurant downtown. And then your car drives itself to the nearest residential area to avoid paying for parking.
MARTIN: The cities aren't going to be happy because they're not going to get parking revenue, right?
VEDANTAM: Precisely. Millard-Ball's modeling experiments show that self-driving cars can effectively blur the line between parking and driving. Most cities currently charge drivers for leaving their vehicles on city streets, not for driving their vehicles on city streets. Because self-driving cars might drive around as a form of parking, Millard-Ball thinks that cities should move to create congestion pricing, as some big cities have done, where you get charged for the amount of time that your car spends on the road whether or not it's moving.
MARTIN: I mean, plus, wouldn't it just be a public nuisance? If you were living in one of these residential neighborhoods and you look outside and there's, like, some weird self-driving car just doing loops around your neighborhood, that's creepy.
VEDANTAM: Exactly, and Millard-Ball has done these modeling experiments in San Francisco. And he shows that San Francisco traffic is going to be even worse - hard though it could be to imagine - than it is today.
MARTIN: Oh, man. The future is coming, like it or not. Shankar Vedantam, he joins us regularly to talk about social science research. You can listen to more of his work on the podcast that he hosts. It is called Hidden Brain. Thanks, Shankar.
VEDANTAM: Thanks, Rachel.

A Fiat Chrysler Merger With Renault Would Create 3rd Biggest Car Maker,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727459979/a-fiat-chrysler-merger-with-renault-would-create-3rd-biggest-car-maker,"French car maker Renault is considering a merger proposal from Fiat Chrysler, which has been looking for a partner for a while — and there are limited partners available.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Fiat Chrysler is proposing a merger with the French automaker Renault. Renault says it's considering it. This merger would be a big deal. It would create the world's third biggest car company after Toyota and Volkswagen. Here's NPR's Camila Domonoske.
CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: A merger this big would be striking but not totally surprising.
MICHELLE KREBS: Fiat Chrysler has been looking for a partner for a while, and there are limited partners available.
DOMONOSKE: Michelle Krebs is an analyst with Autotrader and Cox Automotive. She says meanwhile, the French Renault had a longstanding alliance with the Japanese automaker Nissan. That was working well...
KREBS: ...And then things went awry when the former CEO, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested in Japan for alleged financial misdeeds. And things have just been unraveling.
DOMONOSKE: Now, both Fiat and Renault are eyeing their options when it comes to who they'll partner with as they prepare for big changes in the industry. Many major automakers have already been partnering up over the last couple of years. There are two reasons.
First, after years of record growth, the auto industry is starting to slow down. And that decline is expected to continue, meaning fewer car sales, less revenue. At the same time, automakers need to be making big investments in the future - things like electric vehicles and self-driving cars.
MARK WAKEFIELD: And it's a tough one because you're investing in something that isn't profitable today, isn't going to be profitable tomorrow but might be profitable - it might be existential in 10 years' time.
DOMONOSKE: Mark Wakefield is an automotive consultant at AlixPartners. Upstart companies, like Tesla and even ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, they're bringing new competition. In response, established carmakers are...
WAKEFIELD: Closing ranks towards each other to be able to share costs and to be able to invest through this cycle. That's really what's driving a lot of these merger discussions and partnership discussions, too.
DOMONOSKE: Renault has been making electric vehicles for years, while Fiat Chrysler has been lagging behind. It's decided to focus on moneymaking brands, like Jeep and Ram, big pickups and SUVs. Plus, it has premium brands, like Maserati. Renault is pushing smaller low-cost vehicles. Fiat Chrysler thrives in the Americas, particularly in the United States. Renault doesn't sell cars in North America at all. But it's a major player in Europe and Russia.
That all sounds like a pretty good fit. One has small cars, and the other big trucks. One offers luxury vehicles, the other goes downmarket. But...
FELIPE MUNOZ: They still have a big problem, which is China.
DOMONOSKE: Felipe Munoz is an analyst at auto researcher JATO Dynamics. He says neither company has a foothold in the crucial Chinese market. Then there are the practical problems of merging.
MUNOZ: And adding another culture, another - more factories...
DOMONOSKE: That's more people to teach to work together, which Fiat Chrysler has to do already, since the merger that made it back in 2014.
MUNOZ: Fiat and Chrysler, which are Italians and Americans that are doing well, yes. But it's not an easy thing.
DOMONOSKE: And it would be even harder if you try to preserve the French Renault's alliance with Nissan of Japan. Another complication, Renault is part owned by the French government and has strong unions. They'll want to preserve local jobs. Fiat Chrysler says the deal, if it happens, would not result in any plant closures.

The First State Trial Of The Opioid Epidemic Is About To Begin,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727459972/the-first-state-trial-of-the-opioid-epidemic-is-about-to-begin,"On Tuesday, the first trial of an opioid manufacturer is scheduled to begin in Norman, Okla. Johnson & Johnson is accused of selling highly addictive drugs using deceptive marketing practices.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Oklahoma's attorney general blames a pharmaceutical firm for the deaths of thousands of people. Starting today that company, Johnson & Johnson, has its time in court. It's the first major lawsuit to go to trial challenging a drug company for its role in the opioid crisis. Jackie Fortier is on the line. She's a reporter for StateImpact Oklahoma and has been covering this case for NPR.
Good morning.
JACKIE FORTIER, BYLINE: Good morning.
INSKEEP: What does Oklahoma want?
FORTIER: Well, I mean, really, they're looking for funding. They're looking for as much money as possible, as quickly as possible. I talked with Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, and he's the one who brought the lawsuit. And he told me that taking these companies to court is really the only way the state can fund opioid treatment. I mean, you've got to keep in mind that Oklahoma has the second-highest uninsured rate in the nation. The state hasn't expanded Medicaid. State legislators have really slashed public health funding in recent years. So add on top of that the huge opioid addiction crisis, and you've got very few facilities, and they're almost always full.
INSKEEP: So I'm thinking this through from Johnson & Johnson's perspective. I guess if you're a business, you want to kind of get your liabilities, you know, in a predictable - into a predictable place, which might help explain why a couple of other big companies, pharmaceutical companies, settled their lawsuits with the state of Oklahoma. But Johnson & Johnson is going ahead. Why did they not settle the way that other companies have?
FORTIER: Well, I think Johnson & Johnson, you know, from the court documents, really thinks that they have a different type of case. I mean, they produced a Fentanyl patch. They didn't produce something like Purdue Pharma did, which is the opioid OxyContin. They think that they don't necessarily have the same type of market share that Purdue Pharma or even Teva Pharmaceuticals did, both of whom have now settled with the state.
INSKEEP: Well, this is really interesting. Then what is the case by the state of Oklahoma that Johnson & Johnson ought to be included with the other companies that did other things?
FORTIER: Well, I mean, Oklahoma AG Hunter is saying that anyone, really, who sold, you know, opioids in the state is liable. I mean, the court documents that we've - that we have seen so far is that the state is accusing them of these really aggressive, you know, opioid marketing campaigns in a way that overstated the effectiveness and, you know, misinterpreted the addiction risk. But the really interesting thing, like, about this case is that we'll finally get to see the evidence. We haven't been able to see that before. So this trial is going to bring to light, you know, documents and testimony that show what Johnson & Johnson knew, when they knew it and, key, how they responded.
INSKEEP: So you mentioned that the state of Oklahoma needs money here to deal with the crisis. Has Mike Hunter said how this money would be spent if his side were to win?
FORTIER: Well, I mean, we're kind of seeing that already. There was $270 million that Purdue Pharma settled with the state for, and that is going to go to build a treatment center in Tulsa, which is kind of in its preliminary stages right now. He said in the past that the money will go towards treatment. With the Teva Pharmaceutical settlement, a certain portion of that, 85 million, is also going to go towards treatment. But we don't know how much right now.
INSKEEP: What if Oklahoma loses?
FORTIER: Well, if Oklahoma loses then the state is going to have to come up with a lot of money to help pay for the thousands of people who still need addiction treatment. You know, the state's strategy is really going to be closely watched because there's all these upcoming cases, including the large one in Ohio. And, you know, Oklahoma decided to go it alone and won't get anything if, for example, they win the Ohio case.
INSKEEP: Jackie, thanks.
FORTIER: Thank you.
INSKEEP: That's Jackie Fortier. She is a reporter with StateImpact Oklahoma.

Morning News Brief,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727459962/morning-news-brief,"Destructive tornadoes touched down in Ohio overnight. A lesson from a California wildfire: aid may need to come before a disaster strikes. And, four French ISIS fighters have been sentenced to death.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Tornadoes hit Dayton, Ohio, and the surrounding areas last night.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Several million people lost power. We know of flattened homes and overturned cars and roofless structures. And Jake Ryle of WCPO TV says that's just what was visible in the dark.
JAKE RYLE: We're probably going to see a much larger extent of damage once the sun rises here. But right now, I mean, fire crews are doing a pretty good job of just lighting the way.
KING: We're on the line now with Ryle's colleague Evan Millward. He's in Cincinnati. Hi, Evan.
EVAN MILLWARD: Hello. Good morning.
KING: Good morning to you. So these tornadoes hit after the sun had gone down, which always makes it harder to tell what happened, what the extent of the damage is. What do we know?
MILLWARD: Well, yeah. That sure makes it scary because you can't see it. Right?
KING: Yeah.
MILLWARD: What we don't need the sun to tell us is that even now, here in the 5 a.m., hour there are some 60,000 people without power. And we know that this was kind of - it wasn't even kind of - it was a one-two punch. There were two tornado-warned storms that happened one, literally, right after the other...
KING: Wow.
MILLWARD: ...That came through almost the same path, that started northwest of Dayton and dropped right close to downtown and then moved into the neighboring county. And the length of this is what's really incredible that we've been able to piece together. There's a high school with a roof off northwest of Dayton. I-75 cuts right through the center of downtown Dayton, and they were using snowplows to clear debris on I-75 last night.
KING: Oh, wow.
MILLWARD: And east of town, we're seeing the same telltale signs of walls blown out of businesses, homes that look like someone opened up a doll house because they're missing walls.
KING: Dayton is in western Ohio. Are tornadoes common there? Are people prepared for something like this?
MILLWARD: I would say people know how to handle it in western Ohio. They - you get tornado-warned storms every season. And you know, I grew up here in - actually in one of the affected towns this go-around. Something like this is highly unusual, though.
KING: Some parts of the country that have been hit hard by weather this week are expecting more. I wonder, do you have a sense of what the forecast is there?
MILLWARD: I know that areas north of Dayton were already included in that. They were waiting for - or forecasted to get more potentially severe storms. And there was another tornado that - what they believe will be a tornado - and I think it is the worst damage in the Dayton area - is about an hour north of Dayton. It was a separate cell...
KING: Wow.
MILLWARD: ...And it went to a town called Celina, which is right on Grand Lake St. Mary's. And that part - Auglaize County is up there, and they're expected to get, really, the brunt of the severe possibility the rest of the week.
KING: And I imagine next is the cleanup - just briefly.
MILLWARD: Yeah, yeah. And I think now they're - they've had their chance to go through. And they're still - they've got Ohio Task Force 1 on the ground; they're Dayton-based anyway. But that just means that they've had to pull in from Cincinnati and Columbus because their guys are working in their own fire departments. But they're in helping with search and rescue as of about an hour or two ago.
KING: Evan Millward in Cincinnati from WCPO. Thanks, Evan.
MILLWARD: No problem. Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
KING: All right. We have been told to expect the possibility of more disasters like this as the climate changes, and that is prompting more serious thought about how to get ready.
INSKEEP: Congress is considering a bill that would send $19 billion in aid to places that have suffered tornadoes, flooding, hurricanes, fires. The money is meant to help communities like Puerto Rico or Paradise, Calif. You likely recall the fire that killed 85 people and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures. Now Paradise gets some help rebuilding. But here's a question - could it have been cheaper to spend more money in advance preparing for disaster?
KING: NPR's Kirk Siegler has been covering Paradise for the past six months. Good morning, Kirk.
KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel.
KING: All right. To Steve's question - you've been talking to experts in disaster recovery, what are they telling you about paying for this response in Paradise?
SIEGLER: Well, that it's going up and up and the federal government shoulders most of the tab for these disasters. And we're getting more and more of them; they're getting more and more expensive. And experts are saying we're soon going to reach the breaking point if we don't change. So let me just give you a window into the Camp Fire since I've been covering it. And you know, just removing the debris - the cleanup - that's estimated to be $1.7 billion...
KING: Wow.
SIEGLER: ...So - yeah - so far. These are the costs that are that are going up - Small Business Administration disaster loans, the government has paid out 370 million or so; $85 million in emergency FEMA aid for this largely lower-income community that was displaced by the fire. And you know, there are so many people relying on this aid, as you can imagine. Among them is a man named Chris Beaudis.
I met him outside his FEMA trailer at a campground north of where I am. He lost everything in the fire. He had no insurance. But he's super grateful, so let's listen to him.
CHRIS BEAUDIS: FEMA's been great. I understand the process. It's kind of slow at times. But man, they've been overwhelmed, you know? There's more than just this disaster going on in the world.
KING: I mean, this is - with respect to FEMA, this is their job. Why are they overwhelmed, just too much happening?
SIEGLER: Right. Well, the federal government, largely, and our system is overwhelmed. You know, for decades, I mean, everything is pinned on FEMA typically during disaster. But it's much bigger than them.
You know, for decades, our disaster response and recovery system has been, you wait till something happens, and you go out and fix it. You respond. You clean up. You cut checks. And you make it as easy as possible for people who want to rebuild to do so in most cases, even in high-risk places. You know, this worked OK. We got pretty good at it, even, before we started getting this overwhelmed with this many storms, these many floods and fires and gaining in intensity.
Noel, one expert I've been talking to is Josh Sawislak. He was a climate resiliency adviser to President Obama. He told me the system is broken and badly needing an update in this era of climate change.
JOSH SAWISLAK: We're not going to be able to do that anymore. We're spending more and more money. It's going to get even worse. And climate change is going to force our hand to be smarter about how we do this.
SIEGLER: And Noel, I think the, you know, the bigger picture he's getting at is - should we be making it easier for people to rebuild in such high-risk places, including Paradise, Calif., or in hurricane zones in the South or places that always flood in the Midwest, just to give a few examples here?
KING: NPR's Kirk Siegler. Kirk, thanks so much.
SIEGLER: Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
KING: In a courtroom in Iraq, four members of ISIS were sentenced to death. The men came from France. And by all indications, France is ready to let them stay in Iraq.
INSKEEP: More French citizens have left their country to join ISIS than any other place in Europe. And these four ISIS members were among a dozen French citizens transferred to Iraqi custody from U.S. allies in Syria. France doesn't want them extradited back home. This is part of a larger story. There are hundreds of ISIS recruits from various nations who've been detained by U.S. allies, and there's no clear plan of what to do with them all.
KING: NPR's Jane Arraf has been following the story of these four men. She's in Iraq now. Hi, Jane.
JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi, Noel.
KING: So let's go back a ways. How did these four guys end up in an Iraqi courtroom?
ARRAF: So they were captured by Kurdish Syrian forces - U.S. allies. And they're being held by Kurdish Syrian forces, who are absolutely overwhelmed. They actually have 1,200 suspected foreign fighters...
KING: Wow.
ARRAF: ...In addition to the thousands of Syrians and Iraqis. Yeah. So they agreed to extradite some of them who had committed crimes - alleged to have committed crimes in Iraq. And among them were these 12 French citizens, so they are being put on trial this week. But here's the problem. There are significant problems with trials in Iraq in the terrorism courts.
Let's listen to a bit of what Human Rights Watch has to say - a researcher named Belkis Wille.
BELKIS WILLE: The trials of ISIS suspects in Iraq are fundamentally unfair. Defendants do not get any of their basic due process rights granted to them under international law, as well as under Iraqi law. There is absolutely no presumption of innocence when they walk into the courtroom. And many times, defendants are alleging that they have been tortured.
ARRAF: In fact, one of the men yesterday in the courtroom in Baghdad lifted up his shirt to show the judge scars. He said he had been tortured, so his trial is being postponed. But they have sentenced four others to death in the past two days, and there are more on trial this week.
KING: Well, this is a legally tricky question - and an interesting one - because France doesn't have the death penalty. But French officials say they're not going to stop Iraq from sentencing their citizens to death. What are the implications of that?
ARRAF: Yeah. That's interesting, right? So all of these European countries who have citizens there - and lots of citizens, almost 2,000 of them are believed to be French and then there're Germans and Swedes - they don't have the death penalty. But France has agreed to let its people be extradited to Iraq, which it knows does have the death penalty. So France issued a statement saying that it opposes the death penalty, it will remind Iraq of this, but it also recognizes Iraqi jurisdiction.
This is a huge problem for everyone because nobody knows what to do with these fighters. Their countries don't want to take them back, and the Kurds across the border say they just can't handle them.
KING: What problems are other governments facing specifically?
ARRAF: So the biggest problem is the administration in the Kurdish Syrian region of Syria; it's called Rojava. And it's not actually recognized as a region. So here you have these U.S. allies who fought against ISIS to defeat ISIS with the U.S. They lost something like 11,000 fighters, and they're not in a position to put all these people on trial. They're calling for international help for a tribunal but, so far, no takers. Sweden has proposed there be a tribunal. We're still waiting to see whether that will actually happen.
KING: NPR's Jane Arraf in Iraq.
Thanks, Jane.
ARRAF: Thank you.

toggle caption Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice Curators have organized a retrospective at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., to mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of Italian painter Jacopo Tintoretto. Above Tintoretto's The Creation of the Animals, painted circa 1550-1553.
Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice Legend has it that when Jacopo Tintoretto was 12 years old, he was so good at drawing that he rattled Titian — the master artist of Venice, 30 years his senior. Young Tintoretto was an apprentice in Titian's workshop and — as the story goes — the old master gone away for several days, and when he came back he found some of Tintoretto's drawings.
""He saw these drawings and said, 'Who did this?' "" explains art expert Frederick Ilchman. ""The young Tintoretto was nervous, thinking he'd done a bad job ... and was going to be corrected. No, they were not bad — in fact, they were too good.""

The Philadelphia Museum of Art/Art Resource, NY Titian felt threatened and kicked the kid out. But Tintoretto got all the lessons he needed in ambition and toughness — and went on to have a long, successful life in the art world.
That career is the focus of Tintoretto's very first U.S. retrospective, now on view at the National Gallery of Art , co-curated by Frederick Ilchman and Robert Echols. It marks the 500th anniversary of the 16th century Venetian artist's birth.
""He never saw a wall that he couldn't envision covered with a large Tintoretto,"" says Echols. The canvases are huge — jammed with hunky men (and some women) — writhing, and reaching, and rushing — in myths or Biblical scenes. Tintoretto painted them all over a ceiling of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice. It took ambition — and a lot of hustle.
In 1564, Tintoretto was one of four artists invited submit drawings for the grand building.
""Tintoretto doesn't have a drawing,"" says Ilchman. ""Instead, he has pulled aside from the ceiling a big piece of cardboard to show — the fully completed oil on canvas installed in its intended position.""
But wait, there's more: Tintoretto announces it's a donation, knowing full well that there are regulations that stipulate all gifts — large or small — must be accepted, Ilchman explains. It worked, and Tintoretto went on to do some 60 more paintings for the place.

National Gallery of Art Tintoretto competed for work all his life. In the 16th century, the cosmopolitan city of Venice was teeming with artists who had to fight to make a living. ""It was a cut-throat environment,"" Ilchman says. ""You had to paint quickly in order to get your commissions, in order to fill them.""
Over the years, Tintoretto became immensely successful. Eventually he got so many commissions he had to hire a vast number of assistants. They worked so fast that critics thought the pieces looked unfinished. And the commissions kept coming, even though Titian had tried to block them by blackballing his former apprentice. All the while, as the rivalry continued, both artists were painting their heavenly religious scenes.

toggle caption San Trovaso, Venice /National Gallery of Art But Tintoretto was putting his own spin on it. There's so much well-known ""Last Supper"" imagery — the apostles sitting in a row at the table, a serene Jesus in the center. Some 60 years after Leonardo da Vinci painted his famous Last Supper , Tintoretto puts the apostles in a blender and spins them around — and paints their reactions when Christ says one of them will betray him.
""Some of them are practically falling out of their chairs backwards,"" Echols says. ""Some of them are reaching forward, gesturing towards Christ. The painting is full of action, push, and pull, and drama. And this is typical of Tintoretto: His paintings are always dynamic — full of energy and action.""
They're cinematic. You can almost hear the soundtrack.
""Jean Paul Sartre the philosopher said that Tintoretto was the first film director,"" Echols adds.

Musée du Louvre, Paris/Art Resource, NY Speed, competition and success took its toll. You can see it for yourself in two self-portraits that bookend the retrospective at the National Gallery of Art. The first self-portrait, made when he was around 28, shows an intense, almost fierce Tintoretto — with dark curly hair, mustache and beard, he's glaring at viewers, demanding that we pay attention. The exhibit ends with another self-portrait, made when he was around 70; Tintoretto's hair and beard are white, and his stare is stony.
""The impetuous, aggressive, younger artist in that early self-portrait — now the fire has really gone out of his eyes,"" Echols says. ""He's now tired. He's had a very long career, he's been very successful, but boy, is he weary.""
Several of the artworks in the retrospective are coming to the U.S. for the first time. The exhibition is on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., until early July.

A century ago, stuff was expensive. Back then, people relied on nature to make things: Toothbrushes were made of silver, combs were made of tortoiseshell, and clothes were made of cotton (well, they still use a lot of cotton, but you get the point.)
Then, in 1907, a chemist named Leo Baekeland found a way to take the useless gunk leftover from making kerosene and turn it into plastic. It opened up a whole world of affordable products. Suddenly, everyone could get one of everything.
This is the story of how plastic was first made and how maybe we went too far with it.

Brexit Party Is A Tour De Force In European Parliament Elections : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727480363/brexit-party-is-a-tour-de-force-in-european-parliament-elections,"NPR's Noel King talks to Belinda De Lucy of the Brexit Party and a newly elected member of the European Parliament, and to John Peet, the Brexit editor at T he Economist magazine, about the election.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Over the weekend, the European Union held parliamentary elections. And Britain's governing Conservative Party and the main opposition party, Labour, got a shock. The Brexit Party, which is just 6 weeks old, won 29 of 73 seats available. That's more than any other party. Their political platform is for the U.K. to leave the European Union as soon as possible, even if it means without a Brexit agreement in place. Brexit Party is led by populist Nigel Farage. In a speech after the victory, Farage talked about the Brexit deadline, which, at the moment, is set for the end of October.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NIGEL FARAGE: If we don't leave on October 31, then the scores you've seen for the Brexit Party today will be repeated in a general election. And we are getting ready for it.
KING: I'm on the line with Belinda de Lucy. She's a newly elected member of the European Parliament, and she is a member of the Brexit Party.
Good morning.
BELINDA DE LUCY: Yes, good morning. Thank you for having me.
KING: This party was only established a few weeks ago. What compelled you to join it and to run?
DE LUCY: Well, to be honest, millions are politically homeless at the moment in the U.K. We voted in good faith in 2016 to leave the European Union. And we were promised that our decision would be implemented by our politicians. Unfortunately, they have failed to honor their pledge. And millions feel - they feel very let down. They feel betrayed, and they feel that their trust has been terribly misplaced in the two major parties.
And the Brexit Party is the only home - a natural home - for us all to go to. It's the only party that is intent on delivering Brexit in its fullness. And I'm very, very happy and grateful to Nigel for providing such a moderate, peaceful, positive and diverse platform for millions of us to go to.
KING: I suppose that sense of betrayal is understandable if you voted for Brexit. In your victory speech, you talked about Brexit opponents as taking over the narrative. And you say that's why Brexit hasn't happened yet. But isn't a big part of the problem that political leaders can't agree on how Brexit should happen because this is a very complicated process?
DE LUCY: Yes, it is complex. But I genuinely believe that our politicians should be up to the job. And if they're not up to the job, then they should, quite frankly, resign. You know, they - we are the boss, if you like. The people gave a very clear instruction to our parliamentarians to deliver Brexit in its complexity, work out a brilliant deal - the only way we could have got a good deal from the EU, by the way, is to have prepared for a no-deal at the beginning, make it a viable option for us to have left with no deal so the EU would eventually had to have sat down with us and given us a deal.
At the moment, they only want to give us a deal that doesn't allow us to benefit at all from Brexit because they need to protect their project and prevent other countries from leaving. And...
KING: Well, you and dozens of other party members have now been elected to an institution, the European Union, that you want to leave.
DE LUCY: Yes.
KING: What is the point of you being in Brussels?
DE LUCY: I know. It's a very good question. We all hope we're not there for very long. And, you know, we're like turkeys voting for Christmas, if you like. We're very keen to do ourselves out of a job. But it is a platform for us, at least, to, if you like, re-educate Brussels on the virtues of democracy, how fragile democracy is and that it must be supported no matter the result, to re-educate our Parliament on democracy and also to send a clear message to our government. If you don't implement Brexit, the next general election is going to be disastrous for you.
KING: Belinda de Lucy is a newly elected member of the EU Parliament from the Brexit Party.
Thanks so much for your time.
DE LUCY: Thank you so much. Bye-bye.
KING: All right, so for some more perspective on what this all means for the United Kingdom, we're going to go now to John Peet. He is Brexit editor at The Economist magazine, and he's with us from London.
Good morning.
JOHN PEET: Good morning.
KING: Is it any clearer, in light of this victory today, when and if and how the United Kingdom is going to leave the European Union?
PEET: No, I don't think it is any clearer.
KING: No.
PEET: I mean, what is clear is that voters are dissatisfied. They're dissatisfied with the ruling Conservative government, which is - from which the prime minister has just resigned. But they're also dissatisfied with the Labour opposition. And they're not quite sure what they're voting for other than to be grumpy and vote against both the main opposition and the government.
KING: And that would be, I imagine, some other smaller parties, including - the Green Party did well as well. It was not just the Brexit Party. You just heard Belinda de Lucy. Her party won 29 seats. It's too new to have any seats in the British Parliament yet. Do you think it has any clout, any power? You heard her say, we want to get in there to get out of there, essentially. How likely is that?
PEET: I don't think it's going to have any power over the Brexit negotiations, which are just stuck at the moment. And they are going to be handled by the current government when we get a new prime minister. And I would expect them to stay stuck for quite a long time.
What the Brexit Party and the success they had in this election will do is have a big influence on who becomes the next leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister. And I think it will drive that person towards a harder line and possibly towards embracing the idea of just walking out with no deal.
KING: Well, that leads to my next question, which is what this means for the traditional system in the U.K. Do you think this is a reckoning moment? Or do you think this is a restructuring?
PEET: This is going to have ramifications for quite a long time to come.
KING: Yeah.
PEET: If we can't sort out Brexit - and I think that's very difficult to do because compromise is not an easy thing to reach when you've got one extreme saying, let's walk out with no deal and another extreme saying, what we want is another referendum - then I think the Brexit Party will be around. And I think the Liberal Democrats and the Greens will be around. And the consequence will be a growing fragmentation of politics in Britain that will make - whenever the next election is held, the odds are that no party will win. And we will have a difficulty forming a government.
KING: You've thought about this deeply and for a long time. Could anything get Brexit unstuck at this point?
PEET: Well, I do think that the odds are quite high that, when we go back to Brussels with a new prime minister, the deal doesn't change. It still can't get through Parliament - that we may well end up saying, the only way to resolve this is, indeed, to have another referendum. When that will be, I'm not sure. But I think that we are heading in that direction.
KING: John Peet is the Brexit editor at The Economist magazine.
Mr. Peet, thanks so much for your time.
PEET: Thank you.

Turkish Military Officer Flees Turkey After Coup : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727481791/turkish-military-officer-flees-turkey-after-coup,"David Greene talks to a Turkish military officer about why he was forced to flee to the United States shortly after the alleged coup attempt in Turkey in 2016.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
I was in a suburb of San Francisco recently visiting a man who is starting over. He's an officer in the Turkish military. We were in his California apartment with his wife and his young kids. They had recreated their former life in Turkey here as best they could. Shoes come off at the front door. His wife's artwork hangs on the walls. This officer described their lives back in Turkey as comfortable. They'd go out to nice dinners. They'd go on vacations often.
How different is life now? Well, we have distorted and masked his voice in order to protect him, and you'll soon understand why.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: We have a good life.
(Through interpreter) In Turkey, we had a good life. We were living very comfortably. I was not thinking about the future. The future wasn't on my mind.
GREENE: Until it was. The officer, whose name we're not using, had to flee his country.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: I took my backpack.
(Through interpreter) I took my backpack, filled it with clothes and gifts from my kids.
Kids. (Laughter).
GREENE: Think about the most consequential stories in the Middle East in recent years. The war against ISIS. The nuclear deal with Iran. The audacious killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. What often gets lost in that mix are troubling developments out of Turkey.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDINGS)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Chaos in Turkey.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The tanks have opened fire in Turkey's largest...
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Turkey's top general was held hostage at the military...
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: An apparent coup attempt in U.S. and NATO ally Turkey tonight.
GREENE: On a warm summer evening in 2016, the military officer we were speaking to was at a park with his family in Turkey when he heard military jets overhead.
(SOUNDBITE OF MILITARY JETS FLYING)
GREENE: He didn't think much of it until he turned on the television a couple hours later.
(SOUNDBITE OF SOLDIERS YELLING IN TURKISH)
GREENE: Soldiers had stormed the offices of a Turkish news channel and tried to seize control of the airwaves.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: (Speaking Turkish).
GREENE: A coup was allegedly underway. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on his supporters to resist...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Speaking Turkish).
GREENE: ...And they did. Erdogan held onto power, and in the nine months that followed, he unleashed a massive crackdown. His government hunted down anyone suspected of taking part in what he said was an attempted coup. He went after academics and police officers, civil servants and military officers - people our officer knew well.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: I have lots of friends there.
(Through interpreter) I have lots of friends like that. I have friends who are tortured and imprisoned.
GREENE: He tried not to worry.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: First, we didn't.
(Through interpreter) At first, we didn't believe that they would come for us. But one day, one of my supervisors called me and told me that, we are suspending your job. I asked him, why are you doing this? He said, we suspect you have used an application.
An application.
GREENE: And this was common in the crackdown. There was a private, encrypted messaging app, called ByLock. Turkish courts ruled that just having it on your phone was enough to prove involvement in the coup. This officer said he didn't have the app on his phone at the time. I asked him if he was involved or did anything that could have made people think he was involved.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: I was with my family. (Through interpreter) I was with my family. I am not involved. I condemned the coup attempt.
GREENE: Still, he worried that his suspension was only the beginning. He got a different apartment to hide out in for a while, but then he decided it was time to get out. He made a plan with his wife. He would flee the country first, and if the route was safe, he'd call for his wife and kids to follow. He left with just that backpack, which had some gifts from his kids. He still has them. He holds them in sandwich bags, and he showed them to me.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: The most important, the most valuable.
(Through interpreter) The most important, the most valuable, are these two poems. It says, my father in Turkey, my darling in English. My son asked me not to read it until I left Turkey. And whenever I read these poems, I would cry.
I cried.
GREENE: This officer and several others set off by foot, hoping they could reach the Greek border.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: Women.
(Through interpreter) Women were carrying babies in backpacks. Some wrapped their kids to their shoulders and walked seven, eight hours. Sometimes we had to enter water that came up to the waist. It was raining.
GREENE: Finally, he made it to a police station in Greece. And then this senior officer, who'd go to fancy dinners and concerts back home, applied for U.S. asylum. He eventually landed in Northern California. His wife and two kids then made the same journey, and they joined him. They have been struggling. This officer has been selling whatever he can online.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: (Through interpreter) Whatever I can find, clothes, I buy cheap from somewhere and sell them at a higher price.
GREENE: He also recently started driving for the ride-hailing app Lyft to make money. And this military officer is not alone. At least two dozen Turkish military officers have sought asylum in the U.S., and NPR has spoken to several of them. Human rights groups say others are still trying to flee Turkey. Now, of course, people who get out may be the fortunate ones. This officer showed us photos on his wall of other military friends.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: The guy on the left.
(Through interpreter) The guy on the left, he has been tortured.
The right person.
(Through interpreter) The person on the right corner is in Greece.
In Greece now.
(Through interpreter) The first girl's husband has been imprisoned.
Imprisoned.
GREENE: And this is all part of the brain drain that has been created amid this crackdown. Erdogan's government has imprisoned thousands of people since the coup attempt. He's also undermined his country's reputation for democracy and human rights, and he's upset this delicate diplomacy where the U.S. and other NATO countries thought they had a trusted partner in a region that could erupt at any time.
Here in California, this military officer had his asylum approved recently. He's trying to build a life here now, though he still does wonder sometimes if Erdogan's government could one day track him down.
UNIDENTIFIED TURKISH MILITARY OFFICER: We are living at risk.
(Through interpreter) We are at risk when we sell stuff. Whenever I see a Turkish name, I think to myself, I don't want to meet near here. I give them another address not near my house, far from my home.
GREENE: As for his actual home, Turkey, he thinks he'll one day see it again. But he knows that won't be soon.

Steve Inskeep talks to Fire Chief Jeffrey Payne in Dayton, Ohio, about the damage to the city, and efforts to keep residents safe. So far there have been no fatalities and only minimal injuries.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Let's get the best picture we can of the tornadoes that struck Indiana and Ohio overnight. In Ohio alone, we're told there are tens of thousands of power outages affecting millions of people, and plows have had to be used to clear the debris off of highways. Jeffrey Payne is the fire chief in Dayton, Ohio, which is at the center of all of this. Chief Payne, welcome to the program.
JEFFREY PAYNE: Hey, thank you very much. Happy to be here.
INSKEEP: What happened in your area overnight?
PAYNE: Well, we had a large tornado move through the city and, actually, the entire Dayton metropolitan area. And we suffered significant damage. Many homes, apartment complexes, flattened. But fortunately, we've had no fatalities. And we've had a minimal number of injuries related to the tornado. Houses were flattened, apartment buildings, just - they're going to be rendered unusable. They're going to have to be demolished.
There's just devastation - 10, 20, 30, houses, you know, in a community, you know. And then you got an entire apartment complex, you know, sports centers ripped up. It's a lot of devastation right now. But, again, just incredible enough - at least at 6:30 this morning, we have no fatalities.
INSKEEP: Chief Payne, I want to remind people, you - you're in the Midwest. So you know from tornadoes. Is this something worse than what you would normally expect?
PAYNE: Absolutely. I've been with the Dayton Fire Department for almost 31 years, and this is the first major tornado that come through Dayton. We've had some bad tornadoes in neighboring communities, such as Xenia. However, this is the first one to hit the Dayton metropolitan region.
INSKEEP: It is pretty rare, it seems to me, that tornadoes do severe damage in heavily populated, densely populated areas. But from what you're saying, it sounds like this was a quite densely populated area.
PAYNE: Yeah, it was. And surprisingly enough, we're coming out of this pretty well in terms of how many people are injured. For instance, in the city of Dayton we've had - we've only had three injuries related to this tornado. It's just amazing, Steve. And I attribute that to the early notification of the weather coming in and people heeding the warnings and getting in a safe place.
INSKEEP: So what is your focus as this day begins?
PAYNE: Our focus is to continue our search and rescue. We're going to be continuing our search in the city of Dayton and the neighboring communities. We have Ohio Task Force 1, which is a FEMA urban search and rescue team that is here. It's going to be assisting with the search and rescue, as well as three other state teams. And we are confident we're going to have a comprehensive search of any occupants or confirming that everyone in those occupancies are OK.
INSKEEP: Chief Payne, do you have a difficult moment sometimes, or people you work with have a difficult moment sometimes because you get a tornado warning. You know you're going to be working. You've got to be focused on your professional duties. But you, of course, also have a family that - family and friends who are right there, potentially in the path.
PAYNE: That's a very good point. And that really hit home last night because we were all with our families, and we had to leave our homes and come into the city while our families had to stay back. And, of course, there's concerns there. And so it's tough. But such is the life of an emergency responder, whether you're police or firefighter. And you - you're there for the safety of the public. And you have a job to do, and that's what we did.
INSKEEP: Well, Chief Payne, I'm glad the news is as good as it is, anyway, and I wish you luck.
PAYNE: Well, thank you very much.

Instagramming Crowds Pack National Parks,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/726658317/instagramming-crowds-pack-national-parks,"Enlarge this image Around 50 tourists and photographers were huddled near Mesa Arch in Utah to catch a glimpse of the sunrise in early May. Nate Hegyi/KUER Nate Hegyi/KUER Around 50 tourists and photographers were huddled near Mesa Arch in Utah to catch a glimpse of the sunrise in early May.
Nate Hegyi/KUER The dark blue, predawn sky was just beginning to brighten over Mesa Arch — a once-hidden gem in Utah's Canyonlands National Park — as Jonathan Zhang frantically set up his camera and tripod.
The Los Angeles tourist wanted to get the perfect shot of the sun rising over deep, tan canyons and red rock spires, framed by the glowing, orange arch. But he had to squeeze through throngs of other photographers and smartphone-wielding tourists to do so, nearly 50 people total.
There was an Italian man with long, brown hair sitting next to a time-lapse camera rig. A bearded, college-aged man was FaceTiming the sunrise for his friend.
The busy scene was not how it looked when Zhang first came here a decade ago.
""There were only two or three guys,"" he said. ""But now it's like, every morning it's crowded.""
That's because Mesa Arch has joined the growing ranks of places in the United States that have become #Instafamous. The landmark first gained popularity in 2010 after Microsoft used a picture of the sunrise there as one of its default backgrounds for its Windows 7 operating system.
View this post on Instagram Sunrise through Mesa Arch in Canyonlands National Park. I have been quite silent lately, but the time has been well spent in learning new skills both in aviation and photography. This is my first photo consisting of three different exposures. Hope you like it! #travel #nature #sunrise #morning #dawn #hdr #canyonlands #nps #moab #utah #landscape #landscapephotography #mesaarch
A post shared by Valtteri (@valtterimurto) on May 24, 2019 at 5:05am PDT
The sandstone formation has since caught on in social media circles and has been tagged on Instagram more than 25,000 times.
But the growing crowds at Mesa Arch aren't an isolated phenomenon. All across the country, more people are flocking to national parks and public lands with smartphones in their hands.
Horseshoe Bend in Arizona, for example, was once a sleepy, locals-only pitstop on the side of a highway until beautiful photos of the Colorado River there went viral on Instagram.""
Now around 2,800 people visit the landmark every day , according to data from the National Park Service. Across that agency's eight-state intermountain region, visitation to national parks and recreation areas has increased by 37% since Instagram was first founded in 2010.
But is social media solely to blame for the big crowds at national parks and public lands? The evidence is anecdotal.
National 'Lingering Fields Of Yellow' As California's Super Bloom Begins To Fade ""There hasn't been a study done yet that's been published that's been able to show a direct cause and effect,"" said Ashley D'Antonio, a recreation ecologist and associate professor at Oregon State University.
A strong U.S. economy and low gas prices are more probable drivers for increased visitation than social media, according to D'Antonio, though she acknowledged that many of these new tourists are sharing photos on Instagram and Facebook. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, she argued.
The National Park Service and other groups, for example, have been using social media to try and diversify the kinds of visitors who travel to places like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.

A post shared by She is Not Lost 🌎 (@sheisnotlost) on May 24, 2019 at 2:07am PDT
""Most of the visitors to our parks and protected areas are upper middle class, white and slightly older,"" D'Antonio said. ""There's been a lot of groups that use social media to get more people of color, or people that aren't traditionally seen in our protected areas, out promoting and saying that this is a space for you, too.""
Still, growing crowds of smartphone-toting tourists means long lines, traffic jams and, in rare cases, even injuries and fatalities.
In 2018, a California woman fell to her death at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan while trying to take a selfie. Similar incidents have happened at Grand Canyon and Yosemite national parks. At Yellowstone National Park, a woman was gored by a bison while attempting to get a selfie with the animal in 2015.
Park officials there have now instituted a voluntary safety pledge visitors can take that includes a warning on selfies.
""No picture is worth hurting yourself, others, or the park,"" the pledge states. ""Be aware of your surroundings, whether near wildlife, thermal areas, roads or steep cliffs.""
No one has fallen to their death at Mesa Arch yet. But as the landmark has become more popular with the selfie-taking crowd, tensions are brewing between tourists and serious photographers such as Drew Armstrong and his two friends. They watched as a young woman struck a yoga pose in front of the arch.
""It's frustrating when they want to get a shot with their Lululemon pants because they're wearing Lululemon pants,"" Armstrong said. ""I want them to be here and say, 'You know, this is important. This needs to be protected.' ""
Armstrong and his two friends believe that, in the rush to take selfies and post them, people are missing out on what makes national parks and public lands so amazing in the first place.
""Solitude, peaceful moments and nature,"" said Neale Zingle, Armstrong's friend. ""We're so focused on saying, 'We were there.' So focused on having that information that people think you can capture on a snapshot. But you can't do that. You have to take the time to experience it. It's sort of an old-fashioned approach. But there's no shortcut.""
Zingle and his friends have been taking photographs around Canyonlands National Park for the past three decades. This new breed of ""selfie tourist"" appeared to get under their skin. But it didn't seem to bother Zhang, the Los Angeles photographer, too much. He was finishing a time-lapse of the sunrise over Mesa Arch.
""I think it's getting crowded,"" he said. ""But you can't really prevent people from coming. It's public land. They have a right to see these things, too.""
As the sun climbed above the arch and the day became warmer, the big crowds aiming to get their perfect shot began to dwindle. Eventually no one was left. The Instagram moment was over — at least until the next sunrise.

Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images In the summer of 1973, Carole King was at the peak of her popularity and influence. She had ushered in a new era of singer-songwriters that dominated popular music; Tapestry, which she'd dropped two years earlier, was still a top-selling album, well on its way to becoming one of the most-loved and best-selling albums of all time. King had also just released Fantasy, a thematic album recorded with a jazz-funk band, and embarked on her first-ever live concert performance outside of the United States. The venue was the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and, until now, no one outside of those in attendance have ever been able to see her earth-moving set.
YouTube Eagle Vision (part of the Universal Music Group) has unearthed and restored footage of King's set and has announced plans to release the full performance on both DVD and CD. The 18-track concert includes an intimate, solo-piano performance of ""It's Too Late,"" with an audience seated on the floor in front of the stage. ""Usually I don't get to see my audiences,"" she says. ""Tonight, I'm seeing you.""
YouTube Not long into the set, King is joined by an 11-piece band and together they perform nearly every track from her then-untested Fantasy album , including ""You've Been Around Too Long.""
King's band for the performance featured some of the era's most sought-after session artists, including saxophonist Tom Scott, drummer Bobbye Hall and trombonist George Bohanon.
Carole King - Live at Montreux 1973 is scheduled to be released on June 14.

'Range' Argues That Specialization Should Not Be The Goal For Most,www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/725755061/range-argues-that-specialization-should-not-be-the-goal-for-most,"Range Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World
by David Epstein
Hardcover, 339 Range Subtitle Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World Author David Epstein A little more than 10 years ago, Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell was published. Throughout that book, he frequently cited the so-called ""10,000-Hour Rule,"" which stated that to master something, one needed to practice it correctly for that amount of time. That, Gladwell argued, was what successful people did.
It makes intuitive sense: If you want to get good at something, work hard at it until you are. Range: Why Generalists Triumph In A Specialized World , a new book by David Epstein, a former investigative and science reporter at ProPublica , argues that this theory of specialization applies to a limited number of skills and fails to set its adherents up for success. What most people need instead is, well, range.
According to Epstein, the world for nearly everyone is not a place where specialization — which he argues leads to myopic thinking — is truly beneficial. His claim extends from individuals to systems, and he includes some striking anecdotes and evidence in the introductory chapter of the book. One contributing factor to the financial collapse of 2008, he says, was that ""[l]egions of specialized groups optimizing risk for their own tiny pieces of the big picture created a catastrophic whole."" Another anecdote he puts forth is that ""cardiac patients are less likely to die if they are admitted during a national cardiology meeting"" because the absence of interventional cardiologists reduces the number of stents used ""in cases where voluminous research has proven that they are inappropriate or dangerous."" These are compelling points, but they have that slippery feel that can appear in social science books. In this case, their perfect fit and a lack of cited counterargument signals that things may be falling together too easily.
Throughout Range , however, Epstein is meticulous and spends a great deal of time giving credit to dissenters where credit is due. For example, he shares the story of Lazlo and Klara Polgar and their three daughters, Susan, Sofia, and Judit. Lazlo hoped to raise a family of geniuses and that's what he did. His daughters trained in chess whenever they could — and it paid off. ""Susan became the first woman to achieve grandmaster status through tournament play against men...Judit, at fifteen years and five months, became the youngest grandmaster ever, male or female."" Sofia, by comparison the least successful, still reached international master status. This, Epstein grants, is a triumph of specialization.
He deftly flips this on its head, however, explaining the history of computers who can beat humans at chess. What repeated practice trains, he argues, is the same thing that computers are better at than people: tactics. Garry Kasparov, a grandmaster whose 1997 loss to IBM's supercomputer signaled something of a changing of the guard, set out to demonstrate this in a series of hybrid tournaments where humans competed with a machine partner. Epstein writes:
""Kasparov settled for a 3-3 draw with a player he had trounced four games to zero just a month earlier in a traditional match...the primary benefit of years of experience with specialized training was outsourced, and in a contest where humans focused on strategy, he suddenly had peers.""
When the human-and-machine-team-ups proliferate outward, the results continue along this line. ""A few years later...a duo of amateur players with three normal computers not only destroyed Hydra, the best chess supercomputer, they also crushed teams of grandmasters using computers."" Epstein is always careful to respect the dedication and skill of the chess grandmasters. His point is not that their work was wasted but that repetitive devotion of this sort is only useful for training a certain type of skill and most things aren't like chess.
Epstein goes on to highlight numerous great successes made possible by wide-ranging thinking. Gunpei Yokoi, a graduate student and hobbyist, joined Nintendo in 1965 as a maintenance employee. An executive caught him messing around with a gripping tool he'd made in his spare time at work and asked him to develop it into a toy. Yokoi rose in the ranks after the toy's success, playing an important role in the development of the Game Boy, where his lack of engineering experience helped him resist the pull toward the newer technology their competitors were trying. Epstein is quick to also emphasize the essential role that narrow specialists played in the process. Another success he cites is InnoCentive, a company that connects entities with intractable problems with smart people who want to help solve them, for rewards, in their spare time. When the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard had those people who solved problems on InnoCentive rate how relevant the problem they addressed was to their own field of specialization, they found that ""the further the problem was from the solver's expertise, the more likely they were to solve it.""
Where Epstein's argument stumbles is in more artistic fields. The objective measures that he had been relying on to make his points are no longer as relevant, and they're less convincing as a result. Early on, he traces Vincent Van Gogh's creative life before he settled on painting, and uses Van Gogh's high number of paintings sold for over $100 million as proof of his prowess. Similarly, he cites a study done which ranked comic book creators based on the commercial value of their issues. Art's commercial value is not and never will be a useful metric of its quality and it's a shame that Epstein attempts to include that idea in his analysis.
On top of this, Range makes the same compromises that many books of social science make. Many studies are cited, but the size or repeatability of them is not mentioned. There are notes in the back for the more studious readers, but more rigorous in-text citations should be encouraged.
Despite these flaws, Range is a convincing, engaging survey of research and anecdotes that confirm a thoughtful, collaborative world is also a better and more innovative one.

A new pilot is set to take the helm at the Smithsonian Institution.
The organization, a public-private partnership that has established and maintains many of the best-known museums in the U.S., unveiled its next secretary at a news conference Tuesday: Lonnie G. Bunch III , the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture , will take over the day-to-day administration of the Smithsonian's 19 museums, 21 libraries and the National Zoo — among other operations .
Bunch's selection, made by unanimous vote of the organization's 17-member Board of Regents , makes him the first African American to serve in the role of secretary in its 173-year history . He will take over for the outgoing secretary, David Skorton , in roughly three weeks.
Shortly after his name was announced, Bunch stepped to the lectern to reflect on just what this move means to him — and to acknowledge the ""challenges that the institution faces during the next decade.""
""But more importantly,"" he said, ""I'm excited by the potential to meet those challenges.""
Bunch represents a new leader for the Smithsonian, but in many ways he is something of an old hand. He took over the African American history museum in 2005, steering it from the early days of its inception through its 2016 opening and beyond. Before that, he worked at the National Museum of American History for over a decade.
Grand Opening: The National Museum of African American History and Culture Mission Of African-American Museum Writ Large In Its Very Design Grand Opening: The National Museum of African American History and Culture At African-American History Museum, Visitor 'Dwell Time' Is Off The Charts Yet for all his work in history, Bunch said Tuesday that he's got his eyes trained squarely on the future.
""It is important for the public to view the Smithsonian not simply as an addict of nostalgia, but as a cauldron of ideas of innovation and understanding that can be transformative for our country,"" he said at the news conference.
""To accomplish this, though, the Smithsonian must become a much more nimble entity,"" he added. ""It must be an institution that is ripe with technology, an institution better suited to serve 21st century audiences, and an institution of research, of great collections, and of wonder that helps America understand itself and its world. This will ensure that the Smithsonian will always be what it once was. It will always ensure that the Smithsonian will be a place where scholarship, creativity, education and service come together for the greater good.""
Within the Smithsonian Institution's leadership structure, the secretary is akin to a private company's CEO, the executive responsible for the umbrella organization's general vision and daily direction. Bunch will also often act as the Smithsonian's chief fundraiser and lobbyist — a task he knows well from his time at the African American history museum, according to David Rubenstein, chairperson of the Board of Regents.
""He basically started with no congressional appropriations, no donor money, no land, no architectural plans and no artifacts. And over a period of about 12 years or so he put everything together,"" Rubenstein told NPR. ""So it was a real tour de force, though there were plenty of other people involved. But Lonnie was the general, and I think we all owe him a great deal of gratitude for that.""
Meanwhile Skorton, a cardiologist and former president of both the University of Iowa and Cornell University , is headed to the Association of American Medical Colleges, where he will become president and CEO .
""The Regents, and the Smithsonian, are fortunate to have had Secretary Skorton's leadership, vision and commitment during a crucial period when the Smithsonian is expanding its reach and focusing its research and educational efforts,"" John Roberts, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and Smithsonian chancellor, said in a statement after Skorton announced his departure late last year. ""He has laid a solid foundation for the Institution's future.""
Bunch will assume the role of secretary on June 16.

Tiny Desk Georgia Anne Muldrow April 8, 2019 5:00 AM ET Bobby Carter
Twitter Georgia Anne Muldrow is all about showing and spreading love. That fact became clear as we discussed the set list for her Tiny Desk performance. She and the band were floating the possibility of swapping the duet with her partner in music and life, Dudley Perkins with another song. But she decided it was more important to showcase their shared love on the song ""Flowers,"" originally from Perkins' 2003 album A Lil' Light.
The first song I ever heard from Georgia Anne Muldrow, back in the early 2000s, was called ""Break You Down."" The opening line spoke directly to my experience as a twentysomething coming into my own:
""Don't let them make you forget who you are
Don't let them break you down""
I later found that she wrote, produced and performed that song when she was only 17-years old. She possessed talent and perspective beyond her years and I became a fan.
Some time would pass before she eventually released her debut album, Olesi: Fragments of an Earth, in 2006. Since then, she's released well over a dozen, mostly self-produced projects. While much of her music's focus has been on the healing, preservation and education of African American people, the themes are universal: family, struggle and of course, love. The beats are a combination of J Dilla and Battlecat while her voice carries soul that sounds like it was groomed in the backwoods of Jackson, Miss. She's also made a name for herself as a collaborator with artists that include Madlib, Mos Def and Erykah Badu, with whom she introduced the notion of ""staying woke"" to the world, years before it was appropriated as a hashtag.
During her set, Muldrow performed, reworked and animated versions of the song ""Flowers,"" along with two selections from her latest album, Overload , including an extended and jazzy version of ""Ciao.""

Twitter With the 2020 campaign underway, here are some reminders from the Ethics Handbook about publicly expressing political opinions.
The section on impartiality has the guidance and it applies to NPR employees inside and outside the newsroom (more on that below). Some of the highlights:
- ""We don't put political bumper stickers on our cars.""
- ""We don't sign political petitions.""
- ""We don't donate money to candidates.""
- ""We're not advocates. We may not run for office, endorse candidates or otherwise engage in politics in a participatory or activist manner.""
- ""We don't put political signs in our yards.""
- ""If family members get involved in politics we recuse ourselves from any coverage that touches on their activities.""
And:
""Our standards of impartiality also apply to social media. ... Refrain from advocating for political or other polarizing issues online. This extends to joining online groups or using social media in any form (including your Facebook page or a personal blog). Don't express personal views on a political or other controversial issue that you could not write for the air or post on NPR.org. These guidelines apply whether you are posting under your own name or — if the online site allows pseudonyms — your identity would not be readily apparent. In reality, anything you post online reflects both on you and on NPR.""
Of course, we all have opinions about things. And as the handbook says, ""our experiences and perspectives are valuable assets to our journalism.""
But, ""we accept some unique professional obligations and limitations. Because our words and actions can damage the public's opinion of NPR, we comport ourselves in ways that honor our professional impartiality. ... The public deserves factual reporting and informed analysis without our opinions influencing what they hear or see. So we strive to report and produce stories that transcend our biases and treat all views fairly. We aggressively challenge our own perspectives and pursue a diverse range of others, aiming always to present the truth as completely as we can tell it.""
On the issue of who is covered by this guidance, there's a section on that subject here . As we've said in meetings with all departments, the guidance certainly extends to everyone who ""touches our journalism"" in news and programming, and in departments that support them. Also, everyone at NPR should understand that the public does not differentiate between those who work in news and those who are in other parts of the organization. What we do, even something like putting a political bumper sticker on a car that we drive to work and park in an NPR garage or lot can raise questions in the public's mind about NPR's credibility.
See your supervisor or the standards & practices editor if you have questions about whether the guidance applies to you.

Murder Conspiracy Theories: Episode 3 NPR White Lies Civil Rights Crime Podcast : NPR,www.npr.org,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/30/718663251/the-counter-narrative,"Doctors care for the Rev.

James Reeb in a Birmingham, Ala., hospital after he was attacked in Selma on March 9, 1965. Bettmann/Getty Images
Editor's note: This podcast contains explicit language that some may find offensive.
In the third episode of White Lies, we investigate the theory that emerged from the defense's closing argument in the trial for the murder of the Rev. James Reeb: that civil rights activists delayed Reeb's medical treatment and let him die — or killed Reeb themselves — because the movement needed a white martyr to further its cause. Visual Narrative: The Murder Of James Reeb And Its Aftermath
We break down a seven-page letter written a few weeks after the acquittal that amplified the closing argument. Published by an outspoken segregationist in Selma, it promulgated the theory that the true villain was the civil rights movement itself and aimed to absolve Reeb's attackers and the people who lied to protect them.
We interview nurses and doctors who treated Reeb before he died, cross-reference statements made to local, state and federal investigators and dig through an abandoned bunker at a decommissioned Air Force base in a search for evidence.

Anna Gassot/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 2:10 p.m. ET
The Supreme Court is leaving in place part of an Indiana law that mandates that aborted fetuses be buried or cremated.
The court did not take up a second part of the law that banned abortions because of fetal abnormality, the fetus's race, sex or ancestry. A lower court struck down that part of the law in addition to the burial provision. The Supreme Court, though, said it will wait for other lower court rulings before weighing in on the fetal characteristics provision.
Vice President Pence signed the legislation when he was governor.

"When Tea Reaches Its Boiling Point In Fiction, So Too May Story : The Salt",www.npr.org,npr.org,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/05/28/722875100/when-tea-reaches-its-boiling-point-in-fiction-so-too-may-the-story,"Enlarge this image Quilp, the epitome of evil in Charles Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop , seen here with Little Nell, is a dwarf with the head of a giant and a ""few discolored fangs"" for teeth.

Culture Club/Getty Images Culture Club/Getty Images Quilp, the epitome of evil in Charles Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop , seen here with Little Nell, is a dwarf with the head of a giant and a ""few discolored fangs"" for teeth. But his most grotesque trait is his trick of drinking ""boiling tea without winking"" and eating ""hard eggs, shell and all.""
Culture Club/Getty Images A recent study in the International Journal of Cancer revealing a link between hot tea and the risk of esophageal cancer has provoked a range of reactions — from concern and vindication (for those who've long warned family and friends about the dangers of ingesting boiling liquid) to mockery (Not one more study!) to outright defiance. (You can pry that hot cuppa from my cold, dead hands.)
Hardened habitués were inclined to treat the study with the same solemnity as did the great Victorian limericist Edward Lear when Quote: :
There was an old man who forgot,
That his tea was excessively hot;
When they said 'Let it cool'
He answered 'You fool!
I shall pour it back into the pot.'
The warning is no laughing matter — esophageal cancer is the world's eighth most common cancer, and this finding affects millions of tea-drinkers. But the defensiveness that greeted it was scarcely surprising, since it imperiled one of the most intimate, ingrained and pleasurable habits known to mankind — that first scorching sip of morning tea.
Hot tea — it has to be unhealthily hot — has a deep emotional relationship with the drinker. Its dimensions encompass far more than the gustatory, starting with its magical ability to get chronic malingerers out of bed every morning. That first chastising sip constitutes a tiny tour de force of hope that, like a tingling hot bath, cauterizes other pains. Those grieving the loss of a loved one have found that hot tea can seep into places that, to Quote: poet William Wordsworth, ""do often lie too deep for tears.""
It's hardly surprising, then, that it's not just tea drinkers who are addicted to the seductions of hot tea — writers are, too. Across tea-drinking cultures, in China, England, India, Russia, Egypt or the U.S., writers have milked hot tea for all its worth to add a splash of narrative panache to comic or erotic scenes or to build mood, momentum and character.
The Salt Coffee Or Tea: In Dickens' World, It Might Be A Choice Between Good And Evil And what more villainous character than Quilp, the epitome of evil in Charles Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop ? Quilp is a dwarf with the head of a giant and a ""few discolored fangs"" for teeth. But his most grotesque trait — and a fine example of Dickensian éclat — is his trick of drinking ""boiling tea without winking"" and eating ""hard eggs, shell and all."" He resorts to these dietary stunts to terrorize his wife and mother-in-law, succeeding only too well in frightening the women half to death so that they begin ""to doubt if he were really a human creature.""
Sinister in a more ambient way is the boiling tea in Daphne du Maurier's gothic classic Rebecca . At the country manor Manderley, afternoon tea is an elaborate affair served on a tea table covered with a snowy-white tablecloth: ""Tiny crisp wedges of toast, and piping-hot, flaky scones. Sandwiches of unknown nature, mysteriously flavoured and quite delectable, and that very special gingerbread. Angel cake, that melted in the mouth, and his rather stodgier companion bursting with peel and raisins."" But the tea itself, for some reason, is always scalding. It unsettles the already anxious narrator, the second Mrs. De Winter, who is the new mistress of Manderley and is forever comparing herself to her predecessor, the beauteous and wicked Rebecca. When they have guests over to tea, she has to do the honors, and is in a state of high nerves at having to handle the ""monstrous silver tea-pot and kettle."" In another scene, when she calls on her husband's querulous grandmother, who pretends not to know who she is and demands to meet ""dear Rebecca,"" the tea is once again unpleasantly hot, adding to the malignant suspense that builds steadily to the novel's blazing finale.
The Salt The Real 'Favourite' Of Queen Anne's Era? Tea, And The Gossip That Swirled Around It A work that rings with cries of ""tea quick, please"" to tragicomic effect is Fyodor Dostoevsky's strange novella, The Eternal Husband . This cat-and-mouse psychological tale explores the fraught relationship between two men, one of whom, Velchaninov, used to be the lover of the other man Trusotsky's, now dead wife. One night, Velchaninov is gripped by mysterious and agonizing pains, and Trusotsky, with an almost demented fervour, forces him to drink ""two or three cups of very hot weak tea — boiling hot"" as a sureshot remedy. In hysterical tones, he urges him, ""Drink this tea quick — never mind if you scald your tongue — Life is drearer. You can die of this sort of thing, you know."" Why would the cuckold administer to the sufferings of the man who has wronged him? Trusotsky's concern is genuine but it has an edge. Sure enough, though Velchaninov feels better after the tea and falls asleep, he wakes up to find Trusotsky standing over him in the dark, razor in hand. The nurse has turned assassin, with the passive aggression simmering inside reaching boiling point.
As intense, but with a comic-erotic charge, is the scene that unfolds in Palace Walk , Naguib Mahfouz's first novel in his Cairo trilogy . The libertine Yasin — magnificently described as having ""the body of a bull and the elegance of a peacock""— is throbbing with lust for the beautiful lute player Zanuba. As he sits in a coffee shop across from her house desperately hoping for a glimpse of her, he is in such a fever of ""apprehension and anxiety"" that he ""forgot what he was doing and drank hot tea without waiting for it to cool."" He burns his mouth and feels foolish, but the real scorcher comes a little later, when Zanuba, preceded by her long red lute case, finally emerges. When he first sees her, Yasin ""craned his neck and gulped"" — the hot gulp of her, which mimics the action of his tea-drinking, sears him all over again, for as he later muses to himself, ""Desire's a fire.""
One reason for tea's global appeal is its extraordinary ability to both warm you up on a cold day and cool you down on a hot one. The warming one up is straightforward enough. The scalding salted and buttered tea of Tibet provides its people with a boost of energy needed to battle the mountain cold, and the wintry Russian stories of Leo Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Anton Chekhov are full of characters drinking steaming tea accompanied by a lump of sugar.
The Salt It Is A Truth Universally Acknowledged That Jane Austen Pairs Well With Tea But in more torrid climes, too, hot tea is relished for its cooling effect — something Arianna Huffington discovered when she was a student in India studying comparative religions. Scorching hot tea is drunk in India, China, Pakistan, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran and the Middle East through the broiling summer months. Gangadhar Gadgil in Crazy Bombay, a collection of humorous sketches on the city, writes, ""If, in spite of all these odds heavily stacked against him, the Bombayite flourishes, that is only because of the several cups of strong and scalding tea that he pours down his throat."" And a character in Ha Jin's The Crazed remarks that unlike fake stuff like pomegranate tea, nothing can ""help relieve internal heat like real tea.""
For gentler emotional journeys, though — such as the soothing bath of nostalgia — a lower temperature seems more suitable, as in that celebrated moment when Marcel Proust dipped his madeleine into his cup of warm tea: ""No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the crumbs touched my palate than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me ... The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it. And all from my cup of tea.""
Proust's tea is warm and comforting. But when you're being pursued by Death Eaters, it's time to kick things up a notch. In J.K. Rowling's final Harry Potter novel, The Deathly Hallows , Harry, Hermione and a grievously injured Ron, find themselves in a wood, and on the point of despair. But then they pitch a tent and Hermione makes tea. ""Harry found the hot drink ... seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest."" What an excellent verb to employ — ""burn away""— to capture the power of hot tea to singe the edge of fear and how reassuring that it works its magic even on brilliant boy wizards.
And on the war-weary soldiers, too. Major Jimmy Ross, the English hero of Len Deighton's City of Gold , a WWII thriller set in Cairo, feels equally bleak with German General Erwin Rommel's armies advancing on the city. After a particularly awful call with his superior officer, he puts down the phone, emits a heartfelt sigh, and surrenders to an antidote that his adjutant Ponsonby has long championed and that he has long resisted:
'Ponsonby!'
'Yes, Major.'
'I'm ready for a large cup of that filthy tea you brew out there.'
'I thought you might be, sir. I have one here, nicely drawn and all ready to pour out.'
Ponsonby was right. There were times when a large cup of scalding-hot tea, tasting of condensed milk, was the only alternative to jumping off the balcony.
