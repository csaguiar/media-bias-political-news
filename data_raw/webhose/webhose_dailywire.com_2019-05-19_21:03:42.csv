READ IT: Robert Mueller's Letter To Attorney General Bill Barr | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46645/read-it-robert-muellers-letter-attorney-general-ryan-saavedra,"May 1, 2019 views
On Tuesday, Democratic politicians and journalists rushed to claim that Attorney General Bill Barr covered up crimes committed by President Donald Trump. This transpired after The Washington Post reported on a letter that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had sent Barr in March that complained about the media's coverage of his report on Russia as a result of Barr's letter to Congress.
As documented by The New York Times, here is the letter — dated March 27 and made available Wednesday by both Congress and the Department of Justice — that Mueller sent to Barr:
I previously sent you a letter dated March 25, 2019, that enclosed the introduction and executive summary for each volume of the Special Counsel’s report marked with redactions to remove any information that potentially could be protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure that concerned declination decisions; or that related to a charged case. We also had marked an additional two sentences for review and have now confirmed that these sentences can be released publicly.
Accordingly, the enclosed documents are in a form that can be released to the public consistent with legal requirements and Department policies. I am requesting that you provide these materials to Congress and authorize their public release at this time.
As we stated in our meeting of March 5 and reiterated to the Department early in the afternoon of March 24, the introductions and executive summaries of our two-volume report accurately summarize this Office’s work and conclusions. The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of March 25. There is new public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations. See Department of Justice, Press Release (May 17, 2017).
While we understand that the Department is reviewing the full report to determine what is appropriate for public release — a process that our Office is working with you to complete — that process need not delay release of the enclosed materials. Release at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation. It would also accord with the standard for public release of notifications to Congress cited in your letter. See 28 C.F.R. 609(c) (“the Attorney General may determine that public release” of congressional notifications “would be in the public interest.”).
Sincerely yours,
Special Counsel
""[Mueller] was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report,"" Barr told the committee. ""He felt what was inaccurate was the press coverage and what they were interpreting the March 24th letter to say. He wanted to put out the full executive summaries that are incorporated in the report…and those summaries when he sent them actually required later more redaction because of the intelligence community.""

Leftists In Seattle Accuse Jews Of ‘Weaponizing’ Anti-Semitism To Target Blacks And Muslims | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46664/leftists-seattle-accuse-jews-weaponizing-anti-josh-hammer,"Leftists In Seattle Accuse Jews Of ‘Weaponizing’ Anti-Semitism To Target Blacks And Muslims Carl Larson / Contributor via Getty Images May 1, 2019 views
As Seattle-based KTTH 770 AM radio host and Daily Wire contributor Jason Rantz reports , left-wing activists in Seattle are planning a transparently anti-Semitic event that the chairwoman of the Washington State Democratic Party nonetheless deems "" important "":
The Thursday night panel discussion is titled ""Intersectional Dialogue on Weaponizing Charges of Antisemitism,"" and comes as Progressive activists defend Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s (D-MN) widely condemned anti-Semitic remarks.
It is an intersectional view that a Muslim woman of color, such as Omar, cannot be anti-Semitic because, after all, Jews are just rich, powerful, white people to them. It’s, indeed, an anti-Semitic argument.
The event description on Facebook says they will ask: ""How are charges of antisemitism being weaponized to specifically target powerful Black and Muslim leaders, force Jews and Jewish allies into false dichotomies, divert attention from the worldwide rise of white nationalism and state violence, and divide progressive movement-building?""
In other words, evil Jews like myself aren’t about fighting anti-Jew hatred — we’re the actual bigots purposefully using anti-Semitism as a cover to attack ""powerful Black and Muslim leaders."" The evil Jew at work, right?
Rantz also notes how the two Jews on the panel, Rabbi David Basior of the Kadima Reconstructionist Community and moderator Maya Berkowitz, are both open ""anti-Zionists"" who support the facially anti-Semitic ""Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions"" eliminationist campaign against the world's only Jewish state. This is a fairly frequent tactic used by anti-Semites to cover for their anti-Semitism; for example, every time the egregiously misnamed hate group ""Students for Justice in Palestine"" cohosts an on-campus event with the self-hating Jews of ""Jewish Voice for Peace,"" they engage in this. ""I cannot be anti-Semitic if I have a Jew on the panel,"" a benighted naif might say.
As Rantz notes, co-sponsors for the Jew-hating event include the American Muslim Empowerment Network, Seattle King County NAACP, Washington State’s ACLU, OneAmerica, and Womxn’s March Seattle.
As Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro has explained , the theory of ""intersectionality"" — which serves as the over-arching theme for the Seattle Jew-hating event —is inherently anti-Semitic:
How has the Democratic Party morphed into the party of anti-Semitism? By embracing the philosophy of intersectionality on the one hand, and by embracing the myth that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are completely separable on the other. The former provides the emotional impetus for nodding at Jew-hatred; the latter provides the intellectual framework for doing so.
The philosophy of intersectionality has othered Jews from the intersectional coalition . Because intersectionality is built on the premise that the prevailing Western system of thought has victimized various groups, and that those groups must band together in order to destroy that system, those who have thrived under the West must be excised from the intersectional agglomeration – being, as they are, representatives of the fact that Western thought is not, in fact, rooted in evil. The Jews are simply too financially, educationally, and politically successful to be seen as anything other than members of the power structure.
As The Daily Wire has reported at great length, anti-Semitism in the United States is on the rise. But many leftists do not seem to be particularly bothered by the harrowing trend."
Barr Bombshell: Mueller Told Us He Was NOT Saying That Trump Would Be Charged If He Was Not President | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46641/barr-bombshell-mueller-told-us-he-was-not-saying-ryan-saavedra,"May 1, 2019 views
Attorney General William Barr revealed during a hearing on Wednesday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had repeatedly told Barr that he was not indicating that he would have charged President Donald Trump if Trump were not a sitting president.
""Special counsel Mueller stated three times to us in that meeting in response to our questioning that he emphatically was not saying that but for the OLC [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion, he would have found obstruction,"" Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""He said that in the future, the facts of the case against a president might be such that a special counsel would recommend abandoning the OLC opinion, but this is not such a case.""
The point made by Barr was significant, as some Democratic politicians and journalists had tried to push the narrative that Mueller would have charged Trump but could not do so because Trump is a sitting president.

Barr also addressed the latest narrative pushed by the media and Democratic Party that Barr mischaracterized Mueller’s Russia report in his March letter to Congress.
""[Mueller] was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report,"" Barr told the committee. ""I told Bob that I was not interested in putting out summaries, and I wasn’t going to put out the report piecemeal. I wanted to get the whole report out. And I thought summaries by very definition, regardless of who prepared them, would be under-inclusive and we’d have sort of a series of different debates and public discord over each tranche of information that went out, and I wanted to get everything out at once.""

""The Deputy Attorney General and I, therefore, conducted a careful review of the report, looking at the facts found and the legal theories set forth by the Special Counsel,"" Barr continued . ""Although we disagreed with some of the Special Counsel’s legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we accepted the Special Counsel’s legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the Special Counsel in reaching our conclusion.""
""We concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,"" Barr added. ""The responsibility of the Department of Justice, when it comes to law enforcement, is to determine whether crimes have been committed and to prosecute those crimes under the principles of federal prosecution.""
""With the completion of the Special Counsel’s investigation and the resulting prosecutorial decisions, the Department’s work on this matter is at its end aside from completing the cases that have been referred to other offices,"" Barr concluded. ""From here on, the exercise of responding and reacting to the report is a matter for the American people and the political process. As I am sure you agree, it is vitally important for the Department of Justice to stand apart from the political process and not to become an adjunct of it.""

Parents And Staffers Vote To Keep Michael Jackson’s Name On Elementary School Auditorium | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Jeffrey Cawood,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46665/parents-and-staffers-vote-keep-michael-jacksons-jeffrey-cawood,"Parents And Staffers Vote To Keep Michael Jackson’s Name On Elementary School Auditorium ‘King of Pop’ attended Gardner Street Elementary School in Los Angeles as a 6th-grader.

A Los Angeles elementary school formerly attended by Michael Jackson will keep his name on its auditorium in tribute to the late global entertainment icon, district officials announced over the weekend.
The issue was put to a vote following the recent release of a controversial film accusing Jackson of molesting children decades ago. Parents of students attending Gardner Street Elementary School in Hollywood, along with staff members, decided that Jackson’s name shall remain on the facility. Balloting ended last Thursday. A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) told The Daily Wire earlier this week that it expects to release the final vote tally but did not know when the information would be available.
“A majority of those who participated voted to maintain the current name as the Michael Jackson Auditorium,” LAUSD said in a statement. “School leaders, teachers and support staff will focus on preventing any further disruptions to the school and further impact to classroom instruction, student learning and safety.” Parents and staff at Gardner Street Elementary School in Hollywood have voted to keep Michael Jackson's name on the campus auditorium, in wake of the March broadcast of the documentary “Leaving Neverland."" https://t.co/oUG79vp8Ol — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) April 27, 2019
The Los Angeles Times reports : The vote took place in the wake of the March broadcast of the documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which aired on HBO and portrays Jackson through the eyes of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, two men who allege Jackson sexually abused them when they were children. Jackson was never charged with abusing either. The broadcast was deeply unsettling for many at Gardner, and a group of parents told Principal Karen Hollis that they wanted Jackson’s name taken down. There also were parents who felt otherwise, noting that Jackson was never convicted of wrongdoing and cannot defend himself. Jackson died in 2009 from an accidental drug overdose. A spokesman for Jackson’s estate, which represents the interests of Jackson’s children, had urged the school community to respect the right of Jackson – like anyone else – to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
Jackson was briefly enrolled at the school in 1969 when he was a sixth-grader after his family relocated to Southern California from Gary, Indiana. He did not return to public school after leaving Gardner. At the time, he was the youngest member of the Jackson 5 — a singing group comprised of Michael and four of his brothers. Their first hit, “I Want You Back,” was released in October 1969 and reached number one on the charts in January 1970.
According to The Times, the auditorium was named in Jackson’s honor in 1989, “a point at which Jackson’s public reputation was still essentially intact.” He was present when the school choir sang “We Are the World,” which was co-written by Jackson, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony. After vote, Michael Jackson's name will remain on the auditorium at Gardner Street Elementary School https://t.co/pCX0z17Ybr
Since then, the pop star has been accused of sexually abusing children but has never been found guilty of those alleged crimes.
As previously reported by the L.A. Times: Some parents complained about the name on the auditorium in 1993 – just four years after the dedication – when word leaked that Jackson was under investigation for his conduct with a boy. Jackson settled out of court with his accuser and prosecutors filed no charges. In 2003, district officials ordered that Jackson’s name be covered with plywood – but not removed – after Jackson was arrested on charges of sexually abusing another boy. He was found not guilty following a criminal trial in 2005. In 2010, a year after Jackson’s death from an accidental drug overdose at age 50, school district officials ordered the covering removed – amid much celebration from Jackson fans.
Both of “Leaving Neverland’s” accusers defended Jackson against molestation claims when the pop star was alive but filed lawsuits against his estate asking for millions after his death. According to a lawyer representing Safechuck, now 41, and Robson, 36, those cases were dismissed but are currently under appeal. In March, a British journalist reportedly discovered a significant discrepancy in a key part of the film calling its credibility into question.
Robson said in an interview with the L.A. Times that he had attended Gardner elementary in the early 1990s while his alleged abuse was still taking place.
“I commend Gardner Street School for allowing the parents to decide whether or not Michael Jackson’s name should remain on the auditorium,” Robson told the Times before the votes had been tallied.

"Shapiro At 'National Review': The New York Times' Anti-Semitism Is Shocking, But Not Surprising | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ben Shapiro,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46605/shapiro-national-review-new-york-times-anti-ben-shapiro,"views
This week, the New York Times got itself into hot water for printing a blatantly Jew-hating cartoon in its international edition. The cartoon depicted Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an elongated dachshund, a Star of David hanging around his neck, leading a fat, blind, yarmulke-wearing Donald Trump through the streets. The implication: The nefarious, animalistic Jew is in control of the Jew-perverted president of the United States.
The image is nothing new. In 1940, the Lustige Blatter , a weekly German humor magazine, printed an image of a tall, ugly, bearded Hasidic Jew taking a tiny Winston Churchill by the hand and leading him across the surface of the globe.
So, what would tempt the New York Times to print an illustration directly from the mind of Julius Streicher? The fact is that the Times , like many of today’s mainstream media outlets, has been completely and utterly willing to cover for and, indeed, engage in anti-Semitism, so long as it is disguised as anti-Zionism. Undoubtedly, the editors at the Times believed that the cartoon was merely a criticism of Israel, not a criticism of Jews. That excuse found its logical apotheosis in a 2014 German regional-court ruling that characterized a firebombing of a synagogue as merely a protest against Israel, rather than act of anti-Semitism.

Former CIA Officer Pleads Guilty To Conspiring To Spy For China | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Kassy Dillon,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46673/former-cia-officer-pleads-guilty-conspiring-spy-kassy-dillon,"Former CIA Officer Pleads Guilty To Conspiring To Spy For China ""I conspired to gather and send secret information to the People's Republic of China."" ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images May 2, 2019 views On Wednesday, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer admitted to conspiring to spy for the Chinese government in federal court. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 54, was an officer in the CIA from 1994 to 2007, reports The New York Times . Lee is a naturalized American citizen and U.S. Army veteran who grew up in Hawaii but later moved to Hong Kong after leaving the CIA.​ Between 2010 and 2012, the CIA’s informant network in China collapsed, which some speculate may have been a result of Lee providing names to the Chinese. According to BBC , 20 informants were killed or jailed during that time. The FBI reportedly found Lee's notebooks that had the names of CIA assets, operational meeting locations, phone numbers, and information about covert facilities.​ While in Hong Kong, Lee started a cigarette import business with a man that had ties to Hong Kong intelligence. Lee later met with Chinese intelligence and reported the meeting to the CIA without mentioning he had been offered $100,000 to disclose sensitive information. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were deposited into Lee’s bank between 2010 and 2013, according to the BBC. Lee moved back to the U.S. in 2012 after the CIA made him a fake offer to return to the CIA, The Washington Post reports. During that same year, Lee failed to disclose all the details of his meetings with Chinese intelligence while being interviewed by the CIA.​ Lee’s formal charge is conspiracy to deliver national defense information to aid a foreign government. According to John Brown, the FBI’s assistant director for counterintelligence, Lee put the country's national security at risk.​ ""By knowingly aiding a foreign government, Mr. Lee put our country’s national security at serious risk and also threatened the safety and personal security of innocent people, namely his former intelligence colleagues,"" Brown said. ""I conspired to gather and send secret information to the PRC (People's Republic of China),"" Lee said when asked by Judge T.S. Ellis to describe his actions, reports NPR .​ In exchange for the guilty plea, prosecutors dropped two charges related to retaining classified information. Lee’s lawyer, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., maintains that although Lee pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide information, ""There is no allegation that Mr. Lee delivered any information to the Chinese."" McMahon also stressed that ""there was never any claim that Mr. Lee was responsible for getting anyone killed."" Lee is expected to be sentenced at the end of August and could face life in prison. Prosecutors, however, plan to seek a sentence of 17 to 27 years, reports the Times. In February, a former Air Force intelligence officer was charged with espionage for defecting to Iran and giving information about her former colleagues, The Daily Wire reported :​ CBS News reports that Witt is accused of defecting to Iran in 2013 and sharing highly-classified U.S. intelligence about a classified Department of Defense program. Authorities claim Witt collaborated with the elite Iranian military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The FBI’s wanted listing says that Witt was indicted by a grand jury on February 8, and charged with “Conspiracy to Deliver National Defense Information to Representatives of a Foreign Government and Delivering National Defense Information to Representatives of a Foreign Government.” ""Monica Witt is charged with revealing to the Iranian regime a highly classified intelligence program and the identity of a U.S. Intelligence Officer, all in violation of the law, her solemn oath to protect and defend our country, and the bounds of human decency,"" assistant attorney general John Demers wrote in a statement. Witt, 39, had high-level security clearances and was in the Air Force from 1997 to 2008, then became a Defense Department contractor until 2010. She also reportedly went abroad several times on counterintelligence missions."

CNN: Trump’s Economic Approval Rating ‘The Highest Number We’ve Ever Seen’ For His Administration | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46691/cnn-trumps-economic-approval-rating-highest-number-ashe-schow,"May 2, 2019 views
While discussing President Donald Trump’s recent polling numbers, a CNN analyst made a startling exclamation.
When the topic of the president’s approval rating on the economy came up, CNN’s David Chalian said Trump’s 56% approval was “the highest number we’ve ever seen at CNN polling.” Chalian was making the claim in reference to only Trump, saying a few seconds later, “It’s the high watermark in the entirety of the Trump presidency in CNN polling.”
Indeed, it is the highest approval rating on the economy that Trump has received during his presidency from CNN, but it is not the highest approval rating CNN has ever seen.
Former President Barack Obama, for example, beat that number twice during his eight years as president — in the first months of his presidency in 2009 and as he was leaving office in 2017. Both of these numbers should be looked at with a grain of salt. He entered office with high hopes. Remember, he had won the Nobel Peace Prize for a speech he gave before he was inaugurated. His approval rating on the economy jumped eight points from before the 2016 election to just before Trump was inaugurated, so one can also assume that might have had more to do with apathy over Trump than anything Obama had actually accomplished.
Trump is now in his third year as president. At this same point in Obama’s presidency, his approval rating for the economy was just 42%. So on that, at least according to CNN polling , Trump has him beat.
Other polls, however, have not been so kind to Trump. Real Clear Politics averaged Obama’s approval rating on the economy at 57%, which is far higher than CNN’s average.
Newsweek reported in March that former President Bill Clinton’s economic approval rating blows everyone else out of the water:
While Trump’s economy rating essentially matched Obama’s, they both paled in comparison to President Bill Clinton’s, who had the record economic approval rating of 81 percent in 1999. The record low rating since Gallup began polling on the economy, at the start of President Ronald Reagan’s term, was 17 percent for President George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump’s latest rating is well above the average rating of 43 percent. Trump’s economic approval rating never dipped below 45 percent.
CNN further reported that Trump’s high economic approval rating comes after the economy performed better than expected during the first quarter, growing 3.2% compared to the expected 2.5%. (CNN conveniently left those numbers out of its report on Trump’s economic approval rating.)
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said at a recent conference in Los Angeles that Trump’s handling of the economy would help him win re-election in 2020.
""You hate to sound like a cliché, but are you better off than you were four years ago? It's pretty simple, right? It's the economy, stupid. I think that's easy. People will vote for somebody they don't like if they think it's good for them,"" Mulvaney said."

He did offer drumsticks to a couple of female aides seated in front of him.
Later, at an impromptu press conference, Cohen brandished the plastic chicken for reporters, explaining that: “Chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions … this man was picked to be Donald Trump’s fixer. The black socks look clean compared to this team. It's a sad day in America.”

Thanks to Cohen's efforts, ""#ChickenBarr"" began trending on Twitter, as progressive social media activists caught on to the joke.
Other legislators, including Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who called the hearing, chose to leave their mark on Barr in other ways. Nadler gave a speech to Barr's empty chair (sans plastic chicken), berating him for failing to appear and connecting Barr's decision not to testify to further, secretive Trump administration policies.
Barr said Wednesday that he would not attend the House hearings on Thursday after a dispute with Democrats over whether committee staff members and outside legal counsel, rather than legislators themselves, should be allowed to question the acting Attorney General, according to CNN . The Attorney General's office also refused to turn over a full, unredacted version of the Mueller report to Nadler and other Democratic legislators, despite a subpoena.
Nadler has said repeatedly that he will not be satisfied until he obtains a full, clean version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report and a copy of the evidence Mueller used to come to the conclusion that President Donald Trump and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign did not collude with Russian officials to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
On Wednesday, Barr spent hours in front of a Senate committee where, instead of being questioned on the content of Mueller's report, he was repeatedly interrogated over a letter, issued in early April, describing the contents of Mueller's report as clearing the president of collusion charges. Democrats were focused on how Barr characterized the report, despite having actual copies of the report in hand.
Nadler did promise retribution for Barr's absence, telling reporters ominously that House Democrats ""will have no choice but to move quickly to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith. If he does not provide this committee with the information it demands and the respect it deserves, Mr. Barr’s moment of accountability will come soon enough.”"
"KNOWLES: Sorry, AOC, Bernie, Nordic Countries Are Not Socialist | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46677/knowles-sorry-aoc-bernie-nordic-countries-are-not-daily-wire,"KNOWLES: Sorry, AOC, Bernie, Nordic Countries Are Not Socialist Yana Paskova/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 2, 2019 views
On Thursday’s episode of “The Michael Knowles Show,” the host debunks the talking points claiming that Nordic countries are socialist and that the United States should model their countries after their example. Transcript and video below.
Bernie, AOC, they want to tell you that the socialism that they're pushing is like the Nordic countries. It's not like Venezuela. Not a lie. The Nordic countries have relatively free economies, and they have no minimum wage. None of those countries have a minimum wage.
Sweden has a universal school choice, a far more free-market approach to education than even the United States has. Iceland has a freer economy than the United States, according to the Heritage Foundation index for economic freedom.
If AOC wants to be more like Iceland, then she ought to support freeing up the economy, not increased socialism. The former Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen puts the point very clearly. He says, ""Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.""
But what AOC and Bernie Sanders are pushing is a socialist planned economy. And it's so disingenuous if you hear Bernie Sanders or AOC talk about this. Bernie Sanders didn't have his honeymoon in Denmark, and he didn't go on his honeymoon to Iceland. He went on his honeymoon in 1988, the day after he got married, to the Soviet Union. In fact, I'm sorry to say we have video of this Bernie Sanders shirtless drinking vodka singing commie songs with the Russkies in the Soviet Union in 1988.
Bernie Sanders was so enthralled with the Soviet Union, with Soviet communism, the most repressive regime on Earth, and one of the most repressive regimes in the history of the world, that he took his honeymoon there. He didn't want to go to Scandinavia, he wanted to go there, worse even than Venezuela. And to remind you that he's not pushing policies that would bring us to Iceland, and he's pushing the policies of Latin America — just three years earlier in 1985, Bernie Sanders was defending socialist breadlines in Latin America.
Bernie Sanders: ""It's funny sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is because people are lining up for food. That's a good thing. In other countries, people don't line up for food. The rich get the food and the poor starve to death.""
Bernie says, ""bread lines are a good thing, in a lot of countries the rich get food and the poor starve to death."" Right, in socialist countries that's what happens. That's what's happening in Venezuela right now. And if they don't starve to death, they get run over by tanks. That doesn't happen in the United States. Nobody starves to death in the United States. The biggest problem afflicting the poor in the United States is obesity. The problem among the poor in the United States is that they're eating too much — that's not what happens in socialist countries. They starve to death while the rich and the well-connected and the cronies all benefit. "
Poynter Removes Unreliable List Of ‘Unreliable News Websites’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46736/poynter-removes-unreliable-list-unreliable-news-ashe-schow,"Poynter Removes Unreliable List Of ‘Unreliable News Websites’ Nipitphon Na Chiangmai / EyeEm / Getty Images
Ouch, that’s embarrassing.
On Tuesday, the Poynter Institute published a list of allegedly “unreliable” news websites. The list included nearly every conservative media outlet and virtually no liberal media outlets. Within a day of publication, Poynter had to issue a correction and removed two websites from the list. Following more complaints, the organization has now removed the list entirely.
In a “ letter from the editor ” published Thursday, Poynter’s managing editor Barbara Allen apologized for the list, acknowledging that it was itself unreliable.
Allen first explained how the list was created, which consisted of other lists created by biased “journalists” and “fact-checkers,” such as Snopes and Politifact. The intention of the list was to help others – such as advertisers – boycott allegedly “unreliable” news websites by allowing them “to gauge the legitimacy of the information they were consuming.”
As Allen notes, it was not just websites on the list that complained, but also “readers who objected to the inclusion of certain sites, and the exclusion of others.” Poynter then decided to “audit” the list (as opposed to doing this before publication) and “found weaknesses in the methodology.” The organization “detected inconsistencies” between the original lists and their “own rendering” of the final version.
“Therefore, we are removing this unreliable sites list until we are able to provide our audience a more consistent and rigorous set of criteria. The list was intended to be a starting place for readers and journalists to learn more about the veracity of websites that purported to offer news; it was not intended to be definitive or all encompassing,” Allen wrote. “We regret that we failed to ensure that the data was rigorous before publication, and apologize for the confusion and agitation caused by its publication. We pledge to continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.”
Poynter had already published a correction to the list shortly after it was put online, removing my former employer The Washington Examiner and Indian outlet FirstPost from the list.
“This index previously listed The Washington Examiner and FirstPost as unreliable news sources. After reviewing our methodology, we found that neither met the criteria for inclusion, so both were removed,” the correction read.
Read Allen’s full statement below:
Dear readers:
On Tuesday, April 30, Poynter posted a list of 515 “unreliable” news websites, built from pre-existing databases compiled by journalists, fact-checkers and researchers around the country. Our aim was to provide a useful tool for readers to gauge the legitimacy of the information they were consuming.
Soon after we published, we received complaints from those on the list and readers who objected to the inclusion of certain sites, and the exclusion of others. We began an audit to test the accuracy and veracity of the list, and while we feel that many of the sites did have a track record of publishing unreliable information, our review found weaknesses in the methodology. We detected inconsistencies between the findings of the original databases that were the sources for the list and our own rendering of the final report.
Therefore, we are removing this unreliable sites list until we are able to provide our audience a more consistent and rigorous set of criteria. The list was intended to be a starting place for readers and journalists to learn more about the veracity of websites that purported to offer news; it was not intended to be definitive or all encompassing. We regret that we failed to ensure that the data was rigorous before publication, and apologize for the confusion and agitation caused by its publication. We pledge to continue to hold ourselves to the highest standards.

Woman Who Married Herself: It Was The Best Day Of My Life | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46742/woman-who-married-herself-it-was-best-day-my-life-hank-berrien,"May 3, 2019 views
Writing in The Telegraph, a 42-year-old British woman chortled that the best day of her life came last June — the day she married herself .
Melissa Denton, a two-time divorcee with two children, writes, “The idea to marry myself came to me in January last year, when I was at work one day. Three weeks before, on Christmas Eve, I had received a text message from my boyfriend of five and a half years: ‘I can’t do this any more, it’s over,’ it said … It was devastating and left me in a funk, unable to eat, sleep or smile.”
Seizing upon the idea of marrying herself, Denton recalls a TV interview with Sophie Tanner, who had married herself in May 2015. Denton writes, “I was so down, and knew that I needed to learn to love myself before I would be able to attract the right people into my life. For years, I had poured myself into relationship after relationship, losing myself in the process. It was time to put ‘me’ first - a way to affirm that I can be happy on my own and to move on from the relationship.”
Denton bought a ring and set the wedding date. She admits her colleagues thought she was crazy, but she had previously shaved her head to raise money for a cancer charity and later dyed her hair pink and wore a nose ring.
Denton writes that her children, Ruby, 15, and Jasper, 11, were initially skeptical but came around, as did her family, but her brother did not bring his son to the wedding because he thought it would confuse him. She writes, “I’m hoping his opinion has now changed.”
Denton’s mother was initially against the idea, but Denton notes, “She soon came around. At the end of the day, she told me she was really proud.”
The wedding featured “a DJ, live band, karaoke and a huge vegan feast.”
Denton writes, “For the first time in my adult life, I was single and happy - the experience was empowering. Rather than wasting my time, energy and love on someone else, I was putting myself first.""
Denton explains, “My potted and relentless history with men started at 16, when my father died in a car accident.” She segues to her two failed marriages, then adds, “Relationships only got more difficult from there, as I bounced from one man to the next with little time in between to heal or become independent. I often transferred emotions from my last relationship into the next, all the way until that awful Christmas Eve text. “
She describes the wedding: “The atmosphere at the wedding was amazing, and everyone was celebrating, including a couple of ex-boyfriends and some former in-laws. It was just like any other wedding - just without a groom. I walked down the aisle, in a pink dress, with a big smile - towards no-one. A friend gave me away and another officiated. I repeated the vows and put the ring on myself, and we passed a paper plate around the 130-person congregation for everyone to sign in lieu of a register, as it’s not a legal procedure. It was the best day of my life.”
Denton concludes that now that she is fulfilled, she is “ready for a new challenge – and to start cheating on myself – so I applied to go on First Dates. I didn’t consider that for some people it might be a bit too mad. Instead, I planned to joke that I was married, but a bit bored.”
She’s committed to the idea of marrying herself, though: “Some people don’t understand it – but to me, it made absolute sense and that’s why I’m going to renew my vows at a similar ceremony every year, even if I am in a relationship. I have even bought four wedding dresses that can be used in the future. It is a way to centre and value myself, as well as remember that I can receive love that is equal, not one-sided. “
And there’s this: “Being Mrs Denton has taught me to be happy in my own company and skin, to not put pressure on myself to look or act in a certain way. Confidence is the most attractive thing a person can have and the marriage has given me that. My marriage to myself might not have come with a wedding night or honeymoon, but the plans for the future are far more exciting.” Recommended For You"
CA Senate Votes To Keep Trump Off Primary Ballot Unless He Releases Tax Returns | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46750/ca-senate-votes-keep-trump-primary-ballot-unless-hank-berrien,"CA Senate Votes To Keep Trump Off Primary Ballot Unless He Releases Tax Returns Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images May 3, 2019 views
On Thursday, the California state Senate took a shot at President Trump, passing a bill that would require presidential candidates to release five years' worth of income tax returns or not appear on the primary ballot.
As AP reported , a similar bill was passed in 2017, but Gov. Jerry Brown, who himself would not release his tax returns while in office, vetoed the bill, claiming it was unconstitutional. Brown stated , ""Today we require tax returns, but what would be next? Five years of health records? A certified birth certificate? High school report cards? And will these requirements vary depending on which political party is in power?""
But new California Governor Gavin Newsom may well sign the bill, which is coauthored by state Sen. Mike McGuire and state Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the 2017 bill.
In 2017, McGuire stated, ""For decades, every president has put their personal beliefs aside and put our country first and released their returns. The American people shouldn’t be in the dark about their president’s financial entanglements."" Wiener added, ""This bill is about giving the American people the honesty and transparency they deserve from anyone who wishes to serve as their president.”
This week, McGuire stated, “We believe that President Trump, if he truly doesn’t have anything to hide, should step up and release his tax returns.” He said recently , “President Trump’s refusal to release his income tax returns has broken a time-honored, bipartisan tradition which has weakened our democracy and his jaw dropping business conflicts have now put the security of our nation at risk.”
Last December , McGuire ranted, “Voters not only deserve full disclosure of their leader’s tax returns, they should be entitled to them. If President Trump had released his tax returns we would know why he’s ignoring intelligence agencies and snuggling up to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who has been linked to the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi. Transparency is a nonpartisan issue and it’s time to put the speculation to bed and bring to light any conflicts of interest that could drive an American president into the arms of a foreign power. It’s time to make President Trump’s tax returns public.”
Newsom spokesman Brian Ferguson said the bill “would be evaluated on its own merits.”
McGuire noted that Newsom has released his tax returns, adding, “I never want to put words into his mouth, but here’s what I’ll say: Gov. Newsom has led by example.” He said, “We can all debate on the floor about the constitutionality of this bill. But we also have to look at what makes our democracy strong. The foundation of any successful government is transparency.”
AP wrote, “Candidates would have to submit tax returns to the secretary of state’s office, which would work with the candidates to redact some information before posting the returns online.”
Similar bills have been proposed in New Jersey and Washington state.
According to a Morning Consult poll in April, a bare majority of respondents, 51%, want to see Trump’s tax returns released."
WALSH: Why Facebook's War On ‘Hate’ Is Just A Thin Excuse To Censor Conservatives | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Matt Walsh,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46743/walsh-why-facebooks-war-hate-just-thin-excuse-matt-walsh,"May 3, 2019 views
Without giving a warning or any specific reason, Facebook purged a number of "" far-right extremists "" from its platform this week. Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopolous, Alex Jones, and Laura Loomer were all summarily banished. Louis Farrakhan was also given the boot — though he is not, despite media claims, in any way ""far-right.""
This ban reaches farther than anything we've yet seen. Facebook and Instagram will neither allow links to their content nor mentions of any events they attend. According to the The Atlantic , the only Infowars content permitted on either platform is that which expressly condemns Infowars:
Infowars is subject to the strictest ban. Facebook and Instagram will remove any content containing Infowars videos, radio segments, or articles (unless the post is explicitly condemning the content), and Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share Infowars content and events promoting any of the banned extremist figures, according to a company spokesperson. (Twitter, YouTube, and Apple have also banned Jones and Infowars.)
The social media conglomerate offered only vague justifications for this move. It claimed that the targeted people are guilty of ""hate"" and ""violence,"" and are therefore ""dangerous."" As for evidence of this dangerous hate and violence, it gave only a few rather bizarre examples. From the BBC :
It said Alex Jones had hosted on his programme Gavin McInnes, leader of the Proud Boys, whose members are known for racist, anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Mr McInnes has been designated a ""hate figure"" by Facebook.
Facebook said this year Milo Yiannopoulos had publicly praised both Mr McInnes and English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, both banned from the network.
Laura Loomer also appeared with Mr McInnes, and Facebook said she also praised another banned figure, Faith Goldy, a Canadian.
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was banned for making several anti-Semitic remarks earlier this year.
Apparently it is a violation of Facebook’s policies to speak positively anywhere in public about people Facebook doesn’t like. Yiannopolous has been banned not for promoting Gavin McInnes on Facebook, but for expressing positive opinions about him in public . Can I then be banned for writing this article questioning the decision to ban these newly dubbed ""hate figures?"" I suppose I'll find out soon enough.
Indeed, it is impossible to know ahead of time whether you are operating according to the rules or in defiance of them, because the rules are intentionally obscure. What counts as ""hate"""" What is ""extreme?"" Which ideas are ""dangerous?"" Well, we can only try and narrow it down by the process of elimination.
Hamas and Hezbollah must not be considered ""hateful"" because they still have Facebook pages . This burlesque performer posted a picture of herself half-naked with a young girl stuffing dollar bills into her underwear while the girl's parents watched and cheered. She still has a page, so I guess the exploitation and abuse of children is not ""dangerous,"" according to Facebook. Speaking of which, this 11-year-old drag queen has a page, though dressing a child in drag seems both dangerous and ""extreme"" by any objective standard. PETA is extreme. The Animal Liberation Front is extreme. The National Abortions Rights Action League is extreme. Michael Moore is extreme. Sarah Silverman is extreme. Al Sharpton is extreme. Bill Maher is extreme. Everybody at the Daily Kos and Think Progress is extreme. All of these people and organizations, and the hundreds similar to them, are not only extreme but often quite hateful, yet their Facebook presence has not been interrupted by either bans or suspensions.
It seems that Facebook is operating with the same definition of ""extremism"" and ""hatred"" as the above-cited left-wing extremists themselves. If they were really interested in enforcing some objective and fair set of rules, they wouldn't have waited to issue all of these bans at the same time, as part of one big P.R. spectacle. If Alex Jones were going to be banned for spreading the insane and evil Sandy Hook conspiracy theory, Facebook would have made that move five years ago. If Yiannopolous or Watson or Loomer really did something that violates the terms of service (and, in Watson's case especially, I have no clue what that could possibly be), then they would have been kicked off the platform in response to that specific violation. Instead, Facebook handled it this way because the real ""violation"" is political. Whether these individuals can rightly be described as ""extremist"" or not, their only sin, in Facebook's eyes, is that their alleged extremism falls on the right end of the political spectrum. The extremists and hateful bigots on the Left — of which there are many — have been granted full immunity.
Two questions now arise: (1) Is Facebook correct to censor people based on politics?; and (2) Does Facebook have the moral right to censor people based on politics?
The answer to the first question is obviously no. A social media giant with over a billion users suppressing speech is far more dangerous than a right-winger expressing his views in a blog post or a YouTube video. Facebook's underhanded, dishonest, and absurdly biased actions should be condemned by anyone who cares about the free and open expression of ideas (an increasingly small group, perhaps).
The answer to the second question is more complicated. One thing I can say for sure is that Facebook does not have the right to smear and libel anyone. If they are going to publicly label someone like Paul Joseph Watson ""dangerous,"" ""hateful,"" and ""violent,"" they must provide evidence for that description. Otherwise they are baselessly defaming him, and that defamation, coming as it does from one of the most powerful companies in the world, will certainly have a negative impact on his life and professional career.
Leaving aside the libelous aspect of the matter, the question of whether or not Facebook has the moral or legal right to censor as it sees fit really comes down to category. What is Facebook? Is it a public utility, like a phone company? Is it just a ""platform?"" If so, what is a platform and how exactly can it be distinguished from a utility? Could a phone company claim that it is just a platform for phone calls? And if a platform makes editorial decisions about the content it publishes — such as allowing only negative references to Infowars — then hasn't it actually become more of a publisher than a platform? And if it's a publisher, then isn't it responsible for everything posted to the site — such as that picture of the young girl and the burlesque dancer?
I don't know the answers to all of these questions. But I do know that Facebook can't weave around the cones forever, never defining itself or explaining what it is and how it operates. Facebook has to be one thing or the other or the other. It can't be all three. And whatever it decides to be, ultimately, it must accept the responsibilties that come with that."
"Man Who Voiced ‘Winnie The Pooh’ Accused Of Rape, Abuse By Ex-Wife | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46757/man-who-voiced-winnie-pooh-accused-rape-abuse-ex-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Man Who Voiced ‘Winnie The Pooh’ Accused Of Rape, Abuse By Ex-Wife Photo by Mike Marsland/Mike Marsland/WireImage May 3, 2019 views
Jim Cummings, the man who voiced the iconic character of “Winnie the Pooh,” has been accused of rape by his ex-wife.
According to documents obtained by The Blast, the voice actor’s ex-wife Stephanie Cummings says Jim has engaged “in physical, sexual, and emotional abuse including but not limited to death threats, rape, and various sexual deviant behavior forced upon me without my consent” since the couple’s divorce in 2011.
Stephanie claims she has two separate domestic violence restraining orders against the actor after violent incidents, including one in August of 2011, “when she says Jim came over to her home and slapped her on the buttocks and forced himself on her in front of their 4-year-old daughter,” The Blast reports.
“He later came up behind me,” the ex-wife claims, “grabbed my arm, spun me around, and forcefully put his hand on the back of my neck and kissed me while holding me in place against the wall.”
The 66-year-old actor then allegedly asked Stephanie if she could “see him leaking, because that’s what I make him do when he touches me.” She said the experience left her “humiliated and degraded.”
Jim recalled the incident differently, saying in court documents that hef was “joking and laughing” with his ex-wife. “I touched her slightly on the butt,” he recalled. “[T]the whole incident was happy” and consensual, he said, noting that Stephanie “is much taller than I am, and a large woman, made no objection to anything.”
Jim denied the alleged incident further in an email to Stephanie: “Shame on you, you’re [sic] distortions are obscene. ‘forcing?’ Please, everyone, Gracie myself and especially YOU were all giggling and laughing, it was pleasant to have one moment of light-heartedness,” he wrote. “We both erupted into laughter ... I’m hardly the first person in the world to point out one ‘catches more flys [sic] with honey than vinegar’ for you to overlay a reference to being a whore is little too telling, Let’s get this over with for the love of God.”
A police report was filed after Jim allegedly raped her in 2013, the ex claims.
“Jim would frequently ‘without consent, would touch my buttocks, my groin, and my breasts. He would hold me in place attempting to kiss and fondle me. He would spank me in front of our daughters. He would then follow up by making sexual comments to me that I found repugnant,” Stephanie said, according to the report.
The former Disney star voice actor would allegedly say he could “touch Mommy’s breasts since he had paid for them” in front of their daughters.
In 2017, Stephanie moved to Utah with their two daughters. When Jim asked to stay at their home during a visit, she accepted. “However, during the middle of the night, she claims Jim was ‘standing over me with his erect penis in my hand. He was using my hand to stroke his penis while my youngest daughter was asleep on the other side of me. She was 10 years old at the time,’” the report said.
“I told him to stop and get out of the house. He refused. He then came back and did the same thing, insisting I masturbate him or he would wake Lulu up. I did as he asked given his threat to wake up my daughter and my worry that I could not control what he would do in front of her,” claimed Stephanie.
That was when the second restraining order was allegedly obtained by Stephanie, she said."

On MAS's website, the organization did condemn the recent anti-Semitic white nationalist terror attack against the synagogue in California and the organization did condemn the Islamic terrorist attacks last month in Sri Lanka on Christian churches on Easter day.
Here is MAS's statement on the Poway synagogue attack:
Muslim American Society condemns the terrorist attack that targeted a synagogue in San Diego. As worshipers observed the last day of Passover, a 19-year old white male started targeting and shooting members of the synagogue. This person is the same individual who attacked a mosque in Escondido, 9 miles away from the Chabad Synagogue of Poway. One person is dead and three are wounded, including the Rabbi.
“Hate has no place in our society. In an era where we’ve seen an increase in hate crimes, including rising Islamophobia and anti-semitism, we must stand tall together in solidarity.” said Ayman Hammous, Executive Director of MAS, “these acts of terror in places of worship and against humanity cannot become the norm.”
MAS strongly condemns this white supremacist attack and we call on our leaders to call this out for what it is, an act of terror meant to terrorize a faith community. Places of worship are sacred and human life is sacred. The Muslim community has faced acts of hate numerous times and we stand tall with the Jewish community who also faced similar acts of hate one too many times. “We know that our faith communities are resilient. We will bounce back stronger together,” says Ismahan Abdullahi, National Deputy Director of MAS PACE, “Hate is scared of love, for it’s the only thing strong enough to keep it at bay. This world can and must do better.”
Our thoughts and prayers are with the Jewish community in Poway. We offer our sincerest condolences to all the families impacted by this tragedy. We urge all faith communities and centers to be vigilant and take extra precautions. Together, we will stand tall against hate.
Here is MAS's statement on the Christian churches in Sri Lanka:
The Muslim American Society (MAS) offers its sincerest condolences to the families of the victims of the bombings in Sri Lanka.
The bombings, which resulted in the tragic deaths and wounding of hundreds of congregants, Sri Lankans and tourists from around the world, took place during one of the holiest days in the Christian faith, Easter. MAS Executive Director Ayman Hammous said, “These senseless acts of violence do not accomplish anything other than drawing humanity into a state of chaos. We need to stand together as brothers and sisters in humanity, across all faiths, united against all acts of terror and destruction.”
MAS calls on all people to come together during these difficult times and stand for peace and justice for all. Recommended For You "
Pope Francis Criticizes The Nation-State: ‘Common Good Has Become Global’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46760/pope-francis-denounces-nation-state-common-good-paul-bois,"May 3, 2019 views
In the effort to stop climate change, human trafficking, and nuclear threats, Pope Francis said that nation states should give way to globalization in some aspects, calling on them to create ""intergovernmental institutions that manage their common interests.""
“In the current situation of globalization not only of the economy but also of technological and cultural exchanges, the nation-state is no longer able to procure the common good of its population alone,” Pope Francis told the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, according to Catholic News Agency .
The Pope did emphasize the need for subsidiarity that would allow nations to maintain their sovereignty but ultimately conceded that intergovernmental institutions would have to fill the global gaps. ""While, according to the principle of subsidiarity, individual nations must be given the power to operate as far as they can, on the other hand, groups of neighboring nations — as is already the case — can strengthen their cooperation by attributing the exercise of certain functions and services to intergovernmental institutions that manage their common interests,"" he said.
Issues like climate change and human trafficking are just two examples that Pope Francis cited that call for a ""supranational common good."" Pope Francis also touched on the issue of nationalism, which he says has sparked a rise in distrust toward migrants and a neglect of the ""common good.""
""The Church observes with concern the re-emergence, almost everywhere in the world, of aggressive currents towards foreigners, especially immigrants, as well as that growing nationalism that neglects the common good,"" Pope Francis told the professors gathered to hear him speak.
The Roman Pontiff called on nations to welcome all immigrants and to regulate migratory flows with ""virtue of prudence.""
“It is the task of public authority to protect migrants and to regulate migratory flows with the virtue of prudence, as well as to promote reception so that local populations are trained and encouraged to consciously participate in the integrating process of migrants who are welcomed,” he said. ""The way in which a nation welcomes migrants reveals its vision of human dignity and its relationship with humanity. Every human person is a member of humanity and has the same dignity.""
Earlier this week, 51 Catholic theologians and priests issued an open letter to bishops calling on them to admonish Pope Francis for speaking heresy and appointing people in powerful positions who openly flaunt Church teaching.
“We take this measure as a last resort to respond to the accumulating harm caused by Pope Francis’s words and actions over several years, which have given rise to one of the worst crises in the history of the Catholic Church,” the group said in a 20-page open letter this week that was published at LifeSiteNews .
In an 11-page letter released last year , Archbishop Viganò, former Nuncio from the Vatican to Washington, D.C., alleged that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had been sanctioned under Pope Benedict XVI only to have those sanctions removed by Pope Francis upon his ascendancy in 2013. Cardinal McCarrick had an alleged history of sexually abusing male seminarians and, according to Viganò, was ordered by Pope Benedict to refrain from saying Mass or public ministry.
Pope Francis has still not responded to the accusations laid against him by Viganò."
Rashida Tlaib’s Father Says She ‘Lied Big-Time To Get Elected’ In Resurfaced 2010 Newspaper Article | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46777/rashida-tlaibs-father-says-she-lied-big-time-get-ryan-saavedra,"Rashida Tlaib’s Father Says She ‘Lied Big-Time To Get Elected’ In Resurfaced 2010 Newspaper Article Zach Gibson/Getty Images May 3, 2019 views
In a March 11, 2010 newspaper article in The Detroit News, Rep. Rashida Tlaib's (D-MI) father accused her of lying ""big-time to get elected"" by falsifying her address on an election affidavit.
Tlaib's father, Harbi Elabed, made the accusations against Tlaib, who at the time was a freshman state-level representative from the 12th District in Detroit’s Southwest side. The newspaper article was scrubbed from the internet when The Detroit News migrated to a new website but was available in a subscription-based digital archive. The Detroit News reported:
He said his daughter misrepresented her residency when she signed an election affidavit in 2008 with the Wayne County Clerk claiming she was a citizen of Detroit.
According to that affidavit, Tlaib claimed she lived at 9123 Rathbone in Detroit. That house is owned in part by her father, Harbi Elabed, and he now says she did not live there and he was only recently made aware that she had claimed so.
""She lied,"" Elabed said. ""She lied big-time to get elected. I never teach her that way. I teach her the right way. It’s my house. She didn’t live there. She lived in Dearborn in her house with her husband and boy."" Here's the March 11, 2010, report in The Detroit News pic.twitter.com/rFe5lH0iLt — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) May 3, 2019
The Detroit News continued:
Dearborn is not a part of the 12th House District that Tlaib was elected to represent.
Residency issues are very difficult to prove. To become a candidate, you must be a “registered and qualified elector” of that district, according to state law. That means you must have your primary residence — the address on your driver’s license and where you’re registered to vote — in that district.
There is no law however, according to state election officials, saying that a person must spend any particular number of days, weeks or months at a certain location. Perjury is an offense punishable by up to five years in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Tlaib even admitted at the time that accusations against her caused problems for her, saying: ""People have questioned that a lot, but never my father and I’m sad about that. The point is I complied with the law. I moved into the district before I filed. Period.""
The Detroit News added:
According to property and tax records, Tlaib lived in a house on Tireman in Dearborn that her husband purchased a decade ago. Taxes were paid on that house in 2009 with her husband claiming it as his primary residence.
But in 2008, as Tlaib was preparing for a run for the seat, she said she separated from her husband and moved into her father’s house with her two brothers.
Tlaib said she had bills to prove where she lived but it does not appear that she ever provided those bills to the newspaper to validate her claims.
Tlaib's father said that he came forward with the allegation because it was part of a ""growing litany of transgressions that his daughter committed upon him — culminating in a dispute about care of his aged mother, who suffers from dementia,"" adding that Tlaib ""sided against him and in favor of his nephew in a battle of custody, a complete breach of family values.""
""My sons told me blood is thicker than water and I should keep my mouth shut, so OK, I did,"" Elabed said. ""Then she crossed the line with her father. When she interferes in the father’s business, when she shows him no respect. This life in politics has changed her.""
Tlaib ended up reconciling with her husband and moved next door to her father.
""It’s not surprising that he did this to me. It’s not. He was abusive to me as a girl and he’s angry at me about my grandmother,"" Tlaib claimed. ""I know he’s proud of what I’ve accomplished but he’s also vindictive. It’s all very embarrassing. What do they say, you can’t choose your family?"" "

ERICKSON: Fighting Over The Body | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Erick Erickson,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46767/erickson-fighting-over-body-erick-erickson,"ERICKSON: Fighting Over The Body photo by David S. Holloway/Getty Images May 4, 2019 views
Read about a lot of high-profile deaths and you find families fighting over the corpses. They've long since stopped arguing about issues; they just want control over the body, and maybe an inheritance. Both sides have a sense of grievance for some emotional wound. But the fight has escalated so much that no one really remembers why it started or what the endgame should be other than control of a dead body.
Washington seems to be that way these days, and the William Barr hearing is another reminder of that.
According to Barr, Russia and others will probably try to impact the 2020 election. That should be really big news, but it wasn't. Democrats have trotted out James Comey to attack the attorney general while ignoring so many of the indiscreet things Comey has done over the past few years, including his letters about Hillary Clinton.
Suddenly, Comey is awesome because he is on the Right Side of History. Democrats who blamed him for Clinton's loss pivoted to blaming Russia once Comey signaled he was sympathetic to their cause.
Meanwhile, MSNBC hosts are speculating that perhaps the President is actually helping Russia in Venezuela, where the Russians have decided to set up shop, ignore the Monroe Doctrine and prop up a dictator that the President is actually handling responsibly. It amazed me that MSNBC anchors would suggest Donald Trump is really helping Russia on this. I get that they hate the President, but he has actually been a responsible leader on this one.
Ilhan Omar, however, has not. She's gone on a television program to denounce American treatment of Venezuela. Omar and several of her freshmen colleagues in the House of Representatives have gravitated to the ""blame America first"" crowd. The world, she would have us believe, would be a peaceful utopia, but for the United States. In her scorn, she also indicts Barack Obama's foreign policy. He did not coddle enough dictators for her.
All this is happening as Joe Biden tells everyone China is not really a threat to us, just like Russia was not a threat in 2012. Biden says China is not even competing with us. Perhaps he said something so ludicrous to distract from his own Russia scandal: His son sat on the board of a Ukrainian company with ties to the Russians and only resigned once his dad decided to run for President. Some allege that Biden previously helped pressure Ukraine into firing a prosecutor looking into that company.
No one in Washington seems to have noticed that China now has a navy in the Western Pacific that is capable of kicking our butts in a fight. In fact, the American fleet over there is still suffering from issues with leadership, training and morale. In Venezuela, the Cubans and Russians have set up shop and military operations. North Korea has gone back to building weapons of mass destruction.
Then there is our own nation's pending bankruptcy. Democrats and Republicans can only agree on spending more money together. Democrats are willing to work with Republicans on a $2 trillion infrastructure package but cannot fund a $5 billion border wall. They will not even acknowledge the situation at the border.
I'm reminded that when Rome fell into chaos, the bureaucracy still basically functioned, so it was a long time before anyone realized the empire had no pulse. It took the barbarians storming the gates to open people's eyes.
At this point, we probably ought to ask if the United States still has a pulse. It looks more and more like the political class in Washington is just fighting over the corpse. Our nation is completely unprepared for coming crises and on the verge of bankruptcy, and both sides are pointing fingers and focusing on partisan squabbles instead of real threats.
For every Democrat who would read all this and say, ""But Trump,"" I'd reply that Russian meddling began during the Obama administration after Obama said they were not a threat. Pointing fingers is beside the point now. We have problems as a nation without anyone in Washington ready to play a long game to fix them.

"In Response To FOIA, A County Clerk Gave A Reporter A PICTURE Of A CD-ROM, But Not Its Contents | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46786/response-foia-county-clerk-gave-reporter-picture-ashe-schow,"In Response To FOIA, A County Clerk Gave A Reporter A PICTURE Of A CD-ROM, But Not Its Contents Hannelore Foerster/Getty Images May 4, 2019 views
Journalists and concerned citizens file hundreds of thousands of Freedom of Information Act Requests each year, and government officials continue to find new and unique ways to avoid complying.
Each year since 2015, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit dedicated to free speech and transparency, publishes The Foilies , a list of the “year’s worst in government transparency.” The 2019 list contains some doozies, but perhaps none more absurd than what happened to ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman:
ProPublica reporter Jessica Huseman has been digging deep into the child welfare system and what happens when child abuse results in death. While following up on a series of strangulations, she requested a copy of a case file from the St. Joseph County Superior Court in Indiana. Apparently, the clerk on the other end simply took the entire file and ran everything through a scanner. The problem was that the file contained a CD-ROM, and that's not how CD-ROMs work. ""Well this is the first time this had happened,"" Huseman posted to Twitter, along with the blotchy black-and-white image of the top of the disc. ""They scanned a CD as part of my FOI and didn't give me its contents. Cool cool.""
That’s right, the clerk sent her a photo of a CD-ROM but not the contents within. There are plenty of examples of ridiculous redactions in FOIA requests, but that’s certainly a novel idea.
In another example of government employees using CD-ROMS to annoy reporters who filed FOIA requests, EFF described an episode in which the CIA sent someone six discs containing eight documents – each just three to nine pages long.
Kel McClanahan, executive director of the nonprofit public interest law firm National Security Counselors, filed a request an expected eight documents. The CIA sent him the six discs containing the small documents, which could have easily fit on one.
“What makes this ‘extra silly,’ McClanahan said, is that the CIA has previously complained about how burdensome and costly fulfilling requests can be. Yet the CIA could have easily combined several requests onto the same disc and saved themselves some time and resources. After all, a standard CD-ROM can hold 700 MB, and all of the files took only 304 KB of space,” EFF reported.
Many of the other “awards” were for some serious transparency issues, like the city of Seattle telling a man he could have the information he sought for $33 million, or Michigan State Police trying to charge another report $485,645.24 – 25 cents for each line of a 1.9-million-line dataset.
One last silly example: The Federal Communications Commission tried to avoid a FOIA request for emails relating to Chairman Ajit Pai’s YouTube video “7 Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality.” After some legal wrangling, Muck Rock editor JPat Brown was able to get the unredacted emails released. They showed that Pai wanted to know when the video would be live and that the FCC wanted to be able to ax the video. Oh, and one redaction literally covered up the word “OK.”"
HAWORTH: The Democrats' Obsession With Al Sharpton | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ian Haworth,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46787/haworth-democrats-obsession-al-sharpton-ian-haworth,"May 4, 2019 views
This week, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg met with American civil rights activist and Baptist minister Al Sharpton for lunch in New York. They met to discuss “winning over the African-American community” and how to talk about Buttigieg’s sexuality with others.
Buttigieg is not the only Democratic candidate who has chosen to align himself closely to Sharpton. Beto O’Rourke, Andrew Yang, Julián Castro, John Delaney, Kamala Harris, John Hickenlooper, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Chuck Schumer, and Eric Swalwell all appeared at the National Action Network (NAN) 2019 Convention. NAN is a non-profit organization founded by Sharpton.
Al Sharpton is one of the political personalities to whom any Democratic hopeful must bend the knee. Given that much of Sharpton’s past behavior seems to be at odds with the Democrat’s claim of moral superiority, a growing number of conservatives are asking why Sharpton holds such a significant influence over the American Left.
Sharpton’s first major controversy involved the infamous 1987 Tawana Brawley rape case. Despite “overwhelming evidence” leading the grand jury to determine that Brawley had fabricated her story, Sharpton accused Dutchess County prosecutor, Steven Pagones, of racism and being one of the perpetrators in the alleged abduction and rape. Even though he was successfully sued for defamation, Sharpton refused to pay his share of the damages.
He also faced heavy criticism for his role in the Crown Heights race riots of 1991. During the funeral of Gavin Cato, a seven-year-old boy who was accidentally killed by one of the cars in the motorcade of the leader of an Orthodox Jewish Hasidic movement, Sharpton said: “It’s an accident to allow an apartheid ambulance service in the middle of Crown Heights.” During the Crown Heights riots, Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Jewish student, was surrounded, beaten and stabbed. He later died in the hospital. Many criticized Sharpton for his role in inflaming tensions, citing remarks such as “If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house”.
Sharpton’s finances have also come under severe scrutiny. In 2017, he sold the rights to his life story to the National Action Network (his own non-profit) for $531,000, adding to the $244,661 he took as compensation from NAN that year. According to The New York Times , as of November of 2014, Sharpton and his for-profit businesses owe $4.5 million in federal and state taxes.
He has also made multiple racially-charged statements. During a speech in 1994 at Kean College, Sharpton stated: “Do some cracker come and tell you, ‘Well my mother and father blood go back to the Mayflower,' you better hold your pocket. That ain’t nothing to be proud of, that means their forefathers was crooks.” When speaking of Mitt Romney in 2007, Sharpton said: “As for the one Mormon running for office, those who really believe in God will defeat him anyways, so don’t worry about that; that’s a temporary situation.”
Given these examples, many conservatives are understandably confused as to why Sharpton still seems to exercise power and influence over the Democratic Party. After all, how would the Left react if a conservative had behaved in this way?
However, when we understand who the Democrats have become, it becomes perfectly clear. They are the party of the baseless accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Jussie Smollett hate-crime hoax, and the spread and legitimization of anti-Semitism.
Of course they would stand in line to bend the knee. Al Sharpton showed them the way. "
KLAVAN: Facebook Censorship Should be Stopped | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Andrew Klavan,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46789/klavan-facebook-censorship-should-be-stopped-andrew-klavan,"May 4, 2019 views
""I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.""
These words, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall to describe the philosophy of Voltaire, should be written on Mark Zuckerberg’s forehead in indelible ink.
Zuckerberg’s Facebook — and Instagram as well — have permanently banned several people they deem ""dangerous"" from their sites. Among the deplatformed are Infowars’ Alex Jones, Nation of Islam’sLouis Farrakhan and provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.
Jones is a lunatic conspiracy theorist, Farrakhan is a hate-filled anti-semite and Yiannopoulos has pushed anti-liberal trolling to the point of fascism. It would be too little to say I disagree with their points of view. I despise their points of view.
But it is not only wrong for Facebook and Instagram to silence them, they have no right to do it and they should be forced to allow them back on their sites.
Facebook and Instagram are platforms not publishers. Unlike publishers, who can curate their content and are thus responsible for their content, platforms cannot be sued if slanderous material appears on them. In return for that immunity, they should be forced to allow all voices to speak. They should no more be able to censor people than the phone company should be allowed to stop Milo and Farrakhan from having a phone chat about whom they hate the most.
Facebook’s blatant and, to my mind, illegal act of censorship has nothing to do with keeping people safe. It has to do with silencing conservatives. Farrakhan — who has swanned around with Barack Obama, Eric Holder and most of the black congressional caucus — is the spoonful of leftist sugar meant to make the poisoning of the right go down. All the other targets are on the right.
Donald Trump has been so successful in taking over the phrase ""fake news,"" it’s easy to forget it originated on the left as part of a plan to shut down conservative speech. That plan is now in full operation.
Sharyl Attkisson, the investigative reporter who was forced out of CBS News when CBS refused to run stories that exposed the corruption of the Obama administration, has traced the origin of the “fake news” concept to a company called First Draft. First Draft got much of its funding from Google, whose parent company is run by one of Hillary Clinton’s biggest supporters. After First Draft started beating the ""fake news"" drum during the 2016 campaign, the cry was taken up by Hillary and Obama and, most urgently, by left-wing activist David Brock, who ran the George Soros-funded Media Matters, and other pro-left attack sites.
But the anti-conservative ""fake news"" campaign really took off in December of 2016 after a man fired off some bullets in Comet Ping Pong, the D.C. pizza parlor associated with Pizzagate. Pizzagate, you’ll recall, was the lunatic right-wing conspiracy theory that involved Hillary and others running a child sex ring out of Comet.
But did the conspiracy theory really originate on the right? Comet, after all, was run by one of Brock’s former boyfriends.
In any case, Brock had promised he was going to get Facebook and other major platforms to curate their content with the help of left-leaning organizations like Southern Poverty Law Center and Factcheck.Org. And after the shooting, he succeeded. Since the ""fake news"" push, right-wingers, almost exclusively, have become targets of censorship on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms.
It’s got to stop, and the government’s got to stop it. If Facebook is a publisher who can silence Jones and the rest, then we ought to be able to sue Facebook for every slanderous comment that appears on the site.
If they are not a publisher, but a platform, then they must let every voice be heard.
No one wants to stand up for clowns like Jones and Farrakhan. But while their rhetoric may indeed be ugly, it is nowhere near as dangerous as censorship of Americans by huge, powerful, monopolistic corporations like Facebook."
"Bill & Hillary Clinton Book Tour Prices Slashed, Tickets Now Available For Less Than $10 | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46795/bill-hillary-clinton-book-tour-prices-slashed-emily-zanotti,"Bill & Hillary Clinton Book Tour Prices Slashed, Tickets Now Available For Less Than $10 Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images May 4, 2019 views
A winter-long hiatus has not improved demand for tickets to Bill and Hillary Clinton's joint ""book tour,"" and seats can be had for the pair's final performances for less than $10.
The tour concludes this weekend with stops at the Forum Theater in Los Angeles, California, on Saturday night, and at the Park Theater at the Park MGM resort and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday night. Neither venue is sold out and tickets for both appearances are widely available not just on Ticketmaster, but on a number of secondary market sites as well.
On Friday night, the New York Post reports , organizers were forced to ""slash listed prices and even offer discount ducats through Groupon to boost sales"" at Seattle’s WaMu Theater. Even the best seats in the house, which once cost around $1700, were available Friday night for around $800 — more than half off the suggested retail price.
Even ""The West Wing's"" Bradley Whitford, who emceed the event and conducted the interview with Bill and Hillary Clinton couldn't manage to salvage the affair.
Secondary ticket marketplace, StubHub, has tickets for Saturday evening's show in LA available for a mere $6 — and that's for a floor seat. Similar-priced tickets are available in the arena's first and second bowls. The best ticket currently available on StubHub — a third row, middle, floor section seat — is just $47.50.
Parking at LA's Forum Theater may actually cost you more than seeing the main event.
Sunday night's event, at the Park MGM, is at a smaller venue, so ticket prices are a bit higher. Balcony seats will run attendees around $20 . The best seat in the house is around $475, but those probably won't sell, especially when Ticketmaster still has seats available for the event , in the same section but a few rows ahead for just $228 plus taxes and fees; the event isn't even sold out, and it's been on the calendar since last year, and was even rescheduled after the Clintons dropped out to go to former President George H. W. Bush's funeral.
Fortunately, after Sunday night, “An Evening With the Clintons” will be out of its misery.
The Clintons started the tour as a way of ""connecting"" (and earning major cash) following Hillary's loss in the 2016 presidential campaign, though the pair promised not to address the ""Trump issue,"" and focus instead on their collective time in power. Initially, promoters anticipated swift ticket sales and a response comparable to Michelle Obama's sold out, blockbuster, arena book tour.
It didn't work out that way. Plagued by bad ticket sales and ""exhaustion,"" Bill and Hillary Clinton called time on the fall half of their tour, perhaps thinking the spring weather — or maybe the Mueller report — would yield better results. Sadly, that wasn't the case. Audiences simply weren't interested, and the were even less interested when it became clear neither Bill nor Hillary had any intention of discussing Trump.
On Friday, Hillary waxed poetic about ""constitutional crises"" and the ""rule of law"" but never mentioned her 2016 arch-nemesis.
“I really believe that we are in a crisis, a constitutional crisis,” Hillary Clinton told the Seattle audience. “We are in a crisis of confidence and a crisis over the rule of law and the institutions that have weathered a lot of problems over so many years. And it is something that, regardless of where you stand in the political spectrum, should give real heartburn to everybody. Because this is a test for our country.”
Bill Clinton, who has a stunning lack of irony, added, ""These people, they don’t believe the same set of rules apply to them that apply to everyone else.”
The pair said they feel ""optimistic"" about the 2020 elections, perhaps because they'll finally be retired. "
Nancy Pelosi Warns Democrats That President Trump Won't 'Respect' Losing Election Results | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46801/nancy-pelosi-warns-democrats-president-trump-wont-emily-zanotti,"Nancy Pelosi Warns Democrats That President Trump Won't 'Respect' Losing Election Results Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images May 5, 2019 views
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says she's warning fellow Democrats that if President Donald Trump isn't defeated by a sizable margin in the 2020 presidential elections that he won't respect the outcome of the vote and may refuse to leave office.
Mediaite reports that the newly crowned Speaker of the House has also been cautioning her colleagues to remain more moderate on the campaign trail so that they don't ""play into Trump's hands"" and accidentally verify his claims that Democrats intend to move the country toward socialism.
“If we win by four seats, by a thousand votes each, he’s not going to respect the election,” Pelosi told The New York Times in a wide-ranging interview published Sunday, adding that she had the same concerns before the 2018 election, when Democrats retook the House of Representatives.
“He would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the races; he would say you can’t seat these people,” she told the NYT. “We had to win. Imagine if we hadn’t won — oh, don’t even imagine. So, as we go forward, we have to have the same approach.”
Pelosi then added that she and Democrats believe they have to ""inoculate"" against the possibility that ""Mr. Trump would not give up power voluntarily if he lost re-election.""
Part of her strategy of ""inoculation"" involves convincing fellow Democrats that impeachment is not the best route for challenging the president in Congress. Instead, she believes, Democrats should focus on making the 2020 elections a referendum on Trump's performance and his culpability in obstructing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russian officials to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
""Do not get dragged into a protracted impeachment bid that will ultimately get crushed in the Republican-controlled Senate, and do not risk alienating the moderate voters who flocked to the party in 2018 by drifting too far to the left,"" Pelosi suggests, according to the NYT.
Pelosi's comments will be surprising to both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats are certainly anticipating the 2020 race for the presidential nomination to be between members of the party's far-left progressive wing, and not between moderates representing the center-left. Progressive activists are desperately pushing the party to nominate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) as a way of ""making up"" for the socialist candidate's defeat in 2016. And even though the more moderate former Vice President Joe Biden is in the lead, there is a visible, concerted effort to derail his potential campaign.
Republicans may be surprised to learn that Democrats, including Pelosi, are still operating under the delusion that President Donald Trump is the most likely 2020 candidate to refuse to accept election results, particularly given that former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is still re-litigating the 2016 election, and that key Democratic candidates, like former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, are refusing to accept even certified election results.
Clinton, for example, told a Los Angeles audience Saturday night that she believes she was robbed of the presidency back in 2016. In response to a question about 2020 from @TedDanson , @HillaryClinton just said that “you can run the best campaign,” and “still have the election stolen from you.” #BillandHill pic.twitter.com/T5Unen8Kx6 — Michael Soneff (@Soneff) May 5, 2019
Of course, Clinton didn't ""run the best campaign,"" — and not even by Democratic standards. She skipped several key states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, where faulty internal polling showed her far ahead. As a result, she failed to get the number of Electoral College votes needed to solidify a victory.
Abrams told an audience last week that she wasn't governor of Georgia ""yet,"" despite losing the state by more than 50,000 votes. "
"Robert Mueller Scheduled To Testify Before Congress On May 15, Democratic Lawmaker Claims | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46799/robert-mueller-scheduled-testify-congress-may-15-emily-zanotti,"Robert Mueller Scheduled To Testify Before Congress On May 15, Democratic Lawmaker Claims Alex Wong/Getty Images May 5, 2019 views
Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) told Fox News Sunday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is ""tentatively"" expected to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee on May 15 — a reversal from Mueller's earlier pledge to remain publicly mum on the contents of his final report, issued last month.
Neither Mueller nor the House Committee itself could confirm that Mueller plans to attend the scheduled May 15 hearing, Politico reports , so it is not immediately clear what inspired Cicilline's assertion. House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) told media last week that his office had been communicating with Mueller's office, and that he and others on the committee were ""eyeing"" May 15 as a tentative date for Mueller's testimony, but nothing had been set in stone.
""A tentative date has been set for May 15 and we hope the Special Counsel will appear,"" Cicilline, said during his interview. ""We think the American people have a right to hear directly from him.""
Cicilline called the agreement ""tentative,"" he said, because ""the representative for the Special Counsel has"" signed off on the scheduled hearing but that ""until the day comes, we never have an absolute guarantee.""
Last week, Attorney General William Barr had reportedly agreed to testify in front of the same House Committee but did not show up the day of the hearing after discovering that Democrats intended to question Barr through legal counsel, similar to how the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over claims that he sexually assaulted a high school classmate decades ago.
Apparently sensing that Democrats intended to turn the hearing into a circus, Barr simply skipped the hearing altogether. A Democratic committee member placed a plastic chicken behind Barr's name placard at the witness table instead, giving focus to Democrats who spent the hearing making independent proclamations.
Democrats are desperate to question Mueller over both the conclusions reached in his report on collusion between the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russian officials looking to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential elections, and over statements made last week indicating that he felt his conclusions, particularly on the subject of President Donald Trump's attempted ""obstruction of justice,"" were twisted by members of the media.
Convinced that Attorney General Barr also ""misled"" Congress on the subject of obstruction of justice, CNN reports , Democrats are also interested in asking Mueller how he feels about Barr's interpretation of his report, both in a letter issued the weekend Mueller's report was completed and in subsequent statements Barr made to lawmakers.
The White House has said it will not object ot Mueller speaking in front of any Congressional committee, and Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the White House has ""so far indicated they would not interfere with Mr. Mueller's attempts to testify.""
Although Mueller's conclusions about ""collusion"" aren't really in question, Democrats have said they intend to re-run Mueller's 22-month deep dive into whether Trump aides communicated and coordinated with Russian officials looking to make an impact on the 2016 presidential election.

Trump Sends ‘Clear And Unmistakable’ Message To Iran | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46807/trump-sends-clear-and-unmistakable-message-iran-ryan-saavedra,"Trump Sends ‘Clear And Unmistakable’ Message To Iran Felix Wong/South China Morning Post via Getty Images May 5, 2019 views
The Trump administration is sending a carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East to send a ""clear and unmistakable message"" in response to ""a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings.""
""The deployment comes less than a month after the Trump administration designated Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a terrorist organization,"" Fox News reported . ""The deployment also comes amid the bloodiest fighting in five years between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.""
""In response to a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings, the United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the U.S. Central Command region to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force,"" Bolton said. ""The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.""
Former Israeli national security adviser Yaakov Amidror said on Sunday that Iran was behind the increasing escalation in Gaza.
""What made Friday’s shooting on the IDF patrol interesting, Amidror said, was that it took place precisely when Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders were in Cairo putting the finishing touches on an agreement drawn up by Egypt that was designed to ease the tension in the South,"" The Jerusalem Post reported . ""But while its leaders were in Cairo, Islamic Jihad fired on the soldiers. At first, the organization tried to deny responsibility for the attack.""
""Why did the Islamic Jihad do this?"" Amidror asked. ""The answer is again and again and again – Iran.""
""[Islamic Jihad] was established by Iran, financed by Iran, and does what Iran wants it to do,' Amidror said, adding that the Iranian idea is that ""Israel will be busy focusing on Gaza and not have enough energy to deal with the building up of an independent war machine in Syria.""
Iran has continued to spew hatred towards Israel in recent days while clearly indicating it wants to destroy Israel.
In a recent Iranian sermon translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute, ""Mohammad Baqer Ebadi congratulated IRGC Major-General Hossein Salami on his recent appointment as commander of the IRGC,"" MEMRI reported . MEMRI provides the following translation of part of the sermon:
There is a new commander for the IRGC – Gen. [Hossein] Salami. We wish him success. General Salami said something once – he made a brief remark that still bothers the Zionists. In one speech, he said: ""The Israelis have nowhere to run. In the north, they have Hizbullah. In another part, they have the Hamas. On this side, they have Syria, and all around there are Muslim peoples, even though some of the governments have sold themselves out."" He said: ""Netanyahu should start learning how to swim in the Mediterranean Sea."" He meant that when Netanyahu wants to flee, this will be his only way to escape. This is why he should learn how to swim. I hope Mr. Netanyahu learns quickly how to swim, because Salami has finally arrived. He is the commander of the army of Islam. If Netanyahu has not yet learned how to swim, he should do it before it's too late because, Allah willing, the day is drawing near. According to some traditions, the wounded Zionists will step over their dead while trying to escape, but they will be killed.

"Norwegian Air Nixes Heels, Makeup Requirement For Flight Attendants After Serious Backlash | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46790/norwegian-air-nixes-heels-makeup-requirement-paul-bois,"Norwegian Air Nixes Heels, Makeup Requirement For Flight Attendants After Serious Backlash ""We now allow female crew members to wear flat shoes at all times"" Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images May 5, 2019 views
The female flight attendants for Norwegian Air will be a great deal more comfortable now that the company has lifted its requirement for them to wear heels and makeup, according to Fox News .
Last month, the airline made headlines when reports surfaced that flight attendants were under such a strict dress code that they had to present a doctors note if they wanted to wear flat shoes outside the aircraft when greeting passengers. The policy also forbid women wearing more than two rings per hand and nothing on the thumbs. All jewelry had to be made from gold or silver metal; necklaces could not have any religious symbolism.
According to USA Today , a spokesperson for Norwegian Air, Anders Lindström, confirmed that policy has been laid to waste.
""We now allow female crew members to wear flat shoes at all times and no makeup if they choose, male crew members can also wear light makeup,"" said Lindström. ""Our cabin crew have always been required to wear flat shoes while working on board our aircraft for their safety and comfort. As a responsible employer, we are in continuous dialogue with our cabin crew colleagues to see how we can improve our uniform guidelines.""
At the time of the controversy, Norwegian Air defended its dress code as being ""neutral and discrete"" while being ""similar to other airlines.""
""We are willing to review the guidelines again internally and make necessary changes if there is a wish to do so among our cabin crew globally,"" Lindström said at the time. ""It is certainly not our intention to offend or provoke anyone with our uniform guidelines, externally or internally.""
Though Norwegian Air allowed flight attendants to wear flat shoes on the airplane, The Independent reports the backlash crescendoed into an eventual fever-pitch, with critics saying that the airline operated according to the rules of a ""Mad Men Universe"" — a reference to the AMC show.
""It is almost comical that we face these issues in 2019,” a women’s spokesperson for the country’s Socialist Left Party told Norwegian newspaper VG . “While the rest of society has moved on, Norwegian is stuck in the Mad Men universe from the 1950’s and ‘60s."" The Norwegian Labour Party’s women’s spokesperson Anette Trettebergstuen said the dress code went way beyond simple uniform requirements. ""Uniform requirements are one thing, but to impose heels and makeup is going too far,” Trettebergstuen said. ""The year 1950 rang and it wants its rulebook back. This is super embarrassing and they should have progressed further.""
Following the backlash, an online petition began circulating that racked up 20,000 signatures demanding that Norwegian Air change the policy. The Independent reports that other airlines have already implemented similar changes.
""Last month, Aer Lingus announced it will not require female cabin crew to wear makeup or skirts anymore. The flag carrier airline of Ireland said it had made the decision in response to feedback sessions with staff across many departments,"" reports the outlet. ""This came after Virgin Atlantic revealed makeup and skirts would cease to be mandatory for female staff days earlier."" "

Far-left Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) attacked Israel on Sunday and defended the Palestinian terrorist attacks that targeted Israel over the weekend.
The Jerusalem Post reported that approximately 700 rockets were fired at Israel from Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip and that the Iron Dome intercepted approximately 173 of the rockets.
""Terror groups Hamas and Islamic jihad in Gaza have fired over 700 rockets at Israel since Friday, killing four Israelis and wounding dozens,"" The Jerusalem Post reported , adding : ""Defiant Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials said on Sunday that they don’t rule out the possibility that the current round of fighting in the Gaza Strip could lead to an all-out war with Israel.""
""The latest round of violence began two days ago when an Islamic Jihad sniper fired at Israeli troops, wounding two soldiers,"" Reuters reported .
Omar and Tlaib, who are both well-documented anti-Semites , rushed to attack Israel and defended the terrorism that was being carried out against Israel.
In response to a New York Times headline that stated that Palestinian terrorists had fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, Tlaib wrote on Twitter: ""When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free?

Omar took a more aggressive stance defending the terrorists, writing: ""How many more protesters must be shot, rockets must be fired, and little kids must be killed until the endless cycle of violence ends? The status quo of occupation and humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unsustainable. Only real justice can bring about security and lasting peace.""

On Sunday, after Hamas had launched hundreds of rockets indiscriminately at Israel and murdered Israelis while wounding scores of other Israelis, anti-Semitic Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) attacked Israel once again, blaming Israel for shooting “protesters” and insisting that Israel was occupying Gaza.
Rep. Liz Cheney, furious, fired back with a blistering tweet, blasting, “how many times will @IlhanMN rush to the defense of terrorists?”
Omar tweeted, “How many more protesters must be shot, rockets must be fired, and little kids must be killed until the endless cycle of violence ends? The status quo of occupation and humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unsustainable. Only real justice can bring about security and lasting peace.” How many more protesters must be shot, rockets must be fired, and little kids must be killed until the endless cycle of violence ends?

One conservative commenter decided to give Omar a short lesson in history, noting succinctly, “Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. There is no occupation.

Your attempt to blame Israel for the violence Hamas crates is telling and deplorable.” Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005. There is no occupation.

Cheney has aggressively countered Omar’s anti-Semitic rhetoric before; in March Cheney gave a statement to The Daily Wire in which she ripped House Democrats over their lame resolution condemning hate following Omar’s anti-Semitic rhetoric. Cheney stated, ""Today’s resolution vote was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism. While I stand whole heartedly against discrimination outlined in this resolution, the language before the House today did not address the issue that is front and center. Rep. Omar’s comments were wrong and she has proven multiple times that she embodies a vile, hate-filled, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel bigotry. She deserves to be rebuked, by name, and removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee so that there is no mistake about the values and priorities that the House stands for.""
Cheney continued, ""For Democratic leadership to kowtow to their radical members and refuse to offer legislative language that criticizes Rep. Omar’s statements in the strongest possible manner confirms what we already knew: that their party is controlled by far-left extremists who can’t even muster the courage to stand up to blatant anti-Semitism. This is a sad day for the House and Democrats’ lack of action is fully responsible for bringing us to this unfortunate moment.""
Omar twisting the facts about Israel and Hamas to fit her narrative is not unusual for her; this is the same woman who blamed the United States for killing “thousands” of Somalis in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, as The Daily Wire has reported, exaggerating the number of casualties and ignoring the fact that American forces were in Somali on a humanitarian mission to save starving Somalis and protect food and aid from being stolen by warring factions. Omar seemingly referred to U.S. forces as “Satan,” responding to a commenter who noted the number of American lives lost by tweeting, “In his selective memory, he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by the American forces that day! #NotTodaySatan .” In his selective memory, he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by the American forces that day! #NotTodaySatan https://t.co/wrFocrZymQ "

The usual suspects came out in support of the people who launched rockets at Israel over the weekend. Sadly, it is not surprising to see the likes of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) or Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) siding with terrorists. It should , of course, be surprising — shocking, even — for members of the United States Congress to express such views, but we are far past being shocked over terror-sympathizing among Democrats. Yet there is one thing — one little three-letter word — that makes this case significantly different. Reacting to what she considered an unfair headline in The New York Times, Tlaib tweeted this:
When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free? Headlines like this & framing it in this way just feeds into the continued lack of responsibility on Israel who unjustly oppress & target Palestinian children and families. #FreePalestine
Uh. ""Our?"" Tlaib does not call them just ""Palestinian people,"" or ""the Palestinian people,"" but instead adds the possessive ""our,"" transforming this from run-of-the-mill Democratic terror-sympathizing to a declaration of loyalty to a foreign entity. I don't think I'm making too much of this. We should all be profoundly disturbed to see a representative of the American government using the phrase ""our people"" in reference to those who are not American.
I have heard two excuses for this wording choice. One is that she meant it in a global sense. When she said ""our,"" she meant ""our"" as in ""the world's."" We are all one people, one world, etc. I would still have a problem with that kind of one-world rhetoric from an American politician, but that's clearly not what she meant. Besides, how would the media react if President Trump made a similar expression of global unity by referring to ""our Russian people""?
The other excuse is that Tlaib is a self-described ""Palestinian American,"" despite the fact she was born in Detroit. If she still considers Palestinians to be ""her people,"" how is that not an example of dual loyalty? How can we expect her to keep America's interest first at heart, and her constituents' interests at heart, if ""her people"" are in the Middle East?
Indeed, I probably do her a favor by accusing her of dual loyalty. In reality, there is little evidence that she is loyal to America at all. She already has a history of making anti-American statements. Consider how she described her feelings after 9-11:
“I immediately called my brothers and told them to be very careful who you hang out with. Telling my sisters, ‘Just be real careful out there,’ and being really afraid of my fellow Americans.”
Here Tlaib identifies herself as an American, but only in the context of expressing fear and suspicion of Americans. Now she tells us that Palestinians are her people. This is beyond merely concerning. It calls for an investigation, though none will be conducted for fear of ""racism"" charges. So we are stuck, it seems, with a congresswoman who is not an American first, and doesn't even pretend to be. "

On Monday, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) strayed from the far-left base of the Democratic Party and unapologetically voiced her support for Israel as Hamas launched hundreds of rockets at the nation.
""I condemn the rocket attacks on innocent civilians and stand in support of Israel and peace,"" the Democrat posted to Twitter. I condemn the rocket attacks on innocent civilians and stand in support of Israel and peace. — Kyrsten Sinema (@SenatorSinema) May 6, 2019
As noted by The Hill, Sinema spoke at an Arizona-based AIPAC event in February. ""Our support for a secure Israel as a beacon of democracy must remain unwavering,"" the Democrat wrote in a tweet.

Sinema is one of the few voices on the Left — certainly within the freshman class — expressing support for Israel, an ally of the United States, as the nation was indiscriminately bombarded by rockets this weekend.
For example, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), tweeted Sunday: ""When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free?

Rep. Omar has been routinely criticized for comments deemed anti-Semitic. In February, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) blasted Omar for her ""use of anti-Semitic tropes.""
""Congresswoman Omar’s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive,"" said a statement from Pelosi, co-signed by other party leaders, according to Politico. ""We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments.""
Pelosi, however, has since rationalized Omar’s comments, suggesting the Democrat did not know the ""full weight of the words."" The House speaker also went to bat for Omar when President Donald Trump attacked her for suggesting the 9/11 terror attack that killed 3,000 Americans was a mere instance when ""some people did something."""

""It's like déjà vu all over again,"" once quipped the ever-quotable New York Yankees Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra.
Has there ever been a more depressingly apt descriptor for the unrelenting horror of the dastardly duo of Muslim Brotherhood jihadist franchise Hamas and Iran-managed Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) teaming up to rain recalcitrant rocket fire hell on Israeli civilians?
This weekend marked yet another deeply tragic and harrowing time for our Israeli allies. Hamas, the genocidal Sunni sharia supremacist death cult democratically elected by a radicalized Gazan populace after then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's disastrous unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, combined with PIJ to rain approximately 700 missiles this past weekend upon Israeli civilian infrastructure. Due to a seemingly providential combination of jihadist technological incompetence and Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system having an 80+% success rate, the weekend death toll for Israelis was a mere — still deeply saddening — four.
Internal Palestinian-Arab politics are infamously messy. PIJ, which operates as somewhat of a rogue outfit in the Strip and takes direct orders from the terrorist Shiite regime in Tehran, first initiated this round of rocket escalation. But it is longtime Israeli policy to hold Hamas, which nominally governs Gaza, as solely responsible for all rockets fired from Gaza into Israel. And it is Hamas, furthermore, which shows increasingly strong gains throughout Judea and Samaria, where it repeatedly undercuts the kleptocratic , venal Palestinian Authority (PA) government. Indeed, Holocaust-denying PA chieftain Mahmoud Abbas, who is currently in the 14th year of his four-year term, refuses to hold elections due in no small measure to the fact that he knows Hamas would win them.
The Palestinian-Arabs are a wholly radicalized and generally Jew-hating populace. But don't take it from me: According to the liberal Anti-Defamation League's 2014 survey , an astounding 93% of Palestinian-Arabs hold anti-Semitic views. The following video from this past weekend is, as the adage goes, worth (at least) a thousand words: Palestinians in Gaza cheer and chant ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great) as rockets targeting Israeli civilians are launched from nearby. pic.twitter.com/I7vA5dpRfU — Avi Mayer (@AviMayer) May 4, 2019
This is not a healthy culture. Indeed, one cursory glance at the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict ought to axiomatically reveal the Left's multiculturalist idolatry as the massive lie that it is. All cultures are not, in fact, equal .
The upshot is that it is not at all clear what potentially gruesome horror might succeed Hamas in Gaza. True, some Gazans have recently taken to protesting Hamas quite publicly — but this is still a largely Jew-hating, pro-Islamist civilian population.
And yet, Israel — as a sovereign nation that has a moral duty to protect its civilians against enemy combatants, and which cannot be held to a different standard than any other nation of the world — increasingly has no choice but to act decisively. Indeed, with urban centers such as Tel Aviv now under threat from longer-range missiles, the situation is increasingly dire. In March, I laid out the case for Israel to utterly destroy Hamas once and for all:
Try as the Israel Defense Forces might to keep on "" mowing the grass"" when the ""infidel""-loathing jihadists of Hamas flare up in impulsive paroxysms of ""anti-Zionism"" Jew-hatred, the status quo in Gaza is completely unsustainable. No other sovereign country on Earth would deal so passively with such a cancerous threat living on its border — with its biggest civilian centers under constant fear of city-wide sirens signaling the incoming threat of crude Iran-manufactured rockets fired haphazardly from a bordering terroristic death cult. Indeed, no sovereign country on Earth should have to deal with such a threat. If the Sinaloa Cartel or Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion ever decided to shoot terrorist rockets at Texan or Arizonan ranchers, the United States would (rightfully) send in M1 Abrams tanks across the Rio Grande tomorrow. ...
It is long past time for the Israeli government to commence a full-on, comprehensive land/air invasion to hunt down and permanently root out every last one of the Hamas leadership there. Israel surely has no interest in formally re-annexing Gaza — calamitous as Sharon's withdrawal was, the Israeli government could not be any less interested in now re-absorbing the radicalized Arab populace there. And while the Israel Defense Forces would no doubt suffer high and tragic casualties as a result of a prolonged land invasion, one is forced to consider the tradeoff of inaction — the continuance of the status quo. And that status quo is truly terrible for all parties involved.
But in addition to the moral and strategic calculation of deciding whether to commence such a comprehensive land/air invasion, it is important to emphasize the timing aspect of such a decision. Specifically, it is imperative that Israel launch such an operation within — at the latest — the next calendar year.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads a right-wing, pro-Israeli sovereignty coalition, was just re-elected to once again lead the Jewish state. As Daniel Polisar recently explicated at the indispensable Mosaic Magazine, furthermore, Israel's decision to once again hand the reins of government to Netanyahu makes ample sense . A man forever hardened by the tragedy that befell his dear older brother Yoni in Entebbe, Bibi grasps the nature of genocidal, irredentist sharia supremacism in a way that perhaps no other Western leader can. In the bloody aftermath of the Oslo Accords-induced Second Intifada, Israelis trust Bibi to keep them safe. Period.
But not only does Israel have a present leader uniquely capable of summoning the will to plan and execute an extended land/air invasion to extirpate in Hamas in Gaza. From the perspective of American politics, the time to launch such an investigation is also right now . Because while the Jew-hating ignoramuses of the ""international community"" — best embodied by that wretched hive of Western values-hating scum and anti-Semitic villainy known as the United Nations — would inevitably howl and shriek regardless of any extended extra-territorial Israeli military operation, there can be no serious doubt that this, the most pro-Israel , pro-Jewish presidential administration in a century or more, would enthusiastically have Israel's physical and proverbial back.
Israel simply cannot risk waiting until the eve of the 2020 presidential election — not with a menagerie of anti-Israel dunderheads competing for the nomination of what is an increasingly openly anti-Semitic Democratic Party. A comprehensive Gaza operation to root out and destroy Hamas simply must be commenced with Trump as president. There is no other choice.
The status quo in Gaza is unsustainable. Israel has the best possible governing coalition to go in guns blazing and systemically eradicate a Sunni jihadist outfit raining perpetual hill on the Jewish state's civilians. Furthermore, the best possible American president is in office right now — although an election looms next year.
All that is missing is Netanyahu summoning the requisite political will to call the right shot."
Tiger Woods Criticized For Accepting Presidential Medal Of Freedom | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46835/tiger-woods-criticized-accepting-presidential-paul-bois,"Tiger Woods Criticized For Accepting Presidential Medal Of Freedom ""I can’t recall a business partner"" Andrew Redington / Staff / Getty Images May 6, 2019 views
In the age of President Trump, even renowned golfer Tiger Woods is great again — and that's just too much for some people. Ahead of the ceremony in which Woods is to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, critics immediately pounced on Woods for having a past business relationship with Donald Trump. But these same critics seemingly ignored the fact that Woods completed one of the greatest career comebacks in sports history by winning the Masters Tournament a month ago.
According to Fox News , several journalists and social media and various publications took Woods to task for previously partnering with the Trump business empire, which arguably may have contributed to Woods not criticizing the president upon his election in 2016. From the way The New York Times put it, Woods has been a protege of Trump's since the late 1990s.
Since then, Mr. Trump has named a villa after him at the Trump National Doral Miami. He has also gone into business abroad with Mr. Woods, announcing in 2014 that the golfer would design a course in Dubai as part of a luxury residential megaproject that would be managed by the Trump Organization.
On Monday, Mr. Trump is set to once again seize Mr. Woods’s moment. At the White House, he will present Mr. Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in honor of his Masters victory last month, a stunning personal comeback that put him back on top of the sports world at age 43, after a decade-long championship drought.
The Times report later went on to characterize Trump's award to Tiger Woods as a mix of ""hero worship and opportunism,"" suggesting that it may be a ploy to bring a prominent black athlete to the White House as other athletes (football and basketball players) have boycotted.
Of course, President Obama gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom Award to Oprah Winfrey, who was one of his biggest celebrity allies during the 2008 election. While Tiger Woods may indeed have been a business partner with Trump, he never actively campaigned on the president's behalf. Kyle C. Kopko, a professor at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, claims that Obama's ties to Oprah pale in comparison to Trump and Woods.
""I can’t recall a business partner,"" Kopko told the Times. ""I can’t think of something like this, where Tiger is designing a golf course for Trump. I can’t think of another parallel.""
Tiger Woods took flack from leftists in 2018 when he urged people to respect the office of the president, as noted by Fox News.
""He's the president of the United States. You have to respect the office. No matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office,"" Woods said at the time , earning the ire of ESPN commentator Max Kellerman.
""Well, I’ve known Donald for a number of years,"" Woods added at the time. ""We've played golf together. We've had dinner together. I've known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency.""
In response to the attacks, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the president honored Woods due to his athletic pedigree.
""The president thinks Tiger is not only a tremendous athlete but also has a great comeback story,"" said Sanders. ""He is undisputed as one of the great golfers in history and has broken barriers in the game."""
"Kamala Harris Refuses To Accept Election Results In Florida, Georgia | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46820/kamala-harris-refuses-accept-election-results-ashe-schow,"Kamala Harris Refuses To Accept Election Results In Florida, Georgia Ethan Miller/Getty Images May 6, 2019 views
Just as in 2016, Democrats and their media supporters are suggesting President Donald Trump may not accept the results of the 2020 election. At the same time, these same people are ignoring that it is actually Democrats who are refusing to accept election results.
In early April, Rolling Stone published an article asking, “Will Trump Accept the Results of the 2020 Election?” On Saturday, The New York Times published an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) where she warned Democrats they needed to win decisively in 2020 so Trump couldn’t challenge the results.
But as Democrats and the media suggest Trump will not accept the results of an election he loses, politicians on the Left actually aren’t accepting the results of elections they lose.
During her speech to the Detroit, Michigan, chapter of the NAACP, 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) claimed that voter suppression led to Democrat losses in Florida and Georgia in 2018, echoing the claims of the two candidates who lost those races.
“Let’s say this loud and clear – without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia, Andrew Gillum is the governor of Florida. So, the truth is, we need a new Voting Rights Act.” Sen. @KamalaHarris speaks to Detroit @NAACP : ""Let's say this loud and clear -- without voter suppression, @StaceyAbrams would be the governor of Georgia, @AndrewGillum is the governor of Florida. So the truth is we need a new Voting Rights Act."" pic.twitter.com/j37Rjkhcmb — The Hill (@thehill) May 6, 2019
Each of these candidates have refused to concede their elections. Abrams is on a countrywide tour claiming she actually won. Just last week she told an audience that she refuses to concede. In that same speech, she also bragged about increasing Democrat turnout, so it’s hard to see how she still gets away with the absurd claim that voters were suppressed.
""I won because we transformed the electorate, we turned out people who had never voted, we outmatched every Democrat in Georgia history,"" Abrams said.
She did not win but she did transform the electorate. The number of people who voted in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race was double the number who voted in the same race in 2014.
Abrams lost and simply refuses to accept it.
Gillum hasn’t been on a U.S. whining tour like Abrams, but he did tell HBO “Real Time” host Bill Maher back in March that votes weren’t counted in Florida.
“Had we been able to legally count every one of those votes not just in Florida but in Georgia, I wonder what the outcome may be,” he claimed.
As The Daily Wire previously reported, Democrats aren’t calling the Florida election illegitimate, even if Gillum does.
And we can’t forget that Hillary Clinton still refuses to accept she lost the 2016 presidential race because she was a bad candidate. She has blamed everyone and everything from racism, sexism, Russians, former FBI Director James Comey, and more for why Trump won over her. She simply can’t accept that she ran a bad campaign that assumed she’d win all the states that voted for President Barack Obama and ignored activists on the ground warning her they needed more resources.
Clinton set the tone for the Democrat Party in 2016, and others have just been following suit since then. Maybe Trump will refuse to accept a loss in 2020, but we can pretty much guarantee that Democrats will refuse to accept the results if and when they lose next year. "
Trump: Mueller Should Not Testify | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46810/trump-mueller-should-not-testify-james-barrett,"May 6, 2019 views
Amid reports Sunday that Democratic Judiciary Committee members are attempting to schedule Special Counsel Robert Mueller to testify on May 15, President Trump offered his unequivocal opinion on the issue: ""Bob Mueller should not testify,"" the president tweeted Sunday. ""No redos for the Dems!""
As Politico noted Sunday, Democratic Judiciary Committee member Rep. David Cicilline (RI) told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the committee has tentatively scheduled Mueller to testify on May 15; the congressman later issued a clarification on Twitter. ""Just to clarify: we are aiming to bring Mueller in on the 15th, but nothing has been agreed to yet,"" wrote Cicilline on Sunday. ""That’s the date the Committee has proposed, and we hope the Special Counsel will agree to it. Sorry for the confusion."" Just to clarify: we are aiming to bring Mueller in on the 15th, but nothing has been agreed to yet. That’s the date the Committee has proposed, and we hope the Special Counsel will agree to it. Sorry for the confusion. https://t.co/FfR8ReLmkp — David Cicilline (@davidcicilline) May 5, 2019
Politico notes that the chairman of the committee, Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler (NY), has also said that the committee is trying to schedule Mueller to testify on May 15.
While the White House has said that they will not attempt to prevent Mueller's testimony, Trump took the Twitter to express his disapproval of Democrats trying to get ""redos"" on the special counsel's final report.
""After spending more than $35,000,000 over a two year period, interviewing 500 people, using 18 Trump Hating Angry Democrats & 49 FBI Agents — all culminating in a more than 400 page Report showing NO COLLUSION - why would the Democrats in Congress now need Robert Mueller to testify,"" he said in a series of Mueller-themed tweets (tweets below). ""Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION. Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!""
Politico suggests that if Trump's tweet is ""interpreted by the attorney general as a direct order to stifle Mueller’s testimony,"" it ""could set up the most consequential legal question related to the special counsel’s probe: whether executive privilege can be used to stop an executive branch employee from testifying about an investigation into the president.""
A few hours later, Trump posted some more Mueller-related tweets, comparing Mueller to fired FBI Director James Comey, slamming the Democrats' use of their committees as ""bullying"" their opponents, and highlighting the role Comey played in helping to get the Russia collusion investigation rolling.
Quoting former Whitewater independent counsel Robert Ray, Trump tweeted: ""The Report sounded an awful lot as being Comeyesque, in other words, I’m not going to charge this person (there wasn’t even close to being a crime), but I’m going to criticize him on the way out the door. That’s unfortunate because it’s stepping outside of the role.""
He followed up that quote with another by The Wall Street Journal's Jason Riley: ""This is not Congressional Oversight, this is bullying.""
Trump then retweeted a post by Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, who wrote: ""Comey’s FBI sent undercover agents to spy on @realDonaldTrump’s campaign. It’s a stunning revelation of the lengths the Obama administration went. Instead of a phony Russia collusion investigation, we actually need to investigate how this whole hoax started.""
Trump continued to slam the Democrats' ""obstruction"" impeachment strategy on Monday morning, quoting One America News Network: ""'Democrat Texas Congressman Al Green says impeachment is the only thing that can prevent President Trump from re-election in 2020.'"" Trump added: ""In other words, Dems can’t win the election fairly. You can’t impeach a president for creating the best economy in our country’s history....Also, there are 'No High Crimes & Misdemeanors,' No Collusion, No Conspiracy, No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, and that’s what the Dems should be looking at, but they won’t. Nevertheless, the tables are turning!""

""Saturday Night Live"" alum Rob Schneider went on a Twitter tirade this past weekend against the Big Tech giants who have all colluded with Democrats to promote an ""Orwellian nightmare of censorship,"" according to Fox News .
""We are in a real world Orwellian nightmare of censorship. Be careful who you label and smear today. You will be the smeared tomorrow,"" Schneider wrote on Saturday.
The comedian was going on the offensive against the Poynter list of ""unreliable news sources"" that was eventually scrapped because, as it hilariously turned out, the Poynter list was itself unreliable.

On Sunday, Schneider went on another tirade against Facebook for booting several far-right figures from the platform, such as Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos. The ban also included one far-left figure, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
""Free Speech is ALL SPEECH! The UK and Australia don’t have protected speech. And we are not protecting our 1st Amendment. #EternalVigilance,"" Schneider tweeted. Free Speech is ALL SPEECH!

Ironically, Schneider quoted far-left professor Noam Chomsky to illustrate his point about free speech and censorship. ""As America’s greatest linguist Noam Chomsky says,’Free Speech is ALL SPEECH. You’re either for ALL of it or NONE of it.’ (Emphisis 4 dummies),"" Schneider tweeted alongside a photo of the quote itself.
""Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you’re really in favor of free speech, then you’re in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise.

Schneider experienced his intellectual departure from the Democratic Party several years ago and has been seemingly waging a war on destructive political correctness ever since. In April of last year, he took his former stomping grounds of ""Saturday Night Live"" to task for ruining the show with leftist politics .
""The fun of 'Saturday Night Live' was always you never knew which way they leaned politically,"" Schneider told the New York Daily News at the time. ""You kind of assumed they would lean more left and liberal, but now the cat's out of the bag they are completely against Trump, which I think makes it less interesting because you know the direction the piece is going.""
Schneider also took aim at Alec Baldwin's current portrayal of President Trump in comparison to his former co-star Dana Carvey's portrayal of President George H.W. Bush. Beneath the satire, according to Schneider, the latter showed affection for the president while the former only has disdain.
""Carvey played it respectfully,"" Schneider said. ""To me, the genius of Dana Carvey was Dana always had empathy for the people he played, and Alec Baldwin has nothing but a fuming, seething anger toward the person he plays.""
For that reason, Schneider says Baldwin is ""hard to watch"" because his motives are just too obvious. ""Alec Baldwin is a brilliant actor… he's not a comedian,"" Schneider flatly shared."
"Code Pink Leftists Take Over Venezuelan Embassy In Washington, D.C., Taunt Actual Venezuelans | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46841/leftists-take-over-venezuelan-embassy-washington-emily-zanotti,"Code Pink Leftists Take Over Venezuelan Embassy In Washington, D.C., Taunt Actual Venezuelans Photo Credit: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images May 6, 2019 views
A group of around 50 leftists, organized by the far-left, pro-Communist organization, Code Pink, has taken up residence in the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, D.C., in order to ""prevent"" the new Venezuelan government from taking over from Nicolas Maduro's team of diplomats, who vacated the embassy last month.
Towards the end of last week and over the weekend, Venezuelans who support opposition leader Juan Guaido, also began protesting around the embassy in an effort to educate the mostly white, uniformly American demonstrators inside on the realities of Maduro's dictatorship.
The Code Pink protesters were, reportedly, not amused.
The dueling protests have clashed, sometimes violently, since Thursday of last week, when the pro-opposition protesters joined together to form a human chain around the Venezuelan embassy, preventing new Code Pink and pro-Communist occupiers from entering the building, and blocking deliveries of food. Fox News reports that the Code Pink-ers retaliated by playing pro-Communist anthems, screaming taunts into bullhorns, and sitting down in front of the Venezuelans.
The Code Pink group, led by longtime leftist stalwart Medea Benjamin, says they have no plans to leave until the embassy has returned to Maduro's hands, and that they have permission from the Maduro government to remain inside. Officials tied to the Maduro government have even provided them keycards and security codes for the building.
“We feel that the elected government and the government that holds power and the government that’s recognized by the United Nations is the Maduro government, and they deserve to have their embassy here,” Benjamin told Fox News in an interview late last week. “That’s why we’ve been here.”
Photos of Benjamin's cohorts show a mostly non-Venezuelan crew , and the Venezuelan protesters have noticed, often referring to the Code Pink protesters as ""occupiers,"" according to one reporter from Vox who spent the day at the protest last week.
""We're doing our part from wherever we are around the world to bring light into the Venezuelan plight. And there's invaders in our embassy that are not Venezuelans,"" one pro-Venezuelan protester even told CNN . ""This is the Venezuelan people for Venezuelan democracy; this is not about right or left in the world. I hope and I beg that people don't use my country and the suffering of my people for their own personal flags that have nothing to do with what's going on.""
Occasionally, Benjamin and others, including Code Pink co-president Ariel Gold, will try to ""educate"" the Venezuelan ex-pats — an effort that often results in embarrassing confrontations like the one captured by Vox Media, in which an elderly, white, American protester attempts to explain Venezuela to a Venezuelan.
WATCH: — Alex Ward (@AlexWardVox) May 2, 2019
Other pro-Communist protesters have tried doing public relations for Maduro. Kevin Zeese, the 63-year-old career leftist in charge of the pro-Maduro group, ""Popular Resistance,"" explained to Vox's reporter (while clad in a Hugo Chavez tee shirt that read, ""Chauvistas"") that Maduro is not a dictator and that he had friend who had visited the country and found only limited poverty.
Over the weekend, pro-Venezuelan protesters tried fighting back against the taunts by reading aloud a list of people killed by Maduro's regime.
The State Department called Benjamin's crew, ""trespassers,"" but admitted that they can't remove the group by force since the embassy is technically Venezuelan territory. Even the Secret Service, which is guarding the embassy and trying to diffuse tension between the two groups of protesters, can't go inside."
"REPORT: Flint, Michigan Administrators Mismanaged Clean Water Funds, Hired Firm With No Experience Replacing Pipes | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46852/report-flint-michigan-administrators-mismanaged-emily-zanotti,"May 6, 2019 views
A new report from The Daily Caller claims that the city of Flint, Michigan, which has suffered from a headline-commanding water crisis for half a decade, may have steered tens of millions in aid money meant to help replace lead water pipes to a contractor that had no experience, but who did have a close relationship with Flint city officials.
The controversy may go straight to the top: to the Flint mayor's office.
The Caller reports that $22 million in ""water crisis aid"" was directed to a company with ties to city officials, even though that company didn't have experience replacing leaded water pipes — what the aid money was meant to help do.
Administrators in charge of the project also ignored cost-saving models that would have allowed water replacement companies to test for older pipes before digging up huge swaths of land, opting instead to follow a plan that had contractors digging up yard after yard to replace water pipes, even if they found copper or new piping underground.
""The city prohibited contractors from using an efficient method of digging holes known as hydrovac excavation,"" a Flint councilwoman told the Caller. ""That leveled the playing field for a contractor, WT Stevens, with no experience or the appropriate equipment — and let it bill far more to taxpayers, she says. All of these factors, [the councilwoman] adds, needlessly led to more waiting for anyone who actually has lead pipes.""
They ""chose to dig up yards that they knew were copper, and they decided to hand dig instead of hydrovac,” the councilwoman said. ""That was because WT Stevens didn’t have the ability, and you get more money [digging by hand]. It costs $250 [to hydrovac] versus thousands to dig a large hole without the equipment.""
Flint's mayor, Karen Weaver, and one key Flint city councilman, Eric Mays, both appear to have cozy relationships with WT Stevens, and supported the contractor even when the work looked shoddy. The pair were also behind the decision to dig up every yard looking for lead pipes, even though a University of Michigan study was able to predict where the problematic lead pipes were with stunning 94% accuracy.
The ""predictive model"" could be extrapolated, Flint clean water activists said, but WT Stevens dug up areas where there were no predicted lead pipes in ""exploratory"" projects.
This latest revelation is one of just a handful of discoveries that have called aspects of the nearly billion-dollar Flint clean water rescue program into question. Flint's water systems had a lead problem that came to light when state administrators made the decision to shift Flint from the costly Detroit water system to a cheaper local system in an effort to save the city from descending into bankruptcy. Once the shifts began to occur, authorities discovered that Flint's infrastructure had been completely neglected for decades, leaving Flint citizens exposed to dangerous levels of lead in their drinking water.
Since then, state and federal officials estimate that more than half a billion dollars has been allocated to alleviate Flint's water issues, but that a great deal of that money has been mismanaged. Besides the $22 million in pipe replacement contracts and a similarly mismanaged wastewater contract, a whistleblower lawsuit is currently making its way through federal court, alleging that Flint's mayor, Karen Weaver, diverted money meant to help Flint's citizens to her campaign coffers.
Flint's water has been safe to drink since early 2017 , according to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the amount of lead in the water has continued to fall to where it is now well below levels considered ""safe"" by the federal government and the National Resources Defense Council.

Poll: It's Clearly Biden Vs.

Trump In 2020 Biden blowing out other contenders Angela Rowlings/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images May 6, 2019 views
It’s looking like it will be former Vice President Joe Biden who will face-off against President Trump in 2020, if a new poll is an accurate reflection of Democratic voters.
A Hill-Harris poll released on Monday showed Biden with a whopping 32-point lead over the second-place finisher, Senator Bernie Sanders, 46% to 14%. Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in third place at 8%; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) garnered 7%. Mallory Newall, the director of research at Ipsos Public Affairs, commented, ""Biden has seen a little bit of a bump from his announcement, anywhere from 12 to 15 percentage points in most polls that I've seen. I think his standing is strong at this point but again, you have to keep in mind that he is by far the best known in the race.""
As The Hill noted, “Polls taken since the former vice president's official declaration have shown him receiving support in the upper 30s to lower 40s, about twice as much as Sanders, his next closest rival.”
The rest of the field: California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris (6%), former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with 3% each; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), former HUD secretary Julian Castro , former Rep. John Delaney (D-MD), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) all received 2% or lower.
No other candidate received more than 1%.
Two candidates who seemed to be catching fire early in the campaign, Harris and O’Rourke, have faltered badly. As The Daily Wire reported Monday:
A new poll of Iowa, New Hampshire & South Carolina Democratic primary voters reveals that erstwhile leading candidates Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) lag far behind numerous other candidates.
The Firehouse-Optimus poll found that in Iowa, Harris garnered only 4.9% of the vote, with O’Rourke trailing her at 2.7%. The two candidates fell far behind former Vice President Joe Biden, at 34.9%, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at 13.7%, Pete Buttigieg, at 11.4%, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, with 10.4%.
In New Hampshire, Biden got 34.%, Sanders 15.5%, Buttigieg 9.7%, Warren 9.1%. Harris 7.0%, and O’Rourke 3.0%. In South Carolina, Biden garnered 48.3%, Sanders 11.9%, Buttigieg 5.2%, Warren 4.5%. Harris 4.3%, and O’Rourke 1.2%.
Biden’s numbers seem to be holding up despite various hits he has taken recently, including his son Hunter’s alleged connection to a Ukrainian political corruption scandal, of which The New York Times reported that new information showed “how Hunter Biden and his American business partners were part of a broad effort by Burisma to bring in well-connected Democrats during a period when the company was facing investigations backed not just by domestic Ukrainian forces but by officials in the Obama administration.""
Other hits: reports that Biden’s staffers were reportedly physically blocking off reporters from covering the Democrat on the 2020 campaign trail, presumably at the candidate’s directive, as The Daily Wire reported. Another : a racially-charged clip of Biden from 2007 discussing condom use in the black community and AIDS testing."
GA Governor Signing ‘Heartbeat Bill’ : I’m Not Worried About What Hollywood Thinks Of Me | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46849/ga-governor-signing-heartbeat-bill-im-not-worried-hank-berrien,"May 6, 2019 views
On Tuesday, despite the specter of Hollywood actors pushing for a boycott, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will sign the ""heartbeat"" abortion bill, according to Fox News .
Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC), ""I can't govern because I'm worried about what someone in Hollywood thinks about me. I ran the last two years on these issues, and I got elected with the largest number of votes in the history of the state of Georgia, and I'm doing what I told people I would do … Our business environment’s good. We cannot change our values of who we are for money. And we’re not going to do that. That’s what makes our state great.""
Staci Fox of Planned Parenthood Southeast told AJC, “We warned them - we will see you in court, Governor Kemp. And we are coming for their seats.”
AJC noted that Georgia hosted 455 productions last fiscal year, generating $9.5 billion in economic impact and $2.7 billion in direct spending.
The “heartbeat bill,” H.B. 481, states that the “full value of a child begins when a heartbeat exists”; requires “physicians performing abortions to determine the existence of a detectable human heartbeat before performing an abortion,” states “it shall be the policy of the State of Georgia to recognize unborn children as natural persons,” and asserts “unless otherwise provided by law, any natural person, including an unborn child with a detectable human heartbeat, shall be included in population based determinations.”
As The Daily Wire reported in late March, 50 actors who fancied themselves paragons of morality sent a letter written by abortion advocate Alyssa Milano to Georgia House Speaker David Ralston and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp threatening the state of Georgia with a boycott if the state passed H.B. 481, the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act, also known as the “heartbeat bill.”
The letter stated:
As actors, our work often brings us to Georgia. We’ve always found your state to be populated with friendly and caring people. We’ve found the hotels in which we stay and restaurants in which we dine while filming there to be comfortable and of a high quality. We’ve been glad to bring millions of dollars in revenue to support Georgia’s schools, parks and communities. But we cannot in good conscience continue to recommend our industry remain in Georgia if H.B. 481 becomes law.
This dangerous and deeply-flawed bill mimics many others which have already been deemed unconstitutional. As men who identify as small-government conservatives, we remind you that government is never bigger than when it is inside a woman’s body or in her doctor’s office. This bill would remove the possibility of women receiving reproductive healthcare before most even know they are pregnant and force many women to undergo unregulated, hidden procedures at great risk to their health.
We can’t imagine being elected officials who had to say to their constituents, “I enacted a law that was so evil, it chased billions of dollars out of our state’s economy.” It’s not the most effective campaign slogan, but rest assured we’ll make it yours should it come to pass. This is the precipice on which you stand. We want to stay in Georgia. We want to continue to support the wonderful people, businesses and communities we have come to love in the Peach State. But we will not do so silently, and we will do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women if H.B. 481 becomes law. You have a choice, gentlemen. We pray you make the right one."
"NYT Editorial Board: 'Congress, Give Trump His Border Money' | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46851/nyt-editorial-board-congress-give-trump-his-border-james-barrett,"views
Yes, you read that right, but, no, The New York Times editorial board explicitly does not mean money for his ""big, beautiful"" wall. Nonetheless, the nation's left-leaning newspaper of record is conceding that not only is there a crisis at the southern border — as Trump has been hammering repeatedly and Democrats have been denying obstinately for months — it's so severe that the Times is actually calling for Democrats to put aside ""political gamesmanship"" and do the one thing they're most committed not to do: actually work with Trump to do something good for the country when it comes to illegal immigration.
""President Trump is right: There is a crisis at the southern border. Just not the one he rants about,"" the Times editorial board writes in an editorial published Sunday.
What is supposedly not happening at the border, according to the Times, is undocumented people secretly crossing over who pose a national security risk. There's ""no invasion of murderers, drug cartels or terrorists,"" the Times confidently underscores — though the nature of illegal immigration is that we do not know who has entered the country, and we do have a lot of evidence of drug cartels operating on the border. That said, the editorial board lays out the aspects of the crisis they are willing to admit is in fact happening:
But as record numbers of Central American families flee violence and poverty in their homelands, they are overwhelming United States border systems, fueling a humanitarian crisis of overcrowding, disease and chaos. The Border Patrol is now averaging 1,200 daily arrests, with many migrants arriving exhausted and sick. Last week, a teenage boy from Guatemala died in government custody, the third death of a minor since December. As resources are strained and the system buckles, the misery grows.
The ""misery"" has grown so intense and widereaching that our lawmakers must actually do something — and ""soon."" And what's blocking this action? Well, business as usual in Washington, the Times suggests: ""political gamesmanship once again threatens to hold up desperately needed resources.""
The Times then acknowledges that the Trump White House has issued a rather reasonable request of $4.5 billion for emergency funding to help manage what it aptly describes as a crisis caused by ""alarming numbers"" of migrants arriving at the southern border, in particular unaccompanied minors:
In a letter to lawmakers, the acting director of the White House’s budget office, Russell Vought, sought to convey the scope of the challenge. “In February, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered more than 76,000 illegal border crossers and inadmissible aliens, and in March that number exceeded 100,000 — the highest monthly level in more than a decade,” Mr. Vought wrote. He described what he said were “alarming numbers” of women and children jammed into Border Patrol stations never intended as long-term shelters.
The Times faults the request for being ""light on specifics"" but notes that none if it goes to the wall and that it earmarks a majority of the funds, $3.3 billion, for humanitarian needs, specifically directing much of it to the agency that handles unaccompanied minors.
The only ""nonstarter""in the request for Democrats is the $700 million that goes to ""shoring up border security operations, including increasing the number of detention beds overseen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement."" The board expresses some sympathy with Democrats on the issue but suggests, ""until better policies are in place, Democrats need to find a way to provide money for adequate shelter."""
The Truth About Serving In Gaza From An Israeli Soldier | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46860/truth-about-serving-gaza-israeli-soldier-daily-wire,"The Truth About Serving In Gaza From An Israeli Soldier
Jonathan D. is a soldier who served in the IDF. This is his story.
In 2014, after being pounded by Hamas rocket fire, and with pregnant women and senior citizens forced to run to bomb shelters ten times per day, the IDF finally invaded Gaza, both to stop the rocket fire and to destroy the tunnels dug from Gaza into Israel. We, the 101st Paratroopers Battalion, were sent with combat engineers into a neighborhood of Khan Yunis called Khirbet Ekh’zeiah, which has a gorgeous and imposing mosque at its center.
Almost every building in this civilian area had mortars or other weapons inside. While we were searching the neighborhood, one big tunnel was discovered by our combat engineers in the basement of the mosque. The tunnel led directly across the border and popped up under an Israeli kindergarten. Imagine what Hamas fighters would do to Israeli children if they had managed to use the tunnel as planned. To any reasonable person, this mosque was now a legitimate target. If you use a mosque for military purposes, do not be surprised when you get a military response. If my shul were used as a staging ground for attacks on Muslim kindergartners, I would, at minimum, find a new shul.
So the combat engineers got to work figuring out what to do, while we set a perimeter around the area. But we were above ground. During this time, three subterranean Hamas fighters emerged from the tunnel in the mosque, and shot and killed two of our combat engineers. My close friend Chayim had to run into the firefight, carrying out the engineer St. Sergeant Guy Boyland as he bled out and screamed, dying in Chayim’s arms. The three Hamas fighters were killed in the ensuing battle.
This was the last straw for the mosque. The combat engineers demolished it along with the tunnel underneath — a totally legitimate military operation. I took a picture of the mosque as the sight was truly awful. A house of worship destroyed is always a tragedy, and Jews have enough of this in our history to be sensitive. But wait until you see how this mosque was used by Western media.
Before discussing that, take a moment to consider just how evil Hamas’ tactics were here. In the service of murdering Israeli kindergartners, they tunneled beneath a mosque in their own densely-populated neighborhood, with tens of thousands of residents living in eight square blocks, perversely relying on Israel’s humanity to prevent it from striking innocent people. And despite the budget to build these expensive, reinforced concrete tunnels, they have not built any bomb shelters for their own people (except, of course, the Hamas leadership). We (the IDF) did not have to lose Guy, or any of the other 75 soldiers sacrificed during this war. We could have simply napalmed the area and been done with it. But we didn’t, to protect Gazan civilians. My fellow soldiers and I risked our lives for innocent Gazans as much as for Israelis.
I personally guided a group of 50 Gazan women and children away from the fighting, to safety, risking exposure to Hamas sniper fire. Congresswoman Tlaib now accuses me and my fellow soldiers of ""targeting children and families."" This is a libel, and she should be laughed out of polite society. Unfortunately, she and her ilk have enablers.
After my release from the army, I studied at Columbia University in Manhattan. I love Columbia, and do not think it is nearly as anti-Israel as is often claimed in the media. But there are certainly many examples of a deeply sinister view of Israel widely held on campus.
For example, I attended one particular event led by Avner Gvaryahu of Breaking the Silence, a group that claims to speak the truth on behalf of combat veterans who are uncomfortable with what they did while serving. In reality, the group, with European funding, goes around the world painting a picture of half-truths about the IDF’s conduct. And, as we all know, half-truths told to ignorant masses are often more damaging than outright lies, which can be more straightforwardly debunked.
Breaking the Silence had compiled a deeply misleading report about the 2014 war against Hamas, called “This is How We Fought in Gaza.” Even a cursory reading leaves one with the impression that Israel is a brutal, trigger-happy oppressor. I read the report, curious to see if it would match my experience. And before even opening the book, I saw the gray, haunting photo on the cover: The mosque. The same mosque as the one I photographed. No context, none of the story I outlined above.
I asked Gvaryahu whether he thought the cover of the report conveyed a fair implication of what happened to this mosque. Wouldn’t knowing the context significantly change a reader’s understanding of the story here? He had no answer – clearly he was not expecting somebody who had actually fought there to confront him in New York. He mumbled something about the cover photo not being related to any of the testimonies in the report, which does not help his case. The impression the reader gets immediately is, “Wow, Israel is awful for blowing up a mosque. Why should we believe the IDF is a ‘moral army’?” Gvaryahu and his organization have concocted a work of political propaganda.
And so we see one striking example of the dishonesty in academia that filters into Western media, all of which manifests as Hamas apologetics. Roger Cohen at the NY Times routinely cites Breaking the Silence in his laments about the “corrosion of Israel’s soul,"" to admiring nods of agreement from his ideological kin. And while I do wish Israeli soldiers would grapple more fully with the violence necessary to counter threats from its neighbors, that is an internal societal issue, not one to be dumbed down for Western media consumption and narrative-pushing. Breaking the Silence, and NGOs like it, should be considered just as dishonest as the Southern Poverty Law Center and other discredited hack organizations. And those who cite Breaking the Silence should do so at the cost of their credibility.
It is quite strange to experience something up close, and then to watch trusted sources twist and mangle the actual story so fully that the conclusion drawn by the reader is the opposite of what occurred. But this is, unfortunately, often the case in Western countries today when it comes to Israel and Gaza. We should not be surprised to see the same thing happening now as happened five years ago.
I hope there are enough fair and decent Americans to sympathize with the impossible situation in which IDF troops find themselves, and to vote accordingly. Israel is our ally, and must remain so."
No Mocking AOC: Popular Ocasio-Cortez Parody Account Banned From Twitter; Creator Speaks Out | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46867/no-mocking-aoc-popular-ocasio-cortez-parody-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 7, 2019 views
A popular Twitter account mocking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was hit with a permanent ban after apparently gaining too much steam on the big tech platform. The account, which clearly indicated itself as ""parody"" in its Twitter name, amassed over 85,000 followers before Twitter shut it down for unclear reasons.
The politico who created and manned the account, Mike Morrison, also had his personal account permanently banned. Morrison, who believes the bans were politically motivated, had nearly 60,000 followers before his seemingly unprovoked exile.
According to screenshots provided by Morrison to Human Events, Twitter acknowledges that clearly-marked parody accounts are allowed but Morrison’s content posted to the AOC parody account was apparently too similar to comments actually made by the socialist.
""You may not register or create fake and misleading accounts. While you may use Twitter pseudonymously or as a parody, commentary, or fan account, you may not use misleading account information in order to engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive behavior, include attempts to manipulate the conversations on Twitter,"" an email from Twitter said.
""You may also not ‘post duplicative or substantially similar content, replies, or mentions over multiple accounts or multiple duplicate updates on one account or create duplicate or substantially similar accounts,'"" the email to Morrison added.
Human Events noted that Morrison’s mock-AOC account followed their rules with regard to online parody:
Twitter rules require all parody, newsfeed, commentary, and fan accounts to indicate “non-affiliation” in both the account name and bio. The AOC Press Release parody account used the word “parody” in both its account name and biography.
""I think Twitter banned AOC Press for the increasing amounts of attention it’s been receiving lately,"" Morrison said of the ban.
""In the past month and a half alone the account grew by roughly 50,000 followers. We’ve had tweets with over 30,000 likes on them, so I think Twitter decided it was time for [the account] to go,"" he claimed. ""They didn’t like how popular an account created by their political opposition had become.""
Late last month, outspoken conservative and award-winning actor James Woods was locked out of his massive Twitter, which has over 2 million followers. As reported by The Daily Wire, Sarah Miller, Woods’ girlfriend, posted a screenshot of an email the actor received from Twitter, which claims Woods was locked out of his account for ""violating"" Twitter rules ""against abusive behavior.""
""If you try to kill the King, you better not miss. #HangThemAll,"" the tweet supposedly in violation from the actor said.
Keeping in line with the theme of online censorship, Facebook and Instagram (which is owned by Facebook, Inc.) permanently banned so-called ""dangerous individuals and organizations"" from their accounts on Thursday. Infowars founder Alex Jones, self-described investigative journalist Laura Loomer, Infowars’ Paul Joseph Watson, provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan were among those included in the de-platforming."

Anti-Trump FBI Agent Suspected CIA Was Behind Leaks To Media In Trump-Russia Probe | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Joseph Curl,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46873/anti-trump-fbi-agent-suspected-cia-was-behind-joseph-curl,"Anti-Trump FBI Agent Suspected CIA Was Behind Leaks To Media In Trump-Russia Probe Chip Somodevilla / Staff / Getty Images May 7, 2019 views
Former FBI agent Peter Strzok appears to have suspected that the Central Intelligence Agency was orchestrating leaks to the media about alleged contacts between members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, several of which turned out to be wildly inaccurate.
Strzok — who together with his lover, then-Bureau lawyer Lisa Page, expressed their desire to use law enforcement power to “stop” Donald Trump from becoming president — said in an April 2017 email that signs pointed to the agency's involvement.
""I'm beginning to think the agency got info a lot earlier than we thought and hasn’t shared it completely with us. Might explain all these weird/seemingly incorrect leads all these media folks have. Would also highlight agency as source of some of the leaks,"" Strzok wrote in an email to FBI colleagues.
The revelation comes after Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked Michael K. Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, if he had probed whether the CIA was involved in leaking to the media.
Along with the April 2017 email, the two senators cite a December 2016 text message that Strzok — who was serving as the top investigator on the Trump-Russia probe — sent to Page, with whom he was having an affair.
""Think our sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried and political, they’re kicking in to overdrive,"" Strzok wrote.
""Strzok did not identify a specific leak, but a day earlier, NBC News broke a bombshell story that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in the U.S. election hacks. The story was sourced to 'senior U.S. intelligence officials,'"" The Daily Caller wrote. Strzok's April email referred to a report by The Guardian, titled ""British spies were first to spot Trump team’s links with Russia,"" which, as The Daily Caller notes, ""appears to have raised his suspicion that the CIA, which is referred to in government circles as 'the agency,' had intelligence that had not been shared with the FBI.""
The two Republican senators say the emails and text messages should prompt a probe into the intelligence community's involvement. The messages ""demonstrate the need to investigate leaks from agencies or entities other than FBI,"" said Johnson, the Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman, and Grassley, who is the Senate Finance Committee chairman.
""For example, who are the 'sisters' and what does it mean to say that the 'sisters have [been] leaking like mad'? What are they worried about, and what are they kicking into 'overdrive'? Which 'agency' is he referring to and why does Strzok believe the referenced news article highlights that 'agency as [a] source of some of the leaks'?"" the senators wrote.
During a Senate hearing last week, Attorney General Bill Barr testified that the Justice Department is conducting ""multiple criminal leak investigations"" into media contact with department officials that occurred during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russia collusion."
"Planned Parenthood, NARAL Go To War Against Last Pro-Life Democrat In Congress | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46885/planned-parenthood-naral-go-war-against-last-pro-paul-bois,"Planned Parenthood, NARAL Go To War Against Last Pro-Life Democrat In Congress ""Every life is sacred and needs to be protected"" Tom Williams / Contributor / Getty Images May 7, 2019 views
Looking for further evidence that the Democratic Party is the party of abortion with no room for dissenters? Abortion conglomerate Planned Parenthood is now vowing to fight to oust Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-IL) from his seat due to his being Congress's lone token pro-life Democrat.
According to LifeNews , America's top abortion advocacy groups have all endorsed Lipinski's primary challenger, Marie Newman.
""Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America, MoveOn, and EMILY’s List on Monday endorsed Newman, making clear their support for a pro-abortion candidate over the pro-life Democrat currently representing Chicago’s 3rd district,"" reports LifeNews. ""The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, however, remains loyal to its tradition backing incumbent Democrats, saying it will cut ties with persons and groups that work against him.""
Of course, abortion advocates tried to play this game against Lipinski in the 2018 midterm race by spending upwards of $1.6 million on Marie Newman; they lost by a narrow margin to Lipinski, who is remains a proud moderate Democrat. He even spoke at the 2019 March for Life this past January.
""Every life is sacred and needs to be protected,"" Lipinski said at the March.
Other members of the Democratic Party, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), have also endorsed Lipinski's primary challenger.
EMILY’s List President Stephanie Schriock said that Lipinski wants to strip away the ""fundamental rights of women"" and must be stopped.
""In a time when the president and GOP have made it clear that stripping away the fundamental rights of women is at the top of their agenda, we must have a leader to stand up against Trump. That is not Congressman Dan Lipinski,” Schriock told NBC on Monday. ""Congressman Lipinski has time and again proven he’s out of touch with his constituents by standing in lockstep with the Republicans.""
Lipinski has largely dismissed the attacks against him as an extremist insurgency, likening it to some kind of ""tea party of the left"" movement.
""Marie Newman is again running a 'tea party of the left' campaign at the behest of national interest groups rather than focusing on taking care of the everyday concerns of people in the district, as I have a track record of doing,"" Lipinski said. ""This type of campaign, along with Ms. Newman’s hateful, Trump-like rhetoric … will once again be rejected by voters.""
The debate over this new abortion litmus test in the Democratic Party began after the fallout of Trump's victory, when the abortion cheerleaders at NARAL criticized Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez for giving a platform to Nebraska pro-life mayoral candidate Heath Mello. Perez sided with NARAL by calling abortion a "" fundamental value .""
Kristen Day, executive chairwoman of Democrats for Life, has said this impossible litmus test will cost Democrats votes in the long run.
""I think it’s become much more hard-line now,"" Day told The Washington Times . ""What happened is the pro-choice Democrats kinda felt like Hillary Clinton is going to win, and they made the abortion platform more radical. But what they didn’t realize is they alienated pro-life Democrats who didn’t vote for her."" "
Trump Grants Full Pardon To Ex-Army Soldier Convicted Of Killing Suspected Al-Qaeda Terrorist | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46870/trump-grants-full-pardon-ex-army-soldier-convicted-amanda-prestigiacomo,"Trump Grants Full Pardon To Ex-Army Soldier Convicted Of Killing Suspected Al-Qaeda Terrorist Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images May 7, 2019 views
On Monday evening, the White House announced that President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to a former United States Army lieutenant who was convicted of killing a suspected al-Qaeda terrorist in 2009.
Army 1st Lieutenant Michael Behenna was sentenced to 25 years in prison for unpremeditated murder in a combat zone by a military court in 2009, but was later paroled. According to CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller, Trump ""found Behenna 'entirely deserving' of a pardon."" Pres grants pardon to former US Army 1st Lt Michael Behenna, sentenced in 2009 to 25 yrs for murder of an Iraqi, but later paroled. WH cites senior military support for Behenna for his claim of self-defense and says @POTUS found Behenna ""entirely deserving"" of a pardon. — Mark Knoller (@markknoller) May 7, 2019
As noted in a report from The Washington Post, two soldiers and friends of Behenna were killed in a roadside explosion in 2008. An intelligence report later found that then-Iraqi operative Ali Mansur — the man Behenna would later kill — likely helped in organizing the explosion that murdered his battlefield compatriots.
After Mansur was interrogated and freed due to lack of conclusive evidence, Behenna sought to interrogate Mansur without authorization. ""During the interrogation, Behenna shot Mr. Mansur in the head and chest,"" reported The New York Times. The lieutenant left the suspected terrorist’s body in the remote area without telling anyone; Iraqi police found a dead Mansur the following day.
According to Behenna, he acted in self-defense against Mansur when Mansur threw a chunk of concrete at the lieutenant and reached for his handgun.
As reported by Fox News, Behenna's parents claimed in 2018 that ""the prosecution failed to disclose that their own expert's analysis supported their son’s version of events. The expert felt so strongly that he reached out to the Behennas about his findings.""
""After judgment, however, the U.S. Army's highest appellate court noted concern about how the trial court had handled Mr. Behenna's claim of self-defense,"" said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in the statement regarding the pardon, according to CNN.
""Additionally, the Army Clemency and Parole Board reduced his sentence to 15 years and paroled him as soon as he was eligible in 2014 — just 5 years into his sentence,"" she added.
Sanders also cited ""broad support"" for Mr. Behenna ""from the military, Oklahoma elected officials, and the public.” According to Fox News, that support included ""37 generals and admirals, along with a former Pentagon inspector general"" all vouching for Behenna. The press secretary also noted that the former soldier was a ""model prisoner"" while serving his time behind bars.
President Trump has offered nearly a dozen pardons since his election in 2016. According to the Department of Justice, other pardons include former Sheriff Joseph M. Arpaio, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, and ranchers Dwight Hammond Jr. and his son Steven Hammond. "
Seattle School District Wants Teachers To Bless Muslims During Ramadan | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46894/seattle-school-district-wants-teachers-bless-paul-bois,"Seattle School District Wants Teachers To Bless Muslims During Ramadan ""The district is running roughshod over the First Amendment’s mandate..."" Anadolu Agency / Contributor / Getty Images May 7, 2019 views
A school district in Seattle has sent out a letter asking teachers to bless its Muslim students in Arabic during the month of Ramadan and give them preferential treatment, such as obtaining dispensations for classes and exams, reports Fox News .
In response to the letter, the religious liberty legal defense group Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund (FCDF), has threatened the Dieringer School District with a potential lawsuit for violating the conscience of its employees. FCDF alleges that the district followed edicts put forward by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) that advises schools to accommodate Muslim students by wishing them ""Ramadan Mubarak"" (Happy Ramadan) or ""Ramadan Kareem"" (Have a generous Ramadan). The edicts also instruct teachers to respect the Ramadan fast by not scheduling any tests during the holidays of Eid Al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha . More from Fox News:
The defense fund claims Dieringer Superintendent Judy Martinson blindly followed the recommendations of CAIR and ""enacted the letter as official district policy."" The defense fund sent Martinson a letter stating their complaints after a teacher and parent complained about the new procedure.
The May 6 letter also warned Martinson about CAIR's anti-semitic advocacy and alleged ties to radical Islamists, which the group has long denied.
Daniel Piedra, FCDF’s executive director , said in a statement that the Seattle-area school district is violating teachers' First Amendment rights by exerting pressure upon them to engage in religious speech with which they do not agree. Piedra argues that the district would never advise teachers to accommodate Christian students in such a similar manner.
""By urging teachers to bless Muslim students in Arabic, the district is running roughshod over the First Amendment’s mandate of government neutrality toward religion,” said Piedra. ""A school district would never order teachers to 'welcome' Catholic students during Easter with 'He is risen, alleluia!' Singling out Muslim students for special treatment is blatantly unconstitutional.""
Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for CAIR, denounced the potential lawsuit in a statement to Fox News as a ""sign of the growing Islamophobia in our nation that showing respect for and accommodating the religious traditions of Muslim students could result in punitive legal action.""
""Pluralism in America means recognizing the wide variety of holidays celebrated by students of different faiths and backgrounds, including by saying 'Merry Christmas,' 'Happy Hanukkah,' 'Happy Diwali,' or 'Ramadan Mubarak,'"" Hooper added.
The FCDF complaint goes beyond just mere accommodation of Muslim students by the school district, arguing that CAIR's mission is to raise Ramadan to the equivalence of Christmas on the school calendar, thereby disrupting the academic schedule.
""This approach is wrong for two reasons. First, adding Islamic holidays does not further the district’s educational mission and academic goals,"" the FCDC said in a statement. ""Recognizing holidays is constitutional only if the purpose is to provide secular instruction about religious traditions, rather than to promote the particular religion involved. Second, CAIR’s recommendation that teachers schedule tests around Eid Al-Fitr and Eid would alleviate no burden on Muslim students.""
Ramadan began on Monday. During the month-long Islamic holiday, observant Muslims must fast during the day. "
Anti-Semitic Cartoons Of Shapiro Posted At Stanford University | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Daily Wire,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46899/anti-semitic-cartoons-shapiro-posted-stanford-daily-wire,"Anti-Semitic Cartoons Of Shapiro Posted At Stanford University Photo by rhyman007/GettyImages May 7, 2019 views
Stanford University’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine have been accused of posting cartoons caricaturing Daily Wire Editor-In-Chief Ben Shapiro at a Passover Seder dinner saying the Jews who were enslaved in Egypt millennia ago were “terrorists” so Egypt had the right to “limit their birthrates.” Is this depiction of Ben Shapiro - to advertise an anti-Israel event at @Stanford - like ""donning black face and hoping to have a nuanced conversation about race""? #IsraelUnderAttack #Zionist pic.twitter.com/Fd0MT1bYH4 — The College Fix (@CollegeFix) May 7, 2019
As The College Fix reports, the Stanford College Republicans claimed on Facebook that SJP placed the cartoons, drawn by the viciously anti-Israel cartoonist Eli Valley, over SCR’s posters advertising an event with Andrew Klavan of The Daily Wire:
We are not surprised that Stanford leftists have resorted to ripping down flyers advertising our upcoming event with Andrew Klavan. Leftists routinely vandalize our flyers, as they refuse to accept the right of conservatives to speak on the campus. However, this time, not only did leftists destroy our flyers, but members of Stanford Students for Justice in Palestine have been covering our posters with anti-Semitic cartoons by Israel-hating propagandist, Eli Valley , who will speak at Stanford at SJP's invitation next Friday. These cartoons specifically attack Ben Shapiro, using vile anti-Semitic caricatures. Eli Valley and his supporters in Stanford's SJP would make any neo-Nazi proud.
Klavan’s speech is titled, “Yes, American is a Judeo-Christian nation.”
As The College Fix noted, “The cartoons are advertising SJPs’ own May 10 event with the cartoonist who drew them, Eli Valley. “
Ari Hoffman, a student at the Stanford Law School, wrote an op-ed in The Stanford Daily in which he stated:
I had been under the mercifully mistaken impression that Der Stürmer, the Nazi newspaper edited by Joseph Goebbels, had long ago ceased publication … Imagine my surprise when a flood of images seemingly drawn from Der Stürmer’s archives appeared on campus at Stanford University, where I am a law student, as an advertisement for a talk by cartoonist Eli Valley, a cartoonist and the keynote speaker for Palestine Awareness Week (May 6 – 10) on campus, organized by Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). When it comes to anti-Semitism and cartoons, what is old is new again.
… Let me be as clear as I can: the images are indefensible in any context. They are not justifiable, and they are not explainable. The sin is not against sensitivity. It is one of smearing a Jewish minority under attack here and abroad in the name of a skewed vision of a foreign conflict. SJP’s promise that “Eli’s knowledge and guidance” will ameliorate these facts is akin to entrusting fire safety to an arsonist. To apologize for the flyers but insist on continuing with the event is equal parts absurd and appalling.
Stanford’s Hillel chapter said that the acting Dean of Students, who joined a group of 30 student leaders to discuss the issue, “was with us during this conversation, would reach out to the Resident Fellows and staff right away to alert them to the concerns raised by our community.”
The College Fix noted of Hoffman, “He said SJP had apologized for sharing the cartoons 'out of context' in a Sunday message to a Stanford Jewish community listserv. SJP’s Facebook page makes no mention of an apology, and the Daily news section does not mention it."""

CNN guest Christine Quinn said during a discussion Monday night about pro-life state-level ""heartbeat bills"" that when a woman gets pregnant that she is not pregnant with a human being.
""Christine, what's the concern with what just passed in Georgia, and what you may wind up seeing more of, a state passing through its legislature, a more restrictive right to reproductive acts such as — reproductive rights such as abortion?"" CNN's Chris Cuomo asked. ""This is a six-week bill.""
""These so-called heartbeat bills are exactly what you said, six-week bills. They, for all intent and purposes, are an end run around Roe versus Wade, and a clear attempt to make abortion illegal in new — across the country,"" Quinn said. ""That's what they are. And we've seen in states where they've been passed already, courts strike them out or enjoin them. This is a clear attempt to take decisions about a woman's body and birth out of the hands of a woman and out of the hands of doctors.""
Quinn became hostile toward CNN contributor Rick Santorum, and Cuomo jumped in and sided with Quinn.
Later in the interview, during an exchange with Santorum, Quinn said, ""When a woman gets pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her. It's part of her body.""
Matt Wolking, deputy director of communications for the 2020 Trump Campaign, flagged the clip Tuesday on Twitter.

Limbaugh: Here's Why The Newly Revealed Texts From Anti-Trump Strzok Are So 'Significant' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46918/limbaugh-heres-why-newly-revealed-texts-anti-trump-james-barrett,"May 8, 2019 views
On his talk radio program Tuesday, conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh discussed the newly revealed messages from former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was removed from the Trump-Russia investigation after his overt anti-Trump bias came to light. Strzok's newly released texts and emails from December 2016 and April 2017 triggered a request by two high-ranking Republican senators‌ on Monday for further investigation. The reason they're so ""significant,"" said Limbaugh, is they provide a possible clue about the role of John Brennan's CIA in spreading false ""collusion"" claims to the press.
On Monday, Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson highlighting a text and an email from Strzok that raised serious questions. In a December 2016 text to his paramour, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Strozk wrote: ""Think our sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried and political, they’re kicking in to overdrive."" Then, in an April 2017 email to some of his FBI colleagues, Strzok wrote: ""I’m beginning to think the agency got info a lot earlier than we thought and hasn’t shared it completely with us. Might explain all these weird/seemingly incorrect leads all these media folks have. Would also highlight agency as source of some of the leaks.""
Limbaugh addressed the ""fascinating"" development on Tuesday. ""Now, this is significant, because we now know that there was no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion,"" he said. ""It looks like the CIA was, in fact, leaking false Trump-Russia stories to the press to undermine Trump. These are leaks that even the FBI agents running their own version of a coup thought were wrong and incorrect, and it was John Brennan running the CIA at the time.""
""[T]hey’re concluding that Brennan and the CIA are leaking and putting this stuff in the media that they, then, have to deal with themselves,"" he said after dismissing the idea that this was a ""CYA"" attempt by the FBI. ""And they are concluding here, these are 'incorrect leads all these media folks have.' That is a solid indication that the FBI’s looking at this as it’s happening, and that the CIA is releasing a bunch of BS that even the FBI thought was BS. And the media was just swallowing it all up, not questioning any of it.""
Why was the media unquestioningly accepting this ""BS""? Because ""it came from Obama’s CIA, which they revere,"" said Limbaugh.
The host then highlighted one of those early leaked claims that proved to be false: that Putin was ""personally involved"" in colluding with Trump, a claim reported just two days before Strzok's December text:
“U.S. Officials: Putin Personally Involved in U.S. Election Hack.” That has to be Brennan. It has to be. It has to be the CIA. From the article: “U.S. intelligence officials now believe with ‘a high level of confidence’ that Russian President Vladimir Putin became personally involved in the covert Russian campaign to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, senior U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News.”
""So here’s Strzok Smirk, and they’re looking at this, and they see this. They know they didn’t put that out there, and figured it had to come from their 'sisters' at The Agency,"" said Limbaugh. He then quoted again from the report on the false claim:
""Two senior officials with direct access to the information say new intelligence shows that Putin personally directed how hacked material from Democrats was leaked and otherwise used. The intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said.""
""That’s all from an NBC story December 14th, 2016, and it syncs right up with Strzok Smirk’s texts,"" he said. Rush then ""flash-forwarded"" to today, with a new poll finding that 55% of Democrats believe that Trump is a traitor. ""There it is! If that’s all the kind of garbage these people, these Democrats have been consuming for two years, what do you think they’re gonna think?"" Rush exclaimed.
""Folks, there has to be a price paid by the people who have done this,"" he said. ""I mean, this is a flat-out lie. Somebody literally made this up, or they got scammed by some agents in Russia who are running a scam on Brennan and they knew what Brennan wanted to hear, so they told him."" "
Iranian President Warns Europe: Undercut U.S. Or We'll Stop Limiting Enrichment Of Uranium | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46944/iranian-president-warns-europe-undercut-us-or-well-hank-berrien,"Iranian President Warns Europe: Undercut U.S. Or We'll Stop Limiting Enrichment Of Uranium Iranian Presidency / Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images May 8, 2019 views
On Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani threatened that Iran would start increasing its stock of low enriched uranium and of heavy water, warning that if Europe didn't undercut American efforts to isolate Iran, Iran would end limiting its enrichment of uranium.
The New York Times reported:
Mr. Rouhani said that starting on Wednesday, Iran would begin to build up its stockpiles of low enriched uranium and of heavy water, which is used in nuclear reactors — including a reactor that could give Iran a source of bomb-grade plutonium. If the Europeans fail to compensate for the unilateral American sanctions, he said, Iran will resume construction of the Arak nuclear reactor, a facility that was shut down, and its key components dismantled, under the deal. Mr. Rouhani then threatened a potentially more severe step. If the Europeans do not find a way to help Iran “reap our benefits,” especially in petroleum exports and banking transactions, in 60 days Iran will end the limits on the enrichment of uranium, he said.
Rouhani tweeted on Thursday, “Starting today, Iran does not keep its enriched uranium and produced heavy water limited. The EU/E3+2 will face Iran's further actions if they can not fulfill their obligations within the next 60 days and secure Iran's interests. Win-Win conditions will be accepted.” Starting today, Iran does not keep its enriched uranium and produced heavy water limited. The EU/E3+2 will face Iran's further actions if they can not fulfill their obligations within the next 60 days and secure Iran's interests. Win-Win conditions will be accepted. — Hassan Rouhani (@HassanRouhani) May 8, 2019
As The Washington Post noted, “Uranium used as fuel in power plants needs to be enriched only to a low level. However, when it is enriched to much higher levels, it can be used as fissile material in nuclear weapons.”
Mark Dubowitz, CEO of Foundation for Defense of Democracies, stated , ""The regime in Iran remains committed to nuclear weapons capability. Any Iranian move to expand their nuclear program should be met with the most severe sanctions -- and an unambiguous warning from Washington that all other instruments of American power are available to stop the ayatollahs' atomic drive.”
Great Britain’s junior foreign minister, Mark Field, called the Iranian announcement an “unwelcome step.” French Defense Minister Florence Parly echoed , “Today, nothing would be worse than Iran, itself, leaving this accord.”
Yet European countries have been undermining the United States’ determination to weaken the despotic Iranian regime using sanctions; European and Iranian officials are pushing the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), which undercuts America’s desire to isolate Iran. Sen. Ted Cruz blistered the Europeans in a statement reading:
It is unfortunate that our European partners are spending their diplomatic and material capital creating mechanisms that break up American sanctions, rather than siding with us and the Iranian people against the Ayatollahs' regime. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps dominates entire sectors of the Iranian economy, and there is no such thing as a safe transaction. The United States should be prepared to use all relevant measures, including visa denials and asset forfeitures, to protect the integrity of our sanctions and the maximum pressure campaign, and I will continue to work with the Trump administration and my colleagues to ensure that we do.
Olli Heinonen, former Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA ) and head of its Department of Safeguards, explained the necessity of the U.S. revoking waivers (which it has done) enabling Iran to ship abroad excess supplies of enriched uranium and heavy water:
Under the terms of what is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran may stockpile no more than 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium (LEU), i.e. uranium hexafluoride enriched up to a 3.67 percent concentration of the U-235 isotope, and no more than 130 metric tons of heavy water. Thanks to a waiver that allowed it to export excess LEU to Russia, Iran maintained the option to continue enriching uranium under the JCPOA. A waiver also enabled Iran to ship excess heavy water to Oman for storage, from where it could be sold to foreign customers.
By revoking the waivers, the U.S. is pressuring Iran to stop the production of LEU and heavy water. Currently, there is an oversupply of LEU and heavy water in the global marketplace, which means that Iran would be unlikely to find customers even if it were allowed to export these items.
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has been consulting with Iranian ally Russian President Vladimir Putin; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin saw “no alternative” to the Iran nuclear deal."
Revival? Billy Bush To Anchor New Version Of ‘Extra’ After Ostracization Over Trump Tape. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46941/revival-billy-bush-anchor-new-version-extra-after-paul-bois,"Revival? Billy Bush To Anchor New Version Of ‘Extra’ After Ostracization Over Trump Tape. Craig Barritt / Stringer / Getty Images May 8, 2019 views
Has Billy Bush spent enough time in Hollywood jail following the ""Access Hollywood"" tape leak in which he laughed as Donald Trump infamously said ""grab 'em by the p***y?"" Perhaps.
According to The Hollywood Reporter (THR), the former ""Today"" host will be an anchor on a new ""Extra"" series — ""Extra Extra."" Read all about it:
Extra , it was announced in December , is moving from its longtime home on NBC owned-and-operated stations to Fox in seven major markets, starting in the fall.
The syndicated newsmagazine is produced by Telepictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic TV Distribution.
Extra Extra is set to premiere Sept. 9, a rep for the show confirmed. The rebranded program will feature a modernized set and in-depth look at pop culture, sports and politics, according to People . The magazine added that Extra host Mario Lopez will continue in his role through the end of the current season.
Bill Bush's career took a massive hit during the 2016 presidential election, when NBC fired him from ""Today"" after the leak of the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape from 2005 that featured Donald Trump bragging about sleeping with other women and grabbing women ""by the p***y."" Throughout the tape, Bush could be heard laughing and egging on Trump.
Despite Bush's apology for his participation in what Trump downplayed as ""locker room talk,"" Bush lost his job at NBC and fell out of grace for over two years. Speaking with THR in 2017, Bush said his life became ""a roller coaster.""
""If you start from the day everything happened, Friday, Oct. 7, it was just instant shock. Things were happening way too fast, and a media circus developed,"" he told THR. ""I've never been the type that the paparazzi would be interested in. So that early part was just chaos. But then things progressed, and when you have a big, traumatic event, you go through stages, and it led to acceptance and understanding. And then I found myself in a place of soul searching. And I developed a commitment to become a better, fuller man.""
As to his participation in the bus talk, Bush said he wished he had behaved better at the time by changing the topic. ""Looking back on what was said on that bus, I wish I had changed the topic. I didn't have the strength of character to do it,"" he said.
Writing on Instagram this past October, Bush lamented that he faced a far stricter punishment than anyone else did for his affiliation with the ""Access Hollywood"" tape.
""Two years ago today, my life went from order to chaos in a dramatic instant. I accounted for my small part, while the President and my employer walked away and still haven’t accounted for their actions,"" said Bush. ""These past couple years have been character-building, to say the least — anxiety attacks, fits of rage, feelings of betrayal and abandonment — and I have concluded that I am NOT extraordinary. Terrible things can happen at any moment to ANYONE.""
Speaking with People about his new gig on ""Extra Extra,"" Bush said he has grown exponentially since 2005 and 2016. ""We all have to be able to evolve as we grow,"" Bush said. ""The guy that left the scene in 2016 was already a changed person [since 2005], but I had the opportunity to grow up a little bit. Facing adversity in some way is good. And I feel I’ll be better at my job than I ever was. This is my next step."""
WATCH: Feminist Repeatedly Punches Pro-Lifer In The Face On Campus. She's Been Charged With Assault. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46925/watch-feminist-repeatedly-punches-pro-lifer-face-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 8, 2019 views
Last month, a pro-life activist was physically attacked by a feminist on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
In a video posted by Created Equal, one of the male team members of the pro-life group is approached by a female student. “Did you put these [signs] up?” the feminist asks the pro-lifer. When he responds in the affirmative, the woman attacks him, punching him repeatedly in the face and kicking him.
The feminist is then approach by law enforcement and notified that she will be charged with assault.
According to a statement from the pro-life group, the incident occurred on April 2, when team members were posting “signs depicting the gruesome reality of abortion” meant to “engage students in conversation about this human injustice.”
Created Equal confirmed to The Daily Wire on Wednesday morning that the feminist has been identified as a social justice activist known as Jillian Alexandra Ward and has been charged with a simple assault, which is a misdemeanor. Ward's court date is set for June 4.
Mark Harrington, president of Created Equal, said abortion activists are resorting to violence because they are losing the argument.
“Pro-abortion activists are losing the argument, and instead of seeking debate they are escalating the violence on peaceful preborn defenders on college campuses,” read a statement from Harrington.
“We will never cave to acts of violence or intimidation. We will return hate with love for mothers and their babies,” he added.
“We are committed to defending babies. We are also committed to defending the right to defend babies. Thus, Created Equal is currently engaged in several open cases with prosecutors charging those who attack our property or people, including the incidents at UNC,” said Created Equal.
There have been a spate of incidents in the past few months wherein pro-lifers have been physically attacked or verbally harassed by abortion advocates. Over the weekend, for example, a Democratic state representative from Pennsylvania, Brian Sims, videotaped himself berating an elderly pro-life sidewalk counselor outside a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic. In another video posted by the Democrat, Sims harasses three teenage girls and offers his viewers $100 for their identities so that they can be doxxed.
Last month, an elderly pro-life woman in Kentucky, sidewalk counselor Donna Durning, was thrown to the ground outside an abortion clinic, suffering a broken leg and head injuries. Durning was apparently trying to pass out pro-life literature when she was attacked.
And at the end of March, an elderly man at a peaceful pro-life prayer vigil outside a San Francisco-based Planned Parenthood abortion clinic was physically assaulted by an abortion advocate. The 85-year-old had his pro-life banner stolen by an unidentified male abortion advocate; when he attempted to retrieve his property, he was severely beaten and threatened.

Israel U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon: U.N. Must Designate Hamas A Terrorist Group | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46940/israel-un-ambassador-danny-danon-un-must-designate-josh-hammer,"May 8, 2019 views
As The Daily Wire has reported , Israel this past weekend faced a relentless barrage of indiscriminately fired jihadist rocket fire from the dastardly terrorist group duo of Muslim Brotherhood -affiliated Sunni sharia supremacist death cult Hamas and Iran-funded Shiite sharia supremacist death cult Palestinian Islamic Jihad. But while Iran catalyzed the conflict by goading Palestinian Islamic Jihad into initially commencing the sustained rocket fire that has thus far killed four Israeli civilians, it is longstanding Israeli government policy to hold Hamas — the democratically elected governing group for the Gaza Strip — responsible for all rocket fire from Gaza.
But while the United States, the European Union, and Israel all formally recognize Hamas as the terrorist organization that it so plainly is, the paradigmatically pusillanimous United Nations does no such thing. But, per The Times of Israel , Israel's U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, is now seeking to alter that:
""The time has come for the [U.N.] Security Council to designate Hamas a terror group like al-Qaeda and Daesh,"" Danon told reporters as [his] group viewed a house damaged by shrapnel, saying he would bring the demand to the Security Council.
""Hamas commits double war crimes — it hides behind civilians in Gaza, it attacks civilians here in Israel."" Danon said.
At least a dozen ambassadors joined the trip, including Ivory Coast’s Kacou Houadja Léon Adom, who currently has a seat on the Security Council.
Andrejs Pildegovics, Latvia’s ambassador to the U.N., said the envoys were in Ashkelon ""to learn about the damage that terror leaves.""
Hamas' founding organizational charter makes clear its desire to annihilate the Jewish state of Israel and murder every Jew in the world. The genocidal and disgusting charter states , in relevant part:
""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it"" (The Martyr, Imam Hassan al-Banna, of blessed memory). ...
Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious. It needs all sincere efforts. It is a step that inevitably should be followed by other steps. The Movement is but one squadron that should be supported by more and more squadrons from this vast Arab and Islamic world, until the enemy is vanquished and Allah's victory is realised. ...
Moreover, if the links have been distant from each other and if obstacles, placed by those who are the lackeys of Zionism in the way of the fighters obstructed the continuation of the struggle, the Islamic Resistance Movement aspires to the realisation of Allah's promise, no matter how long that should take. The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him salvation, has said:
""The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."" (related by al-Bukhari and Moslem). ...
In face of the Jews' usurpation of Palestine, it is compulsory that the banner of Jihad be raised. To do this requires the diffusion of Islamic consciousness among the masses, both on the regional, Arab and Islamic levels. It is necessary to instill the spirit of Jihad in the heart of the nation so that they would confront the enemies and join the ranks of the fighters.
Clearly, anything other than the U.N. agreeing to designate Hamas a terrorist group amounts to a cowardly and inherently anti-Semitic shirking of responsibility — par for the course, perhaps, for the deeply troubled transnational tribunal .
In multiple op-eds for The Daily Wire, I have argued that the time has come for Israel to commence a comprehensive joint land/air operation to permanently extirpate and destroy Hamas — and that the time to do so is before the 2020 U.S. presidential election and the prospect of a new anti-Israel Democratic president ascending to the White House."

The Daily Wire has repeatedly covered the ongoing migrant influx crisis at our beleaguered southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) March crossing/apprehension numbers were record-shattering, and CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert E. Perez referred to the onslaught as a ""system-wide emergency"":
""We are currently experiencing a system-wide emergency in our processing and holding facilities. The humanitarian crisis created by a massive influx of family groups and unaccompanied children in recent months has forced CBP to reallocate resources away from law enforcement, trade and travel missions to process and provide care for those in our custody,"" said CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert E. Perez. ""The impacts to legitimate trade and travel cannot be overstated. As this crisis continues to worsen, it undermines CBP’s ability to perform its dual mission of protecting our borders and facilitating legitimate trade and travel.""
In Fiscal Year 2019 to date, the U.S. Border Patrol has seen a more than 370% increase in the number of family units apprehended compared to the same time period in FY2018. Today, 60% of apprehensions along the Southwest border are family units and unaccompanied children, made up predominantly of individuals from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
But what is even more distressing is that the brand-new, hot-off-the-press CBP April numbers are somehow even worse!
Conservative favorite freshman Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) tweeted: ""'U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detained 109,144 migrants along the boundary with Mexico' in APRIL! This is the second consecutive month of 100K+ apprehensions. #PelosiDoesntCare."" ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detained 109,144 migrants along the boundary with Mexico"" in APRIL!

But amidst the ongoing crisis , there is one statistic — courtesy of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — that truly ought to underscore the extremist nature of both our illegal and legal immigration regimes. Specifically, an incredible 1% of the entire population of Guatemala and Honduras has entered the U.S. since this past September.
Yes, really.
As Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner reported yesterday:
In a shocking demonstration of the latest surge of illegal immigrants border officials are struggling with, over 1% of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras have entered the United States since September, according to the Homeland Security Department chief.
Worse, 3% of the population of one Guatemalan county has crossed into the U.S., acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan told the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas tonight.
""The current migration flows, especially of vulnerable families and children, from Central America through Mexico, to remote areas all along the U.S. border, represent both a security and humanitarian crisis. The situation is not sustainable,"" said the longtime border and immigration official.
This is a truly eye-opening and revelatory number. It ought to shock policymakers. And we ignore it at our own peril."
"SAD: Trump Tweets About Elizabeth Warren's Pet Casino Deal, Gets Bill Pulled From Floor | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46960/sad-trump-tweets-about-elizabeth-warrens-pet-emily-zanotti,"May 8, 2019 views
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been pushing a sweetheart deal for a Native American tribe seeking a casino in Massachusetts, but on Wednesday her hopes were (temporarily) dashed by President Donald Trump.
In a surprise tweet issued early Wednesday morning, Trump urged Republicans ""to vote against a bill that would end a legal challenge to the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe’s reservation in Massachusetts,"" allowing the tribe to declare ownership over a tract of land they are reportedly looking to turn into a resort and casino, according to The Hil l.
""Republicans shouldn’t vote for H.R. 312, a special interest casino Bill, backed by Elizabeth (Pocahontas) Warren. It is unfair and doesn’t treat Native Americans equally!” the president tweeted.
The president's tweet got Republicans moving on the legislation, which Democrats had fast-tracked to come to a vote this week — a happy and not-at-all planned conicidence for Warren, who is slowly regaining support in Democratic primary polls. The bill was pulled from the floor early Wednesday afternoon, over the objections of Warren and other members of the Massachusetts delegation, but will likely return to the floor next week in a closed session.
Critics of the president claim that he was acting on behalf of Conservative Political Action Conference head Matt Schlapp, who has an interest in a competing casino operation, but the issue of Elizabeth Warren and the Massachusetts casino didn't simply appear on the docket today, and the vote, which did not go Warren's way, may have a long-term impact on her 2020 hopes.
Warren joined the crusade on behalf of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe last year, according to the Boston Herald , which has followed the story since the beginning, likely as a way of convicing Native Americans that she was adequately representing their interests — as a Native American herself — in Congress, and to deflect criticism over her decision to embrace her faux Native American heritage (Warren is somewhere between 1/64 and 1/1024 ""Native American"" according to an at-home DNA test she took last year, and is not a registered member of any tribe, though she claims Cherokee heritage).
The Mashpee Wampanoag tribe is not a recognized Native American tribe under the United States Department of the Interior, and members do not fall under the 1934 ""Reorganization Act"" which listed out the known Native American tribes existing in the United States at the time, who were eligible to receive land grants for reservations. In 2016, they sued the federal government for recognition and a federal court ruled against them.
But now the Mashpee tribe wants to build a casino in partnership with a controversial Malaysian conglomerate, Genting Group, and they're looking to challenge the federal court's ruling by obtaining recognition through Congress — a cause Warren embraced immediately, then subequently abandoned, according to the Boston Herald , then embraced again after she declared her candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
Needless to say, now that she's back in the top five, Warren is likely to need protection against claims she has no ties to Native American issues in Congress, so she's back on the bandwagon, supporting the Mashpee Recognition measure.
And all was going swimmingly until this morning when President Donald Trump brought the bill to the attention of Senate Republicans who might have otherwise thought it was just a routine declaration.
The bill is not fully dead. Masschusetts legislators no doubt see the value in having a Native American casino on the border with Rhode Island, though the last polls taken in the area show residents aren't thrilled with the idea. The bill is scheduled to return to the floor next week, but out of sight of the public (and, they hope, the president)."
Terrific Trump: Trump About to Flip Another Appeals Court To Conservatives | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46961/terrific-trump-trump-about-flip-another-appeals-hank-berrien,"Terrific Trump: Trump About to Flip Another Appeals Court To Conservatives Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 8, 2019 views
President Trump, who already has had a mammoth impact on America’s judicial system by appointing over 100 judges and flipping the Pennsylvania-based Third Circuit Court of Appeals to majority Republican appointees, is posed to flip another Circuit Court of Appeals: The Second Circuit. There are 13 Circuit Courts of Appeals in the U.S.
As Bloomberg Law reports, on Wednesday the Senate confirmed Joseph Bianco to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Another judge, Michael Park, is expected to be confirmed later this week. Bloomberg noted, “When Trump makes additional appointments for vacancies that will be left by two judges who recently announced their retirements, Dennis Jacobs and Christopher Droney, the 13-member court will be majority Republican-appointed.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer supported Bianco’s confirmation to the district court in 2005, asserting, “I am proud to support someone as outstandingly qualified and well respected as Mr. Bianco,” but he opposes Bianco’s promotion now that he could change the balance on the Second Circuit. In March, Schumer issued a statement that said of Bianco and Park:
Another day, another partisan push by Senate Republicans for hard-right nominees to get lifetime appointments on the federal bench. One day after Senate Republicans elevated to the Sixth Circuit an attorney who proclaimed pre-existing condition protections are unconstitutional, Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans voted to advance the nominations of Michael Park and Joseph Bianco for the Second Circuit, despite objections from Senator Gillibrand and me.
Mr. Park has spent much of his career working in opposition to civil rights and seeking to advance the far-right agenda. He has been on the front lines of efforts to dismantle affirmative action policies in education, strike down our health care law, and is currently defending the Trump administration's effort to insert a citizenship question into the 2020 census. I will be strongly opposing these nominations when they come to the Senate floor.
On Wednesday, Schumer ripped Park, saying, “Frankly, his principal qualification seems to be that he’s a card-carrying member of the Federalist Society … He’s an ideologue.

No good deed goes unpunished, an Australian man falsely accused of sexual assault after helping a woman with her broken down car has learned.
Thirty-six-year-old Kenan Basic spent weeks in jail, lost his relationship, and was repeatedly slandered after a woman falsely accused him of sexual misconduct.
According to Australia-based 7NEWS, Basic was accused of “indecently assaulting and stalking” Caitlyn Gray, a 19-year-old woman, after he stopped to help her when her car broke down late last year.
Basic apparently spent two hours fixing Gray’s vehicle. As shown by surveillance footage, the smiling pair seem happy, hugging after the car is fixed and eventually parting ways. But according to the news station, “Gray told police Basic had allegedly propositioned her for sex in return for his help before he pursued her in the car and later indecently assaulted her at a different location.” Authorities investigating the incident called Basic’s behavior “predatory.”
Months later, however, the truth about the incident finally came out: Basic never assaulted the woman. The 19-year-old confessed to police during an interrogation that she fabricated evidence and made up the assault whole-cloth.
All charges against Basic have been dismissed. Gray is now the one with the legal issues, charged with contempt of court, fabricating evidence, and lying to law enforcement.
""My client and his family are extremely happy with the outcome,"" said Mona Elbaba, a lawyer representing Basic.
""He has always maintained his innocence, he's always said he's not guilty to the charges, and has vigorously denied the allegations,” said the lawyer.
""I understand that there was some CCTV footage which contradicted her version, and the police obtained that footage by mere luck after we asked the police to investigate the matter further, and they did,"" Elbaba continued. ""It's an extraordinary outcome for my client. Justice has been served and we are very happy with the outcome.""
Walking out of the court room where the charges were dropped on Monday, a relieved Basic told reporters, ""Finally this is over, so I am very happy.”
The falsely accused man noted that he’s ""never been jailed, never had a criminal record or anything.""
""I always help people, all my life,"" he said. ""And this was the first time a snake bit me.""
The 36-year-old said he’ll ""probably never help again, ya know. I don’t want that to happen again.”
Basic is now pursuing costs and compensation over the ordeal and is set for a court date in July, 7NEWS reported."
"WATCH: George Clooney Parody PSA Mocks Trump, Climate Change Skeptics: ‘Dumb F***ing Idiots’ | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46937/watch-george-clooney-parody-psa-mocks-trump-paul-bois,"May 8, 2019 views
George Clooney is back — and no, not with another movie (the box office took care of that ). Instead, the former ""Ocean's 11"" star did a parody public service announcement (PSA) on Jimmy Kimmel in which he mocked President Trump and climate change skeptics as ""dumb f***ing idiots.""
According to The Hollywood Reporter , Kimmel introduced the parody PSA by referencing a recent report from the United Nations that estimated that there are over one million species that are threatened with extinction because of humans.
Appearing in a suit on Kimmel, Clooney introduced himself as both an actor and director, as well as the ""two-time sexiest man alive titleholder.""
""Science enables us to cure diseases, to communicate across great distances and to fly,"" Clooney said in the PSA. ""Tragically, though, the volumes of invaluable knowledge gathered over centuries are now threatened by an epidemic of dumb f***ing idiots saying dumb s**t.""
The video then showed clips of President Trump and his administration, as well as conservative Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK).
""Dumb s**t is highly contagious, infecting the minds of even the most stable geniuses,"" Clooney said.
Later, Clooney called on people to combat this ""rampant dumbf***ery"" by supporting the United to Defeat Untruthful Misinformation and Support Science initiative, which was abbreviated as UDUMASS.
Get it?
""Your generous contribution to UDUMASS will provide desperately needed knowledge to dumb f***ing idiots on Facebook and Twitter all around the world,"" Clooney said. ""Just $20 will convince one f***ng idiot that climate change is real. $50 will teach five brainless dumbf***s to vaccinate their kids and $200 will teach ten dips**t knuckle-draggers that dinosaurs existed, but not at the same time as people.""
""Together we can win the fight against dumbf***iness, but we can't do it alone,"" he said. ""The world needs your support, UDUMASS.""
It makes sense that Clooney would appear on Jimmy Kimmel to refer to people that disagree with him as ""dumb f***ing idiots,"" given that his career as a movie star has been seemingly relegated to merely having movie-of-the-week on Hulu. In 2017, his box office performance as both an actor and director had tanked so hard that he openly pondered dropping out of acting altogether.
""Look, I acted for a long time and, you know, I’m 56. I’m not the guy that gets the girl anymore,"" Clooney said before humbly adding that his tequila brand, Casamigos, made him more money than acting. ""Acting used to be how I paid the rent, but I sold a tequila company for a billion f***ing dollars. I don’t need money.""
George Clooney's previous directorial effort, ""Suburbicon,"" made just a little over $5 million in the box office and currently holds a paltry 5.6 rating on IMDB and an even more paltry 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Many reviewers have denounced the film as a pretentious piece of mean-spirited virtue-signaling.
Scott Mendelson of Forbes has said that George Clooney can only be considered a movie star as long as the studios are seeking a debut of less than $20 million."
Kennedy Family Asks Public To Disregard RFK Jr. On Vaccines | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46963/kennedy-family-asks-public-disregard-rfk-jr-hank-berrien,"Kennedy Family Asks Public To Disregard RFK Jr. On Vaccines Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images May 8, 2019 views
Writing in Politico , the extended family of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. begged the public to ignore his anti-vaccination stance and instead vaccinate their children.
Kennedy’s sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland, his brother Joseph P. Kennedy III, a former member of Congress from Massachusetts,and his niece, Maeve Kennedy McKean, the executive director of Georgetown University’s Global Health Initiatives, joined to issue a plea to the public, starting by writing, “We love Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but he is part of a misinformation campaign that’s having heartbreaking—and deadly—consequences.”
The trio continue: “Americans have every right to be alarmed about the outbreak of measles in pockets of our country with unusually high rates of unvaccinated citizens, especially children. Right now, officials in 22 states are grappling with a resurgence of the disease, which was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. With over 700 cases already reported and indications that more outbreaks will occur, 2019 will likely see the most recorded cases of measles in decades.”
The authors note that measles is not the only disease that is spreading as a result of non-vaccinations, pointing out that Maine health officials acknowledged in March there were 41 new cases of whooping cough, double the number from the same time period in 2018.
After quoting the World Health Organization reporting a 300% increase in measles cases over last year, with over 110,000 people dying annually, they write bluntly, “Most cases of preventable diseases occur among unvaccinated children, because parents have chosen not to vaccinate, have delayed vaccination, have difficulty accessing vaccines, or the children were too young to receive the vaccines.”
The authors say of RFK Jr., “He has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines … his and others’ work against vaccines is having heartbreaking consequences.”
They continue: “The fact is that immunizations prevent some 2 million to 3 million deaths a year, and have the potential to save another 1.5 million lives every year with broader vaccine coverage, according to the WHO. Smallpox, which plagued mankind for thousands of years, has been eradicated through vaccines. Because of immunizations, no cases of polio have been reported in the United States since 1979. “
After citing their family’s efforts on behalf of vaccinations, the authors conclude:
Those who delay or refuse vaccinations, or encourage others to do so, put themselves and others, especially children, at risk. It is in all our interests to make sure that immunizations reach every child on the globe through safe, effective and affordable vaccines. Everyone must communicate the benefits and safety of vaccines, and advocate for the respect and confidence of the institutions which make them possible. To do otherwise risks even further erosion of one of public health’s greatest achievements."
"REPORT: Donald Trump, Jr., Subpoenaed By Senate Intelligence Committee | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46964/report-donald-trump-jr-subpoenaed-senate-emily-zanotti,"May 8, 2019 views
The Senate Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena to Donald Trump, Jr., to compel him to testify in an investigation related to the committee's Russia inquiry, according to a report from Axios .
The report is somewhat shocking, coming a little less than a day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared the Senate's investigation ""case closed,"" and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's several hundred-page report on the issue the definitive answer to the question of whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russians to impact the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
Nevertheless, the committee, led by Republican Richard Burr (R-NC) and Democrat Mark Warner (D-IN) appears to have issued the demand to Trump, Jr. on Wednesday, ordering him to appear to testify a second time in front of a Senate panel about his role in a Trump Tower Moscow project, which allegedly put him in contact with agents of the Russian government.
Trump, Jr. has already testified about the project under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee back in September 2017. At the time, Trump, Jr. admitted to knowing little about the Trump Tower Moscow and being only ""peripherally aware"" of negotiations surrounding a potential Russian expansion for the Trump company.
At the time, Trump, Jr. also agreed to answer as many questions as the Senate had, leading to a marathon of testimony, Axios reports — ""more than 25 hours with three different committees, per a source familiar with the situation.""
In January 2019, Trump, Jr. reiterated his lack of knowledge of the Moscow project in an interview with Laura Ingraham: ""We don't know anything about it. Ultimately, it was Michael Cohen essentially trying to get a deal done.""
Trump lawyer Cohen, of course, contradicted Trump, Jr.'s account of the meetings, claiming in his own testimony in front of Congress that he briefed Trump, Jr. and his sister, Ivanka, ""approxmately 10 times"" about the Trump Tower Moscow, and that both Trump children were well aware of the project. Cohen, though, seems to be the only member of the Trump team with any extensive involvement in the project , having been part of negotiations surrounding the Trump Tower Moscow project since 2016.
The Senate Intelligence Committee refused to confirm whether Axios' report was accurate, telling media only that, ""We do not discuss the details of witness engagements with the Committee. Throughout the investigation, the Committee has reserved the right to recall witnesses for additional testimony as needed, as every witness and witness counsel has been made aware.”
A source close to Donald Trump, Jr. told The Daily Wire exclusively that Trump, Jr. has complied with the committee's requests, and called the subpoena a ""PR stunt.""
""Don is a private citizen, who has already been cleared by Mueller after a two year investigation. He has done 8-9 hours of testimony in front of Senate Intel already and 27 hours of testimony in front of various committees in total. When he originally agreed to testify in front of the Senate Intel Committee in 2017, there was an agreement between Don and the Committee that he would only have to come in and testify a single time as long as he was willing to stay for as long as they’d like, which Don did,"" the source told The Daily Wire.
""Don continues to cooperate by producing documents and is willing to answer written questions, but no lawyer would ever agree to allow their client to participate in what is an obvious PR stunt from a so-called 'Republican' senator too cowardly to stand up to his boss Mark Warner and the rest of the resistance Democrats on the committee."""
Democrats Vote To Hold AG Barr In Contempt.

Here's What They Said In 2012 When Holder Was Held In Contempt. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images May 8, 2019 views
The Democrat-controlled House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines, 24 to 16, on Wednesday to recommend holding Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt of Congress for his refusal to comply with a subpoena for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's unredacted report and underlying investigative files.
The move came after President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over the report moments before the House Judiciary met on Wednesday to discuss whether to hold Barr in contempt. In a statement, the White House said:
The American people see through Chairman Nadler’s desperate ploy to distract from the President’s historically successful agenda and our booming economy. Neither the White House nor Attorney General Barr will comply with Chairman Nadler’s unlawful and reckless demands.
The Attorney General has been transparent and accommodating throughout this process, including by releasing the no-collusion, no-conspiracy, no-obstruction Mueller Report to the public and offering to testify before the Committee.
These attempts to work with the Committee have been flatly rejected. They didn’t like the results of the report, and now they want a redo.
Faced with Chairman Nadler’s blatant abuse of power, and at the Attorney General’s request, the President has no other option than to make a protective assertion of executive privilege.
It is sad that Chairman Nadler is only interested in pandering to the press and pleasing his radical left constituency.
The American people deserve a Congress that is focused on solving real problems like the crisis at the border, high prescription drug prices, our country’s crumbling infrastructure, and so much more.
""The Department's decision reflects President Trump's blanket defiance of Congress's constitutionally mandated duties,"" Nadler said in a statement. ""In the coming days, I expect that Congress will have no choice but to confront the behavior of this lawless Administration. The Committee will also take a hard look at the officials who are enabling this cover-up.""
In 2012, Obama's Attorney General, Eric Holder, became the first sitting member of a president's cabinet in U.S. history to be held in contempt of Congress after he refused to turn over documents related to the Obama administration's ""Operation Fast and Furious,"" which gave military-style weapons to Mexican drug cartels which were then used to kill U.S. federal agents.
In response to Holder being held in contempt, Nadler tweeted the following in 2012: ""Just joined the #walkout of the House chamber to protest the shameful, politically-motivated GOP vote holding AG Holder in contempt."" Just joined the #walkout of the House chamber to protest the shameful, politically-motivated GOP vote holding AG Holder in contempt — (((Rep. Nadler))) (@RepJerryNadler) June 28, 2012
Here are the responses from other notable House Democrats on Holder being held in contempt: Adam Schiff: “To say this is a terrible use of Congress’ power and time is an understatement.” Nancy Pelosi: “It’s such a ridiculous thing. This contempt [vote] don't get me started.” Steny Hoyer: “The action on the floor today is unprecedented in the history of America.” Elijah Cummings: “You’ve been holding the Attorney General to an impossible standard” and that he solely was “protecting documents he was prohibited by law from producing.” Recommended For You"

After giving dozens of hours of testimony in front of congressional committees related to the Russia probe, which found no collusion, Donald Trump Jr. has been subpoenaed by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee to answer more questions, this time reportedly about his hours of testimony.
""The subpoena sets up a fight that's unprecedented in the Trump era: A Republican committee chair pit against the Republican president's eldest son,"" Axios , who broke the story, reported Tuesday. ""Mueller, whose investigation did not find a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, did not indict Trump Jr., despite speculation that he would,"" the outlet noted later, adding: ""The fact that they're subpoenaing Trump Jr. is a strong signal that he declined a request to appear before the committee again.""
The subpoena may have been prompted by former Trump lawyer and convicted felon Michael Cohen claiming that Trump Jr. knew more about the ""Trump Tower Moscow"" deal than he had stated during congressional testimony, Axios suggests.
In a statement to The Daily Wire , a source close to Donald Trump Jr. slammed the subpoena as an ""obvious PR stunt,"" noting that he has already given 8-9 hours of testimony in front of the Senate Intel committee and over two dozen hours total in front of various committees.
""Don is a private citizen, who has already been cleared by Mueller after a two year investigation.

While he hasn't yet issued a personal statement on the development, Trump Jr. has made quite clear where he stands online by retweeting a series of posts related to the story.
The first is a tweet by Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy (CA), who wrote in response to the Axios story: ""DonaldJTrumpJr has already spent dozens of hours testifying in front of Congressional committees. Endless investigations—by either party—won't change the fact that there was NO collusion. It's time to move on. It’s time to focus on ISSUES, not investigations.""
Trump Jr. followed that retweet with another of McCarthy telling Democrats: ""The Mueller Report is done. Let's move forward. With the strongest economy that we've seen in 50 years, now is the time to work together to solve actual problems."" . @DonaldJTrumpJr has already spent dozens of hours testifying in front of Congressional committees.

Jessica Chastain Blasts 'Game of Thrones' For Using Rape As Empowerment | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46969/jessica-chastain-blasts-game-thrones-using-rape-paul-bois,"Jessica Chastain Blasts 'Game of Thrones' For Using Rape As Empowerment ""Rape is not a tool to make a character stronger"" Gabe Ginsberg / Contributor / Getty Images May 9, 2019 views
Actress Jessica Chastain is taking the much-lauded HBO show ""Game of Thrones"" to task for attempting to use rape as a vehicle to female empowerment.
Chastain did not appreciate the way in which the show, which has always exploited women in every which way imaginable, handled the transformation of Sansa Stark (played by Sophie Turner ) in a recent episode in which she suggested that she developed gumption in part due to a previous rape she endured.
""Chastain said dialogue between The Hound (played by Rory McCann) and Stark as they marked victory in the Battle of Winterfell suggested the latter only possessed her current strength because of the harrowing sexual assault she’d suffered from Ramsay Bolton (played by Iwan Rheon) in season five of HBO’s epic fantasy drama,"" reports HuffPost .
In the episode, The Hound told Stark how she had changed and that ""none of it would have happened if you’d left Kings Landing with me, no Littlefinger , no Ramsay, none of it.""
To that, Sansa Stark replied, ""Without Littlefinger and Ramsay and the rest, I would’ve stayed a little bird all my life.""
The implication is that Ramsay's rape somehow contributed to her growth. Chastain said the scene was the show using rape as a ""tool to make a character stronger.""
""Rape is not a tool to make a character stronger,"" tweeted Chastain. ""A woman doesn’t need to be victimized in order to become a butterfly. The #littlebird was always a Phoenix. Her prevailing strength is solely because of her. And her alone."" Rape is not a tool to make a character stronger. A woman doesn’t need to be victimized in order to become a butterfly.

Jessica Chastain's criticism of ""Game of Thrones"" follows a recent scene that some viewers found shocking involving actress Maisie Williams, whose character, Arya Stark, audiences were introduced to when she was just 11 years old. The big scene occurred between the now 22-year-old Williams and the character Gendry (played by 31-year-old Joe Dempsie). Arya, who is 18 years old in the show, wanted to lose her virginity prior to a major battle.
""We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens,"" her character tells Gendry as she aggressively kisses him.
On Instagram , responding to the scene, actress Sophie Turner made a raunchy joke involving the Easter Bunny doing something rather NSFW. ""In honor of Easter, I guess Game of Thrones wanted the storyline to have a little Easter Bunny hop, hop, hoppin’ into that p---y, and that’s the tea,"" Turner said while sipping a glass of red wine in a video posted on her Instagram stories .
The hit HBO shows seems to have taken a lot of hits this week. On Tuesday, ThinkProgress lamented HBO abandoning its climate change theme.
""The huge HBO hit Game of Thrones has long been seen as a metaphor or parable for the climate crisis — and the author of the original books, George R.R. Martin, said as much last year, calling his story 'a great parallel' to modern day climate change,"" ThinkProgress's Joe Romm wrote. ""But in the show’s eighth and final season, as the TV series races far past where Martin left the story in his still unfinished book series, HBO’s writers and show runners have literally shattered the entire metaphor.""
Apparently, leftists saw the approaching Army of the Dead as the symbol of climate change (""Winter is Coming"") and — spoiler alert — saw their dreams dashed when the army was defeated rather easily by a single character. "

Soon after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R) signed legislation known as the ""heartbeat bill,"" which bans abortions in the state when the unborn child’s heartbeat can be detected, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) weighed in with a tweet critics are slamming as callous and misinformed.
""'6 weeks pregnant' = 2 weeks late on your period,"" the socialist posted. ""Most of the men writing these bills don’t know the first thing about a woman’s body outside of the things they want from it. It’s relatively common for a woman to have a late period + not be pregnant. So this is a backdoor ban."" “6 weeks pregnant” = 2 weeks late on your period.

Of course, being six-weeks pregnant is a lot more than just being late on your period — ask any woman who’s miscarried or had a baby. At that time in a pregnancy, the unborn child is developing facial features and has a beating heart. Moreover, Ocasio-Cortez is misinformed about the authors of the legislation, a majority of whom are women , not men.
Pro-life advocates were quick to rebuff the Congresswoman. Live Action founder Lila Rose, for example, highlighted the unborn child’s development at six weeks.
""[Baby Center] explains a baby’s amazing development at 6 weeks: ‘The nose, mouth, and ears that you'll spend so much time kissing in eight months are beginning to take shape...His heart is beating about 100 to 160 times a minute...and blood is beginning to course through his body,'"" she wrote. . @BabyCenter explains a baby’s amazing development at 6 weeks: “The nose, mouth, and ears that you'll spend so much time kissing in eight months are beginning to take shape...His heart is beating about 100 to 160 times a minute...and blood is beginning to course through his body” pic.twitter.com/KCUpe5qUDl — Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) May 8, 2019
The Daily Wire’s Emily Zanotti, currently pregnant with twins, emphasized the changes which occur during and before six weeks gestation.
""Are people just unaware that changes happen in your body in the first 2-4 weeks of pregnancy? I might be more experienced with this given my fertility treatments/history, but there's a whole hormonal shift that happens.

""It's not a 'backdoor ban,'"" responded Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro. ""It is a ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, just like it says it is.

"Feds Release 168,000 Illegal Immigrants Into U.S. Amid Record-Breaking Month For Border Crossings | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46995/feds-release-168000-illegal-immigrants-us-amid-emily-zanotti,"Feds Release 168,000 Illegal Immigrants Into U.S. Amid Record-Breaking Month For Border Crossings Jeff R Clow via Getty Images May 9, 2019 views
United States Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have released around 168,000 illegal immigrants — mostly members of family groups — into United States border communities to await asylum hearings, The Washington Times reports .
Although the Trump administration had officially declared an end to the ""catch and release"" policies of the Obama administration, the record number of illegal immigrants arriving at the border in the first quarter of 2019 has forced desperate immigration officials to find ways to alleviate the strain on their resources.
""Family units are not appearing in great numbers,” acting ICE chief Nathalie Asher told Congress on Wednesday, challenging the country's immigration systems. ICE and CBP cannot hold full families in custody for more than 21 days, per a 2005 court decision, and the Trump administration walked back a policy separating families last summer.
Asher and other immigration officials testified before Congress on Wednesday, begging legislators to free up more funds for immigration enforcement along the southern border. In conjunction with the hearing, border patrol also released the number of illegal immigrants intercepted during the month of April, which was, again, a record-breaking month.
According to a press release from CBP, 109,144 individuals were apprehended at the southern border in the month of April. Ten thousand additional illegal immigrants were arrested and detained at legal border crossings.
""The 58,474 individuals in family units set another record,"" CBP noted, ""but an increasing number of people are also coming as single adults, 31,606. The overwhelming number of single adults are from Mexico, while most of the family units and unaccompanied teens are from Central America.""
The most astounding statistic in the report, though, may be that the Department of Homeland Security estimates that ""1% of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras have made the journey north to the U.S. and jumped the border in just the past seven months,"" according to statement made earlier this week by acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan.
The Washington Times reports that, if the record-breaking trend continues (and it has shown no sign of slowing in the first two weeks of May), by the end of this year, 2% of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras may have immigrated to the United States.
Democrats questioning DHS and CBP officials refused to believe that the border crisis has anything to do with a sudden rise in ""migrant caravans"" made up of immigrants from Central America looking for jobs in the United States, armed with the knowledge that the U.S. cannot keep family units in custody and must eventually release them to family members already living in-country.
Instead, Democrats, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), blamed the crisis on President Donald Trump's threat to close the border to both immigration and trade. Durbin claims Trump's rhetoric created an artificial emergency for asylum seekers who just want to get into the U.S. before more aggressive action is taken.
Officials responded to Durbin by noting that they frequently interview migrants and asylum seekers, and almost all interviewees tell authorities that they are looking for jobs and understand that the U.S. cannot immediately deport family units or adults who bring children.
""From interviews that we have done with the families we are apprehending, they are hearing that message loud and clear. They are hearing that from the smugglers, they are hearing that from the media down in the Northern Triangle,” one official told the panel.
Democrats say they'll try to address the crisis, but not by freeing up funds for immigration control. Rather, Durbin said, according to The Washington Times, that Democrats are considering a one-time bill authorizing aid to Guatemala and Honduras. "
"WATCH: Democrats, Moms Demand Action Politicize Vigil. Students Storm Out, Chant 'Mental Health!' | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ryan Saavedra,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46970/watch-democrats-moms-demand-action-politicize-ryan-saavedra,"May 9, 2019 views
Students from STEM School Highlands Ranch stormed out of a vigil on Wednesday night put on by an organization affiliated with the anti-gun Brady Campaign because the event was ""heavily politicized,"" in the words of one student.
Hundreds of students attended the vigil held in nearby Highlands Ranch High School and quickly realized that the event was intended to push for gun control and was not about remembering Kendrick Castillo, their 18-year-old classmate who was killed when he attacked the assailant, allowing some of his classmates to escape.
A student who attended the event, and wished to remain anonymous, told The Daily Wire that Moms Demand Actions' Laura Reeves was the person who prompted pushback from students due to her heavy politicization of the tragedy that claimed Castillo's life. Multiple people on social media also indicated that Reeves was the person who offended many at the vigil.
Shortly after Reeves' politically charged comments, students got up and stormed out of the high school and chanted, ""Mental health!""

One of the students that spoke to The Daily Wire said that Reeves' comments were ""dystopian"" and not connected to reality, and that she angered the students the most of all the speakers because she was trying to capitalize on their pain.
""It has become our unimaginable reality that gun violence is now so commonplace it is our new reality that we allow families to live in neighborhoods where gunshots can be heard at all hours of the day,"" Reeves claimed without evidence. ""I'm also very disappointed to admit that all the generations before yours made this harder.""
""We became paralyzed by the NRA. We did not hold our elected officials accountable as they were loosening the sensible gun regulations that were keeping us safe,"" Reeves claimed. ""Instead, we chose to burden our youth with the responsibility of saving their own lives. We forced all of you to learn in an environment that's more closely resembling a prison than a school. ... We robbed you of your innocence. Why would we do this to our own children? The very pathetic truth is that we took this route because it seemed easier than confronting the actual root cause of the gun violence issues, for this, I am truly and deeply sorry.""
Reeves then pushed her political views even harder on the grieving students, suggesting that they should be like her and work to elect anti-gun Democrat lawmakers.
Reeves then encouraged the students to register people to vote in the upcoming election, lead walkouts and demonstrations, write op-eds, raise money, and use social media to push for gun control. Moms Demand Action's Laura Reeves heavily politicizes the STEM School Highlands Ranch vigil: -Blames NRA -Demonizes pro-gun politicians -Advocates working to elect Democrats -Tells students to register voters, stage walkouts, raise $$$, & use social media to promote gun control pic.twitter.com/YlY3VaXWp8 — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) May 9, 2019
Democrat Rep. Jason Crow and Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet both politicized the tragedy by calling for new gun-control laws — even though no gun laws would have prevented the shooting, as the firearms used were illegally obtained — and neither Democrat called for protecting students at school. It is worth mentioning that both politicians did repeatedly remember the life of Castillo and did not take their politicization of the tragedy nearly to the extent that Reeves did. "

The radical gun control group Moms Demand Action, founded by far-left activist Shannon Watts, is facing mounting backlash on social media after the organization politicized a vigil on Wednesday night for the STEM School Highlands Ranch shooting.
The Daily Wire reported Thursday morning that students stormed out of the vigil after Democrat politicians and Moms Demand Actions' Laura Reeves ""heavily politicized"" the event, in the words of a student who was in attendance.
Reeves suggested to students that they should be like her and work to elect anti-gun Democrat lawmakers and that they needed to register people to vote in the upcoming election, lead walkouts and demonstrations, write op-eds, raise money, and use social media to push for gun control.

Noted Feminist Begs Men To Join In The Fight To Keep Abortion | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Hank Berrien,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47030/noted-feminist-begs-men-join-fight-keep-abortion-hank-berrien,"Noted Feminist Begs Men To Join In The Fight To Keep Abortion Photo by Kenny Williamson/GettyImages May 9, 2019 views
On Thursday, fanatic feminist Lauren Duca, who has hitherto had a rather hostile perspective toward men, suddenly issued a highly-unlikely plea, begging men to get more involved in fighting against the state of Georgia adopting the “heartbeat bill” which outlaws abortion once the baby shows it has a heartbeat. Duca pleaded, “Hey, all men? We need you to show up for this fight.” — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) May 9, 2019
On Tuesday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, ignoring threats from the Hollywood community that they would boycott his state if he signed the so-called “heartbeat bill” which would ban abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, signed the bill.
H.B. 481 states that the “full value of a child begins when a heartbeat exists” and requires “physicians performing abortions to determine the existence of a detectable human heartbeat before performing an abortion,” stating, “it shall be the policy of the State of Georgia to recognize unborn children as natural persons,” and asserting “unless otherwise provided by law, any natural person, including an unborn child with a detectable human heartbeat, shall be included in population based determinations.”
Duca was mocked on Twitter: Wait, I thought men didn’t get an opinion on abortion? pic.twitter.com/2rHy828B7r
Duca’s attitude toward men prior to her entreaty on Thursday displayed a hostility that went to the extreme, as The Daily Wire reported in August 2017:
In an openly bigoted and super edgy attack on Christians, Teen Vogue writer and abortion enthusiast Lauren Duca warned Evangelicals that she will ""bite some d***s off"" if their supposed misogyny heightens to the level of The Handmaid's Tale — the one and only book on the third-wave feminists' lifetime reading list, apparently. ""I just want the Evangelicals to know, if you guys figure out how to do 'The Handmaid's Tale' [in real life], I am fully prepared to bite some d***s off,"" wrote Duca. I just want the Evangelicals to know, if you guys figure out how to do ""The Handmaid's Tale"" IRL, I am fully prepared to bite some dicks off — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) August 29, 2017
Duca’s hatred of men shone through when she wrote in Teen Vogue in August 2017, “Diapers cost money—and food, and clothing, and shelter cost money. So does the long-term effort of raising a child, which requires time and energy that could be directed toward a career (which is — fun fact —another way that people earn money). Women cannot be equal when they are denied the option to opt out of that decades-long financial burden, and proposing a platform of economic equality that dismisses this reality is no less than patriarchal arrogance masquerading as ‘strategy.’”
Duca wrote of abortion in 2014,
The last two years haven’t been great for reproductive rights. More than 70 anti-choice provisions were enacted in 2013. This was another year of setbacks (see: Texas), and with major Republican victories in the November elections, we can expect to see more restrictive measures passed in 2015. As a (somewhat terrifying) infographic from the Guttmacher Institute shows, “more abortion restrictions were enacted between 2011 and 2013 than in the entire previous decade. There are plenty of horrifying things to read if you want to know more about the troubling state of the legislative fight for reproductive rights in the United States. But beyond legal battles and ballot measures, the reality is that abortion has become a subject we hardly know how to discuss.
Duca made her feelings most clear in a tweet from September 2017: “ProTip: Don’t date anyone who doesn’t identify as a feminist.”"

Conservative actor James Woods said on Thursday that he will no longer be using Twitter after the platform suspended him and then deleted a tweet that he refused to take down after the platform received widespread scorn from lawmakers for its continued censorship of conservatives.
""Twitter demanded that I rescind my tweet paraphrasing Emerson,"" Woods said in a statement to The Daily Wire. ""It now seems they have chosen to delete that tweet from my account without my permission.

Far-left Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) attacked President Donald Trump on Thursday over joking remarks that he made on Wednesday night at a campaign rally in Florida.
While talking about what border agents can do about illegal aliens who are crossing over the southern border, Trump said: ""Don't forget, we don't let [border security agents] and we can't let them use weapons, we can't. Other countries do, but we can't. I would never let them do that.""
At that moment a person in the crowd shouted a remark that was difficult to hear on a video of the rally. A couple of people claim that the person in the crowd shouted, ""Shoot them!""
""That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement,"" Trump jokingly responded while smiling and shaking his head. ""Only in the Panhandle.""

Boycott Backfire: New Rankings Show Chick-Fil-A Is Thriving | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46974/boycott-backfire-new-rankings-show-chick-fil-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 9, 2019 views
Despite endless efforts to boycott Chick-fil-A from the Left, Yahoo Finance reporter Myles Udland announced Wednesday that the fast-food eatery has become the third-largest restaurant chain in the nation and has tripled its sales over the last ten years. Chick-fil-A is now the third-biggest US restaurant chain and its sales have tripled in the last decade. https://t.co/9qYL1MZ0lr — Myles Udland (@MylesUdland) May 8, 2019
Food service consultancy Technomic Inc. provided the new rankings showcasing Chick-fil-A’s steady boost in popularity, according to The Wall Street Journal. In 2018, the eatery hit $10.2 billion in sales and has just about doubled its number of locations since 2007.
""Each year since 2015, Chick-fil-A has been the top-rated fast-food restaurant on the American Customer Satisfaction Index, which considers factors such as staff courtesy and restaurant cleanliness,"" reported the Journal, adding: ""Among limited-service U.S. restaurants that mainly serve chicken, Chick-fil-A’s market share rose to 33% last year from 18% in 2009, while the market share of Yum Brands Inc.’s KFC chain fell to 15% from 29% in that time, according to data tracker Euromonitor.""
""We’ve been pretty consistent in how, over multiple decades, we’re going to take it slow and steady,"" said Chick-fil-A senior director Mark Moraitakis. ""It’s paid off for us.""
Though the restaurant has been praised for the friendly and efficient customer service and legendary chicken, it has also become a target of left-wing political backlash. Activists and politicians have tried to brand Chick-fil-A as discriminatory and anti-LGBT over the company donating to Christian charities and CEO Dan Cathy’s nearly-decade old remarks affirming that biblical marriage is between a man and a woman.
""It has been seven years since Dan Cathy affirmed biblical marriage in an interview. Seven years. Almost a decade. And yet the LGBT lobby has not yet dropped the matter. Against all odds, they have remained obsessed with the chicken chain for these 80 or so months,"" The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh wrote last month. ""Just recently, Chick-fil-A locations were blocked from opening at airports in Buffalo and San Antonio . Protests are still waged. Gay rights activists are still writing angry think pieces. We still are told that eating a Chick-fil-A chicken nugget is an act of bigotry against homosexuals. The chicken itself is labeled ' hateful .' All, again, because of views expressed by Dan Cathy during Obama’s first term in office.""
Walsh highlighted that Chick-fil-A has not been ""accused of actively discriminating against gay people. They serve gay people. They hire gay people. They do not take any discriminatory actions of any kind against gay people.""
Notably, Chick-fil-A broke their rule of staying closed on Sundays and provided free food to people donating blood in response to the tragic 2016 terrorist attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In other words, this was just another example of Chick-fil-A being really bad at ""hating"" gay people.
""But the founder is a Christian who believes what the Bible says. And that has been reason enough to spend seven entire years trying (unsuccessfully, and often hilariously) to destroy the man's business,"" continued Walsh.
Unsuccessfully, indeed. "
Facebook Co-Founder: It’s Dangerous. Break It Up. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46993/facebook-co-founder-its-dangerous-break-it-paul-bois,"May 9, 2019 views
Mark Zuckerberg has become too powerful and must be stopped, according to Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes.
Writing in The New York Times on Thursday, Chris Hughes referred to Facebook as ""dangerous"" and said that it must be subjected to government regulation.
""We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be,"" Hughes wrote, according to HuffPost . ""Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American. It is time to break up Facebook."" I’m calling for breaking up @Facebook in an essay in the @nytimes . FB has become too big and too powerful, and it’s part of a trend in our economy of an increasing concentration of corporate power. We can fix this: break the company up and regulate it. https://t.co/34rITPfvJ9 — Chris Hughes (@chrishughes) May 9, 2019
Hughes does not necessarily hit Facebook for cracking down on speech, such as the recent deplatforming of Alex Jones and Louis Farrakhan, and instead hits at the company's seemingly monopolistic empire. He takes serious issue with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) allowing Facebook to acquire Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, thereby sealing the company's hegemony in the social media sphere.
""Mark is a good, kind person,"" Hughes wrote. ""But I’m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks.""
""I’m worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them,"" he added. ""Facebook’s board works more like an advisory committee than an overseer.""
Hughes also accuses Facebook of quashing competition by copying innovations, such as Snapchat — thus creating an echo chamber where almost no major social media company can emerge to compete. The solution, according to Hughes, is to have the government break up Facebook into multiple companies by enforcing antitrust laws and dismantling the acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.
""Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability,"" Hughes wrote. ""This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment and, finally, resignation.""
Following that, Hughes says that a new regulatory agency must be created to focus on other companies with an emphasis on protecting people's privacy. He also urges Congress to pass a new privacy bill that would ""specify exactly what control Americans have over their digital information, require clearer disclosure to users and provide enough flexibility to the agency to exercise effective oversight over time.""
""This idea may seem un-American — we would never stand for a government agency censoring speech,"" Hughes wrote. ""But there is no constitutional right to harass others or live-stream violence.""
Hughes finishes on a more philosophical note, focusing less on Facebook's business practices and more on how the company has completely changed social communication — for the worse, in his view. He notes how the site is designed to keep people scrolling, constantly searching for an image more beautiful than the next.
""Some days, lying on the floor next to my 1-year-old son as he plays with his dinosaurs, I catch myself scrolling through Instagram, waiting to see if the next image will be more beautiful than the last,"" he wrote. ""What am I doing? I know it’s not good for me, or for my son, and yet I do it anyway.""
""We pay for Facebook with our data and our attention, and by either measure it doesn’t come cheap,"" he said. "
People In This Small Ohio Town Couldn’t Open Their Cars Or Garages For Weeks. The Mystery Has Been Solved. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46996/people-small-ohio-town-couldnt-open-their-cars-or-ashe-schow,"People In This Small Ohio Town Couldn’t Open Their Cars Or Garages For Weeks. The Mystery Has Been Solved. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 9, 2019 views
For weeks, residents in North Olmsted, Ohio, just outside of Cleveland, couldn’t use their key fobs to open their cars or garage doors.
The problem started in late April, according to WKCY3 . The media outlet interviewed resident Cory Branchick, who said when the problem first started she assumed the battery in her key fob had died.
“So, I got a battery and that didn't work,” she told WKYC3.
“It only happens when I’m only in the driveway,” she added. “Anywhere else when I got to work or when I go to the grocery store, the key fob works.”
Branchick told the outlet that 10 of her neighbors were having the same issue, and residents who lived on other streets in the area were also experiencing the problem. Some residents only had their key fob stop working, others couldn’t operate their garage doors, while still others found both had stopped working
For weeks police looked into the issue — but not before residents ran wild with speculation. Maybe something at the airport was interfering with the device. Maybe NASA was involved.
North Olmsted City Councilman Chris Glassburn said something must be interfering with fobs’ radio frequencies and suggested maybe the utility companies’ equipment in the area was responsible. AT&T and First Energy investigated, but found nothing . First Energy even turned off residents’ power, yet the interfering frequency remained.
“We really thought it was going to be the utilities,” Glassburn told WKYC3.
Glassburn said he would continue to investigate.
A week later, residents finally had their answer .
Glassburn had set out with a retired communications employee and searched for the source. Using a de-amplifier, they found the signal and were able to enter the residents’ home with permission from a neighbor. In the home they found a homemade device had been causing the interference.
""It was a man-made custom device that was designed to notify the resident someone was in their home,"" Glassburn told WKCY3. ""We turned it off and went outside pressed our clickers and everything started working again. It was like magic.""
The resident who created the device had special needs and was unaware of the problems his invention was causing his neighbors, Glassburn told The New York Times.
The councilman said the device causing all the trouble was the size of a shoe box, and hadn’t been properly designed.
""It was putting out a signal continuously and only was the signal interrupted would it tell them another individual was in the part of the home.""
The resident agreed to turn the device off and not make any more. City officials told WKYC3 there was no “malicious intent” on the part of the resident who created the device.
Mystery solved.
While this may have been a small and simple mystery, it is a good example of a community actually coming together — residents and government — to solve a problem. Glassburn actually stepped out to help his constituents, something rarely seen in higher levels of government today. "
Comey Gives 'Very Painful' Response When Asked About Anti-Trump FBI Employees | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47035/comey-gives-very-painful-response-when-asked-about-james-barrett,"Comey Gives 'Very Painful' Response When Asked About Anti-Trump FBI Employees Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 10, 2019 views
On Thursday night, former FBI Director James Comey — who was unceremoniously fired by President Trump in May 2017 and who has since made a point of publicly undermining Trump's presidency — participated in a CNN town hall in which he was asked about the impact the role of anti-Trump former FBI agent Peter Strzok and his paramour, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, had on the credibility of bureau and the investigation into Trump. Comey gave a ""very painful"" answer.
Strzok and Page have repeatedly found themselves in headlines, and official inquiries, because of their correspondence while they were both employed by the FBI in 2016 and 2017 about Trump, for whom they repeatedly displayed their hostility. Strzok headed up the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's illegal private email server and was a member of Robert Mueller's team in the early stages of the ""collusion"" investigation before the special counsel was forced to remove him after his problematic anti-Trump messages came to light. Just Monday, Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson highlighting yet another text from Strzok to Page that raised more questions about the intelligence community's role in leaks to the media concerning the Trump-Russia investigation.
In a moment from the town hall Thursday noted by Mediaite , host Anderson Cooper, after giving the audience a primer on Strzok and Page, introduced a question from an audience member about what consequences Comey believes Strzok, Page and fired Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe should have faced.
""Considering the high standards that we set for law enforcement, what do you think should have been the consequences for Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Andrew McCabe?"" the audience member asked Comey.
""I think, given the standards that we have — especially we in the FBI have — there should have been, and was, severe discipline around their behavior,"" said Comey. ""As Anderson said, very different episodes of behavior. Everyone has opinions — about political issues, about religious issues, and sports issues. You can’t bring them to work and have them affect your work. There have to be severe consequences. FBI employees must tell the truth, always. And if they don't, I don't care what it's about, it's going to be investigated and there's going to be severe consequences. ""
After insisting that he knew nothing about Strzok and Page's opinions on Trump and suggesting that McCabe likely didn't either, Comey was asked by Cooper if he would admit that Strzok and Page had ""damaged"" the bureau's reputation or ""tarnished"" the Russia investigation.
""So, do you acknowledge that this whole episode with Strzok and Page that it damaged the reputation of the FBI and that it perhaps tarnished the investigation?"" asked Cooper.
""Definitely,"" said Comey. ""Yeah. Very painful. It was important that it be investigated, and important that there be discipline that follows it. But yeah, it made us all look bad.""
Comey then made a point of defending Strzok. ""Peter Strzok is a very talented agent,"" he stressed. ""It’s a personal tragedy for him. But, as much as I care about individuals, I care about the institution more. It hurt the institution."" ( Watch the exchange here .)
During the town hall, Comey also predicted that Trump would face legal consequences for alleged ""obstruction"" after his presidency. Trump took to Twitter in response to the CNN event to reiterate his very low opinion of Comey and defend his decision to fire him.
""James Comey is a disgrace to the FBI & will go down as the worst Director in its long and once proud history,"" Trump wrote. ""He brought the FBI down, almost all Republicans & Democrats thought he should be FIRED, but the FBI will regain greatness because of the great men & women who work there!""

He brought the FBI down, almost all Republicans & Democrats thought he should be FIRED, but the FBI will regain greatness because of the great men & women who work there! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2019
As Fox News noted Thursday, Comey has come under increased scrutiny amid new revelations about his FBI's attempts to ""spy"" on the Trump campaign. ""A Trump administration official briefed on the matter told Fox News that Barr assembled a 'team' to investigate the origins of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign,"" the network reports. ""Fox News also has been told the Justice Department's inspector general (IG) was looking separately into whether Comey mishandled classified information by including a variety of sensitive matters in his private memos that include the name and code name of a confidential human source."""
Amy Klobuchar Says Planned Parenthood Offers Mammograms. They Don’t. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47050/amy-klobuchar-says-planned-parenthood-offers-paul-bois,"Amy Klobuchar Says Planned Parenthood Offers Mammograms. They Don’t. ""They’re going there for mammograms..."" Ethan Miller / Staff / Getty Images May 10, 2019 views
2020 candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has put forward the dubious and pernicious lie that abortion conglomerate Planned Parenthood offers mammograms, even though this myth has been so thoroughly debunked that even Snopes had to admit the assertion had no merit.
Speaking at a Fox News town hall event this week, the senator from Minnesota said that ""one in five women"" go to the abortion chain for treatment besides abortion, which apparently includes mammograms.
""Most of them are going there for contraception, birth control, they’re going there for mammograms, they’re going there for cancer screenings, and yet over and over again, this president has tried to cut that funding for Planned Parenthood,"" Klobuchar said, according to The Washington Times .
The senator's emphatic defense of Planned Parenthood stemmed from the prospect of Congress stripping it of American taxpayer dollars. As noted by LifeSiteNews , the Democratic talking point that Planned Parenthood offers mammograms has been punched with so many holes as to render it entirely obsolete.
""Planned Parenthood does not actually provide mammograms, but only offers standard breast exams that women can perform themselves and referrals to get mammograms elsewhere,"" reports the outlet. ""Even mainstream fact-checkers such as The Washington Post have been setting the record straight ever since former President Barack Obama claimed in 2012 that Planned Parenthood offers mammograms.""
""Pro-life groups such as And Then There Were None and Live Action have helped expose the truth by organizing and recording phone calls to various Planned Parenthood locations by women attempting to schedule appointments for mammograms, demonstrating that Planned Parenthood could not meet their requests,"" the report continued.
During the town hall, Klobuchar, a supposed moderate among a roster of socialist crazies, also defended her stance on late-term abortion.
""Of course, there are limits there in the third trimester that are very important about, except for the health of the woman, and there are some limits there,"" she said. ""But I think overall, what we want to do is make sure women have the right — right? — to make their own decisions.""
Klobuchar also blasted President Trump for seeking to defund Planned Parenthood due to its birth control program supposedly curtailing the number of abortions. ""So when this president goes … against Planned Parenthood, that to me is a major problem,"" she said.
Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life ( MCCL ) wrote that Klobuchar is an extremist on abortion — not only on her support for it in the third-trimester but also due to her support for taxpayers funding the procedure, having sponsored various pieces of legislation to severely limit abortion restrictions.
""Klobuchar has never voted for a pro-life bill or for a restriction on abortion, no matter how modest,"" the organization said. ""Klobuchar also co-sponsored sweeping legislation that would have invalidated nearly all limits on abortion, at any stage of pregnancy.""
If Klobuchar wants to clinch the 2020 nomination, she has a major uphill battle, with the latest polls putting her nearly dead last. Upon announcing her candidacy, she took a major hit in the character department when The New York Times released a scathing report confirming rumors that Klobuchar earned herself a reputation on Capitol Hill for abusing her staff."

Who can forget the infamous opening line to Hunter S. Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel, ""Fear and Loathing Las Vegas""?
We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.
Well, the Los Angeles Times may have come close to matching Thompson. Here is the opening line to a Times piece today entitled, ""The 'Tactical Rabbi' Helps Synagogues Defend Against Anti-Semitic Violence"":
It was 45 minutes into his lecture when the rabbi pulled out an AR-15.
Pretty awesome indeed. The rabbi in question is named Raziel Cohen, and he is the head instructor at a group called National Defensive Firearms Training (NDFT). Here is how the NDFT website describes Cohen:
Instructor Cohen, otherwise known as ""The Tactical Rabbi,"" has been training and instructing some of the best in the country. The National Defensive Firearms Training Academy only became available to civilians in 2018. Prior to this, Instructor Cohen only gave private courses to Military Personnel, Law Enforcement Officers, and Security Details.
Instructor Cohen began his training with Competition Shooters, which helped him learn competitive techniques and apply it to the defensive world, allowing him to teach students how to be faster and more accurate. ...
In July of 2018, Instructor Cohen was one of only seven people hand selected in the state of California to join a Special Forces training class. The class was led by an active duty Navy Seal and a member of Australian Special Forces. Instructor Cohen completed top of the class. ...
Finally, Instructor Cohen is a certified instructor under the Department of Justice as well as having multiple certifications under the NRA. He not only completed top of his class but his perfect test score put him in the top 1% of the United States.
Not too shabby for a kippa-clad ordained rabbi!
As the Times piece elaborates, services such as Cohen's have become more popular since the deadly shooting last month at the Chabad of Poway, California that left one dead and the heroic rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein , seriously maimed:
""Who thinks, by show of hands, that we should be carrying more guns in shul?"" Rabbi Raziel Cohen asked the crowd at a Westside Chabad synagogue Wednesday night, during an active-shooter seminar organized in the wake of the deadly attack at Chabad of Poway.
Half the room raised their hands.
In the days since the shooting, Chabad leaders in California have scrambled to secure public safety grants and to calm frightened congregants, mobilizing hundreds more through active-shooter drills and community defense training. In Southern California, religious security experts such as Cohen, who calls himself the ""Tactical Rabbi,"" are quickly becoming their own cottage industry.
In an op-ed for The Daily Wire and a NRATV appearance following the horrific Chabad shooting, I argued that Jews simply must take responsibility and arm themselves. With anti-Semitism on the rise not just in Europe, but right here on the domestic homefront, there is truly no other viable option. Godspeed to Rabbi Cohen, and may as many Jews as possible heed his clarion call. ""Anti-Semitism cannot and should not be brushed aside, and with two high-profile attacks on synagogues in the last six months, conservative writer @josh_hammer is calling for Jews across the country to arm themselves."" — @DLoesch @realDailyWire Watch the full interview on NRATV. pic.twitter.com/HOAhjwl1Xv"
Lara Trump Says Threatening Don Jr. With Jail Won’t ‘Make Hillary Clinton President’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47041/lara-trump-says-threatening-don-jr-jail-wont-make-ashe-schow,"Lara Trump Says Threatening Don Jr. With Jail Won’t ‘Make Hillary Clinton President’ Photo by Manny Carabel/Getty Images May 10, 2019 views
All the Democrats’ threats subpoenas and votes for contempt are just payback for losing the election.
Lara Trump, senior advisor to the 2020 Trump campaign and wife of President Donald Trump’s son Eric, said on Fox News Thursday night that demanding Donald Trump Jr. testify before congress or face jail “is not going to make Hillary Clinton the president of the United States.”
Lara Trump told Fox News host Tucker Carlson on his nightly program, “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” that the special counsel investigation into whether the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russia “is over,” and that Trump Jr. testified previously.
In September 2017, Trump Jr. testified before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee behind closed doors — for hours. He was asked repeatedly about the infamous Trump Tower meeting where he, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort met with alleged Russians (who actually had ties to Democrat opposition research firm Fusion GPS) to get “dirt” on Clinton. In the end, no “dirt” was provided, and the meeting — which now looks more like entrapment — resulted in nothing.
Now, nearly two years later, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) has sent a subpoena to Trump Jr., causing a rift in the Republican party. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said Trump Jr. “ought to be put in jail” if he doesn’t comply with the subpoena.
Lara Trump scoffed at the notion.
""We know [collusion] did not happen,"" she told Carlson. ""Whatever they think they're going to do is not going to change that. It's not going to make Hillary Clinton the president of the United States like I know they all wanted so badly for so long.""
Lara Trump added that she was “shocked and appalled” that Burr, a senator from her home state of North Carolina, would do such a thing.
""This is harassment of our family, harassment of the president,"" she said.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished his investigation in March, finding no evidence of collusion and not enough evidence to recommend a charge of obstruction. Attorney General William Barr opted not to charge for obstruction, since the decision then fell to him.
Since then (and really, even before), Democrats have demanded to see the evidence for themselves, no doubt so that they can use it against President Trump and justify their continued discussions of impeachment. Democrats currently have around 22 investigations opened into Trump, his business, his finances, his campaign, and his family — all fishing expeditions to get back at him for winning the presidency over Clinton (and maybe even as revenge for leaving their party and becoming a Republican).
Trump won the election; Hillary Clinton did not. Trump’s presidency has been succeeding even with the Russian investigation looming over his head. Now he’s been cleared, and Democrats aren’t happy. Neither, it would appear, are some Republicans. "
Another University Votes To Boot Chick-fil-A From Campus | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47048/another-university-votes-boot-chick-fil-campus-paul-bois,"Another University Votes To Boot Chick-fil-A From Campus ""We don't sell pornography in the bookstore..."" Araya Diaz / Contributor / Getty Images May 10, 2019 views
Even though the fast food chain Chick-fil-A has routinely fended off the hate leftists have directed at it simply because the company's late founder expressed support for biblical morality, another university has voted to ban the restaurant from campus.
According to LifeSiteNews , the faculty of Cal Poly San Luis Obisbo ""voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to recommend expelling Chick-fil-A from campus."" Strangely, the school likened the presence of Chick-fil-A on campus — and there has been one there for 25 years — to pornography in the campus bookstores.
""We don't sell pornography in the bookstore and we don't have a Hooters on campus — we already pre-select those kind of things based on our existing values,"" academic senate vice chair Thomas Gutierrez told the on-campus publication Mustang News . ""This is a similar thing, the difference is we're actually profiting from this. So our money, every dollar a student is spending at Chick-fil-A, is going to these causes that are in violation of our values.""
Thirty-eight of the Cal Poly’s academic senate’s 44 members voted to force Chick-fil-A off campus. University spokesman Matt Lazier agreed that Chick-fil-A represents bigotry but disagreed that fighting ""intolerance with intolerance"" would solve the problem.
""While university administration passionately disagrees with the values of some of the organizations, the president of Chick-fil-A has chosen to make personal donations to, we do not believe in responding to intolerance with intolerance,"" Lazier said. ""Rather, we must model our values of inclusion — that means upholding the rights of others to have different perspectives and ensuring there is space in our community for differing viewpoints and ideologies, even those that may be in direct conflict with our own.""
The hate toward the chicken sandwich empire began in 2012 when company founder Dan Cathy expressed support for traditional one-man/one-woman marriage, prompting boycotts across the country from LGBTQ activists.
""I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, 'We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,'"" Cathy said at the time . ""I pray God's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to define what marriage is about.""
Just last year, two major publications wrote scathing articles begging people to boycott the business: The New Yorker and HuffPost . ""If You Really Love LGBTQ People, You Just Can’t Keep Eating Chick-fil-A,"" wrote Noah Michelson of HuffPost. When Chick-fil-A wanted to set up shop in New York City, Dan Piepenring of The New Yorker called it a ""creepy infiltration"" of the city.
Since then, Chick-fil-A has been banned from two major airports : San Antonio and Buffalo. Most recently, a dean at Rider University resigned from his post when the school banned the chicken restaurant on campus.
As reported by The Daily Wire's Amanda Prestigiacomo, however, the chicken giant just continues to thrive no matter what the Left throws at it, becoming the third biggest fast-food chain in the United States with $10.2 billion in sales while doubling its number of locations since 2007. "

The Charges Were Dropped When She Realized She FORGOT She Gave Consent. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47054/she-accused-him-rape-charges-were-dropped-when-she-ashe-schow,"She Accused Him Of Rape. The Charges Were Dropped When She Realized She FORGOT She Gave Consent. steele2123 / Getty Images May 10, 2019 views
A Queensland man, now 49, was accused of raping a woman whom he had known and previously had sex with back in October 2017.
The couple met at a church event years before this alleged incident, The Daily Mail reported , and had sex on occasion throughout those years. On October 8, 2017, the woman invited the man over to her home after the two had a fight earlier that day. The man came over and the two had consensual sex. The next day, however, she called police and said the man had raped her.
The charges were finally dropped against the man, who will not be named by The Daily Wire, because the woman simply “forgot” she had invited him.
Crown Prosecutor Matthew Hynes withdrew the charges and told an Australian court that the woman suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had a personality disorder. He said these disorders would lead the woman to engage in “incidences with men, whereby consensual sex can occur, she can transplant previous memories on to that.”
“She has a high-functioning alcoholism issue whereby she consumes a fair bit of alcohol every day, and that plays a part into her mental health and her mind and state and perception of things,” Hynes added. “It also plays a part in why she might forget things at times.”
The judge in the case, Catherine Muir, told the courtroom the accuser had a “false impression” of the incident.
The woman also claimed that prior to the sex, the accused man pushed her “backwards on to the couch, which hurt her back.” The man allegedly had “no recollection” of pushing her, according to his attorney Peter Nolan, but pleaded guilty to assault to “prevent the woman from having to face the witness box,” the Mail reported.
The accused man, despite being innocent, lost his job as an Uber driver as a result of the woman’s claims. He had no criminal history prior to this accusation.
This is what happens when we live in the era of #MeToo, where every accusation, no matter how thin or what the woman’s circumstances are, must be believed and every accused man must be taken through the system. This man was charged with rape because a mentally ill woman forgot she consented.
In another recent example, a man faced the court system after an abusive ex-girlfriend stalked him and then made up a false rape claim against him when he didn’t respond. He was the victim, yet he was treated as a perpetrator until the charges were finally dropped.
Perhaps the woman who forgot she consented needs mental health help, but many other women, who lie for vindictive reasons, are never punished for the harm they cause to innocent men. Or, in the rare instance they are criminally punished, they receive light sentences such as probation or a fine.
Until false accusations are taken seriously, they will continue, and when there’s a movement that seeks to paint due process as an impediment to justice, they will not just continue, but pick up. "

On Friday, an estimated 1,000 pro-lifers gathered outside a Philadelphia-based Planned Parenthood in response to Democrat State Representative Brian Sims live-streaming his harassment of an elderly pro-life sidewalk counselor and teenage girls praying outside the abortion clinic over the weekend.
The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh, who called for the rally in reaction to Sims’ deplorable treatment of pro-lifers, gave an impassioned speech at the gathering, which of course included a direct address to “bully” Sims.
“I’m grateful that we are not merely complaining right now. No, we decided to do something, we responded. We are engaging on the issue in the real world. I hope we continue this,” Walsh told the massive crowd, according to Faithwire. Here’s what peaceful pro-life action looks like.

“We are saying to the pro-life activists that they are not alone and that we are with them,” he said. “We can’t just be pro-life in our minds, we have to live that truth — to bring that truth out into the real world.”
Then Walsh took on Sims directly: “We are sending a message to bullies like Brian Sims. We will not be intimidated, we will not be silenced. If you try to shut us up, we are only going to get louder. If you try to shame us, we are only going to stand taller.” . @MattWalshBlog to @BrianSimsPA : “If you try to shut us up, we’re only going to get louder...you try to intimidate because that’s all you have. You have no arguments...If you want to bully someone, I’m right here.” — Alexandra DeSanctis (@xan_desanctis) May 10, 2019
“Pick on someone your own size,” Walsh said to the Democrat. “Can you look us in the eyes and tell us why you think babies should be killed? If we cannot see the worth and value in a child, then who can we see it in?”
“We know that our cause is just. We know that we are right and we are firm in that truth. We have truth on our side and we will wield it like a sword to protect the unborn,” he added. We are sending a message to bullies like Brian Sims. We will not be intimidated, we will not be silenced. If you try to shut us up, we are only going to get louder. If you try to shame us, we are only going to stand taller. -Matt Walsh
The podcast host ended by explaining why he and fellow pro-lifers care so deeply about the issue of abortion: “Because life is precious — that’s it, that’s our entire argument. … Let the children live. Let them live!”
Sims made headlines on Saturday when he live-streamed himself harassing an elderly pro-life sidewalk counselor for over seven minutes. “Shame on you! Shame on you!” the Democrat continuously shouted at the woman. “What you’re doing out here is disgusting. You have no business being out here! … An old white lady telling people what's right to do with their bodies. Shame on you. Shame! Shame!”
The Democrat also taped himself threatening to dox three teenage girls who were praying outside the abortion clinic. “What we’ve got here is a bunch of protesters, a bunch of pseudo-Christian protesters who’ve been out here shaming young girls for being here,” Sims screams at them. “So here’s the deal, I’ve got a $100 for anyone who will identify any of these three.”
Walsh personally thanked Mr. Sims on Twitter, too. ""HUGE thanks to [Brian Sims] for making this happen. We couldn't have done it without him."" HUGE thanks to @BrianSimsPA for making this happen. We couldn't have done it without him. — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) May 10, 2019"
HAMMER: China Is America’s Greatest 21st Century Threat. Trump’s Aggressive Posture Is Proper. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Josh Hammer,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47057/hammer-china-americas-greatest-21st-century-threat-josh-hammer,"May 10, 2019 views
In January, I joined a quasi-diplomatic mission, organized by the American Jewish Committee , to Japan. The mission was sponsored by the Japanese government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, over the course of our eight days in Japan, we met with various high-ranking diplomatic officials from each of the American, Japanese, and Israeli governments. The common theme of the trip was a joint understanding, especially from the perspectives of the U.S. and Japan, that China represents the most acutely distressing geopolitical threat of the 21st century. American and Japanese officials frequently discussed the need to partner, in unison with other allied regional actors such as South Korea, to deter and repel Chinese military, political, and economic ambitions.
Calling China the number one 21st century geopolitical threat to the United States ought to not be a particularly controversial claim. As far back as 2011, The Economist noted that, ""[w]ith its rapidly improving military capability ... China has the wherewithal to challenge the security status quo in the Pacific as well as potential motives to do so."" That trend has only exacerbated in recent years. In January, for instance, the Pentagon expressly warned about China's recent ""series of ambitious military reforms and acquired new technology."" In March, the Chinese government assertively pronounced an astonishing 7.5% annual rise in military spending — which was actually a mild decrease from the previous year's military spending increase. Over just the past couple months, China has fortified its military presence in the highly strategic Horn of Africa, and has even made expansionist overtures in the Arctic.
But perhaps less noticed is China's deeply destructive browbeating and overt cyberwarfare intimidation of Western corporations when those corporations deviate from the Chinese Communist Party's line vis-à-vis territorial disputes with Taiwan the Republic of China and Tibet. In January, Ben Weingarten explained at The Federalist:
In January 2018, Marriott International, the world’s largest hotel company, cowered at verbal attacks by Chinese government officials for having set a survey listing Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Macau as distinct from China, and for an employee’s ""like"" of a tweet endorsing Tibetan independence using a corporate Twitter account.
Later, in November 2018, Marriott disclosed it was the victim of a massive hack of its Starwood reservation database, compromising the sensitive information of up to 383 million guests, including passport numbers, email addresses, and credit card data. According to reports, U.S. investigators believe the hackers were affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, its sprawling intelligence apparatus. ...
Also in 2018, Mercedes-Benz posted an anodyne quote from the Dalai Lama on Instagram: ""Look at the situations from all angles, and you will become more open."" The Dalai Lama is a Tibetan leader. So, facing strong criticism from Chinese state media, Mercedes apologized, promising: ""no support, assistance, aid or help to anyone who intentionally subverts or attempts to subvert China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.""
The upshot is that everywhere from North Korean denuclearization to the Senkaku Islands territorial sovereignty dispute in the East China Sea to the deeply combative forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft that the Chinese Communist Party claims as an allegedly necessary ""cost"" of doing business in China, China is a deeply adversarial geopolitical actor. This is a nation with rapidly escalating hard military power, the world's second largest GDP, a huge landmass, the world's largest population, ownership of a massive reserve of U.S. sovereign debt, a grossly manipulated currency , an aggressive regional foreign policy that seeks to undermine key U.S. allies, a desire to dictate the rules of trade from a hostile, communist perspective, a reflexive urge to publicly shame and embarrass Western corporations into toeing the Chinese Communist Party line on geographical disputes, and an unhinged zealotry in committing acts of cyberwarfare upon and pilfering the intellectual property of sundry Western corporations.
When Mitt Romney famously called Russia America's number one geopolitical threat during the 2012 presidential election, he was wrong. Russia is indeed a generally hostile actor that does not have anything remotely resembling America's best interests at heart. But the number one geopolitical threat for America this century is not Russia, but China.
Against this backdrop, the Friday announcement of President Donald Trump's latest imposition of massive tariffs as a pure tactical cudgel — and not as an economically desirous end in and of itself — is understandable and, indeed, proper. I am as pro-free trade as anyone, but free trade only necessarily works when all parties abide by the same playing rules. Not only does China not abide by the same rules as does the U.S., but it actively thwarts and harms the U.S. at every possible turn. And one-sided ""free trade"" is not actually free trade.
This is an enemy regime, and it ought to be viewed and treated as such. The U.S. cannot be militarily, politically, or economically bullied by anyone , and the Trump administration's imposition of purely procedural tariffs — which must be viewed as part of a broader, comprehensive push back against Chinese hegemony — against such a malfeasant actor ought to not be condemned. Hopefully, we eventually get to a state of zero-tariff free trade policy with China. But that day is not today — and it likely will not be anytime soon. In the interim, all options need to be on the table to help rein in this unconstrained, destructive foe."
BBC Promotes 'Drag Syndrome': Drag Queens With Down Syndrome | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47008/bbc-promotes-drag-syndrome-drag-queens-down-amanda-prestigiacomo,"A post shared by Drag Syndrome (@dragsyndrome) on Jun 18, 2018 at 8:28am PDT
In October, NBC News similarly showcased “Drag Syndrome.” The network highlighted performances by the group’s members at a popular gay venue called Royal Vauxhall Tavern.
“Then, without warning, the steady electronic beat of the music shifts to a more familiar Divine track, and out pops a drag queen dressed to the nines in a skin-tight catsuit, draped with purple sequins, and a blond wig to top it all off,” reported NBC.
“Good evening b****es,” Otto, dressed as Horrora Shebang, said to the audience.
“I don’t do nervous,” Otto Baxter, the man behind the feisty Horrora Shebang persona, told NBC News before the show.
Daniel Vais, the choreographer for Drag Syndrome says the “starting point” for the performances “is the art. Before Down’s syndrome, before extra chromosome, before disability, before anything.”
Vais previously told Mashable that the group’s first drag event “fully sold out.”
""And while we were performing it, the audience came up to me and said, 'This is revolutionary,'” he said. “'This is history happening here. The artists that performed it did such a good job.' The audience realized we were doing something out of this world. This was not just people with Down syndrome dressing up. This is proper, proper drag. It was so new to them.”
""Suddenly in front of them is an amazing drag queen with Down syndrome performing like a master. [The audience] thought [the people with Down syndrome] were all very cute and very angelic,” he continued. “Suddenly, it becomes so fierce. You have this drag queen going on stage saying 'Good evening, b****es.’ And it's an amazing drag queen. And she controls the crowd.”
Vais called the performances “avant-garde art.”
“When my artists are dancing on the dance floor it's like Rihanna came. This is not a social experiment. It's not an after-school club. This is proper avant-garde art,” he told Mashable.

LA Writer Wore A MAGA Hat Into An Ultra-Liberal Vegan Restaurant. Here’s What Happened. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47004/la-writer-brought-maga-hat-vegan-restaurant-heres-paul-bois,"LA Writer Wore A MAGA Hat Into An Ultra-Liberal Vegan Restaurant. Here’s What Happened. ""No one gave me a dirty look."" Bill Clark / Contributor / Getty Images May 9, 2019 views
As a case study in American political tribalism in the age of President Trump, a Los Angeles writer wore a MAGA hat to an ultra-liberal vegan restaurant in the city to see what sort of adventures would unfold. Quite shockingly, people actually proved his thesis wrong.
The article by Joel Stein in Los Angeles Magazine confronts the fact that Americans hate each other in the age of President Trump, a fever he himself admits to having been inflicted with at times.
""More than 42 percent of people in each party think those in the other party are 'downright evil,' 20 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans think we’d be better off if members of the other party 'just died,'"" Stein writes. ""The anger is so ubiquitous that even I’ve been infected. I saw an elderly man walking toward me on the Ferndell Trail in Griffith Park wearing a red hat, and I hate-stared him until he got close enough that I could see it had a USC logo on it. I avoided talking to a nice dad at my son’s old school because there was a rumor that he voted for Trump.""
Stein has been researching political tribalism for his upcoming book, oddly titled ""In Defense of Elitism."" He admits that his research has led him to see some Trump supporters in a different light, such as when he visited Miami, Texas, only to find out that the people there were so nice that they ""fed me in their homes or paid the server before our check arrived.""
""I worry that my side isn’t as friendly,"" Stein admits. ""We’ve harassed politicians out of restaurants, chanted threats outside a Fox News anchor’s home, and gone off on me for asking other parents if putting on a play about Native Americans despite the fact that there are no Native Americans in our school is really that evil.""
In light of all this, Stein devised a little social experiment: wear the iconic Make America Great Again hat to the ultra-liberal Café Gratitude in Larchmont, which he describes as a ""vegan hipster restaurant."" It's a restaurant so liberal that when the establishment sold a ""Make America Grateful Hat,"" customers complained that it took President Trump's evil too lightly.
""I didn’t want to give $25 to Trump’s re-election campaign, so I bought a knockoff hat made in China for $8 on Amazon,"" Stein writes. ""The hate is so strong in me that I thought it was more ethical to support the Chinese government than Trump.""
Stein admits to being terrified upon his journey to the restaurant, fearing the absolute worst could happen, recalling the incident at Dodger Stadium where a guy ended up in a nine-month coma for wearing a San Francisco Giants hat. When he arrived at Café Gratitude, however, his expectations were surprisingly disproven. In fact, Stein learned some interesting insight about people on his own side — they don't hate Trump or his supporters nearly as much as they profess.
""I glanced around the room, and no one gave me a dirty look,"" Stein writes. ""No one walked up to yell at me about Charlottesville or caged children. The guy with the ear twig pulled out a newspaper called the SJW, which I figured was a publication for Social Justice Warriors until I looked again and saw it was The Wall Street Journal .""
""Before I left, I asked the black waiter, Darick Thomas, how he felt about my hat,"" Stein continues. ""'I don’t care. At all. Really. At all! I look at a hat and that doesn’t tell me who the person is,' he said. ""'I’m not against Trump. He says some smart things; he says some dumb things.'""
Throughout Stein's whole time at the restaurant, only one person, a patron, openly expressed disapproval of his MAGA hat. ""Is that guy wearing a f***ing MAGA hat?"" the patron asked at the counter.
Stein's article ends on a quasi-confused note, illustrating how his experience throughout his research has stifled his narrative, so much so that he strives to keep his beliefs about Trump intact. He recalls a moment when his friend saw a man with a swastika tattoo on his neck frolicking through the park in some kind of Instagram photo shoot, expressing frustration that nobody confronted him.
""The far right has become so normalized that no one said anything to a guy in a MAGA hat at Café Gratitude,"" Stein concludes. ""I Am Not Sure How Great That Is."" "
Democrats Renew Push To Overturn Major First Amendment SCOTUS Decision ~ Full Magazine,www.dailywire.com,,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47073/democrats-renew-push-overturn-major-first-josh-hammer,"Democrats Renew Push To Overturn Major First Amendment SCOTUS Decision Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 10, 2019 views
This week, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) resuscitated an old Democratic Party political enemy: The First Amendment-affirming 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission . In Citizens United , the Court held that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment generally prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for communications by corporations, labor unions, and other similarly situated associations. The relevant statute, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, had prohibited any corporation from making an ""electioneering communication"" within 30 days of a primary election or within 60 days of a general election. The Citizens United decision, although well-grounded in the original understanding of the political speech-centric Free Speech Clause, has consistently been lambasted by the Left ever since it was handed down. Many on the Left criticize the ""dark money"" from corporations that the decision has allegedly allowed to flow out in the open.
Now, Schiff wants to bring back an effort to overturn the decision via constitutional amendment. CNN reports :
Rep. Adam Schiff on Wednesday introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which helped usher in a new era of big money in American elections.
""Our democracy is not for sale. We must stop the flood of dark money from drowning out the voices of everyday citizens,"" the California Democrat said in a statement on Twitter. He said such an amendment would ""restore power to the American people.""
By a 5-4 ruling, the high court in 2010 swept aside a ban on independent spending by corporations and unions in candidate elections, saying the restrictions amounted to censorship. Outside spending in federal elections has soared from $338 million in 2008, the last presidential election before the ruling, to $1.4 billion in 2016, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.
But, as Justice Kennedy held for the 5-4 Court: ""The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment ; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical pre-election period is not a permissible remedy. Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are [constitutionally impermissible].""
Here is how Judge Jim Ho of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit formulated it last year in a dissent from a denial of a decision to rehear a case en banc (full disclosure: I previously served as a law clerk for Judge Ho):
Under our Constitution, the people are not subjects, but citizens. As citizens, we enjoy the fundamental right to express our opinions on who does and does not belong in elected office.
To be sure, many Americans of good faith bemoan the amount of money spent on campaign contributions and political speech. But if you don’t like big money in politics, then you should oppose big government in our lives. Because the former is a necessary consequence of the latter. When government grows larger, when regulators pick more and more economic winners and losers, participation in the political process ceases to be merely a citizen’s prerogative — it becomes a human necessity. This is the inevitable result of a government that would be unrecognizable to our Founders. See, e.g., NFIB v. Sebelius , 567 U.S. 519 (2012).
So if there is too much money in politics, it’s because there’s too much government. The size and scope of government makes such spending essential. See, e.g., EMILY’s List v. FEC , 581 F.3d 1, 33 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Brown, J., concurring) (""The more power is at stake, the more money will be used to shield, deflect, or co-opt it. So long as the government can take and redistribute a man’s livelihood, there will always be money in politics."").
The Constitution has not been amended since the 27th Amendment was ratified in 1992. "
Trump’s New Nickname For Biden: ‘SleepyCreepy Joe’ | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47047/trumps-new-nickname-biden-sleepycreepy-joe-paul-bois,"Hillary is ""Crooked."" Bernie is ""Crazy."" Biden is apparently ""Sleepy"" and ""Creepy"" all at once.
Ever since former Vice President Joe Biden announced his 2020 candidacy, President Trump has been putting nicknames out as feelers to see what might stick over the next year and a half. First, he coined the phrase ""Sleepy Joe,"" and after seeing that fail to take hold, he's moved onto his latest: ""SleepyCreepy Joe"" — an upgrade of sorts.
""Looks to me like it’s going to be SleepyCreepy Joe over Crazy Bernie [Sanders],"" Trump tweeted on Friday. ""Everyone else is fading fast!"" Looks to me like it’s going to be SleepyCreepy Joe over Crazy Bernie. Everyone else is fading fast! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2019
Time will tell if the moniker sticks, but Trump has no doubt been playing the troll game against Joe Biden ever since the spate of allegations from various women that he touched them inappropriately by getting into their personal space. For that, Biden has only expressed sorrow for not understanding more.
""I’m sorry I didn’t understand more,"" said Biden. ""I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman. So that’s not the reputation I’ve had since I was in high school, for God’s sakes ... The fact of the matter is I made it clear that if I made anyone feel [uncomfortable], I feel badly about that. It was never my intention. Ever.""
Biden's first accuser, Lucy Flores, hammered Biden in a New York Times op-ed for his lack of apology.
""The act of atoning may be difficult and complicated, but the concept is simple enough: You did something bad and it caused harm,"" wrote Flores. ""A basic sense of decency urges you to take measures to, at worst, express how sorry you are, and at best, do something to right the wrong.""
""Not a villain. Not an unlikable person. Not a sexual harasser or assaulter. But also, as Anita Hill recently found out, not exactly sorry, either,"" she wrote.
Flores also criticized Biden in April for not taking the allegations seriously by joking about them in public forums.
""The basis of the behavior that I talked about was something much more serious than just a hug,"" Flores said on Fox News. ""That is unprofessional, inappropriate behavior, no matter who does it.""
""We're talking about the fact that, as women, we have had to endure this kind of inappropriate behavior on behalf of powerful men certainly for as long as I've been alive — you know, forever,"" Flores continued.
Trump's attacking Joe Biden this early on with nicknames while he still battles out in a primary is a tactical political maneuver that could force the former vice president into fighting on two fronts. Currently, he enjoys an impressive lead over his opponents — a full 32 points ahead of Bernie Sanders. He now holds a commanding lead of 42% to Bernie Sanders' 14%, which perhaps partially stems from the latter's having expressed his support for incarcerated felons (including the Boston Marathon bomber) voting in elections. The third contender in one recent poll, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, trails at just 7%."
"LIMBAUGH: Et Tu, Sen. Burr? | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,David Limbaugh,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47080/limbaugh-et-tu-sen-burr-david-limbaugh,"LIMBAUGH: Et Tu, Sen. Burr? Aaron P. Bernstein/Bloomberg via Getty Images May 11, 2019 views
How nauseating that RINO Sen. Richard Burr, as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is doing the bidding of vindictive Democrats in issuing a subpoena to Donald Trump Jr.
Burr has joined the Democrats' investigatory vendetta against President Trump, most recently exemplified in the House Judiciary Committee's vote to hold Attorney General Will Barr in contempt of Congress. Democrats claim Barr is in contempt for failing to release an unredacted report by special counsel Robert Mueller, allegedly lying twice to Congress and refusing to appear before the committee. All three claims are absurd on their face and, if heard by an impartial tribunal, will be rejected.
Democrats are pounding their chests in fake indignation that Barr lied in his summary of Mueller's report, but in all particulars, his summary tracked with the report, which Mueller affirmed. You can't quite make a case of contempt for lying when the witness told the truth.
As for his refusal to appear, Barr sat through hours of grilling and abuse by grandstanding senators and only decided to cancel his appearance before the House when Democrats announced that professional staffers would aid them in the questioning. Enough is enough.
Concerning the charge that Barr refused to turn over the unredacted report, he has already released to Congress a version that is 98 percent unredacted. ""Democrats are therefore seeking a contempt sanction on a report that is 98 percent disclosed and only lacks grand jury material,"" wrote law professor Jonathan Turley, who pointed out that the key obstruction portion of the report is ""virtually unredacted.""
The Democrats are acting in bad faith, ignoring the bulk of the report and its conclusions in trying to create a smoke screen of confusion to dupe their base and other parts of the credulous public who might be susceptible to believing they really have the goods on Trump at last.
Now Sen. Burr has climbed aboard the Democrats' Witch Hunt Train, where he'll be consigned to the caboose as long as Conductor Jerrold Nadler, House Judiciary Committee chairman, insists on chugging his locomotive down this partisan track.
It's easy to understand what Nadler and his Democrat colleagues are up to — they've been telegraphing their plan to impede Trump's agenda through endless investigations over matters on which Trump has already been cleared. They have no intention of allowing him to be president — ever. I would say, ""Shame on them,"" except they're shameless. They know exactly what they're doing. They know it's wrong. But it serves their lower purposes, and that's all that matters.
It would be too charitable to accuse the Democrats and Burr of going on a fishing expedition because they know there's only dead fish in their toxic lake. They don't stand a snowball's chance of impeaching Trump or laying a glove on Don Jr. But they think they have plenty to gain in harassing the president, his family and anyone in his administration or wider orbit. If a team of highly skilled, Trump-hating prosecutors was unable to find anything actionable against Trump, these lightweight clowns in Congress are going nowhere. We are witnessing an ongoing abuse of power in its purest form, which is sure to backfire on its perpetrators.
Sen. Burr is probably shell-shocked to have stuck his finger in this hellhole thinking he would be drenched with praise, only to draw back a bloody stump. He is being uniformly condemned as the sanctimonious opportunist he is.
Sen. John Cornyn, a fellow member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he'd discuss the subpoena with Burr but warned that the panel needs to stay out of politics, and that this move against Donald Trump Jr. ""smacks of politics."" In a shot across the bow at Burr, Cornyn said that the Intelligence Committee needs to focus on its mission, ""which is oversight of the intelligence community."" Let's not lightly pass over that. Just what business does Burr think his committee has in further investigating a matter that has nothing remotely to do with intelligence, especially since Mueller concluded there was no collusion or coordination with Russia?
Sen. Mitch McConnell said the case was closed. Sen. Thom Tillis also criticized Burr's subpoena, affirming that the Mueller report cleared Donald Trump Jr. and that ""he's already spent 27 hours testifying before Congress."" Sen. Rand Paul tweeted that Burr apparently didn't get McConnell's memo that the case was closed. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy likewise tweeted that ""Endless investigations — by either party - won't change the fact that there was NO collusion."" Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said that failing to notify the White House before issuing the subpoena was ""bad form.""
It would be one thing for Burr to walk out on this brittle limb if he were pursuing a noble cause, but self-aggrandizement has never been considered virtuous. He is just going to be one more Republican who falls flat on his face while trying to ingratiate himself to the Trump-loathing mafia.
In an effort to divert the public's gaze from his endless sexcapades and perjuries, then-President Bill Clinton pleaded that he just wanted the investigations against him to end because he needed to get back to work for the American people. Well, how about it, Democrats and enabling Republicans? Don't you think it's about time you showed a little respect for the will of the people and allowed President Trump to devote the full measure of his time and attention to the work of the American people?

Media Ignores Valerie Plame’s Blatant Anti-Semitism When Covering Her Run For Congress | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47081/media-ignores-valerie-plames-blatant-anti-semitism-ashe-schow,"Media Ignores Valerie Plame’s Blatant Anti-Semitism When Covering Her Run For Congress Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images May 11, 2019 views
Valerie Plame, the former CIA employee who was outed during the George W. Bush administration, announced on Thursday that she is running for congress as a Democrat in New Mexico.
Left-wing media outlets all wrote pretty much the same story when covering her announcement — basically a background-filled article-length version of my previous paragraph. What each of these outlets left out, predictably, was the blatant anti-Semitism Plame has espoused in recent years.
Jim Geraghty of National Review outlined Plame’s anti-Semitism, which was ignored by the major outlets. In September 2017, Plame tweeted out a link to an article titled, “America’s Jews Are Driving America’s Wars,” which had a sub-headline that asked, “Shouldn’t they recuse themselves when dealing with the Middle East?”
After being called out for sharing the article, Plame — in a now-deleted tweet — said the article was “very provocative, but thoughtful.” She further stated: “Many neocon hawks ARE Jewish ... Read the entire article and try, just for a moment, to put aside your biases and think clearly.”
After further backlash, she claimed she had actually just “skimmed this piece, zeroed in on the neocon criticism, and shared it without seeing and considering the rest.” Geraghty goes on:
She repeated an urban legend about dancing Israelis sighted after 9/11 and an article touting “Israeli fingerprints all over the place” in the investigation of the worst terror attack in American history. She shared an article entitled “Why I Still Dislike Israel” that laments the “Israel Lobby electing and controlling a malleable congress [sic] and increasingly even officials at state and local levels.” She commented that Natalie Portman was a fine choice to play a young Ruth Bader Ginsburg because “they are both Jewish.” (By itself, that’s a harmless comment, but in the context of the other ones, Plame seems particularly focused on knowing who’s Jewish and who isn’t.)
One would think blatant bigotry against a class of people would be important when writing about said person (it certainly would be if that person were a Republican, even if the “bigotry” weren’t blatant but imagined), but one would be wrong.
As @AG_Conservative pointed out in a thread on Twitter, major left-wing outlets completely ignored this information when writing about Plame’s announcement.
The New York Times, “which has had extensive issues with excusing and promoting anti-Semitism recently,” AG wrote, focused only on Plame being outed as a CIA employee. The author of that story later took to Twitter to claim she only had 400 words to write about the announcement, which is why she left out a major issue concerning Plame.
The Daily Beast also left out the anti-Semitism, as did The Washington Post . CNN was one of the few outlets that covered the controversy, but as AG notes, the outlet washed over the whole thing.
“CNN mentioned it, but their description is misleading. They write she resigned “after apologizing for sharing on Twitter an anti-Semitic article that she said she had only ‘skimmed,’” AG wrote. “Ignoring that she had shared quite a few anti-Semitic posts.”
Indeed, this was the paragraph CNN included about Plame’s anti-Semitism:
In 2017, Plame reportedly resigned from the board of the Ploughshares Fund, an organization working to end the threat of nuclear weapons, after apologizing for sharing on Twitter an anti-Semitic article that she said she had only ""skimmed."" That Twitter account no longer appears available as of Thursday afternoon.
Don’t expect the media to change its coverage after her campaign is up and running."
WOMAN PRIVILEGE: Woman Pays Just $250 Fine For Stabbing Stranger With Stiletto. | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47087/woman-privilege-woman-pays-just-250-fine-stabbing-ashe-schow,"Ah to be one of those poor, oppressed women who have fewer privileges than men.
A woman like Jazzmin Fry, who was so oppressed that when she stabbed a complete stranger — a man — with one of her stilettos for literally no reason, she only had to pay a $250 fine as punishment. Her conviction wasn’t even recorded outside of the press.
9News in Australia reported that the assault occurred after Fry, 21, had been out drinking with friends. She was in the China Town Mall in Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley, allegedly carrying her heels, according to her victim, when she just reached out and hit him on the top of his head with one.
The victim, Kyle Johns, 19, was taken to the hospital and needed two staples in his head to repair the wound.
""[She] comes to the middle of China Town with her heels in her hand and stabs me in the crown of my head,"" Johns told 9News.
His mother, Susan Johns, received a phone call at 2:29 a.m. the Sunday morning of the attack, she told the outlet.
""This voice I didn't know said, 'Are you Kyle's mum?', and I said, 'Yes', and he said, 'We've been assaulted — Kyle is laying on the ground in a pool of his own blood,’” she told the outlet.
Fry pleaded guilty to the assault and was simply charged $250 as punishment. 9News confronted her outside the office where she worked before the assault (she had since been fired).
""It was a drunken act. It was my 21st birthday and it's not me. I don't know why I did that and I wasn't in the right mind frame,"" she told the outlet.
Her victim, Johns, and his mother responded to the news that Fry would only have to pay $250 for her unprovoked assault with anger.
""[I'm] devastated to be honest. If the roles were reversed would I be getting pretty much the same slap on the wrist?"" Johns told 9News.
Johns is absolutely correct. Women in the justice system — whether in Australia, or the U.K., or the U.S. — get off much easier than men for the same crimes. One of the biggest disparities can be found in sexual assaults against minors. When women commit these crimes — whether against a young boy or girl, or teenager — they receive much lighter sentences than men do for the same crime.
As I have written previously , men who abuse children (rightly) receive harsh punishments. A 32-year-old man who sexually abused a young girl over the course of several years faced 366 years to life in prison. Yet a 25-year-old woman who pleaded guilty to raping young boys at a trailer park only received five years probation. Yes, one example comes from a person pleading guilty and the other taking their case to trial, but five years probation for an admitted child abuser? There’s no way a man would receive the same deal.
In 2012, University of Michigan professor Sonja Starr researched the gender disparities in federal criminal cases and found that “men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do” and that “Women are … twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.”
During the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton lamented mothers who are sent to prison for their crimes.
""But women aren't the only ones affected when they are sent to prison. The high number of women in prison — and the long lengths of their sentences — destabilizes families and communities, especially their children,"" Clinton wrote in an op-ed. ""Since 1991, the number of children with a mother in prison has more than doubled. Mothers in prison are five times more likely than fathers in prison to have to put their children in foster care while they serve their sentences.""
This kind of thinking leads to stereotypes that allow women like Fry and others to receive light sentences that wouldn’t have been afforded to men in similar situations."
‘Tolkien’ Biopic Overlooks Author’s Devout Catholic Faith | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Paul Bois,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47082/tolkien-biopic-overlooks-authors-devout-catholic-paul-bois,"‘Tolkien’ Biopic Overlooks Author’s Devout Catholic Faith Axelle/Bauer-Griffin / Contributor / Getty Images May 11, 2019 views
Even though the author of one of the 20th century's most beloved pieces of literature was a devoutly Christian Catholic, whose faith animated a work that spawned a multi-billion-dollar franchise in the 21st century, the movie depicting his life seems oddly unaware of this fact.
According to Fr. Michael Ward at The Catholic Herald , the new movie ""Tolkien"" treats the renowned author's Catholic faith as if it was some afterthought, a brief passing blurb in his life that played little to no role whatsoever in the books that people would forever know as ""The Lord of the Rings"" — so much so that the movie does not even bother to mention the fact Tolkien's own mother was ostracized from her family when she became a Catholic after his father's death.
""This handsome, earnest, yet overstuffed and poorly paced film deviates frequently from the historical record,"" Fr. Ward said. ""Most seriously, it ignores Tolkien’s devout Christian faith: there is no indication that he served Mass daily as a boy or ever even entered a Catholic church. His punch-ups with Wiseman and drunken night-time profanities are, in comparison, unimportant inventions.""
""Incidents come thick and fast, but are strangely uninvolving,"" Fr. Ward continued. ""Screenwriters David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford present various possible motives for Tolkien’s behaviour, but it’s unclear what animates him, and [Nicholas] Hoult’s unconvincing, un-Edwardian performance doesn’t make good the lack.""
Steven D. Greydanus at the National Catholic Register also notes that the movie omits the fact that the Virgin Mary served as inspiration for the iconic character Galadriel:
The film is interested ... in Edith as an inspiration for the elf-princess Lúthien Tinúviel — a key shot of Edith dancing in the woods appears more than once — but of the Virgin Mary, an important inspiration for Galadriel, there is not so much as a Madonna statue or a snatch of a Hail Mary. (A glimpse of a life-size crucifix amid the dream imagery of the Somme sequences is the one visual nod to the sacred.)
Father Morgan has an intriguing line about the liturgy, deeming “modern words” useless when it comes to comforting the grieving, but neither liturgy nor prayer makes an onscreen appearance. There’s no hint of the Eucharist, the reality behind the elven “waybread” or lembas .
Religion is so unimportant that when Father Morgan objects to Tolkien’s romance with Edith in part on the grounds that “she isn’t even Catholic,” some viewers may not understand that it was Tolkien, not Edith, who was outside the religious mainstream of the day.
Pajama Media's Tyler O'Neil noted that Tolkien was deeply inspired by more than just the Western literary tradition but also the very fulcrum upon which that literary tradition rests: The bible and Jesus Christ. The movie gives this passing mention if any mention at all.
While ""Tolkien"" does not commit the same sins as other recent works that have tried to eradicate Christianity from their subjects' lives, it still stands in line with that increasingly trendy position. Oddly enough, Hollywood keeps insisting on doing this despite the fact that movies whitewashed of Christianity (such as ""A Wrinkle in Time"") bomb in the box office."

Comedian-turned-director Jordan Peele has made a lucrative career out of exploiting America's racial divide for profit with movies like ""Get Out"" and episodes of ""The Twilight Zone."" Don't expect him to highlight the fact that more black babies are aborted in New York City than allowed born or the fact that American taxpayer dollars go to an organization founded by a racist eugenicist .
According to The Hollywood Reporter , Jordan Peele and director J.J. Abrams (the man who transformed ""Star Wars"" into a feminist empowerment vehicle) both released a statement that their HBO drama ""Lovecraft County"" will not be shooting in Georgia as scheduled due to the state passing a law that bans abortions after a baby's heartbeat has been detected in the mother's womb.
""In a few weeks we start shooting our new show,'Lovecraft Country' and will do so standing shoulder to shoulder with the women of Georgia,"" the directors said in a joint statement. ""Governor Kemp's 'Fetal Heartbeat' Abortion Law is an unconstitutional effort to further restrict women and their health providers from making private medical decisions on their terms. Make no mistake, this is an attack aimed squarely and purposely at women.""
Abrams went on to say that his company Bad Robot and Peele's Monkeypaw Productions will be donating funds to combat the legislation.
""We stand with Stacey Abrams and the hardworking people of Georgia, and will donate 100 percent of our respective episodic fees for this season to two organizations leading the charge against this draconian law: the ACLU of Georgia and Fair Fight Georgia,"" he said. ""We encourage those who are able to funnel any and all resources to these organizations.""
What is most interesting about Peele and Abrams denouncing the bill as some kind of affront to women is the fact women were the bill's primary sponsors. From LifeNews :
Four of the seven major sponsors of the legislation were women including the lead sponsor in the Senate, Senator Renee Unterman. In fact Unterman called passage of the legislation in the upper chamber of the Georgia legislature the “pinnacle of her legislative career.“
Unterman told the story of having a hysterectomy when she was in her 20s.
“I adopted two children and only by the courageous abilities of those birth mothers to give up those children,” she said. “That was my journey that started me on being so pro-life.”
Unterman went on to slam the Hollywood elites who threatened to boycott the state because of the heartbeat bill.
“We’re very proud of the movie industry,” she said. “But we have our values, and we’re going to protect our values. They knew when they came here what we are and who we are.”
Jordan Peele, who recently said he would not cast a white male lead in his movies, and J.J. Abrams join alongside four production companies who announced on Thursday that they would be boycotting the state of Georgia for the same law.
Christine Vachon, CEO of Killer Films, which produced films like ""Vox Lux"" and ""First Reformed,"" announced that the company will ""no longer consider Georgia as a viable shooting location until this ridiculous law is overturned.""
David Simon, who runs Blown Deadline Productions and who created ""The Wire"" and ""The Deuce,"" said that he could not in good conscience ask any female under his employment to shoot in Georgia.
""I can’t ask any female member of any film production with which I am involved to so marginalize themselves or compromise their inalienable authority over their own bodies. I must undertake production where the rights of all citizens remain intact,"" Simon said in a tweet.
""Can only speak for my production company. Our comparative assessments of locations for upcoming development will pull Georgia off the list until we can be assured the health options and civil liberties of our female colleagues are unimpaired,"" he continued.
Simultaneously, Mark Duplass of Duplass Brothers Productions urged other companies on Thursday to blackball Georgia.
""Don’t give your business to Georgia,"" he wrote . ""Will you pledge with me not to film anything in Georgia until they reverse this backwards legislation?""
Later, CounterNarrative films, which produced the Netflix movie ""Triple Frontier,"" said that it will no longer shoot in Georgia. ""No Georgia filming on any of our projects until this law is gone,"" wrote producer Neal Dodson on Twitter."
Biden Flashback: D.C. Schools Worse Than Iowa Because Of High Black Population | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Amanda Prestigiacomo,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46989/biden-flashback-dc-schools-worse-iowa-because-high-amanda-prestigiacomo,"May 9, 2019 views
Declared 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden’s lengthy record bit him in the behind again on Thursday, as racially charged comments from Biden back in 2007 began to recirculate online.
When Biden was asked by The Washington Post about the discrepancy in school performance in Iowa compared to schools in Washington, D.C., the Democrat cited the high population of African-Americans and other minorities in the D.C. area.
""There's less than one percent of the population of Iowa that is African American. There is probably less than four of five percent that are minorities. What is in Washington? So look, it goes back to what you start off with, what you're dealing with,"" he told the paper.
At the time, the Post chalked up Biden’s comments as a ""stumble"" — leeway the mainstream press would not likely afford to anyone on the Right, certainly not in 2019.
The Democrat went on to discuss ""dysfunctional homes"" in minority communities and suggested minority mothers don’t talk to their children ""from the time they're born.""
""When you have children coming from dysfunctional homes, when you have children coming from homes where there's no books, where the mother from the time they're born doesn't talk to them — as opposed to the mother in Iowa who's sitting out there and talks to them, the kid starts out with a 300-word larger vocabulary at age three,"" Biden said. ""Half this education gap exists before the kid steps foot in the classroom.""
According to a CNN report published shortly after Biden’s comments, the Democrat’s ""campaign quickly sought to clarify the remarks, saying in a statement that the senator was not making a 'race-based distinction,' but rather a 'socio-economic' one."" reporter: why are schools in iowa are better than DC? joe biden: lol black people of course pic.twitter.com/T916JDaFJ1 — josh (@lyftrs) May 7, 2019
Similarly, a racially charged clip of Biden from 2007 discussing condom use in the black community and AIDS testing re-emerged online last week. ""On a debate stage alongside Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama, Biden bragged about spending his entire summer trying to convince black men to wear condoms, scolded 'the community' for being 'in denial' about AIDS, and praised Obama for getting an AIDS test,"" The Daily Wire previously reported .
""As Hillary points out, there’s neglect in the part of the medical and the white community focusing on educating the minority community out there. I spent last summer going through the black sections of my town holding rallies in parks trying to get black men to understand it’s not unmanly to wear a condom, getting women to understand they can say no, getting people in the position where testing matters,"" said Biden. ""I got tested for AIDS. I know Barack got tested for AIDS. There’s no shame in being tested for AIDS. It’s an important thing.""
Obama made note during the debate that he got tested for AIDS alongside his wife Michelle in an effort to raise awareness about the disease.
""The fact of the matter is, the community, the community is engaged in the community. They’re engaged in denial. No one wants to talk about it in the community,"" the former VP continued.
""And we do not have enough leaders in the community and outside the community demanding we face the reality; confront the men in the community, as well as the women, letting them know there are alternatives,"" added Biden. "
"CONFIRMED: Google Gives Left-Wing Websites Preference Over Conservative Ones, Audit Finds | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Ashe Schow,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47085/confirmed-google-gives-left-wing-websites-ashe-schow,"May 11, 2019 views
Google is one of the largest traffic drivers for news websites and, according to the Columbia Journalist Review , its influence is growing as Facebook’s traffic referrals decline.
“But for all the influence Google has in directing attention, we know painfully little about how its algorithm selects and curates news. Which sites does it direct traffic toward? And how does Google’s news curation impact the diversity of information found?” wrote researcher Nicholas Diakopoulos.
He and fellow researcher Daniel Trielli used the Computational Journalism Lab at Northwestern University to audit the search engine’s “Top Stories” to determine what websites received the most help from Google.
The team ran more than 200 search queries of various news topics in November 2017, such as “Colin Kaepernick,” “earthquake,” tax reform,” and “healthcare gov.” The researchers did everything they could to “minimize the potential for result personalization” and ran their queries each minute over a 24-hour period. The result: 6,302 unique links found in Top Stories. The researchers counted “an article impression each time one of those links appears.” (Emphasis original)
“The data shows that just 20 news sources account for more than half of article impressions. The top 20 percent of sources (136 of 678) accounted for 86 percent of article impressions. And the top three accounted for 23 percent: CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. These statistics underscore the degree of concentration of attention to a relatively narrow slice of news sources,” Diakopoulos found.
Behind the Post, which accounted for 5.6% of the impressions for the top 20 sources, was Fox News, with 3%. Fox was the only outlet on the list that could be considered right-leaning.
“Prior research has shown that search engines can affect users’ attitudes, shape opinions, alter perceptions and reinforce stereotypes, as well as affect how voters come to be informed during elections. As such, media diversity is an important aspect to the way that Google—or any news aggregator—curates sources and perspectives,” Diakopoulos wrote.
It’s difficult to consider the other outlets — especially CNN, the Times, and the Post — as anything other than left-leaning at this point, given their coverage of President Donald Trump’s administration these past two years and their hype of the Russia-collusion hoax.
The researchers then studied the ideological leanings of those who share the content from the sources in the top 20 list. As Diakopoulos wrote, this doesn’t necessarily mean the outlet itself is slanted, but reflects “the self-reported political affiliation of Facebook users sharing content from those sources.”
“Our data shows that 62.4 percent of article impressions were from sources rated by that research as left-leaning, whereas 11.3 percent were from sources rated as right-leaning. 26.3 percent of impressions were from news sources that didn’t have ratings. But even if that last set of unknown impressions happened to be right-leaning, the trend would still be clear: A higher proportion of left-leaning sources appear in Top Stories. (Again this means news sources shared on Facebook more often by people with a left-leaning political affiliation[)],” Diakopoulos wrote.
The researchers also tested the theory that perhaps left-leaning outlets produce more content. They found that was the case, but also that Google’s curation algorithm amplified that skew as well.
One side note to all of this, however, is that the curation may have more to do with the timeliness of the articles. The researchers found that 83.5% of articles in the Top Stories section on Google were less than 24 hours old and 13.1% were less than an hour old."
California Couple Must Pay $586K For Uprooting Tree On Their Property | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,James Barrett,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/46981/california-couple-must-pay-586k-uprooting-tree-james-barrett,"California Couple Must Pay $586K For Uprooting Tree On Their Property Judge slams their ""arrogance,""""complete disregard"" for easement terms. George Rose/Getty Images May 9, 2019 views
A couple from Northern California's attempt to relocate a nearly 200-year-old oak tree from one of their properties to another one has resulted in a $586,000 fine. The judge who slapped them with the fine cited the couple's ""arrogance"" and ""complete disregard"" of legally binding conservation terms in his defense of the stunningly steep punishment.
The couple owned two adjacent properties, one of which included a conservation easement upon which the 180-year-old oak tree was located. (Note: Oak tree pictured above is not the one removed.) The tree was under the protection of a conservation agreement which the judge says the couple ""knowing[ly] and intentional[ly]"" violated.
""The case against Peter and Toni Thompson reportedly started in 2014, when a concerned neighbor reported heavy equipment and digging on a property protected under a conservation easement,"" CBS San Francisco reported Wednesday. ""Court documents show a Sonoma Land Trust official found more than 3,000 cubic yards (2,300 cubic meters) of dirt and rock had been removed and a 180-year-old oak tree had been uprooted.""
The couple attempted to relocate the tree and others to another home they had built on an adjacent property. Unfortunately for the tree, and the couple, the attempt to keep it alive in the relocation process failed. Not only did the tree die, a dozen or so others and vegetation along the path they bulldozed died as well. ABC News reports:
The heritage oak was uprooted and bound so that it could be dragged to an adjoining ranch where property owners Peter and Toni Thompson had built a new estate home. That heritage oak and two others the landowners sought to move over a haul road they bulldozed through the previously undisturbed site all died, along with a dozen more trees and other vegetation, according to court records.
According to the Sonoma Land Trust, the couple also dumped soil onto the protected land from a lake they dredged on their adjacent property.
In response, the Sonoma Land Trust sued the couple for violating their conservation contract, and a superior court judge agreed, condemning the Thompsons for their ""arrogance"" and ""complete disregard"" for the easement terms.
Sonoma County Superior Court Judge Patrick Broderick agreed with the trust that the Thompsons committed ""knowing and intentional"" violations of their conservation deal, ABC notes. Broderick also made a point of blasting the couple for having ""demonstrated an arrogance and complete disregard for the mandatory terms of the easement.""
The $586,000 fine is intended to go to restoring the damaged property — though obviously sans the irreplaceable 180-year-old oak.
After the judge issued the ruling, the couple decided to go ahead and sell their estate for $8.45 million, CBS reports.
The couple is currently seeking a retrial because they say their attorney could not properly represent them as a result of a family matter that arose amid the trial.
""There are so many personal tragic issues throughout this case that were very painful to deal with and actually really affected the ability to tell our side of the story,"" Peter Thompson said in a statement reported by ABC. ""In our opinion, there's a lot of evidence that our side of the story really didn't get a chance to explain."" "
PRAGER: Why The Left Mocks The Bible | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Dennis Prager,05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47089/prager-why-left-mocks-bible-dennis-prager,"PRAGER: Why The Left Mocks The Bible krisanapong detraphiphat via Getty Images May 12, 2019 views
At PragerU, we have released about 400 videos on virtually every subject outside of the natural sciences and math. Along with 2 billion views, the videos have garnered tens of thousands of comments. So we have a pretty good handle on what people most love and most hate. For example, any video defending America or Israel inevitably receives many negative responses. But no videos elicit the amount of contempt and mockery that videos defending religion, explaining the Bible or arguing for God do.
Why is that?
There is a good reason. The Bible and the left (not liberalism, leftism) are as opposed as any two worldviews can be. While there are people who claim to hold both a Bible-based worldview and left-wing views, these people are few in number. Moreover, what they do is take left-wing positions and wrap them in a few Bible verses. But on virtually every important value in life, the left and the Bible are diametrically opposed.
Here are a few examples:
The biblical view is that people are not basically good. Evil therefore comes from within human nature. For the left, human nature is not the source of evil. Capitalism, patriarchy, poverty, religion, nationalism or some other external cause is the source of evil.
The biblical view is that nature was created for man. The left-wing view is that man is just another part of nature.
The biblical view is that man is created in the image of God and, therefore, formed with a transcendent, immaterial soul. The left-wing view — indeed, the view of all secular ideologies — is that man is purely material, another assemblage of stellar dust.
The biblical view is that the human being has free will. The left-wing view — again, the view of all secular outlooks — is that human beings have no free will. Everything we do is determined by environment, genes and the matter of which we are composed. Firing neurons, not free will, explain both murders and kindness.
The biblical view is that while reason alone can lead a person to conclude murder is wrong, murder is ultimately and objectively wrong only because there is a transcendent source of right and wrong — God — who deems murder evil.
The biblical view is that God made order out of chaos. Order is defined by distinctions. One such example is male and female — the only inherent human distinction that matters to God. There are no racial or ethnic distinctions in God's order; there is only the human sex distinction. The left loathes this concept of a divine order. That is the primary driver of its current attempt to obliterate the male-female distinction.
The biblical view is that the nuclear family is the basic unit of society — a married father and mother and their children. This is the biblical ideal. All good people of faith recognize that the reality of this world is such that many people do not or cannot live that ideal. And such people often merit our support. But that does not change the fact that the nuclear family is the one best-suited to create thriving individuals and a healthy society, and we who take the Bible seriously must continue to advocate the ideal family structure as the Bible defines it. And for that, perhaps more than anything, we are mocked.
The biblical view holds that wisdom begins with acknowledging God. The secular view is that is that God is unnecessary for wisdom, and the left-wing view is that God is destructive to wisdom. But if you want to know which view is more accurate, look at the most godless and Bible-less institution in our society: the universities. They are, without competition, the most foolish institutions in our society.
For nearly all of American history, the Bible was the most important book in America. It is no longer. This is a moral and intellectual catastrophe. If you want to understand why, consider reading ""The Rational Bible,"" my commentary on the first five books of the Bible. The second volume of ""The Rational Bible,"" ""Genesis,"" is published today.

"Gunmen Kill Six, Burn Church During Sunday Mass In Terror Attack In Burkina Faso | Daily Wire",www.dailywire.com,Emily Zanotti,05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.dailywire.com/news/47090/gunmen-kill-six-burn-church-during-sunday-mass-emily-zanotti,"Gunmen Kill Six, Burn Church During Sunday Mass In Terror Attack In Burkina Faso OLYMPIA DE MAISMONT/AFP/Getty Images May 12, 2019 views
Several gunman burst into a Catholic Church Sunday morning in north-central Burkina Faso, killing six, including the church's priest as he celebrated Mass.
The gunman then burned the church, the BBC reports , as well as nearby shops and stands, and a government health office.
""The attackers opened fire on the faithful at the beginning of Mass in the village of Dablo, 90 km from Kaya,"" France24 radio reported early Sunday morning , adding that the group of gunman may have included as many as ""twenty to thirty men.""
""Towards 9:00am, during mass, armed individuals burst into the Catholic Church,"" the mayor of Dablo, Ousmane Zongo, told international press in a statement. ""They started firing as the congregation tried to flee.""
""They burned down the church, then shops and a small restaurant before going to the health centre where they searched the premises and set fire to the head nurse's vehicle,"" Zongo added. ""The city is filled with panic. People are holed up at home. Shops and stores are closed. It's practically a ghost town.""
The BBC reports that this is the fourth such attack on a Christian church in Burkina Faso in less than a month, and France 24 adds that terror attacks within the African nation have been on a dramatic rise in 2019, due in part to the growing influence of radical Islam, including ""jihadist groups such as Ansarul Islam, the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM) and the Islamic State in the Great Sahara (EIGS).""
Sunday morning's attack is also the second such attack on a Catholic church in less than two weeks.
The terror groups have been operating within the country since around 2015, but the deadly violence began to spike recently, leaving dozens dead in a series of attacks within the country, many on Christians.
Just days ago , four hostages, including an American, a Korean, and two tourists from France, were rescued in a harrowing mission that cost two French soldiers their lives. The foreigners, who were kidnapped while on a trip through a nature preserve on the border between Burkina Faso and Mali, were held for nearly a month before they were rescued.
French special forces staged the daring rescue last week, heading off the kidnappers and their hostages as they made the journey north into Mali, presumably so that the kidnappers could turn over the foreigners to more powerful jihadi groups.
""French special forces soldiers Cédric de Pierrepont and Alain Bertoncello died during the raid,"" the BBC reported, as did a local driver. The hostages are now safe and are making their way to France.
Reuters reports that Burkina Faso was, at one time, well known for being a bastion of religious tolerance in Africa, but that that hs made it a prime target of jihadists who are looking to destabilize functioning governments on the continent, specifically ""Burkina and the wider Sahel region.""
The United States announced earlier in May that it would double down on efforts to support the government of Burkina Faso, and would provide Burkina Faso's military with guidance on how to better train and manage troops and increase security around key targets."
