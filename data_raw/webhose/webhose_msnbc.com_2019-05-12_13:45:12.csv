Did Mulvaney warn the DHS chief not to bring up election interference? | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/did-mulvaney-warn-the-dhs-chief-not-bring-election-interference,"By Steve Benen As important and consequential as Russia’s attack on our elections was in 2016, there’s no reason to examine the interference in a solely retrospective way. On the contrary, there’s every reason to believe officials in Moscow, pleased with the success of their previous efforts, will try again in 2020.
With this in mind, Kirstjen Nielsen, before ending her tenure as Homeland Security secretary, reportedly tried to organize a meeting of relevant cabinet secretaries to prepare a coordinated strategy in preparation for the next election cycle.
Her efforts would’ve benefited from some presidential leadership, which she never received. In fact, according to a New York Times report , acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Nielsen not to even broach the subject of foreign interference in our elections around Donald Trump, apparently because it makes the president feel bad.
Ms. Nielsen left the Department of Homeland Security early this month after a tumultuous 16-month tenure and tensions with the White House. Officials said she had become increasingly concerned about Russia’s continued activity in the United States during and after the 2018 midterm elections – ranging from its search for new techniques to divide Americans using social media, to experiments by hackers, to rerouting internet traffic and infiltrating power grids.
But in a meeting this year, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, made it clear that Mr. Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Mulvaney said it “wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below his level.”
It’s easy for many observers outside the White House to get the impression that the delicate president has a fragile ego, but this report suggests the problem might be even more severe than we’ve been led to believe.
U.S. intelligence officials believe a foreign adversary may target our elections next year, but no one should bring this up in the president’s presence, because he prefers not to be reminded of the dubious legitimacy of his own election.
The principal goal, in other words, isn’t to protect the American system of elections from a foreign attack, but rather, it’s to protect the American president’s feelings.
Making matters worse, this is not just a story about White House passivity and negligence in the face of a looming threat. On the contrary, regular readers may recall , Trump has taken some steps that might even make the problem worse.
It was, after all, just last year when the White House eliminated the job of the nation’s cyber-security czar, as part of John Bolton’s reorganization of the National Security Council.
The New York Times reported at the time, “Cyber-security experts and members of Congress said they were mystified by the move…. It was the latest in a series of steps that appeared to run counter to the prevailing view in Washington of cybersecurity’s importance.”
A year later, it’s no easier to defend the move.

Trump thinks the Supreme Court can save him from impeachment (it can't) | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-thinks-the-supreme-court-can-save-him-impeachment-it-cant,"US Judge Brett Kavanaugh speaks after being nominated by US President Donald Trump (L) to the Supreme Court in the East Room of the White House on July 9,... SAUL LOEB Trump thinks the Supreme Court can save him from impeachment (it can’t) 04/24/19 12:45 PM By Steve Benen
Now that he’s placed two far-right jurists on the Supreme Court, Donald Trump seems convinced that the nation’s highest bench will effectively serve as a rubber stamp, clearing the way for everything he wants.
The White House agenda on DACA ? The president expects the Supreme Court to rule his way. Birthright citizenship ? The president expects the Supreme Court to rule his way. Redirecting funds through an emergency declaration ? The president expects the Supreme Court to rule his way. Tearing down his own country’s health care system ? The president expects the Supreme Court to rule his way.
Two senior administration officials told NBC News in November that “with Justice Brett Kavanaugh now on the Supreme Court,” the White House “ expects to win .”
With this mind, consider Trump’s latest mini-tantrum on Twitter.
“The Mueller Report, despite being written by Angry Democrats and Trump Haters, and with unlimited money behind it ($35,000,000), didn’t lay a glove on me. I DID NOTHING WRONG. If the partisan Dems ever tried to Impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Not only are there no ‘High Crimes and Misdemeanors,’ there are no Crimes by me at all. All of the Crimes were committed by Crooked Hillary, the Dems, the DNC and Dirty Cops - and we caught them in the act! We waited for Mueller and WON, so now the Dems look to Congress as last hope!”
Much of this is gibberish, including the assertions that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings uncovered no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Reality tells a different story , especially as it relates to obstruction of justice.
It’s also bizarre that the erratic president believes his opponents have been “caught in the act” of committing crimes – misdeeds that exist only in Trump’s mind.
But what may matter most is Trump’s intention to “head to the U.S. Supreme Court” if congressional Dems launch an impeachment effort.
We’re occasionally reminded of just how little our amateur president understands about the basics of American governance and civics. We’re also reminded that Trump doesn’t feel the need to ask anyone for clarifications about how the system works, since his misplaced confidence overshadows his ignorance.
But as someone really ought to let the president know, Congress is responsible for initiating, overseeing, and executing the impeachment process. Lawmakers, and no one else, determine whether a president has committed impeachable acts.
Trump could “head to the U.S. Supreme Court,” but there’s literally nothing justices could do for him, even if they wanted to. The judiciary has no authority to help or hinder the impeachment proceedings.
The president doesn’t know that, and while that’s embarrassing, he nevertheless seems eager to let everyone know just how confused he is.
In the process, Trump is also offering a peek into his perspective on problem-solving. When he finds himself in a jam, the president seems to instinctively look for a fixer: Trump has spent his tenure assuming that everyone from his attorney general to his congressional allies to his White House counsel can simply make his problems go away for him.
As of this morning, the president seems to think the Supreme Court can even rescue him from the threat of impeachment.
It cannot."

An excerpt from 'Our Lost Declaration' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,msnbc.com,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/excerpt-our-lost-declaration,"By Morning Joe staff Since the days when early humans first organized themselves into groups for mutual protection and assistance, human societies have imposed rules intended to keep order. As societies evolved, those rules were written down and became systems of laws. A society’s values are reflected in the system of laws it adopts to protect the rights of its people, and especially how much value that society places on each individual human soul. Sometimes these values are defined in the affirmative—when a society shows what it believes. Our American society does this in the Declaration of Independence. The Continental Congress, which approved this document, was issuing the manifesto of a new society free of British rule, one founded on a revolutionary combination of ideas.
The document leads off by explaining the truths the Congress’s members held to be self-evident: that people have certain rights; that government’s job is to protect these rights and remain answerable to the people in doing so; and that if government fails at this job the people can adjust it as they see fit. These simple statements in the Declaration’s preamble contain thousands of years of human wisdom, distilled and interpreted in the mind of an authentic American genius.
Sometimes, however, just as much can be learned about a society by the values they define in the negative—that is, when they explain what they are definitively against.
The Declaration does this, too, in the litany of grievances against King George III. This is why that section of the Declaration deserves consideration on its own, despite not being as rhetorically memorable as the passages that open and close the document. This is one of the imbalances that I have tried to correct in this book.
Most—but I fear increasingly few—Americans can recite the part of the Declaration that shows what America stands for, but fewer are familiar with the Founders’ explanation, in the same document, of what America stands against. American society remains committed to the principles of equality and liberty outlined in the Declaration’s first lines. But the grievances listed later should remind us of what we fought against, and what we must not allow ourselves to become.
As we near the first-quarter mark of the twenty-first century, the steady growth of the administrative state under presidents of both political parties has made the central government based in Washington an all- too- common intruder into the lives of most Americans. In many ways, these lessons of the eighteenth century have never been more relevant.
We must remember that the Declaration of Independence is not just a manifesto for natural human rights, but it is a manifesto against a strong central government that would infringe upon those rights. It is against “swarms of officers” that “harass” the people. It is against the unchecked growth of executive power. It is against an administrative state.
The tragedy of American legislative bodies (federal and state) in the twentieth and into the twenty-first century is one of slow and steady unilateral disarmament. Bit by bit, state legislatures have become more comfortable giving up more and more of their power to the federal government. Likewise, the Congress in Washington has turned over much of its power to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats housed within the executive branch. In many areas where Congress once reigned supreme, it has now been reduced to a token “oversight” role at best.
The steady usurpation of legislative authority by the executive branch, and of state authority by federal authority, is a creeping phenomenon that is in some ways nearly as menacing to American liberty as a royal colonial governor who woke up on the wrong side of his feather bed. And the greatest indignity is that this is a problem largely of our own making. Over the last eight decades, the people’s elected representatives have made countless choices that have steadily diminished their own power, and with it that of the people they represent. In many respects, they have done so for a simple, understandable, but indefensible reason: Delegating to others the difficult and contentious task of making law has a tendency to make reelection easier.
What is needed is an innovative, perhaps even a radical reimagining of the relationship between Congress and the executive branch, and between state governments and the federal government. This would be a system in which Congress actually exercises the power and authority it is supposed to, rather than delegating that power to a vast web of government agencies. In such a system, any powers not delegated to the federal government to the Constitution would actually be reserved for the state governments or the people, as the Tenth Amendment promises.
Although it might seem radical to us to put more power back in the hands of legislatures, that’s only because we’ve had blinders on for too long. The Founders’ original vision, forged in part by watching their elected legislatures in the colonies get trampled on and dissolved at will by the King’s appointed governors, was one that vested as much power as possible in the place where it was closest to the people— the chamber of their elected representatives. And in a republic like ours, isn’t that where most of the power should belong?
No other conclusion can be drawn from the colonists’ response to the heavy- handed actions of King George III’s government. The seeds of revolution were planted when that government, whose ruler combined a devoted British patriotism with a German absolutist idea of monarchy, decided to squeeze its American colonies tighter and tighter.
Those seeds took root when His Majesty’s royal governors shut down the colonial legislatures where the people had their only say in government. They grew whenever a citizen was dragged before one of His Majesty’s courts without benefit of a jury of his peers—a right any British subject should have enjoyed— or when the courts were shut down altogether due to conflicts with the King’s law. They flourished despite the pressure of unfair trade restrictions, attempts to control the free market for products like tea. And finally they bore the fruit of revolution.
Of course, it took the work of several skilled hands to bring that fruit to bear. Thomas Paine’s rhetoric lit the fire that would fuel the engines of independence. Edmund Randolph defied his loyalist father and fought with George Washington, then joined his fellow Virginians to lead the charge for breaking all ties with Britain. John Adams used his legal skill to remind the royal courts what justice really meant, and later added his expertise to the drafting of the Declaration. Benjamin Franklin, despite being stricken with gout, helped with the editing—and used his trademark wit to console the main author as the full Congress argued over the draft. It was Thomas Jefferson, of course, whom Franklin consoled— the man who staved off his headaches long enough to focus on the important task at hand, and shake loose from the shelves of his meticulously organized mental library the ancient and modern ideas he would use to explain the Americans’ unprecedented act to an astounded world.
These men were not perfect, and neither was the system they created. They were keenly aware that as they signed their names to a statement that “all men are created equal,” this was far from the reality for many of their fellow men and women. And for many Americans, it took far too long for this reality to come to pass. Millions of African Americans lived, worked, and died never knowing freedom simply because of the color of their skin, and their descendants in large swaths of the country were forced into second-c lass citizenry until the latter half of the twentieth century. Millions of Americans were not able to exercise that most precious of the rights of citizenship— the vote—until that same century due to their race or gender. There were the Mormons who were forced out of their communities by government forces because of their religion, and the Japanese Americans who spent years behind barbed wire on American soil because they happened to look like the enemy (even as their sons fought under the Stars and Stripes).
For many in marginalized communities in America to this day, the fight for real equality goes on. But what makes that fight so righteous is that we still look to the words of the Declaration for inspiration. When Jefferson and his colleagues signed their names to that document, they were making a bet on an idea. It’s a bet that every succeeding generation of Americans has done its best to make good on.
Sometimes making good on it means expending blood and treasure. In the midst of the greatest struggle we have yet faced to preserve our founding ideals, one of America’s greatest leaders turned to the Declaration of Independence for strength. Abraham Lincoln, despite his deep knowledge of and respect for the law rooted in the Constitution, viewed the Declaration as a perfect expression of our founding principles.
He felt there was no firmer bedrock on which our nation could stand than the simple truth that “all men are created equal.” Indeed, Lincoln observed that he “never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.” 1
In 1854, during his famous series of debates with Stephen Douglas, Lincoln called that concept “the leading principle, the sheet anchor of American republicanism.” And he used it to attack the institution of slavery, arguing that if slaves were indeed human, they too had the right to govern themselves according to the Declaration. “If the negro is a man,” said Lincoln, “why then my ancient faith teaches me that ‘all men are created equal’; and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man’s making a slave of another.” That, according to Lincoln, was “despotism”— the very charge Jefferson leveled at King George. 2
Four years later, he told an audience in Chicago that what binds us all together as Americans, whether our families had been here since the founding or came in the latest wave of immigration, was that we could all rally behind the “father of all moral principle”—that doctrine of equality expressed in the Declaration. “That is the electric cord in that Declaration,” he said, “that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty- loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.” 3 It is recorded that applause erupted after this line—and it is easy to see why.
In February 1861, as he prepared to take over the presidency of a country inching toward war over the question of slavery, Lincoln spent George Washington’s birthday in Philadelphia. In a short impromptu speech on the steps of Independence Hall, Lincoln considered the question of what had kept the country united in the decades since its founding.
He concluded that the great unifying force was “that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time.” 4
And in November 1863, as the war to make all Americans free raged around him, Lincoln addressed those gathered to dedicate a cemetery at the site of the recent Battle of Gettysburg. “Four score and seven years ago,” he told those assembled, “our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” There was his “ancient faith” again. But now he cast the current struggle in no uncertain terms as an effort to reclaim our founding principles. “Now we are engaged in a great civil war,” he said, “testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure.” It was a test that, by God’s grace, we passed.
Just as our nation has not always expressed perfectly that ideal of liberty among our fellow men, Lincoln’s additional hope that this liberty be expanded across the entire world has sadly remained unfulfilled. But Lincoln understood then what we must understand now— that the Declaration of Independence must be a guiding light, always moving ahead of us, urging us onward, urging us to ever more perfectly follow the principles it sets out.
A century after Lincoln spoke those immortal words at Gettysburg, someone else stood in front of a colossal marble statue of Lincoln and made a proclamation that was no less immortal. “Even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow,” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. assured the throngs stretched out before him, “I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.” And then he told us what the American dream meant to him. “I have a dream,” he said, “that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal.’ ” The crowd cheered. Dr. King recognized our nation’s creed in Jefferson’s words, and he was urging us to better live up to it.
This is our task as Americans today, and it will be the task for every future generation. Armed with a greater understanding of the Declaration’s principles and how it came to be, we will surely be able to fulfill it.

White House chief of staff tries to clarify Trump's illegal directives | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/white-house-chief-staff-tries-clarify-trumps-illegal-directives,"By Steve Benen When Kirstjen Nielsen was forced from her post as Homeland Security secretary, it quickly became obvious that one of the sources of tension between her and Donald Trump was her reluctance to ignore federal laws . The president reportedly urged her, repeatedly, to implement immigration policies that were “ clearly illegal ,” and when Nielsen balked, Trump grew “infuriated.”
It brought to mind recent remarks from former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who told an audience about the kind of instructions he’d receive from Trump. “So often, the president would say, ‘Here’s what I want to do and here’s how I want to do it,’” Tillerson explained . “And I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law.’”
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, of course, is also filled with examples of Trump directing people to take legally dubious actions.
But White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney sat down with The Atlantic recently, and he suggested there’s been some confusion about the president’s instructions.
Often, Mulvaney said, the president is not telling aides “to do something illegal”; he’s “just giving me ideas on what his priorities are and what he wants to accomplish.”
Oddly enough, this sounds a bit like what Tillerson said, only in a way intended to sound more flattering to the president.
Let’s say, for example, Trump speaks with Department of Homeland Security officials and tells them to start ignoring existing federal asylum laws – something the president has been accused of doing. In Mulvaney’s model, Trump hasn’t told officials “to do something illegal”; he’s simply sharing some ideas about the kind of border policies, some of which may be illegal, he’d like to see implemented.
Or put another way, the president doesn’t give directives, encouraging people who work for him to commit crimes, so much as he tells them about his priorities without any real regard for whether his goals are legal or not.
How … reassuring ?
Garance Franke-Ruta recently published a Twitter thread , highlighting “all the different ways Trump has asked people who work for him or the government to break laws.” Alas, it was not short.
Mick Mulvaney’s apparent defense of this dynamic is that Trump has actually just asked people who work for him to pursue his vision without regard for legal boundaries. The president wants what he wants, and he neither knows nor cares what’s permissible under the law.

Economy shows surprising resilience in early months of 2019 | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/economy-shows-surprising-resilience-early-months-2019,"By Steve Benen Economic growth in the latter half of 2018 gradually slid in the wrong direction, prompting fears of a possible economic downturn. Those concerns are a lot quieter this morning .
Reports of the demise of the U.S. economy proved unfounded as first quarter activity showed surprising strength. The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.2% annual pace in the first three months of 2019, the government said Friday.
The gain was well above forecasts. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 2.3% increase in gross domestic product…. One unexpected factor behind the acceleration in GDP growth in the first quarter was a sharp upturn in state and local government spending.
The full report from the Commerce Department is online here .
If recent history is any guide, Donald Trump and the White House will, any minute now, claim that GDP growth of 3.2% is even better than the 3% rate the Republican says was his goal, so it’s worth remembering that this morning’s report refers to quarterly growth – January through March – not annual growth. (Also, the president promised annual growth between 4% and 6% . Why he set expectations unreasonably high is still a mystery.)
What’s more, this new figure will be revised in the coming months.
Regardless, there’s no denying that 3.2% growth is the latest evidence of a healthy economy, and should bury talk of a looming recession, at least for a while.
As for the image above, the chart shows GDP numbers by quarter since the Great Recession began. The red columns show the economy under the Bush and Trump administrations; the blue columns show the economy under the Obama administration.

insists there was 'an attempted overthrow' of US government | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-insists-there-was-attempted-overthrow-us-government,"By Steve Benen On five occasions this month, Donald Trump has promoted Twitter content from others claiming there was an attempted “coup” against his administration. Last night on Fox News, the president lent his voice to the same hysterical talking point.
While discussing the origins of the Mueller probe – which he and fellow Republicans have demanded an investigation into – with his best friend and Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump called the investigation a “coup” and the “greatest political scandal” in history, even greater than Watergate.
Looking over the transcript, the president was not subtle on this point. It seemed as if Trump called into Sean Hannity’s show specifically to push this line.
“Really, it’s a coup,” Trump said. “It’s spying. It’s everything that you can imagine. It’s hard to believe in this country that we would have had that…. I really say, now we have to get down because this was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government.”
He added, “This was a coup. This wasn’t stealing information from an office in the Watergate apartments. This was an attempted coup. And it’s like a third world country – and inconceivable.”
I can appreciate the fact that we’ve all grown quite inured to Donald Trump appearing on Fox News and saying strange things. It’s an understandable reaction.
But it’s worth pausing to appreciate just how extraordinary the circumstances are. For the first time in our history, the sitting American president has told the world that there was “an attempted overthrow of the United States government” – a declaration that has been greeted with widespread shrugs, as if it were a routine Thursday night.
Because, by and large, it was. This is our life now.
In reality, I suspect most sensible observers realize there was no actual “coup” attempt. No one tried to “overthrow” anything. Donald Trump may make wild-eyed, hysterical accusations like these, targeting his political opponents, but his claims are broadly overlooked because the public realizes the president occasionally peddles nonsense that shouldn’t be taken too seriously.
That, in and of itself, is unsettling. In recent generations, the world has looked at the United States as the home of the strongest and most stable political system anywhere. The idea of a “coup” or an “attempted overthrow” is the stuff of fanciful fiction.
Except, that is, in 2019, when everyone can hear the American president share his paranoid fantasies aired live on national television.
It was especially striking to hear Trump tell Hannity, “[I]t’s like a third-world country.” That’s true, though not in the way the president probably intended.
When a leader of dubious legitimacy makes up claims of attempted coups, that is, in fact, “like a third-world country.” As of last night, it also happens to be our country.

Why Trump's new rejection to the Arms Trade Treaty matters | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-trumps-new-rejection-the-arms-trade-treaty-matters,"By Steve Benen Six years ago, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the Arms Trade Treaty on a vote of 154 to 3. While there were some abstentions, the only nations opposed to the ATT were Iran, North Korea, and Syria . The United States voted with the majority, and several months later, then-Secretary of State John Kerry officially endorsed the treaty, beginning the ratification process.
That process, at least in this country, is now dead. Donald Trump made some news at the NRA convention today, announcing the end of the United States’ support for the ATT. The Washington Post reported :
President Trump announced Friday that he would un-sign the global arms pact known as the Arms Trade Treaty in the latest illustration of his aversion to international pacts and world governance.
“We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom,” Trump said during a speech before the National Rifle Association in Indianapolis. “I’m officially announcing today that the United States will be revoking the effect of America’s signature from this badly misguided treaty.”
Specifically, the president added that he intends to formally ask the Senate to end the ratification process, so that he can “dispose of” the treaty (which, evidently, the Senate will have already done).
When the assembled crowd applauded this afternoon, Trump said, “I’m impressed. I didn’t know too many of you would know what it is.”
That’s probably because he didn’t know what it was. In fact, given his rhetoric today, Trump still doesn’t know much about the treaty he’s eager to “dispose of,” or why he’s aligning the United States with Iran, North Korea, and Syria.
The Arms Trade Treaty would not affect Americans Second Amendment rights at all. If ratified, the measure would have literally no bearing on existing U.S. gun laws, and it would place no new limits on consumer access to firearms or individual ownership of guns. Period. Full stop.
Rather, the point of the treaty, since the beginning, has been to set controls on the international gun trade based on whether the weapons would be “used to break humanitarian law, foment genocide or war crimes, abet terrorism or organized crime or slaughter women and children.”
As John Kerry explained after helping negotiate it, “It will help reduce the risk that international transfers of conventional arms will be used to carry out the world’s worst crimes, including terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.”
And yet, as longtime readers may recall, Republicans have ignored the unambiguous text of the treaty and come up with some bizarre justifications to opposes it. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), for example, insisted that abiding by the treaty would lead to an international registry of American gun owners and “full-scale gun confiscation.”
Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) added in 2013 that the treaty was part of an effort to “sign away our laws to the global community and unelected U.N. bureaucrats.”
It’s never been altogether clear whether Republicans actually believed their talking points, but either way, all of this, like Trump’s rhetoric today, was and is demonstrably ridiculous.
It’s also the position has prevailed, at least in this country.

Trump's newest skill: he thinks he's 'the greatest hostage negotiator' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-27-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-newest-skill-he-thinks-hes-the-greatest-hostage-negotiator,"Trump’s newest skill: he thinks he’s ‘the greatest hostage negotiator’ 04/26/19 04:34 PM By Steve Benen One of the oddities of Donald Trump’s personality is that he’s convinced himself he’s an expert in practically every subject. For example, the president recently assured the public, “I’m a professional at technology.” What kind of technology? He didn’t say, but we can probably assume he meant every possible kind .
That, of course, is just the starting point. Trump has also claimed to be the world’s foremost authority on everything from terrorism to campaign finance, the judicial system to infrastructure, trade to renewable energy. NowThis recently prepared a video montage on the subject, and it was amazing to see the many subjects on which the president considers himself a world-class expert.
This morning, our polymathic president let us know about yet another area of his alleged expertise.
“ ‘President Donald J. Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States. 20 hostages, many in impossible circumstances, have been released in last two years. No money was paid.’ Cheif [sic] Hostage Negotiator, USA!”
Sure, you and I might think that to have great skills as a hostage negotiator, one would probably need some kind of training, but not our president. He talked to the nation’s “chief” hostage negotiator, who’s certain that Trump is “the greatest hostage negotiator,” not only alive today, but who’s ever lived “in the history of the United States.”
So, what’s this all about?
The White House told reporters this morning that the president was referring to Robert C. O’Brien, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department, who offered some effusive praise for Trump last month, though he’s never publicly said what the president Quote: : d him saying.
The Washington Post added :
[D]id O’Brien really say what Trump attributed to him? Did he really call Trump the greatest hostage negotiator in U.S. history? Or did he simply refer to the broader concept of “unparalleled success,” which is more about results rather than acumen?
The State Department hasn’t responded to inquiries, but there is plenty of reason to believe Trump has hyperbolized O’Brien’s praise.
Ya think?
Look, Trump has made clear that he doesn’t really understand how quotation marks work, and he’s also shared the details of conversations that have happened only in his imagination . On other occasions, the president has taken parts of a Quote: : , removed parts he doesn’t like, added words that make him feel better about himself, and then shared those Quote: : s with the public as if they were real .
With all of this in mind, I’d recommend some skepticism before accepting as fact the idea that Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator who’s ever lived.
Postscript ; In case it’s not obvious, this issue has come to the fore in light of reports that North Korea billed the United States $2 million for Otto Warmbier’s hospital care. The main U.S. envoy sent to retrieve Warmbier, shortly before his death, reportedly accepted the bill and agreed to its terms before the student’s release in 2017, but the president insisted twice today that the bill was never paid.

Obama offers Trump some good advice: 'Stop whining' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-offers-trump-some-good-advice-stop-whining,"US President Barack Obama speaks at a Hillary for America campaign event, Oct. 14, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. Photo by Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Obama offers Trump some good advice: ‘Stop whining’ 10/18/16 02:27 PM  Updated 10/18/16 02:45 PM By Steve Benen For a guy who enjoys boasting about his “strength” and “toughness,” Donald Trump has a bad habit of whining. When the Republican presidential nominee isn’t complaining about the nefarious forces he perceives as his enemies (journalists, GOP leaders, microphones, Democrats, members of the “global power structure,” et al), Trump is expressing his dissatisfaction with those he sees as uncooperative (pollsters, the Commission on Presidential Debates, Emmy voters, et al).
Reactions to this tend to be a matter of personal taste: Trump’s followers seem to relate to his near-constant complaining, while Trump’s critics are less impressed. But when the Republican candidate started insisting that the American elections process is “ rigged ” against him, the complaints raised a different kind of alarm: Trump’s misguided rhetoric is arguably dangerous if it baselessly undermines public confidence in the American democratic system.
To their credit, some notable Republican officials, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have pushed back, saying publicly that there’s simply no reason to question the integrity of the U.S. voting process. Today, President Obama weighed in on the same subject – in a rather direct way . President Barack Obama on Tuesday downplayed Donald Trump’s suggestion that November’s election is “rigged,” and said the GOP presidential nominee needs to toughen up.
“I’d advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and try to go make his case to get votes,” Obama said at a White House news conference alongside Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
“If whenever things are going badly for you, you start blaming somebody else, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job,” Obama continued. “There are a lot of time things don’t go our way or my way … that’s OK, you fight through it.” At the same press conference, the president added, “I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It’s unprecedented,”
That happens to be true. As we discussed yesterday, there’s simply no precedent for anything like this in the American tradition. Voters have never seen a major-party presidential nominee go to such lengths to undermine confidence in their own country’s voting system – without any proof whatsoever – intentionally trying to delegitimize an election before it occurs.
But also note how Obama lowered the boom: “It doesn’t really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you’d want out of a president.”
The point isn’t exactly subtle. The president could explain how and why Trump is wrong, but Obama chose to go one step further, noting that anyone who whines like this simply isn’t prepared for the task at hand.
The New Republic ’s Brian Beutler noted in response, “[A]s the current president, and the most popular and trusted politician in the country, Obama’s scolding and taunting serves both to restore as much faith as possible in the system and to make Trump look petty and weak. This will resonate widely both because it’s so evidently true and because it’s likely to set Trump off on a new round of anti-Obama conniptions.”
Ideally, none of this would be necessary, but since Americans find themselves in less-than-ideal circumstances, it’s good to see the president defend democratic institutions that are facing nonsensical attacks.

"Asked about evidence of obstruction, Graham says, 'I don't care' | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/asked-about-evidence-obstruction-graham-says-i-dont-care,"Republican presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) speaks during the Sunshine Summit conference being held at the Rosen Shingle Creek on Nov. 13, 2015 in Orlando, Fla. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Asked about evidence of obstruction, Graham says, ‘I don’t care’ 04/29/19 09:20 AM  Updated 04/29/19 01:57 PM By Steve Benen When Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), he helped lead the impeachment effort against then-President Bill Clinton. In the process, the Republican lawmaker established a series of principles he said he believed in, setting benchmarks for lines a president cannot and should not cross.
The trouble, of course, is that Graham has appeared eager of late to ignore those same principles now that there’s a member of his own party in the Oval Office.
On “Face the Nation” yesterday, CBS News’ Margaret Brennan presented the senator with some of his previous statements, leading Graham to try and draw a distinction between Clinton and Donald Trump: “What President Clinton did was interfere in a lawsuit against him by Paula Jones and others; hide the evidence; encourage people to lie. So to me he took the legal system and turned it upside down.”
Of course, this wasn’t exactly helpful to Trump or those eager to carry his water. To read the Mueller report is to know that the current president also took a wide variety of steps to interfere with a federal investigation, including lying and encouraging others to lie.
And yet, Graham quite literally said he doesn’t care .
“I think it’s just all theater. It doesn’t matter. I don’t care what he said to [former White House counsel] Don McGahn. It’s what he did…. I don’t care what they talked about. He didn’t do anything…. I don’t care what happened between him and Don McGahn.”
Despite the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Graham, added that he considers obstruction allegations against the president to be “ absurd .”
Or put another way, as of yesterday morning, if a Democratic president interferes in a lawsuit and encourages people to lie, that’s an impeachable offense. If a Republican president interferes in a federal investigation and encourages people to lie, that’s trivia – according to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It’s an amazing perspective. Graham didn’t say this explicitly, but the unmistakable takeaway is that he believes Trump attempted to obstruct justice, but he failed to actually do so. The president told the White House counsel to fire the special counsel and lie about it, but since Don McGahn didn’t execute Trump’s wishes, then the whole sordid mess is just “theater.”
I’ll leave it to lawyers to speak to this with more authority, but as best as I can tell, this isn’t how the system is supposed to work. Attempting to interfere with a criminal investigation is itself evidence of obstruction. McGahn’s willingness to ignore a president’s corrupt instructions does not let that president off the hook.
South Carolina’s senior senator, however, has left no doubt that he simply does not care, despite the principles he said he cared about when there was a Democrat in the White House. The Washington Post ’s James Downie added , “Graham is far from the first hypocritical politician. But the South Carolina senator particularly prides himself on being no-nonsense and on his legal experience. That he has opted for such an obvious double standard is especially shameless.”

Trump's lies about abortion take an alarming and incendiary turn | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-lies-about-abortion-take-alarming-and-incendiary-turn,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump held his latest campaign rally in Green Bay on Saturday night, and as he’s done on several recent occasions, the president focused attention on abortion rights. In this case, the Republican described a very specific scenario:
“The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”
The audience, on cue, expressed its disapproval of such conditions, booing loudly, as if their president had told them a gruesome truth.
He hadn’t. In fact, the scenario Trump depicted was ridiculously false. The New York Times published a detailed, albeit understated, fact-check piece , but the bottom line remains the same: there are no instances in which a healthy baby is born, only to be murdered soon after following a chat between a woman and her doctor.
If the White House can point to a single instance in which this has ever happened, anywhere in the United States, officials should feel free to present such an example to the public.
They won’t, because they can’t.
The problem in this case, however, isn’t limited to the obvious fact that the president lied – an alarmingly common occurrence – but rather, it’s the nature of this specific lie that stands out.
In an era in which domestic terrorism is an increasingly deadly societal scourge, it’s dangerous when a sitting American president lies to rabid followers with tales of infants being executed in medical facilities.
Complicating matters, Saturday night was an extreme example, but it was hardly the first example of Team Trump using incendiary rhetoric of late on the issue of reproductive rights.
As regular readers know , it was early last month when House Democrats launched an expansive investigation into presidential abuses, prompting White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to release an official press statement accusing Dems of trying to “distract” the public from the party’s agenda – which she said includes “killing babies after they’re born.”
Soon after, the president’s chief spokesperson went a little further. Asked about the virtues of possibly lowering the rhetorical temperature in D.C., the president’s chief spokesperson decided to do the opposite .
“Look, I think that the real shame in all of this is that Democrats are perfectly capable of coming together and agreeing on the fact that they’re comfortable ripping babies straight from a mother’s womb or killing a baby after birth,” Sanders said.
The use of the word “comfortable” was of particular interest – as if Democrats agree with the White House press secretary’s incendiary and false rhetoric.
No good can come of this.

Turmoil creates 'crisis' conditions for the NRA | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/turmoil-creates-crisis-conditions-the-nra,"By Steve Benen Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 4/26/19, 10:16 PM ET Federal judge sentences Maria Butina to 18 months in prison Maria Butina, who pled guilty to acting as a Russian operative, was sentenced in federal court today to 18 months in prison. The judge ordered that Butina be deported immediately following the end of her sentence. share tweet email save Embed On Friday afternoon, as the National Rifle Association’s annual national gathering was getting ready to hear from the nation’s president and vice president, Russian agent Maria Butina was sentenced by a federal judge to 18 months in prison . Butina, of course, intended to influence conservative politics and the Republican Party, and she did so largely by focusing her efforts on the NRA.
At face value, that seemed like the sort of development that might’ve left a cloud over the far-right group’s convention. But as developments progressed, the Russian operative’s prison sentence was just the tip of the iceberg. As the Washington Post reported , “The typically bland corporate fare this year exploded with strife, including allegations of extortion, financial mismanagement and a leadership battle that have publicly overtaken all else at the event.”
Former NRA president Oliver North was ousted from the organization Saturday, one day after NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre issued a letter to the NRA’s board, claiming that North tried to extort him. The battle, which LaPierre appears to have won, was centered on what some claim are exorbitant payments to the group’s outside counsel and a lawsuit the NRA filed against its longtime public relations firm, Ackerman McQueen.
On his way out the door, North, whose resignation was not voluntary, said in his resignation letter that there’s “ a clear crisis ” within the organization.
That seems like a fair assessment. Before his own ouster, North sought LaPierre’s resignation , accusing the group’s longtime leader of financial improprieties, including allegations LaPierre spent more than $200,000 on “wardrobe purchases … that were charged to a vendor.” There are reportedly additional questions surrounding the lack of transparency surrounding the NRA’s contract with Ackerman McQueen.
LaPierre retaliated, told the board North was trying to divide the organization, and North clearly lost the fight. That does not, however, mean the drama is over.
Steve Hart, the NRA’s longtime lawyer, was also suspended over the weekend, and that news coincided with an announcement from New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), whose office is now investigating the NRA’s tax-exempt status .
The NRA’s full board of directors is scheduled to meet today . Evidently, the board’s 76 members will have quite a few decisions to make – including choosing a new president to replace North.

* There’s a lot to chew on in the new Washington Post /ABC News poll , but here’s a topline result that stood out for me: 55% of American voters say they “definitely” will not vote for Donald Trump next year. That may seem encouraging to the president’s critics, though it’s worth noting for context that in 2016, 54% of Americans who cast ballots didn’t vote for Trump and he won anyway.
* The same polling found former Vice President Joe Biden (D) leading the Democrats’ presidential field with 13%, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with 9%. Most of the party’s voters are undecided. (Note: in this poll, respondents were asked to volunteer their top choice; they were not read a list of candidates.)
* Biden picked up an important endorsement this morning, receiving the support of the International Association of Fire Fighters.
* In the face of criticism that his campaign hasn’t been substantive enough, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) unveiled a plan to combat the climate crisis this morning. His plan is to position the United States as a net-zero emissions country by 2050. That’s in line with United Nations targets, though the Green New Deal aims for the same target by 2030.
* According to the New York Times , 16 presidential hopefuls have qualified for the upcoming Democratic debates, while four – Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Mayor Wayne Messam, and Marianne Williamson – have not yet met the minimum thresholds.
* Biden’s campaign made it a priority to have strong fundraising right out of the gate, and as Rachel noted on Friday’s show, the former vice president and his team met their goal: Biden raised $6.3 million in his first 24 hours, which narrowly topped Beto O’Rourke’s $6.1 million first-day haul.
* On a related note, some of the former vice president’s supporters have launched a super PAC on his behalf, and while Biden cannot legally stop them, one of his aides said he “does not welcome assistance from super PACs.”
* And though it seems a little hard to believe, a new Emerson poll in Texas found several Democratic presidential hopefuls running competitively with Donald Trump, with O’Rourke tied with the president, and Biden actually leading the Republican, 50% to 49%. The same poll showed Biden leading O’Rourke among Democratic voters in the Lone Star State, 23% to 22%.

Six months later, Robert Mueller’s investigation, which Rosenstein oversaw from his Justice Department perch, is over, and Rosenstein is exiting the stage. He submitted his resignation letter yesterday, and his last day is May 11.
His resignation was expected; he had been saying for a long time that he planned to leave the department once Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, possible collusion by the Trump campaign and potential obstruction of justice by the president was completed.
“I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education and prosperity,” Rosenstein wrote in his resignation letter.
Apparently indifferent to the political implications, the deputy AG even included an “ America first ” reference in his letter.
It was an odd message, especially for someone who no longer has any incentive to flatter the fragile ego of the president. At least publicly, Trump has routinely showed Rosenstein disrespect, if not contempt, so praising the president’s “courtesy” struck a dissonant note.
But I was also struck by the reference to the “personal conversations” between Trump and Rosenstein. This comes on the heels of a related Washington Post report about their interactions:
Rod J. Rosenstein, again, was in danger of losing his job. The New York Times had just reported that – in the heated days after James B. Comey was fired as FBI director – the deputy attorney general had suggested wearing a wire to surreptitiously record President Trump. Now Trump, traveling in New York, was on the phone, eager for an explanation.
Rosenstein – who, by one account, had gotten teary-eyed just before the call in a meeting with Trump’s chief of staff – sought to defuse the volatile situation and assure the president he was on his team, according to people familiar with matter. He criticized the Times report, published in late September, and blamed it on former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, whose recollections formed its basis. Then he talked about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and told the president he would make sure Trump was treated fairly, people familiar with the conversation said.
“I give the investigation credibility,” Rosenstein said, according to an administration official with knowledge of what was said during the call. “I can land the plane.”
So let me get this straight. While the president was the subject of a federal investigation, he had multiple conversations with the Justice Department official overseeing the probe – including discussions about the investigation itself?
It reminds me of a point we first kicked around 14 months ago . In June 2016, Bill Clinton had a chat on a tarmac with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and according to everyone involved, it was a fairly brief and inconsequential social interaction.
The political world responded to the meeting with abject horror: because the Justice Department was examining Hillary Clinton’s email server protocols, Americans were told, it was wildly inappropriate for the former president to engage the sitting attorney general in conversation.
After all, according to those who saw the chat as scandalous, Bill Clinton might’ve used the opportunity to pressure a top Justice Department official about an ongoing investigation.
There was no evidence of such pressure, but that didn’t matter. Even the possibility was widely seen as scandalous.
Everyone who took that story seriously, or at least pretended to, should consider why Trump’s chats with Rosenstein are receiving far less attention.

New revelations lead to even more trouble for Trump's Fed nominee | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/new-revelations-lead-even-more-trouble-trumps-fed-nominee,"By Steve Benen Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 4/1/19, 9:00 PM ET Obeisance to Trump may not be sufficient to save new Fed nominee Rachel Maddow reports on the mounting scandals plaguing Donald Trump’s nominee for the Federal Reserve Board, Stephen Moore, whose co-authorship of a book called “Trumponomics” may not be sufficient qualification to secure his confirmation. share tweet email save Embed Stephen Moore, Donald Trump’s controversial choice for the Federal Reserve’s board of governors, has already faced intense criticism, but as some of the pushback starts to come from Senate Republicans , his odds of confirmation are starting to fade.
The New York Times reported overnight that White House officials are doing what they should’ve done before the president threw his support behind the Republican pundit: they’re starting to vet his published works.
The White House is reviewing past writings by Stephen Moore, the conservative commentator whom President Trump plans to nominate to the Federal Reserve Board, amid criticism that many of his opinion columns denigrated women, and enthusiasm for his candidacy appeared to be waning among Republicans on Capitol Hill. […]
Mr. Moore apologized on Sunday for some, but not all, of his past writings in an appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” saying that he did not remember everything he had written over his career. “Frankly, I didn’t even remember writing some of these they were so long ago,” he said, adding that he was embarrassed by some of the pieces.
Mr. Moore has written that it may be dangerous for women to earn more than men and has criticized women’s athletic abilities. On Sunday, he tried to shift the focus from his writings to his critics, saying, “I think most fair-minded people think this has been kind of a sleaze campaign against me.”
If by “sleaze campaign,” Moore is referring to people quoting things he’s said and written, then his whining is well grounded.
Indeed, new revelations continue to come to the fore. The New York Times pointed to comments Moore made during a debate in 2016, in which he endorsed repeal of existing child-labor laws.
The article also highlighted comments Moore made in 2000, during a C-SPAN appearance. “It’s not a good thing that black women are making more than black men today,” Moore told a national television audience. “In fact, you know, the male needs to be the breadwinner of the family. One of the reasons you’ve seen the decline of the family, not just in the black community, but also it’s happening now in the white community as well, is because women are more economically self-sufficient.”
There’s no reason to believe this was intended to be funny.
All of this follows other recent revelations, including a 2017 incident in which Moore made absurd comments about Robert E. Lee and slavery.
Of course, each of these examples are just part of a vast collection of offensive and insulting quotes from the Republican pundit.
Moore seems to believe he has a credible response to all of this: none of it matters. The only thing he should be judged on, Moore has argued, is his perspective on economic policy.
“No one wants to talk about my economic ideas,” Moore complained last week. “They have not attacked me on my economic ideas,” he added .
If that were true, it’d still be unpersuasive. Moore’s bizarre record on a wide variety of issues raises important doubts about his judgment.
But just as important is the fact that Moore’s complaint in no way reflects reality. His economic ideas have come under intense fire from, among others, me .
The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell has done fantastic work on Moore’s Fed nomination, and she added this morning, in a rather brutal column , “Stephen Moore wants the media to pay less attention to his idiotic comments about gender and more attention to his idiotic comments about the economy. Sure thing, bro. Happy to help out.”
For what it’s worth, the White House still hasn’t formally sent Moore’s nomination to the Senate for consideration. There’s still time, in other words, to end this fiasco before it proceeds in earnest.

"Targeting the ACA, Trump doesn't see his health care vulnerability | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/targeting-the-aca-trump-doesnt-see-his-health-care-vulnerability,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump was eager to brag about his perceived accomplishments at the NRA’s gathering last week and drew some applause when he turned his attention the Affordable Care Act. “[W]e got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated,” the president said . “Now we’re going for the rest.”
It was those last six words that stood out. Congressional Republicans, aware of the pitfalls for the GOP in the health care debate, have urged the White House to proceed with caution on the issue. Trump doesn’t seem to care.
He should. The latest Monmouth University poll , released yesterday, found health care as Americans’ top concern, far above issues such as taxes and immigration. The latest Washington Post /ABC News poll pointed in a similar direction :
Trump’s handling of health care appears to be a bigger liability in his reelection bid, with 38 percent of voters saying it is a mark against him, compared to 25 percent who say it’s a reason to vote for him.
Republicans are comparatively less enthused about Trump’s handling of health care than they are about other issues, with less than half – or 46 percent – of GOP voters saying his management of the issue makes them more likely to vote for him.
Among independents, Trump’s handling of health care is a negative attribute by an 11-point margin (36 percent to 25 percent).
The more the president boasts about his plans to take down “the rest” of the Affordable Care Act, the more the Republican reminds the public about an issue on which he’s very weak.
Complicating matters is the fact that Trump’s latest boast doesn’t appear to make a lot of sense. Look again at the quote from his NRA speech: “[W]e got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated. Now we’re going for the rest.”
Who’s “ we ”? It’s certainly not congressional Republicans, who have no interest in relitigating the issue. It’s also not the White House, which still doesn’t have a plan , and has no plans to come up with one.
And yet, earlier this month, Trump spoke to the National Republican Congressional Committee – whose members are in the minority in part because of health care – and told his allies, “Republicans should not run away from health care. You can’t do it. You’re going to get clobbered. And I have an idea and I think it’s great.”
The idea, evidently, is to come up with a health care plan in 2021.
Soon after, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News, in reference to health care, “Oh, yes, we want to run on this.”
If Democrats are lucky, Republicans will follow through on this.
