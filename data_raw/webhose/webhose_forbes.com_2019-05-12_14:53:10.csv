WWE Superstar Shakeup 2019: When Is It And What Should You Expect?,www.forbes.com,Brian Mazique,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/04/13/wwe-superstar-shakeup-2019-when-is-it-and-what-should-you-expect/,"Every team sport has an offseason and one of the most entertaining things about the break between games is the player movement. The NBA offseason is arguably more compelling than the actual season. Well, professional wrestling isn't technically a sport, and if it was, it wouldn't be a team sport. Still, the WWE, the king of the pro wrestling scene seeks to capture some of the same magic the NBA and other major sports leagues generate with an offseason, except, of course, the results are all scripted and all of the talent restructurings happens over the course of two days rather than months.
It's called the WWE Superstar Shakeup and here's everything you need to know about it.
When: Monday and Tuesday, April 15-16 Programs: Raw and Smackdown at 8 pm ET for both shows
Who's Involved?
Potentially every wrestler on the WWE's roster could be involved. In previous years, we've seen WWE employ a draft concept for this program. Other times the authority figures, whomever that might be at a given point in the storyline, would dictate the landing spots for the talent.
Currently, the McMahon Family–including Triple H–are major parts of the storyline, and they will likely be pulling the strings this year.
What Might the End Result Be?
This is WWE, so they have the privilege of making things up as they go along. It's part of what makes it cool. Vince McMahon can choose to change the rules of the Superstar Shakeup at any time. It could have a completely different look in 2019.
One thing is for sure, wrestlers will be moved and we'll see new faces. Here are a few things to watch for on Monday and Tuesday.
Potential Returns
Bray Wyatt
It appears the man formerly known as The Eater of Worlds has been ready for a comeback for some time. He has a different look and a rumored new gimmick. At one point, he was arguably the most captivating on-screen talent in the promotion, but WWE never really elevated him to the apex heel level.
It's about time he returns and I think it'll be on Monday or Tuesday.
Fandango
Back in July 2018, Fandango suffered a torn labrum that has kept him out of action for nearly a year. In March, he was featured in a YouTube video from the WWE's Performance Center. He talked about his rehab, missing the business and wanting a more serious gimmick upon his return.
This would seemingly be a good time to bring Fandango back repackaged–if he's physically ready to return. When he was wrestling as Johnny Curtis, he was one of the more promising members of NXT back from 2010-12. A return to that persona might be solid, but it will be hard to pull off initially. Expect fans to sing the Fandango theme song, and Fashion-Police-related stuff while he tries to put over the new persona.
As an in-ring performer, he's much better than we've gotten a chance to see in WWE.
Potential Splits
Breaking Up the New Day
Now that Kofi Kingston is the WWE champion, he needs to have some singles feuds, and that's going to be tough if he's still such a big part of the New Day. Big E suffered a torn meniscus and will be out of action for a while, and that may make it easier to send Kofi to Raw while leaving Xavier Woods on Smackdown.
WWE can figure out where it wants Big E once he's healthy enough to return.
Splitting Bobby Roode and Chad Gable
At one point, Roode and Gable had a little momentum. However, lately, things have slowed dramatically, although it seems Gable is getting an opportunity to flex his in-ring skills. I've always liked Gable and felt he had the skills and look to be a major player.
There is nothing of importance happening with them, so sending them both on a singles journey on different shows could lead to something positive for both men. I don't think anyone cares that they just turned heel.
Potential Elevations
Buddy Murphy
If there is anyone on the cruiserweight roster who has the goods to be on Raw or Smackdown, it's now former champion Buddy Murphy. He is among the best in-ring performers in the promotion and he has the strength and presence to make it with the big boys.
I'd love to see him join Smackdown. How cool would a Murphy-AJ Styles match be?
Sky Pirates
This one is all but a given. Kairi Sane seemed to bid NXT a farewell last week and there have been rumors that she and Io Shirai are headed to the main roster as a tag-team. Paige said she was bringing an impact team to Smackdown this week.
It all aligns pretty plainly. It would be a surprise if those two weren't headed to Smackdown."
"Don't Call It A Comeback: With Two Bills, U.S. Lawmakers Aim To Give New Life to Non-Security Tokens",www.forbes.com,Joshua Ashley Klayman,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuaklayman/2019/04/13/dont-call-it-a-comeback-with-new-bills-u-s-lawmakers-aim-to-give-new-life-to-non-security-tokens/,"It has been an eventful few days in the crypto community, especially for the lawyers. Less than one week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) Staff released a landmark “ Statement on “Framework for ‘Investment Contract’ Analysis of Digital Assets ,” announcing FinHub’s publication of an analytical token framework (the “Token Framework”) and the Division of Corporation Finance’s first digital asset sale-focused no-action letter (the “TKJ No-Action Letter”) (collectively, the “Token Guidance”), U.S. federal legislators introduced two ambitious bills expressly aimed to support the U.S. blockchain industry: the Token Taxonomy Act of 2019 (H.R. 2144) (the “TTA”) and the Digital Taxonomy Act (H.R. 2154) (the “DTA” and, together with the TTA, the ""Bills"").
Controversy has, predictably, ensued.
But as blockchain lawyers throughout the Twitter-verse, the LinkedIn-mosphere and beyond issue-spot and analyze the potential implications, complications and limitations of the Bills and the Token Guidance, let’s pause for a moment to reflect on how remarkable and powerful it is to have broad bi-partisan support for non-security token sales. In the past 10 days, federal regulators and legislators may have breathed new life into a U.S. blockchain and crypto industry that – outside of states like Wyoming – had begun to resemble a repeat of the traditional financial space, including with respect to who may participate.
For those who sounded the death knell for the non-security token sale, it is time to unring that bell.
Powerful lawmakers offer support to fledgling industry.
Getty A Hunger for “Clarity”
While reportedly not timed in reaction to the SEC’s April 3, 2019 Token Guidance, Congressman Warren Davidson’s (R-OH) public comments when introducing the Bills appeared to express disappointment with existing guidance:
“ The lack of regulatory certainty in the U.S., combined with confusing, spasmodic guidance from the SEC, and an inconsistent patchwork of court decisions, has capital and innovation fleeing the U.S. market for the welcoming certainty of other jurisdictions .”
Representative Davidson's statement echoed the sentiment of many in the blockchain space, who have repeatedly and vocally sought bright-line answers and safe “swim lanes” for digital token sales. Yet, those deceptively “simple,” black-and-white results may be extraordinarily difficult for U.S. regulators to provide, as certain key existing legal frameworks (such as the Howey test, used to determine whether a digital asset sale is the sale of an investment contract and, hence, a security) are principles-based and intentionally involve highly individualized, facts-and-circumstances-based analyses.
Initial reactions from certain lawmakers, market participants and lawyers to the SEC’s Token Guidance have been mixed. Some – including this author, as will be explained in a separate piece – view the very existence of the Token Framework and the TKJ No-Action Letter as meaningful steps forward for the industry and the future of bona fide non-security token sales. Others lament that the Token Framework, while potentially useful as an analytical tool, represents the SEC Staff’s non-binding views and introduces new terminology and questions, rather than that elusive “legal clarity.”
Query, however, whether what some in the market truly seek is not mere “clarity” of the SEC’s existing position concerning digital token sales, but, instead, a different view altogether. Prior SEC guidance, including in the form of enforcement actions, cease-and-desist orders, a 21A report of investigation and certain speeches, repeatedly expressed the view that nearly every sale of digital tokens is likely to be the sale of a security, absent guidance to the contrary. The Token Framework itself specifies that it supplements, but does not replace, existing SEC guidance and laws. Examined through that lens, it arguably should be unsurprising that the Token Guidance does not – and perhaps cannot – provide broad relief for non-security token sales.
Perhaps the real way to sate the crypto market’s hunger is not to seek reinterpretations of existing law, but for lawmakers to introduce new laws – as certain U.S. States, perhaps most prominently, Wyoming, have done.
The Bills
Enter the Token Taxonomy Act and the Digital Taxonomy Act . Authored by Representatives Warren Davidson (R-OH-08) and Darren Soto (D-FL-09), respectively, the Bills were introduced April 9, 2019 with a goal “to provide regulatory certainty for businesses, entrepreneurs, and regulators in the U.S.’s blockchain economy.”
Calling the TTA “the key to unlocking blockchain technology in America,” Congressman Davidson asserted, “Without it, the U.S. is surrendering its innovative origins and ownership of the digital economy to Europe and Asia.”
Indeed, certain other nations, including Switzerland, Gibraltar and Malta, have laws that arguably are more welcoming to non-security token sales. As Marco Santori, President and Chief Legal Officer of Blockchain.com, explains, the UK recently proposed digital token legislation that differs considerably from the existing U.S. approach.
“ The FCA’s rejections of both the 'decentralization' and 'functionality' tests articulated by the SEC are important not because they demonstrate the SEC got something wrong (it didn’t), but because they demonstrate the sometimes radical differences between U.S. law and the rest of the world. These laws often constrain regulators and propel them to vastly different practical outcomes.”
They also may constrain entrepreneurs. With that in mind, the Bills seek to clarify “the numerous conflicting state initiatives and regulatory rulings, and patchwork of judicial decisions, that have clouded certainty for entrepreneurs and businesses that use blockchain technology.” Some believe that such uncertainty is one driver of the recent token sale slowdown, known as “Crypto Winter.”
In short, the Bills intentionally seek to address, head-on, concerns expressed by many crypto market participants and their lawyers – namely, how do I comply with law?
Michelle Gitlitz, a partner and Co-Head of the Blockchain Group at Blank Rome LLP, calls the Bills “an important development in the law for digital assets.”
“ Whether you agree or disagree with the [TTA’s substance],"" she asserts, “o ur legislators solicited feedback from the industry on the pain points facing the digital asset economy and have tried to address those pain points.”
Gitlitz is referring to a September 25, 2018 “crypto roundtable” called “Legislating Certainty for Cryptocurrencies,” hosted in Washington, D.C. by Congressman Davidson. There, she, and more than 80 other representatives from major Wall Street firms and blockchain companies, discussed cryptocurrency regulations . Market concerns reportedly included requests for exemptions for non-security token sales, frustration with certain state laws, including New York’s BitLicense, and a desire for legal clarity.
The Bills were drafted in response. According to an accompanying press release,
[T]he [TTA] will further clarify the Digital Token definition to be more inclusive of changing technology. Jurisdictions for the FTC and CFTC were also cited to strengthen protections for consumers. While there have been many positive laws concerning crypto regulation, others like New York’s onerous BitLicense law have been heavy-handed. A preemption provision was included to ensure the [TTA] provides the certainty innovation needs to flourish.”
While aspects of the Bills, including the “digital token” definition and pre-emption provision, have generated significant controversy, both on- and off-line, Gitlitz emphasizes, “[Legislators] listened to what we had to say and tried to draft legislation to address our concerns. That should be commended.”
Munchee and “Utility Tokens” All Over Again?
The TTA proposes to remove the term “digital token” from the definition of “security” in both the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended), while permitting the SEC to assert later the existence of a “digital unit” or investment contract. Some, like Joel Telpner, Head of the FinTech and Blockchain practice at Sullivan & Worcester LLP, think this could inadvertently “create as much ambiguity as exists today.”
“ In particular, the provision that would require rescission 90 days after written notice from the SEC would create the same cloud over the market as exists today, ” says Telpner. “ Additionally, the mere existence of such a possibility tells me that the statute doesn't adequately define digital token and digital unit, because, if it did, there would be no need to address a contingency for possible SEC interdiction. ”
Some question why the Bills did not include in the “digital token” definition the concept of “consumptive purpose,” which is contemplated by both the Token Guidance and Wyoming’s H.B. 62. Others suggest such omission was intentional, perhaps requested by certain market participants.
Preemption Cuts Both Ways
While many crypto enthusiasts may happily bid farewell to the BitLicense, Caitlin Long, the heart and soul behind the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, says that, as presently drafted, the TTA’s preemption provision also would undo aspects of Wyoming’s groundbreaking, grass roots consumptive token legislation, H.B. 62.
Per Long, in its present form, the TTA preempts not just onerous or unclear state laws, but also what she describes as “the good state utility token laws, including Wyoming, Arizona, Colorado, Montana and five other states where favorable bills are moving.”
Noting that federal preemption wasn’t contemplated in the version of the TTA introduced in late 2018, Long predicts that including preemption will “ weigh down the bill’s prospects. ” “ It’s far from clear that this is even constitutional, but it is clear states will fight this, ” Long said. “I don’t understand why on earth Congress decided to pick such a fight.”
Nevertheless, Long praises the TTA’s introduction of a $600 crypto tax exemption, which had roots in a bill originally introduced in the 115th Congressional Session by Representative David Schweikert (R-AZ-06) and Representative (now, Governor) Jared Polis (D-CO), as well as a “1031 exchange”-style (i.e., like-kind) exemption for digital tokens.
Like Long, Greg Strong, a partner at DLx Law, expects significant opposition from state securities regulators, whom he says “will argue that preempting critical regulatory functions will put retail and other investors at greater risk because they will not have access to the information needed to make informed investment decisions.”
According to Strong, the TTA currently “ would expressly preempt states from requiring registration or qualification of digital tokens; imposing prohibitions, limitations or conditions on the use of related disclosure documents; conducting merit review of a digital token offering and requiring notice filings. ”
Measuring “Value”
Some praise the intentions behind the bold Bills, as well as the bi-partisan public outreach by lawmakers to industry stakeholders, and echo Congressman Soto’s characterization of the proposed legislation as “an important first-step to promoting innovation and maximizing the potential of virtual currencies for the U.S. economy [….].”
Others caution that certain of the proposed approaches may provide less legal clarity, rather than more. Jay Baris, a partner at Shearman & Sterling LLP, believes that the likelihood of Congress enacting the TTA is slim. “While the bill is well-intentioned, it may create more issues than it solves. And may create unintended consequences.”
Still others question whether, as drafted, the Bills provide any value.
Andrea Tinianow, of Tinianow Consulting, LLC, known as the “Blockchain Czarina” for her pioneering work bringing to life the Delaware Blockchain Initiative, put it plainly, “ This legislation may have intended to provide value. But in its watered-down version it doesn’t provide clarity and creates more confusion. If the Act doesn’t actually help the blockchain industry, what is the point?”
A Gentle Shove
But are we sure that it doesn’t help? Having bi-partisan Congressional allies willing to take that first step to overcome inertia and enact new laws arguably provides tremendous value for the crypto community.
According to Jason Brett, a former U.S. federal regulator for the FDIC, “ It is always the regulator’s job to ensure ‘nothing happens’ on their watch, so asking for flexibility or risk-taking from the SEC with respect to a new asset class is not going to happen – not without a gentle shove from Congress.”
Brett, a Board Advisor for the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance and Founder of the Value Technology Foundation, says that the Bills signal to entrepreneurs that, “if you are contemplating doing a token sale [….] for a blockchain project, do not leave the United States” and “that the U.S. is friendly to blockchain and cryptocurrency.”
In addition, Brett explains, “by giving funding and asking for reports from the FTC on market abuses,” the DTA sends a zero-tolerance message to bad actors in the space.
Ron Quaranta, Chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, believes that the U.S.’s role in future innovation is being decided now. “ In our many discussions with our member base, which spans multiple industries and professions, our collective concern is the possibility of the United States falling behind in a world of accelerating innovation,” he says.
Quaranta hopes that legal efforts “will evolve with this in mind,” explaining “the WSBA stands ready to assist legislators and regulators to understand their impact on the developing cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems.”
Legislative Perfection?
While the quest for legislative perfection is admirable, so is the courage to listen to the blockchain community’s concerns and take action in response. Blockchain literally requires collaboration, as does changing existing laws. The Bills themselves are likely to evolve. Their introduction marks an ambitious first step, not the last. Perhaps what really matters here is what comes next. In my view, legal and market feedback concerning the Bills should be given to legislators – and lots of it – but so should thanks.

UFC 236 Full Fight Video: Watch Israel Adesanya Defeat Anderson Silva,www.forbes.com,Trent Reinsmith,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2019/04/13/ufc-236-full-fight-video-watch-israel-adesanya-defeat-anderson-silva/,"Israel Adesanya and Anderson Silva were not initially scheduled to headline the UFC 236 fight card, but when an abdominal hernia and a ruptured bowel knocked UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker from his scheduled title defense against Kelvin Gastelum on the day of the event, the UFC elevated the Adesanya vs. Silva matchup to headliner status. Heading into the bout, Adesanya had gone 4-0 in the UFC, winning three fight-night bonus awards in the process. Silva’s record was not as remarkable as his opponent’s. The former middleweight champion was 1-4 with on no contest heading into the bout. The odds were strong in Adesanya’s favor. He was a -450 favorite over Silva, who came in as a +350 underdog.
Those odds held throughout the three-round matchup. While the bout was a highly entertaining affair and Silva showed that he still had some life left in his 43-year old body, the 29-year-old Adesanya took home the unanimous decision win .
After the victory, Adesanya voiced his opinion on the status of the middleweight division, precisely where he belonged in that pecking order.
“I’m the No. 1 contender,” Adesanya said at the post-fight press conference. “I’m the guy fighting for the belt. I don’t care. Kelvin or Rob, whoever it is I don’t care. Whoever has the belt. Cause I see Kelvin walking around with that belt and I don’t know who gave it to him. I’m fighting for the belt next, that’s all I know. I did my job. I showed up to work.”
Adesanya got his wish. Tonight, in the co-main event of UFC 236 he faces Gastelum for the interim UFC middleweight title. It’s likely that the winner of the interim crown will face Whittaker sometime later this year in a title unification bout.
Before Adesanya and Gastelum meet at UFC 236, which takes place at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, you can watch Adesanya’s “Fight of the Night” bonus-winning victory over Silva."
Corporate Innovation Needs Innovation,www.forbes.com,Serenity Gibbons,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2019/04/13/corporate-innovation-needs-innovation/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Entrepreneurs I share insights gathered from purpose-driven entrepreneurs Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Big companies do many things better than their smaller peers, but corporate innovation sure doesn’t seem to be one of them.
In case recent disruptions haven’t made that clear, consider what happened when Target tried to develop its “store of the future.” After assembling a team to prototype a small, showroom-style store that would have had robots grabbing items behind the scenes for customers, the bullseye brand unexpectedly shut down the project less than a year from its launch date. A marketplace project called Goldfish, where retailers other than Target might one day have listed products for sale, was axed at the same time.
Although Target’s senior vice president of communications quickly issued a statement that suggested the retail giant did so to “refocus [its] efforts on supporting [its] core business,” the truth is obvious: Innovations at a big scale don't always go as planned. And that means they provide lots of food for thought for small businesses.
The Reality of R&D Corporations and startups alike struggle to innovate. But the former's scale provides the latter with lots of lessons. pexels.com
Target isn’t unique or even unusual in its inability to spend its way into innovation. Take a look at PwC’s latest “ Global Innovation 1000 ” list. Some of the top innovators, you might notice, spend far less on research and development than those lower on the list. Volkswagen ranks third while spending barely 5 percent of its revenue on R&D, for instance, while Celgene Corporation spends nearly half its revenue and ranks 24th.
How does PwC explain the disconnect? “For the entire 14 years we have conducted this annual study we have consistently found that there is no statistically significant relationship between how much you spend on R&D and how well you perform,” noted Barry Jaruzelski , partner at PwC’s strategy consulting business branch. “What does matter is the depth of your customer insight, the quality of the talent assembled, and rigor of the process you employ.”
Every enterprise likes to think it has a strong team, a solid understanding of its customers, and sensible processes. The reality, though, is that many have skated by on their size and industry connections. When it comes time to innovate, they learn they’ve become so large that they’ve lost the perspective they need on what their customers want and how they can deliver it.
To Innovate, Look Outward
But if corporations can’t buy innovation, how are they supposed to achieve it? The same way startups do: through market insight.
To a degree most corporations aren’t, startups are intensely focused on product-market fit. Whether due to investor pressures or limited personal capital, they tend to have just a single shot to find it. They also tend to be composed of young, mobile high performers, who bring insights from other companies, pop culture, and their entrepreneurial peers.
So how can enterprises get back their entrepreneurial streak? One option is to launch a corporate venture arm or accelerator. Jaguar Land Rover went this route with its InMotion subsidiary , which has helped to develop everything from data-through-audio transmission technology to in-dash smart home controls.
Jaguar Land Rover’s model does, however, have its drawbacks. For one, not every company can afford its own venture division. Second, corporate ventures are prone to poor scoping and undue influence by the parent company. “It’s taken a bit of time to draw a clear line around InMotion to understand what we’re doing and what we’re not doing,” admitted InMotion ’s managing director Sebastian Peck.
But corporations can get startup exposure in other ways. Acquisitions can work wonders when an enterprise is trying to innovate outside its wheelhouse. Amazon, for instance, recently acquired Eero, a mesh Wi-Fi startup based in San Francisco. Although the e-commerce giant’s engineers are no strangers to smart home devices, they’re not so experienced when it comes to wireless internet services.
Beware, though, that corporate acquisitions of startups rarely go as planned. Yahoo is famous for its acquisitions of Flickr, Delicious, MyBlogLog, and more. Google even managed to dampen the impact of Nest , which had two popular products on the market prior to its acquisition. Culture and product clashes are almost always more serious than executives expect them to be.
What’s left on the table? External partnerships. Although data doesn’t exist on the rate of internal innovation failures — which enterprises understandably want to keep private — almost three in four of them innovate successfully when working with external partners.
Generally speaking, an external partnership approach involves fewer risks than corporate venture or acquisition models, but be sure to vet partners carefully. The secretive nature of innovation work creates opportunities for charlatans to make claims they can’t support.
Innovation may not be enterprises’ strong suit, but that doesn’t mean they’re doomed. Instead of sinking money into internal initiatives, they need to get back to what made them successful to start with: an intimate sense of the market’s opportunities and a startup-style thirst to seize them.

The Tiny JBL Go 2 Is The Essential Travel Companion For Today's Backpacker,www.forbes.com,Mark Sparrow,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2019/04/13/the-tiny-jbl-go-2-is-the-essential-travel-companion-for-todays-backpacker/,"Vacation time is almost upon us. It’s time to go away, turn off all the electronics and sit back with a cold cocktail and to soak up some welcome sunshine. Now, as much as I like a bit of peace and quiet, there comes a time, usually after the first couple of days of decompression, that I start to twitch and I begin to miss things like podcasts and music. However, when you’re on holiday with other people, it’s a bit rude to walk around with earphones stuck in your ears all the time. It’s anti-social and bordering on downright rude. So how do you get to carry on listening to your music or podcasts, but still looks as if you’re being sociable and sharing? The answer is to pack a Bluetooth wireless speaker to make it look as if you’re being thoughtful. With a wireless speaker, you can listen to your music or podcasts but still look as if you’re mentally present. The next question is how big a speaker you should take on holiday. If space is no object, I’d definitely recommend taking something from JBL’s Charge or Flip range of speakers, as they’re waterproof and offer really good battery life. Many of us are more likely to pack a few essentials in a backpack and book a budget flight with just a carry-on baggage allowance. For those kinds of holidays, a Bluetooth speaker can be a bit of a luxury and maybe too big to stuff in a backpack. For these occasions, you need something small that can deliver a generous sound but one that doesn’t cost a fortune, just in case it gets stolen or damaged.
For that sort of travel, I’d suggest a JBL Go 2 Bluetooth speaker. I reviewed the original JBL GO some years back and it went on to be one of the best-selling little wireless speakers on the market. For the money, it was a great little speaker. Okay, so it didn’t kick out a whole lot of bass, and the battery didn’t last for an entire day, but for listening to music and podcasts on the hotel balcony or when going to sleep, it’s just the ticket.
The new JBL Go 2 has a fancy curved design and is waterproof to IPX7.
JBL Now JBL has a new baby speaker – the Go 2 –and it’s had a smart makeover. Gone are the hard and straight edges of the first JBL Go, with its charging port and auxiliary input open to the elements. The primary colors have been ditched in favor of a beautiful array of tasteful pastel shades. The JBL Go 2 is available in a dozen classy hues, each featuring a slightly metallic or iridescent appearance that gives the speaker a rather classy feel. The rest of the speaker design is fairly familiar, with the large JBL logo emblazoned across the speaker grille. There’s a small compartment at the right side of the case with a waterproof strip that hides the Micro USB charging and a 3.5mm stereo input for hooking up any non-Bluetooth devices.
Setting up the JBL Go 2 is very simple; just press the Bluetooth button on the top of the speaker and pair it with a smartphone or tablet. That’s all you have to do. Every time you turn the speaker on it connects to the paired smartphone and its ready to play.
There are five buttons ranged across the top of the speaker. The first is a Power button; the second is for Bluetooth pairing; the third and fourth are volume controls, while the fifth is a Play/Pause button for controlling the music which can also skip tracks with a double press. That’s really all there is to this dinky little speaker that also happens to be water resistant to IPX7 standard, which means it can handle splashes from your infinity pool or a sudden downpour when the afternoon monsoon arrives. The waterproof feature was missing from the original JBL Go, and it’s a welcome addition for the seasoned traveler. However, one thing missing from the original design is an anchor point for a wrist strap; it’s no longer possible to hang the speaker on a backpack with a carabineer. That’s a bit of an omission in my view but maybe JBL Go 3 will correct that oversight.
As far as sound goes, the JBL Go 2 still doesn’t offer any more bass that the original JBL Go, but the mid-range and treble both sound quite a bit clearer to my ears. The volume level on this mini speaker is impressive, unlike the battery life, which, because of the speaker's small size, is limited to around five hours maximum. However, the battery life is enough for an evening’s entertainment and recharging overnight is no great hardship.
Verdict: Despite some shortcomings in terms of bass and battery life, I can’t help liking the JBL Go 2. Its new curvy shape is a big improvement on the original boxy design of the JBL Go. My only real complaint is the absence of an anchor point for attaching a hook or wrist strap. For the money, the JBL Go 2 is a great little travel speaker and the ideal companion for today’s globetrotter, in much the same way that a mini shortwave radio was 50 years ago.

Samsung Releases Urgent Galaxy S10 Security Update,www.forbes.com,Kate O'Flaherty,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/04/13/samsung-releases-urgent-galaxy-s10-security-update/,"Most Galaxy S10 users love their phones, but many have complained about the fingerprint scanner. According to users and reviewers, the ultrasonic in-display sensor can be slow and inaccurate. Last week, Samsung was also hit by claims that the fingerprint scanner isn’t actually that secure. A researcher was able to bypass it by taking a photo of a fingerprint on a wine glass and making a 3D copy. Granted, this isn’t something a regular hacker could easily do – and as Forbes contributor Davey Winder says , it isn’t a reason to stop using the fingerprint scanner just yet.
But the manufacturer is making an effort to improve its fingerprint scanner after releasing a firmware update to its biometrics module in the Galaxy Store. Specifically for the S10 and S10+, the update comes with very limited notes, but what they do say is that it is urgent – and that the 6.9MB download covers a “biometrics security patch” and “fingerprints”.
How do I get the update?
There’s no way of manually applying it: the update appears to be rolling out in stages and comes via the pop up screen on your phone via the Galaxy Store app. It’s not clear whether the update addresses the ability to use a 3D fingerprint to unlock the device, but those who have received it are already saying it has made a difference to the speed of the scanner.
The folks at GSMArena say they saw a “tremendous improvement” in the performance of the fingerprint sensor following the update. It will be interesting to see if others concur as the update reaches more users.
There is also a separate March security update which is much larger at over 500MB that comes with bug fixes and performance enhancements."
"iOS Security Feature Destroys 66,000 iPhones -- How To Ensure Yours Isn't Next",www.forbes.com,Davey Winder,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/04/13/ios-security-feature-destroys-66000-iphones-how-to-ensure-yours-isnt-next/,"Way back in 1996 I was fortunate enough to win the ""Technology Journalist of the Year"" award in the U.K. for an investigation into security threats facing the rapidly evolving internet. I have been encouraging people to take security seriously ever since. The perfect technological storm of an omnipresent internet, blisteringly fast mobile broadband speeds and the computer in your pocket that is your smartphone makes this message more relevant than ever. So it may come as some surprise that I am suggesting disabling one of the most important security features that the iPhone provides. What's the problem?
A new report by the Colorado Public Interest Research Group (CoPIRG), has revealed that over the course of the last three years some 66,000 iPhones have had to be destroyed by one Colorado based electronics recycling center rather than being reused. All thanks to an iOS security feature. The Wireless Alliance, which received in excess of six million donated phones for recycling between 2015 and 2018, has said that the iPhones in question were ""perfectly reusable"" but had to be broken up for parts rather than enter the used smartphone market. The reuse before recycle mantra resonates with those who want to empower the less wealthy consumer and reduce the environmental impact of new phone production alike. So what's the iOS security feature that's causing the problem? The answer is iPhone's activation lock that is part of the Find My iPhone functionality.
When an iPhone user turns on Find My iPhone the activation lock is automatically enabled. It works by securely storing the Apple ID on Apple's activation servers and linking this to the device. In order to turn off Find My iPhone or factory reset the iPhone in order to erase all data, the Apple ID password is required. This is a great security feature as you can easily put a misplaced or stolen iPhone into ""Lost Mode"" which locks the screen and displays a custom message to help recover it if found. Apple says ""While Activation Lock works in the background to make it more difficult for someone to use or sell your missing device, Lost Mode clearly indicates to anyone who finds your device that it still belongs to you and can't be reactivated without your password.""
What does CoPIRG say?
While acknowledging that an activation lock can deter thieves by making stolen iPhones a much less valuable proposition, it also urges that every phone that can be reused should be reused. One in four of the iPhones that were donated to The Wireless Alliance last year had the lock activated and the proportion is growing year on year. ""There is no current system in place where companies like The Wireless Alliance can flag non-stolen activation locked phones to manufacturers"" the CoPRIG report says, continuing ""if a phone's activation lock is not lifted by the original owner, the lock is permanent."" In order to tackle this problem of permanence, CoPIRG suggests that there needs to be a better balance between theft deterrence and allowing the activation locks to be disabled by reputable, certified, recyclers. It suggests that a system could be introduced whereby the recycling organization would submit International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers to the manufacturer which would then push a notification to the original owner's current device requesting verification the device had been donated for recycling.
What should you do?
Let me start by stating what you shouldn't do, and that is disable the Find My iPhone feature. This is, as I've already said, an important part of the security ecosystem embracing your iPhone and helping protect your data privacy. You should also continue to donate your old iPhone to a certified recycling center when you upgrade so it can be reused. Just remember to deactivate Find My iPhone, and so the activation lock, before donating it. I also advise that you securely wipe your iPhone to ensure none of your data remains. This is easily done by going to Settings|General|Reset and then selecting Erase All Content. You will need to enter your passcode after which a warning will ask if you are sure. Press the red Erase iPhone button, enter your Apple ID password to confirm and your iPhone will be returned to the factory default."
'Octopath Traveler' Is Coming To PC This June,www.forbes.com,Ollie Barder,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2019/04/13/octopath-traveler-is-coming-to-pc-this-june/,"In a new leak, it looks like the Switch role-playing game Octopath Traveler is getting a PC port released this June. While the original post on the UK Square Enix site was deleted, Gematsu picked it up and it appears that Octopath Traveller is coming to the PC in the near future.
This is right after the news of a mobile prequel game and rumors of a sequel, so having the game on PC will only help build the momentum of the series further.
The original game on the Switch was a solid role-playing game with an interesting 2.5 HD art style that was reminiscent of classic 16-bit games.
The original Switch version also sold very well and considering the obviously smaller overhead in terms of the backend production budget, means it likely performed well for Square Enix and Nintendo.
Either way, having Octopath Traveler come to the PC is good news for everyone really and I hope it will be as well received as the Switch version was, as it’s a decent game.
Octopath Traveler will be released for PC on June 7.

NASA Looks Into Rechargeable Venus Lander; Powered By Microwave-Beaming Atmospheric Balloon,www.forbes.com,Bruce Dorminey,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2019/04/13/nasa-looks-into-rechargeable-venus-lander-powered-by-microwave-beaming-atmospheric-balloon/,"NASA is funding a study that may pave the way for a rechargeable lander on Venus; one that would be wirelessly charged by a floating, balloon-like companion that would collect solar power in our neighboring planet’s upper atmosphere. Venus’ extraordinarily inhospitable atmosphere and surface have long hampered attempts to explore the planet. With surface temperatures of 450 Celsius; surface pressures 92 times that of Earth and a thick carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere, Venus has long guarded its secrets.
But this nine-month, phase one initiative funded by NASA’s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program, may finally help a lander get a handle on Venus’ surface chemistry, geology, and history .
The idea is to use an autonomous, floating power generator to collect solar energy near the top of Venus’ thick atmosphere .
The top of the Venus atmosphere incoming solar radiation averages about 2636 watts per square meter, whereas at the top of Earth’s atmosphere, the solar constant is about 1367 watts per square-meter, Erik Brandon, a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) power technologist who’s leading the study, told me.
Once the atmospheric collector had topped off its batteries, it would likely transmit power via microwave (or possibly in the radio spectrum) from onboard high-temperature batteries to high-temperature batteries on the lander.
The transmitted energy, says Brandon, would be converted to direct current electrical power on the lander via a rectifying antenna or “rectenna” constructed from suitable high-temperature materials and using high-temperature silicon carbide diodes. Thus, the lander should be able to continually extend its operating life. Or at least for longer than the former Soviet Union’s 1970s’-era Venera landers, which never even lasted two hours on the Venusian surface.
Once the lander’s batteries were recharged, the solar power collecting spacecraft would re-ascend back up to the upper reaches of Venus’ atmosphere to recharge its own batteries once again.
Brandon says the biggest challenge is likely to be achieving sufficient control with the collecting vehicle to adequately maneuver the Venus atmosphere between charging at higher altitudes and then getting back to the lander site. The collecting balloon vehicle will then have to maintain control while beaming its power to the lander.
But this continual process of collecting and recharging solar energy for the lander would continue as long as the lander’s components and electronics survived Venus’ harsh environment.
Brandon says in principle this lander/floating-charger combination could also work to keep a Venusian rover powered up. The floating balloon platform could also serve as a communications relay between Earth and the lander. And, in theory, it could continue to function as a secondary science mission even after the lander had ceased to function.
But can the lander’s electronics survive the surface heat and pressures?
We intend to leverage advances in high-temperature electronics (such as silicon carbide devices) and packaging to determine if we can design an end-to-end power system, says Brandon.
This phase one study will answer questions such as what altitudes would the collecting spacecraft have to be? How long would the lander be able to run off a single upload of new power? And what would the lander's surface life be upon first landing, without being recharged?
The initial goal is to ensure it can run with fully-charged batteries until the first recharge event, says Brandon.

Credit: Wikipedia Why not simply use a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). That is, an electrical power unit that generates energy from the natural decay of radioactive material?
“There are no RTGs that can survive at Venus temperatures and conditions,” said Brandon. “Right now, the focus at NASA is on developing improved RTGs for low-temperature, vacuum environments in deep space.”
Where else might this tech be used in planetary exploration?
Brandon says the principle of such a power beamer might work on low-temperature ocean worlds in the outer solar system. That’s where a fixed lander with sufficient power would turn the technology on its head and beam power to a smaller probe. “The idea is that it allows you to extend your fixed power source beyond the boundaries of the lander,” said Brandon.
But Venus would hopefully see some variation of this balloon-collecting and power-beaming technology first. And if Brandon’s current study is successful, a potential second round of funding offers an additional two years of study.
The planetary science community is eager to get on with Venus surface exploration. The Venus exploration community would like to see a working lander that would last for days at least, says Brandon. Or at least long enough to collect data and perhaps perform some simple sampling.
“[But] it is difficult to predict the lifetime of a mission in such a harsh environment,” said Brandon."
'Ni No Kuni' Is Getting An Anime Movie And It's Not Being Made By Studio Ghibli,www.forbes.com,Ollie Barder,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2019/04/13/ni-no-kuni-is-getting-an-anime-movie-and-its-not-being-made-by-studio-ghibli/,"It was only a matter of time really, the popular anime-infused role-playing game series Ni no Kuni is finally getting an anime movie but Studio Ghibli doesn’t seem to be behind the production. If you have been following the Ni no Kuni games, the art style was initially overseen by Studio Ghibli with character designs by Yoshiyuki Momose . This gave the games a wonderful visual edge over the competition, something that developer Level-5 leveraged to its full extent.
While the second game saw Studio Ghibli leave the project overall, Momose stayed on as character designer.
So this new movie is interesting in the sense that it retains the same kind of character designs and art style but is not itself a Studio Ghibli production.
Maybe it is because people like Hayao Miyazaki are not the biggest fan of video games or because Level-5 wanted more creative involvement. In any case, we have a new Ni no Kuni movie on the way and it looks pretty great in the latest trailer (shown below).
If you are curious about this movie’s production, the studio behind it now is OLM, Inc. and Momose is the director along with Akihiro Hino of Level-5 as the producer. What’s more, Joe Hisaishi is returning to compose the music.
The story is not from the games either and features all-new characters, so this could up being rather interesting for fans of the series.
Without much in the way of a release date as yet, all we know is that it will be out sometime this Summer. For now, this new Ni no Kuni anime movie looks rather lovely and I am definitely looking forward to seeing it.

"The 'Fortnite' World Cup Online Opens Begin Today: How To Enter, And How To Watch",www.forbes.com,Dave Thier,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/04/13/the-fortnite-world-cup-online-opens-begin-today-how-to-enter-and-how-to-watch/,"It's been a long road for competitive Fortnite , starting back at E3 last year and going through no small number of growing pains along the way. But Epic Games and the pro community are about to head to the biggest stage yet for one of the biggest games in the world: the Fortnite World Cup online opens begin today, April 13 . And with that, we'll start our way to the finals and a $30,000,000 prize pool. Here's what you need to know. On a technical level, you could say that the qualifying rounds have already started. That's because Arena mode has already been running for a couple of weeks now, and that's the first step for anyone who wants to compete in the World Cup. So if you want to compete, you need to attain Champion League in Arena mode for solos. Without that, you're relegated to watching or to grinding out your Arena rank to try and earn your spot in next weekend's online opens.
Eligible players will compete in solo matches during 3-hour windows on Saturday in their respective regions. Region-locking will be active for this, so here's when each region will compete:
Europe – 4PM – 7PM GMT North America West – 4PM – 7PM PST North America East – 4PM – 7PM EST Brazil – 4PM – 7PM BRT Oceana – 4PM – 7PM AET Asia – 4PM – 7PM JST
Players will be able to play a maximum of 10 matches during that time, and they'll earn points based on their performance. The aim here is just to advance: the top 3000 players will move on to finals on Sundays, where the top players from each region will earn their spot in the finals--the top global players will also get cash prizes.
Epic will be holding these events for five weekends until the finals in New York, where players will compete for the top prizes.
Chances are you won't be competing in the online opens, which is fine! The vast majority of human beings will not. If you want to check out the action, however, the best place to do it will be the official Fortnite Twitch channel, which will in all likelihood be streaming highlights. Or, if you want, you can follow your favorite streamer: most of the big players will certainly have qualified, though most will play with delays to avoid stream sniping."
5 Predictions For The Big 'Jedi: Fallen Order' Livestream Reveal Today,www.forbes.com,Dave Thier,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/04/13/5-predictions-for-the-big-jedi-fallen-order-livestream-reveal-today/,"It's a big one for the video game industry. It's 2019 and we have powerful consoles capable of producing broad-fantastic worlds, but they have yet to do a great job creating one in the Star Wars universe. Today, Respawn and EA are revealing Jedi: Fallen Order , the first single-player game in a long time to let us put a lightsaber in our hands and slash through some as-of-yet undiscovered reaches of the galaxy. There are a lot of expectations going into the reveal: Respawn is a well-respected developer, and people have a lot of pent-up desire for a game like this. Here are some predictions going into the big reveal: This is a traditional single-player game: We already know this, but it bears repeating. Jedi: Fallen Order will be a single-player game with no multiplayer or microtransactions. EA has been focusing on multiplayer Star Wars titles so far, but single-player has gone wrong with several high profile canceled games. This is the publisher's best shot at giving us the sort of Star Wars game that a lot of people imagined from this new era of movies. It's a big deal for EA, which has not really run with this exclusive partnership in the way that Disney may have hoped. Expect major drama in a trailer emphasizing the new story.
We won't see a huge amount of gameplay : Remember, this reveal is happening at the Star Wars celebration, not E3. I expect a trailer and maybe some discussion/explanation, but not any sort of extensive deep dive. We'll save that for later, either at E3 in some capacity or an event of Respawn's own sometime during the summer. I've got a lot of questions about how exactly lightsaber combat is going to work, to what degree this is going to be a stat-based RPG, how open world it will be, and more. I don't expect to get a whole lot of answers today, though I could be wrong.
There will be a whole lot of moral gray areas: The Star Wars universe, even when it tries to complicate things, is pretty straightforward. The two sides here are literally called the light side and the dark side, and one of them is a whole lot more enthusiastic about genocide than the other. That's the appeal of the movies: they are crystal-clear adventure stories where the good guys win in the end. Video games and novels tend to be where the stories go to get a little fuzzier. I'd expect to see a bunch of that here.
November release date: I'm assuming that EA is going big here and stabbing right into the holiday season rather than waiting a little bit on the periphery. Episode IX comes out in December, and everyone involved is going to want this synergy to work out right: not only do we want people to be at the right hype level for Episode IX that they'll want to pick up a video game, we want the excitement from the game to feed right into the movie's release. My guess would be early-mid November, with enough time to let retailers drop the price by $10 or so for Black Friday.
It will still be live-ish service: It's 2019, and things have got to be live service. Even little games tend to be live service, and a major publisher like EA is not going to give up on the opportunity to make more than the initial $60 from any given customer. Don't worry, however: EA also knows that it has made missteps in the past and is likely going to be very careful about how it frames this. We're going to see story-based DLC and maybe not much more than that. Think something like Assassin's Creed Odyssey , though maybe not quite so expansive as that. This may or may not be covered in the reveal."
4 Reasons You Should Definitely Show Up To Catch Bagon And Salamence This 'Pokémon GO' Community Day,www.forbes.com,Dave Thier,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/04/13/4-reasons-you-should-definitely-show-up-to-catch-bagon-and-salamence-this-pokemon-go-community-day-shiny/,"It's Community Day in Pokémon GO, and it's a big one. We're celebrating Bagon, which evolves first into Shellgon and then to the fearsome Salamence, a capable dragon-type that's remained rare ever since it came out. Maybe you're not playing all that much these days, or maybe you haven't made a Community Day in a while, but you're going to want to turn up for this one. Community Day is always a big day, but some are definitely bigger than others for one reason or another. This is going to be one of those times, and there are three reasons why you should definitely turn up for this event A Shiny You Can Use: We all like shinies, even if we can't articulate why. But while shiny hunting makes up an increasingly large portion of the endgame here in Pokémon GO , too often they're just trophies: I don't exactly trot out my shiny Magby on a daily basis. But a shiny Salamence can actually be a regular feature of raids, battles and gym defense, and it's fun to be able to show off your collection when you get a chance.
It's Nice Out: This is a reason that mostly applies to those in northern climes, but there are a fair number of Poké mon players in these areas. But spring is making its way across large swaths of the world, and that means its time to dust of my Poké hat and get ready for some nice long Poké walks. This is a seasonal game perhaps more than any other, and we're getting into the season. I suspect it's why we're getting such a valuable creature right now.
Maybe this isn't you: maybe you just want to play the game and hate the sunshine, though that would be sort of odd. But nice weather means big crowds, and big crowds tend to mean a better Poké mon GO experience. You'll find people willing to show up to raids, battle, trade or just revel in the feeling that everyone around you is out looking for Bagon. It's a nice feeling!
Salamence is a beast: Salamence has got to be the most useful community day Poké mon that we've seen show up since Larvitar/Tyranitar in June of last year. It's a p[owerful Dragon-type attacker with high overall stats, making it terribly useful in raids and solid in gyms and trainer battles as well. Community Day means it can learn Outrage, which will be its best available charged move. I'm still riding high with six Tyranitars, about half of which I got on the Larvitar Community Day, and I hope to repeat that performance with Bagon.
You're hoping for windy weather: with that, you can catch some high-level Bagons and evolve them into high-level Salamence without spending any of that valuable candy on levelling up.
Dragon Tamer: If you're missing just one of your Poké mon catching medals, it's probably this one. I just barely eked out my gold-level dragon tamer medal when dratini showed back up in the December Community Day, and I'm assuming plenty of people are still struggling with it. Dragon types are incredibly rare as world-spawns, but this is going to be one of your best chances to actually knock yourself up to gold tier and help out with catch rates on some of those legendaries."
"Kenyan Multi-Millionaire Peter Munga Receives $500,000 Parting Gift From Equity Bank",www.forbes.com,Mfonobong Nsehe,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2019/04/13/kenyan-multi-millionaire-peter-munga-receives-500000-parting-gift-from-equity-bank/,"Kenyan businessman Peter Munga, the outgoing chairman of Equity Bank, is set to receive a $500,000 ‘Thank You’ token from the Bank where he has served as chairman for the past 35 years. The sendoff package was revealed in a notice for the bank’s AGM which is scheduled for April 30 in Nairobi.
“Payment of a one-off gratuity of Sh50 million to the outgoing founder and chairman, Peter Kahara Munga, in consideration of his length of service, commitment and dedication to the company which spans over 35 years,” reads one of the special resolutions to be voted on at the shareholders’ meeting.
If approved, the amount, which translates to roughly $500,000, will be the largest publicly disclosed exit pay package to have been awarded by an NSE-listed company.
Last June, Equity Bank, which is Kenya’s second largest bank by Market capitalization, announced that Munga had opted to retire as Chairman of the board of the bank after a 35-year stint. He will be replaced by the bank’s Vice Chairman, David Ansell.
One of Kenya’s most respected businessmen, Peter Munga, 76, is the founder of Equity Building Society, the microfinance bank that eventually became Equity Bank, one of East Africa’s largest financial institutions. He previously owned as much as 3.2% in the publicly traded company, but has since sold off most of his shares and now owns just about 0.4% of the bank – a stake currently valued at $5 million. Munga is also a major shareholder in East African insurer Britam Holdings and Equatorial Nut Processors. His Peter Munga Foundation works to reduce hunger and poverty in rural Kenya by promoting sustainable agriculture, development of local markets and encouragement of innovation and entrepreneurship, in order to increase food productivity, security and availability."

At the time, Poirier was less than a month removed from his 23rd birthday. Holloway had turned 20 two months before the meeting. The bout was the featured prelim and was broadcast on FX. Despite his age, Poirier had been fighting with the WEC and UFC since 2010. His record with those promotions was 4-1, while overall he stood at 11-1. Holloway made his UFC debut against Poirier. He replaced an injured Ricardo Lamas on the card. Holloway’s record stood at a perfect 4-0. When the odds closed for the matchup, Poirier was a -714 favorite over Holloway, who was a +325 underdog. The fight was contested at featherweight.
Early in the matchup, UFC commentator Joe Rogan remarked that he liked what he saw from the still-developing Holloway, complimenting him on his striking technique as well as his takedown defense. Unfortunately for Holloway, his takedown defense failed him two minutes into the contest.
Once the fight hit the mat, Poirier easily advanced to full mount. From there Poirier patiently looked for an opening, he found that opening and locked on a triangle armbar. The submission victory, which came at 3:23 of the first stanza, earned Poirier his first UFC fight-night bonus for “Submission of the Night.”
The two run back their 2012 bout tonight when they meet in the co-main event of UFC 236 pay-per-view card, which takes place at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The winner of the contest will be crowned the interim UFC lightweight champion.
Before that fight takes place, you can watch the first meeting between the two right here."

South African Mining Mogul Mzi Khumalo Puts Zimbabwean Gold Mines Under Business Rescue,www.forbes.com,Mfonobong Nsehe,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2019/04/13/south-african-mining-mogul-mzi-khumalo-puts-zimbabwean-gold-mines-under-business-rescue/,"Metallon Corporation, a gold mining group owned by Mzi Khumalo, one of South Africa’s most prominent mining entrepreneurs, has reportedly filed for business rescue for two of its subsidiaries, Goldfields of Mazowe Limited and Goldfields of Shamva Limited, in order to protect the companies’ assets from being seized by creditors. The Business rescue process, as established by the South African Companies Act 2008, provides a company experiencing financial distress with an opportunity to restructure its operational model and improve cash flow by offering a temporary suspension on legal actions or liquidation measures against the company, giving it an time to cut down its debt and produce the best outcomes for all the company’s stakeholders – creditors, employees and shareholders.
Both Goldfields of Mazowe Limited and Goldfields of Shamva Limited have struggled to remain afloat over the last two years in the face of a hostile Zimbabwean economy. Mining executives in Zimbabwe have recently complained about issues affecting their operations such as exchange rate disparities causing a mismatch between revenue and costs, as well as high-interest rates on the market making it challenging for mining companies to raise capital. Khumalo has struggled to raise $400 million in order to expand Metallon’s gold mines four-fold in order to scale and attain critical mass.
Metallon’s companies owe tens of millions of dollars to some of its service providers. In February, the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) took Metallon Corporation to court to compel the gold miner to settle a $9.3 million bill for power supplied to three of its mines. Last September, Metallon announced it was considering paying mining-equipment suppliers in gold because a cash shortage in Zimbabwe was hindering its plan to expand output. In the same month, Goldfields of Mazowe announced a plan to retrench hundreds of employees after the company was put under care and maintenance. Production at Metallon’s mines have since been halted in order to allow creditors to attach property and mining equipment. A representative for Metallon declined to respond to a request for comment.
Metallon is Zimbabwe's largest gold mining company, operating four gold mines throughout the country. The company, which is headquartered in London, was founded in 2002 when Mzi Khumalo acquired Lonmin's Zimbabwean gold assets for $15.5 million. Khumalo, 63, is one of South Africa’s most recognizable businessmen and a former anti-apartheid activist. Apart from Metallon, Khumalo owns extensive business interests in the financial services and infrastructure industries."

Three Great Growth Shares That Could Still Boom In April (Like This FTSE 100 Star),www.forbes.com,Royston Wild,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/roystonwild/2019/04/13/three-great-growth-shares-that-could-still-boom-in-april-like-this-ftse-100-star/,"In this article I am discussing three growth heroes whose share prices could rally in the latter half of the month. Bunzl
Bunzl is a beautiful blue chip that I myself hold in my stocks portfolio. For investors seeking reliable profits growth year after year -- and as a consequence steady dividend expansion, too -- it’s extremely hard to beat.
There’s three main reasons behind this. Number one is its diversified range of operations, Bunzl’s broad range of products and end markets allowing it to absorb problems in one or two industries and keep growing earnings. Next up is its strong exposure to robust US economy, a territory from which 60% of profits are currently sourced. And thirdly the Footsie company’s dedication to acquisition activity to build its position in key markets.
In February Bunzl advised that adjusted pre-tax profit rose again in 2018, on that occasion by 3% to push the annual total to £559m. First-quarter results are expected on Wednesday, April 17 and I’m expecting another positive update, one that could see City forecasts of a 2% bottom-line rise this year upgraded.
JD Sports Fashion
With full-year results slated for release on Tuesday, April 16 I reckon JD Sports Fashion is another stock whose market value could increase in the days ahead.
As both consumer and financial journalist the FTSE 250 firm is one which I adore. It’s at the cutting edge of the so-called athleisure market, thanks in no small part to the trove of exclusive ranges it sells from sportswear giants including Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse and the like.
But what makes JD Sports such a stunning growth share is its commitment to global expansion, a programme that’s taken it outside its traditional stomping grounds of Europe and into Asia and the US more recently. In fact, just last month the retailer boosted its operations in the UK with the £90.1m acquisition of rival Footasylum and it has the financial clout to keep the takeovers coming.
City brokers are expecting the retailer to report another double-digit-percentage earnings rise for the year to January 2019, and another chubby rise -- by 12% -- is predicted for the current fiscal period, too.
Flowtech Fluidpower
I reckon Flowtech Fluidpower is another great buy before its own full-year results are unpackaged on Tuesday, April 16.
Like Bunzl and JD Sports, a large part of the engineer’s appeal as a growth stock comes from its appetite for M&A action and its success in integrating acquisitions into the broader business. This was apparent in its January trading update in which it declared that revenues had increased 42% in 2018, a performance that the City expects to have pushed earnings 20% higher.
It’s no shock that the boffins are predicting that the bottom line will swell by an additional 11% in 2019, either. Flowtech advised at the top of the year that “fluid power market sentiment generally remains positive” and that its thus anticipating “a solid start” to the current year, as illustrated by order activity at its core Power Motion Control division.
Royston Wild owns shares in Bunzl."

Travel Falling in love with travel every day. Share to facebook Share to linkedin © Laura Manske Welcome to ""The Heart of Travel,"" a fun interview series that peeks behind the scenes of the hospitality world to shine a spotlight on accomplished pros who bring passion, polish and prowess to the gracious service of travelers. Such a shining star is Jamie Piedras, general manager of the new, luxurious, all-inclusive, 288-suite The Grand Reserve at Paradisus Palma Real located in vacation hotspot Dominican Republic , a Caribbeam island which wooed more than 6.5 million visitors in 2018 and is already set to break tourism records in 2019. Family-owned by Meliá Hotels International, Spain’s leading hotel company with more 380 properties in 40 countries, The Grand Reserve , which recently opened in December 2018 with 14 unique restaurants and bars, as well as state-of-the-art fitness and wellness amenities, is the third Paradisus getaway on this verdant, sun-sparkled island. Here, a warm conversation about what fuels Piedras' cool devotion and drive — with insightful takeaway tips. General manager Jaime Piedras. ©The Grand Reserve at Paradisus Palma Real
What first inspired your career in hospitality?
I am a general manager’s son, so I grew up in hotels. My hometown in Spain — Málaga on the Costa del Sol — is one of the most popular tourism areas of the world. I was born to be an hotelier.
So were you destined for this life?
I started in the hotel business as a bellboy when I was 17, so I am a young 'old school' general manager. At some point early on, I really fell in love with hotels as a way of living.
You earned an economics undergraduate degree from the University of Málaga and a hotel management degree from Cornell University in New York. Looking back, what was your best career advice while you were still a student?
First, to learn English well. Communication skills are really important in our business. Second, to master very strong financial knowledge. That’s why I majored in economics at university.
You’ve managed hotels all over the world — in Los Cabos, Mexico; Puerto Rico; Spain; Bali and Jakarta, Indonesia; and Shanghai, China. An impressive global romp! Travel is an incredible education. So what have you learned most about working with people from different places and backgrounds?
The most important one: Be tolerant. Do not prejudge any kind of behavior or action. For example, in Asia to laugh can be a sign of stress — not always a sign of joy or a joke. So you can imagine my first reaction when one of my employees started to laugh while I was asking about a mistake he had made. You learn to think twice before taking an action.
Opening a major hotel, what is your foremost emotion?
It’s an amazing feeling to lead the birth of a hotel. It gives one a whole new perspective. To run a hotel well as a general manager is the same feeling that an orchestra director has when the music starts — and it sounds perfect! You are the one leading the team, but you don’t play any instrument. You are in your team’s hands. It’s a very special feeling. The 288 suites, ranging from 800 to more than 3,000 square feet, include living and dining spaces, one or two bedrooms, independent soaking tubs and walk-in showers, as well as secluded balconies with hydro-massage pools. © Laura Manske
What gives you the most pleasure in this job?
To be part of such a great company. Meliá Hotels International is the most important hospitality company in Spain and one of the best in the resorts segment worldwide.
Life is full of surprises. What has been your most unexpected ""aha"" moment?
To realize that all successful hoteliers share the same hospitality passion! We also like to say you need to be a little bit crazy to join this business.
You are known for being a positive leader with an inspirational attitude and clear communication skills. Is there magic in your management philosophy?
I believe in teamwork. A hotel general manager is the coach , the one leading the team, but not the one playing the game. So a leader needs to inspire, train, push and help everyone on the team to do their best, to be part of their achievements and to be part of the failures, too. When you do everything for your team, then your team does the same for you.
How do you motivate and connect with your staff?
I oversee approximately 800 employees right now. It is important for me to be human and open-minded. It is essential to look them in their eyes and to smile when I am walking around the hotel, to show them honest respect . It helps a lot in terms of motivation.

Most Underpaid And Overpaid Players On The Utah Jazz,www.forbes.com,Andy Bailey,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andybailey/2019/04/13/most-underpaid-and-overpaid-players-on-the-utah-jazz/,"In the NBA, general managers wear plenty of hats. In a league with a salary cap, bargain hunter is an important one. And good teams often go hand in hand with GMs who are good at finding players who outperform their contracts Take Dennis Lindsey of the Utah Jazz, for example. His signings of Joe Ingles and Royce O'Neale were economic home runs. In his last season overseas, Ingles averaged six points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists in just 21.2 minutes. And there's a similar story with Royce O'Neale, who averaged 8.3 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists in his final pre-NBA season.
And now, both are outperforming the value of the NBA contracts they earned with those modest numbers, according to research from Forbes' Brett Knight .
In articles on the league's most overpaid and underpaid players, Knight explained his formula in detail. Head there for the breakdown. Here, in the interest of brevity, the process went like this:
Knight took three different catch-all metrics that estimate the number of wins a single player produces for his team, then found the average of the three for each player. He then estimated the cost of a win by dividing the players' share of basketball-related income (BRI) by the number of total regular season games. Next, Knight multiplied each individual player's wins estimate by the cost of a win to get expected salary. And finally, he subtracted each player's cap hit from their expected salary. The results for Jazz players, sorted from most underpaid to most overpaid, are found below:
Rudy Gobert
Wins Estimate Average: 17.7 Expected Salary: $52.6M Cap Figure: $23.5M Difference: $29.1M Not only is Rudy Gobert the biggest bargain on the Jazz, he's No. 2 on Knight 's league-wide list.
And it makes sense. Gobert isn't even on a max contract, but if you sort every player in the NBA by the average of their ranks in 10 catch-all metrics, he finished the season at No. 5. Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden, Paul George and Nikola Jokic were the only players ahead of him.
Royce O'Neale
Wins Estimate Average: 3.6 Expected Salary: $10.7M Cap Figure: $1.4M Difference: $9.3M O'Neale going from little-known role player at both Baylor and overseas, to role player for a 50-win NBA team is remarkable. And again, Lindsey seeing enough in him to the roll the dice is a credit to one of the league's best executives.
This season, O'Neale shot 38.6% from three. And Utah allowed nearly two fewer points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor, according to Cleaning the Glass . Talk about 3-and-D.
Joe Ingles
Wins Estimate Average: 7.4 Expected Salary: $22M Cap Figure: $13M Difference: $9M Coming off a late cut at the hands of the Los Angeles Clippers during 2014 training camps, the Jazz picked up a player who would go on to be one of the organization's most beloved.
After just five seasons, Ingles is already third in franchise history in threes made. He's just 20 behind second-place Gordon Hayward. And shooting might not even be Ingles' best skill.
His defense and playmaking have been critical over the last five seasons as well.
Derrick Favors
Wins Estimate Average: 8.7 Expected Salary: $25.7M Cap Figure: $16.9M Difference: $8.8M When Utah re-signed Derrick Favors in the 2018 offseason, there was some rumblings that his $16.9 million salary was a bit of an overpay for a starting forward who's primary role is backing up Rudy Gobert.
After arguably the best individual season of Favors' career, it's become clear those rumblings were without merit. He posted career highs in Box Plus-Minus, Win Shares per 48 Minutes and True Shooting Percentage.
And Utah's X-factor heading into the postseason might be the Favors-Ingles bench lineups. In the 925 possessions Ingles and Favors played together with the rest of the starters out, Utah was plus-17.2 points per 100 possessions (99th percentile), according to Cleaning the Glass .
Donovan Mitchell
Wins Estimate Average: 3.6 Expected Salary: $10.6M Cap Figure: $3.1M Difference: $7.5M This one is sort of a given. Given the league's rookie scale contracts, there are plenty of players in the first four years of their careers who are technically underpaid. The real test will be whether Donovan Mitchell can improve enough over the next two seasons to stay a bargain.
Right now, his ""expected salary"" is just under $11 million, and the yearly salary on his second deal will almost certainly be far higher than that.
Georges Niang
Wins Estimate Average: 0.7 Expected Salary: $2.1M Cap Figure: $1.5M Difference: $0.6M Georges Niang could find himself following in the footsteps of O'Neale and Ingles.
He was the 50th overall pick in 2016. And over his first two seasons, 125 minutes and had a .308 True Shooting Percentage. This season, his first full campaign with the Jazz, he played 516 minutes and had a .613 True Shooting Percentage.
Jae Crowder
Wins Estimate Average: 2.6 Expected Salary: $7.8M Cap Figure: $7.3M Difference: $0.5M Jae Crowder's play just about matches his contract. But the estimate of the number of wins he's provided is based on box-score numbers. And his value probably goes beyond those.
When Crowder is on the floor, defenses aren't as able to pack the paint as they do when Favors is out there. And the switchability on defense is huge.
Hence, another season in which the Gobert/Crowder frontcourt thrived. In 2,832 possessions, the Jazz were plus-8.2 points per 100 possessions (91st percentile) with that duo in the game, according to Cleaning the Glass .
Thabo Sefolosha
Wins Estimate Average: 1.3 Expected Salary: $3.9M Cap Figure: $5.3M Difference: $(1.4M) Lack of minutes due to various injuries impacted the calculations on Thabo Sefolosha. But availability is certainly a factor when calculating the economic value a player brings.
When he was healthy, though, Sefolosha was plenty helpful. He had a .599 True Shooting Percentage and hit two threes per 75 team possessions.
Utah's Net Rating (team's net points per 100 possessions when a given player is on the floor) was 11.6 points better (96th percentile) when Sefolosha was on the floor, according to Cleaning the Glass .
Kyle Korver
Wins Estimate Average: 1.6 Expected Salary: $4.7M Cap Figure: $7.6M Difference: $(2.9M) In his age-37 season, Korver is still doing what he's always done best. He averaged 3.8 threes per 75 team possessions and shot 39.7% from three. He just didn't provide a ton beyond that. And he was often a negative on defense.
Ricky Rubio
Wins Estimate Average: 3.2 Expected Salary: $9.4M Cap Figure: $15M Difference: $(5.6M) Ricky Rubio's inability to shoot is just difficult to overcome. Among the 345 players in NBA history with at least as many career three-point attempts as Rubio (1,283), he's 345th in career Effective Field Goal Percentage, according to Basketball Reference .
Dante Exum
Wins Estimate Average: 0.3 Expected Salary: $1M Cap Figure: $9.6M Difference: $(8.6M) Other than a one-month stretch immediately preceding an ankle injury that derailed his season, Dante Exum had another difficult year as an NBA player.
In that stretch from December 4 to January 5, Exum averaged 18.5 points, 8.1 assists and 1.1 threes per 75 possessions, with a .603 True Shooting Percentage.
The rest of the season was, well, a struggle. And that includes both injuries and an inability to sustain solid play when he was healthy."
"Client Appreciation Event Best Practices: Be Unique, Have Substance, Connect People",www.forbes.com,Bill Conerly,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2019/04/13/client-appreciation-event-best-practices-be-unique-have-substance-connect-people/,"Many companies selling to other businesses hold client appreciation events. Some call it an advisory council and solicit advice from the clients. The old standard was to do a little bit of business talk, then adjourn to the golf course. Spouses would go do a feminine activity. Today people are busy, in highly competitive industries. They do want to get away from day-to-day operations, but they want substance as well. And many of the business leaders are women, whose husbands don’t want to go on a garden tour with the wives.
To better understand these changes, I posed the question in a LinkedIn post: What’s Best for Client Appreciation Events? Some comments are posted online, some were given to me privately.
The most common response was to make it memorable. Sales consultant John Lee : When people are talking about the event ten years from now, will they say “Do you remember when …?” One commenter, Scott Crabtree , brought his brain science background to bear, saying that similar activities get merged into one memory. So your golf outing may get blended in with your competitor’s golf day.
To make the event unique, marketing guru Cathey Armillas suggests getting people into spaces they don’t usually get to. Maybe rent out a skating rink or have the group walk across a significant bridge to get to lunch. Personally, I love factory tours. At one client event where I was speaking, I arrived a day early to meet with staff members and get a factory tour. I think the clients would have loved the factory tour, too. When my wife talks about the business trips that she has accompanied me to, she says, “Oh, that was the wheat mill.” Or “I remember that plastics factory.” (However, the brewpubs all seem to blend together.)
The second common thread among the comments was to have substance. The head of the speakers bureau No More Boring Meetings suggested new business skills outside their usual area of expertise. For example, IT managers might get more value from how to motivate employees than another lecture on cyber security. One commenter suggested discussing a hot industry topic. I have spoken at client meetings where another presenter’s topic seemed to be out of left field—but engaged the participants and prepared them for the future.
The final theme of contributors—before I get to my own issue—is connection. Environmental consultant Debbie Kinsinger writes “Never enough time to meet people.” That’s a value of recreation activities. So maybe the purpose of the golf afternoon isn’t golf, but camaraderie. Others also noted that value. Give some thought to recreation that provides a unique experience and that also brings people into conversation with one another.
Another way to achieve connection is with discussions that involve group activities. Many professional speakers can provide their content in workshop format, where some knowledge is described, then the clients themselves address a challenge. The last client meeting I attended had a good discussion of employee retention. At another one, participants worked through elements of a recession contingency plan. People learned from each other, with the structure of an expert guiding the discussion.
And don’t forget the cocktail reception and the people who linger at the dinner table over another bottle of wine. After the event, these people will feel comfortable calling each other to discuss issues. “Sally, this is Bill. We had dinner together at the XYZ Company retreat. Can you tell me if you’ve had a problem like this?” When that happens, the value of the client retreat is reinforced, with the host company’s brand enhanced.
My own slant adds to those threads with a valuable technique: ask your clients for advice. I recently heard a sales person at such an event ask a client, “What’s a good turnaround time for you?” The humorous reply is “Yesterday,” but the substantive conversation helped both parties understand the issues that the other side had. Asking good questions builds a relationship better than giving answers. When the client provides genuine counsel, not only does the company benefit, but the client feels more invested in the relationship. In the non-profit world, fund-raising professionals say “Ask for money and you get advice; ask for advice and you get money.” So ask your clients how you can improve your company’s performance, and you’ll get more sales.
Based on these insights, the checklist for an event is:
Make it unique Have valuable content that’s different Connect people with one another Ask your clients for advice Get started planning your next client appreciation event. Good events take longer to plan than you might think."

"Led By Milwaukee Bucks, Golden State Warriors, NBA Scoring Is At Highest Level In 48 Years",www.forbes.com,Tim Casey,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timcasey/2019/04/13/led-by-milwaukee-bucks-golden-state-warriors-nba-scoring-is-at-highest-level-in-48-years/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Milwaukee Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo shoots a free throw during the second half of an NBA basketball game against the Atlanta Hawks Sunday, April 7, 2019, in Milwaukee. (AP Photo/Aaron Gash) ASSOCIATED PRESS Mike Budenholzer’s professional future was in limbo last April. He had just completed his fifth season as the Atlanta Hawks’ coach, which was, by far, the most trying of his tenure.
The Hawks had won 24 games, the fewest in the NBA’s Eastern Conference, quite the fall for a franchise that had won a conference-best 60 games only three years earlier.
Although Budenholzer had two years remaining on his contract, the Hawks granted him permission to seek employment elsewhere. He interviewed with the Phoenix Suns , New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors, but he pulled his name out of consideration or didn’t get an offer for any of those jobs.
Finally, in mid-May, Budenholzer was named coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, which had lost in the first round of the playoffs. Now, Budenholzer couldn’t be in a better or more secure position.
Tomorrow night, the Bucks (60-22) open the postseason against the Detroit Pistons as the conference’s top seed. They finished the regular season with the NBA’s best record and have the second-best odds (+650) to win the title behind the heavy favorite and two-time reigning champions Golden State Warriors (-225), according to Bovada Sportsbook in Las Vegas.
No matter how the postseason shakes out, expect exciting, high-scoring games. The Bucks (118.1 points per game) and Warriors (117.7) are the league’s two highest-scoring teams and are leading an offensive revolution not seen in almost five decades.
During the regular season, NBA franchises averaged 111.2 points per game, nearly five points more than last season and the highest since the 1970-71 season. The 52.4% effective field goal percentage was the highest in league history. And the 110.4 offensive rating, which is an estimate of the points scored per 100 possessions, was the highest since that statistic was first tracked in 1973-74.
The Warriors’ offensive numbers aren’t surprising at all considering they have three of the NBA’s top 20 scorers in guard Stephen Curry (sixth with 27.3 points per game), forward Kevin Durant (ninth with 26 points) and guard Klay Thompson (20 th with 21.5 points).
Before this season, the Warriors had led the NBA in scoring for four consecutive seasons. They have been among the top three teams in offensive rating for the past five seasons, including a league-best 115.9 this year.
The Bucks, on the other hand, were not known for their offensive prowess in recent years. In fact, they ranked between 15 th and 28 th in points per game in the five seasons before Budenholzer arrived.
Milwaukee is now flourishing under Budenholzer, who has implemented an up-tempo style and greatly improved its defense. The Bucks average 103.3 possessions per 48 minutes, second in the league behind the Hawks (103.9). They lead the NBA with an 8.6 net rating, which estimates the point differential per 100 possessions.
Budenholzer has been even more impressive on the defensive end. The Bucks’ 105.2 defensive rating is the best in the NBA. They were 19 th a year ago in that statistic.
Budenholzer has no doubt been helped by the continued maturation of 6-foot-11 forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, arguably the NBA’s best player. Antetokounmpo, 24, who is averaging 27.7 points, 12.5 points and 5.9 assists per game, is the co-favorite along with Houston Rockets guard James Harden to win the Most Valuable Player award.
Still, other than adding center Brook Lopez, Milwaukee’s roster is basically the same as it was last season. But one year later, things couldn’t be much more different for Budenholzer or his new team, which hasn’t won a playoff series since advancing to the Eastern Conference finals in 2001.
The Bucks are expected to snap that streak this year and should have no problem with No. 8 seed Detroit (41-41), yet their next matchups will be much tougher. They will likely face the No. 4 seed Boston Celtics in the second round and No. 2 seed Toronto Raptors or No. 3 seed Philadelphia 76ers in the conference finals if they advance that far. And then, if all goes as planned, they will make the NBA Finals for the first time since 1974. It’s a scenario that was hard to believe 12 months ago, but the marriage between Budenholzer and the Bucks has worked better than anyone could’ve imagined.

"With Joel Embiid Unlikely To Play, Sixers Will Turn To Other Options Vs. Nets",www.forbes.com,Gordie Jones,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordiejones/2019/04/13/with-joel-embiid-unlikely-to-play-sixers-will-turn-to-other-options-vs-nets/,"Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin

Getty Joel Embiid is listed as doubtful for the 76ers’ playoff opener against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday because of a sore left knee, and some creativity is in order.
That likely means some Mike Scott at center for the Sixers. It could very well mean meaningful action for rookie Zhaire Smith -- especially given the fact that James Ennis , one of the team’s top wing subs, will sit out with a strained quad.
The Nets are a small-ball centered, and while they only faced the current iteration of the Sixers once this season (a 123-110 Philadelphia victory on March 28), they did give them some problems in splitting four meetings. Backup guard Spencer Dinwiddie scored a career-high 39 points in a 127-124 Brooklyn victory on Dec. 12, and D’Angelo Russell notched 38 when the teams squared off on Nov. 25, a game the Sixers won, 127-125, on Jimmy Butler ’s 3-pointer at the buzzer.
It would not be surprising to see more freewheeling, high-scoring affairs in this series. The Nets like to spread the floor, run a bunch of pick-and-rolls, shoot a ton of 3-pointers. That means Russell attacking downhill, probing the defense, getting what he can get. And it puts a sizable defensive onus on the two guys most likely to see the minutes at center, should Embiid in fact sit out -- Boban Marjanovic and newly acquired Greg Monroe . (The team’s other alternative at that position, Jonah Bolden , is listed as questionable with a bad knee.)
Neither Marjanovic nor Monroe is known for his defense, and in the teams’ last meeting the Nets showed they are perfectly willing to play without a center, as Rondae Hollis-Jefferson , a small forward by trade, manned the middle most of the second half -- and that was in a game Embiid played (and excelled, collected 39 points and 13 rebounds; he averaged 30.5 and 14.3 against the Nets this season).
Enter the 6-8 Scott, then. Acquired in the Feb. 6 trade with the Clippers that also brought Tobias Harris to the Sixers, he has seen some time at center this year, in addition to his regular appearances at forward. Now, however, his presence would appear to be of particular value, given his footspeed and, at the other end, his shooting. He has averaged just under eight points a game while knocking down 41.2 percent of his attempts from the arc (a better clip than he has managed in any full season in his nine-year career), mostly off the bench. He had three starts among 27 appearances with Philadelphia, and averaged 24 minutes a night.
Given the Nets' Lilliputian nature, it would not at all be a shock to see Scott in the closing lineup. One word of caution: The quintet of Scott, Harris, Ben Simmons , Jimmy Butler and J.J. Redick was not one of the Sixers’ stronger units , as it outscored opponents by just 0.8 of a points. (It was, in fact, not even the best lineup Scott was a part of. Three others were better, and he proved to be most effective when used alongside Harris, Butler, Marjanovic and T.J. McConnell ; that unit only outscored opponents by an average of 2.3 points.)
As for Smith, his season consisted of six games, after he suffered a foot injury last summer and then was beset by an allergic reaction that almost killed him . There have of late been some glimpses as to why the Sixers parted with Mikal Bridges in a trade for Smith during the draft last June. He scored 17 points in Wednesday’s season finale against Chicago, and shows a willingness to guard, something that will be needed against the Nets.
Coach Brett Brown has told reporters that his rotation would consist of 8.5 players in the playoffs, meaning that when healthy he would use Scott, Ennis, Marjanovic and McConnell behind his starters. That's not possible now, and Smith would appear to be a viable alternative -- especially given the fact that Brown has shown little confidence lately in Jonathon Simmons .
Again, the situation requires some creativity, some massaging. Survive and advance remains the most popular mantra, this time of year.

Banks and Balyey's shocking loss to The IIconics at WrestleMania 35, marking yet another brief title reign for Banks (who held the NXT Women's Championship for 192 days), was reportedly the final straw as Banks is currently out of the country , pondering her future.
April 18, 2016 —On an episode of "" Busted Open, "" Sasha Banks vowed that she would never appear on WWE offshoot Total Divas.
""There’s always gonna [sic] be, so to say, Divas. And I’m in a category of wrestlers,"" said Banks.
""It’s not for me. I won’t ever be on that show. Saying it out there for a fact. But it’s fine. People like it. People watch it. So let them enjoy it.""
September 1, 2017 —Sasha Banks appeared on "" The Sam Roberts Wrestling Podcast ,"" and admitted to preferring NXT over Raw. Said Banks:
I think that's what's different about NXT too. We kind of always knew where we were going, so it helped me prepare and think of ahead of time, like, 'how can I make this better?'. But when I go to RAW, it's legit, like, 'I have no clue what I'm doing.' I don't even know what to prepare for. I'm just, like, handed something or told something. And I was like, 'okay, I have one hour to get ready. Oh, okay. Alright. Let's just do it!'
Banks continued to air her frustrations with her standing in WWE, criticizing her own short title reigns, which is the same issue that has reportedly caused her latest bout of disgruntlement.
""I'll be honest about something. I'm a three-time RAW Women's Champion, right, which is awesome,"" said Banks.
""Within a whole year, I'm a three-time Women's Champion, which, to me, is a lot. I am a three-time two-week holder of a championship, so that took away my confidence so much.""
September 13, 2017— On an episode of "" Her Take ,"" Sasha Banks doubled down on her preference of NXT to Raw, saying "" [NXT's] always home for me and I feel like that's really where I made a name for myself.""
June 27, 2018 —On the "" In this Corner "" podcast, Sasha Banks said the following about being underutilized in WWE:
I feel like I go out there every single week and give it 110-percent. Most recently, I talked to one of my good friends, Mark Sherman, and he told me ‘as long as you work hard, you can’t be unhappy with yourself’ and that’s what I do every single week. Whether they want to push me or not, I’m always going to give it 110-percent. I’m honestly living my dream every single day, so there’s not a lot that I can be mad at.
August 23, 2018 —On an episode of the currently dormant "" Open Late ,"" Sasha Banks addressed legitimate heat with fellow WWE Superstar Alexa Bliss. When asked if she had any desire to work with Bliss in the future, Banks plainly responded: ""not really."" Sasha Banks very well could be on her way out of WWE. Credit: WWE.com
January 19, 2019— Scott Dawson of eternally disgruntled tag team The Revival—whose recent stunts include reportedly asking for their release , criticizing the Raw Tag Team Championships and going out of their way to pose with a fan wearing an AEW t-shirt —tweeted ""don't matter where we go, we're stealing the show.""
The tweet came in the midst of aforementioned speculation that the duo had requested its release. Banks replied to the tweet, saying ""take me with you."" The tweet sparked its own wave of added speculation on Banks' future with WWE. Don’t matter where we go, we’re stealing the show. #FTR https://t.co/M4br9lIVEI

April 8, 2019— After no-showing an appearance on ""The Wendy Williams Show"" due to personal reasons, Sasha Banks posted a lengthy, cryptic quote on Twitter that appeared to speak to her growing frustrations on the WWE roster.

The Masters: Record Weekend Field is Top-Loaded With Major Winners,www.forbes.com,Mike Dojc,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikedojc/2019/04/13/the-masters-record-weekend-field-is-top-loaded-with-major-winners/,"The cut line at the Masters didn’t quite cut to the quick. It was more like a haircut where the barber was instructed to take just a little bit off the top. The field for moving day is a Masters record 65-players strong with 22 golfers sitting pretty within four shots of the lead. How did this happen? The current rules call for the top 50 players after two rounds of play to make the Masters cut along with any additional players within ten strokes of the lead. Adam Scott’s birdie on Fire Thorn, the par-five 15 th , briefly lifted the Aussie to -8 spelling doom for a large group of players sitting at three-over par. But Zach Johnson, Martin Kaymer, and the seven other lucky duckies in that surviving cohort should be sending Scott a thank you card for putting way too much mustard on a three-foot par putt on sixteen that he blew past the hole to keep them in the hunt. While the culling of the herd was kinder than usual, there were 22 players sent packing. Notables who’ve exited the tournament are Paul Casey, Justin Rose, and Sergio Garcia.
Pacing the Pack
Deadlocked at seven under are five major winners in Adam Scott (2013 Masters), Brooks Koepka (2017 and 2018 U.S. Open, 2018 PGA Championship), Jason Day (2015 PGA Championship), Francesco Molinari (2018 Open), and Louis Oosthuizen (2010 Open).
Just one shot back of the leaders is Tiger Woods, the fourteen major marvel who can chew gum and make drop dead gorgeous birdies like nobody’s business. Over the years at Augusta National Woods has dazzled patrons with more than a few “Oh-My-Goodness… Oh Wow” moments of golfing genius that tend to rouse the senses of even long dormant fans. Legions come out of the woodwork and onto the edge of the couch to witness the continued heroics of the greatest player of the modern era.
""I feel like I played my own way back into the tournament,"" Woods said after yesterday’s round. ""I was just very patient today, felt very good to be out there doing what I was doing. This is now three straight majors that I've been in the mix and so it's good stuff.""
Two birdies in a row places Tiger Woods at six under par, one off the lead. #themasters pic.twitter.com/uJ5oICPr34
— Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 12, 2019
Tied with Tiger at -6 is big hitting, perennial fave Dustin Johnson (2016 U.S Open champ) and Xander Schauffele, a four-time PGA Tour winner currently sitting in third in the FedEx Cup standings. The Cali native carded a 65, the lowest round on Friday.
If those were the only big names in contention golf fans would still be in a tizzy but there’s just so many more. Also lurking in striking distance on the leaderboard are Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm who are both two back and Phil Mickelson is three back, a 36-hole distance he’s made up in previous green jacket runs. Among the group tied at -3, four shots back of the leaders, you’ve got the likes of Justin Thomas Rickie Fowler, and Bryson DeChambeau.
The leaderboard is so stacked, it's like an IHOP on a Saturday morning. You really couldn’t ask for a better scenario for moving day at the Masters."
"'Game Of Thrones' Fans, Maybe There Is Hope For 'Winds Of Winter' After All",www.forbes.com,Erik Kain,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/04/13/game-of-thrones-fans-maybe-there-is-hope-for-winds-of-winter-after-all/,"I'm beginning to feel a bit like Fox Mulder from The X-Files when it comes to George R.R. Martin's A Song Of Ice And Fire novels. ""I want to believe,"" was Mulder's battle cry when it came to all things supernatural. His partner, Dana Scully, was the resident skeptic. ""Show me scientific evidence,"" was more her style.
And I guess I'm a bit of both Mulder and Scully when it comes to the Game of Thrones author and his next book, The Winds Of Winter. I want to believe that Martin will finish the novel and that it will be a great read, and that he'll quickly move on to the next one and I'll be reading it before I'm old and grey.
I want to believe.
Credit: Fox Then again, the last book, A Dance With Dragons, came out on my 8-year-old son's first birthday. We're lacking any hard evidence that Winds of Winter is anywhere near completion. I remember writing reviews for Game of Thrones back in Season 7 (2017) and mentioning how maybe the novel would release in 2018.
Now we know, for a fact, that it will not release before HBO's television adaptation wraps. We will get the fake TV ending long before we ever get Martin's true ending—if, indeed, that ever happens.
But there is hope. Speaking with Entertainment Tonight at the NYC World Premiere of Game Of Thrones eighth season, Martin said that his writing has ""been going very well lately, so knock wood."" (Knock on wood?)
He also noted that ""It'll be done when it's done"" which is less exciting, but it's good to hear that the writing is going ""very well lately"" rather than ""not at all lately because of myriad other projects, football, etc.""
It's certainly a step up from statements such as : ""I’ve had dark nights of the soul where I’ve pounded my head against the keyboard and said, ‘God, will I ever finish this?’ The show is going further and further forward and I’m falling further and further behind. What the hell is happening here?”
I suppose the Mulder on my right shoulder wants to believe that this is good news, a good omen, signs that the impossible might be possible, that real progress is being made—while the Scully on my left shoulder is shaking her head in disapproval. This is not evidence of anything! Want to believe all you like, but until there's a manuscript on the publisher's doorstep this is just another flying saucer sighting.
I don't know. Evidence be damned—I want to believe.
Season 8 of Game of Thrones returns this Sunday on HBO. I'll be reviewing each Sunday after the episode airs."
"Taylor Swift Has Announced When New Music Is Coming... At Least, It Seems Like She Has",www.forbes.com,Hugh McIntyre,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/04/13/taylor-swift-has-announced-when-new-music-is-coming-at-least-it-seems-like-she-has/,"While her last release isn’t too far in the rearview mirror, fans are still eager to hear more from Taylor Swift, who remains perhaps the biggest pop star on the planet. While the ""Look What You Made Me Do"" chart owner is typically fairly mum on when new tunes will arrive, she’s just given everyone a reason to celebrate...or at least know when they can celebrate. The country-turned-pop singer excited millions of fans all around the world by making some big, and very important, changes on social media, all of which seem to suggest new music is approaching quickly. Swift posted a simple countdown clock on both her Instagram story and her website early Saturday (April 13) morning, setting it to wind down 13 days from now.
13 days from today is April 26, a date that also now appears in both her Instagram and Twitter bios (and nothing else). As if both of those clues weren’t enough to tell fans that something big is on the way, Swift also changed her profile pictures and the background on her official website to a graphic of pink clouds floating on a turquoise sky. Fans have been noting an aesthetic shift in her Instagram posts for some time now, as her uploads have become dreamier and dreamier, which seems to suggest the beginning of a new era.
While Swift hasn’t come out and properly announced she’ll release something (a song, or perhaps an entire album?) on April 26, it seems fairly obvious at this point that fans will be able to listen to something that Friday (another clue, as new music is dropped on Fridays, the beginning of Billboard ’s tracking week). If she doesn’t drop a piece of music on that date, fans are sure to be disappointed.
The 10-time Grammy winner released her last album Reputation in November 2017, and it was massively successful upon arrival. The campaign followed its predecessor, 1989 , which saw her finally shift from country music (or, some form of it) to proper pop. The superstar released one last single from Reputation , “Getaway Car,” in September 2018, though as it was the seventh cut to get the treatment, it didn’t make much of an impact. Throughout last year, Swift was busy touring, as well as preparing for and filming the movie adaptation of the musical Cats , which is slated to be released at the end of 2019.

Weather Will Impact Two Iconic Sporting Events - The Masters And Boston Marathon,www.forbes.com,Marshall Shepherd,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2019/04/13/weather-will-impact-two-iconic-sporting-events-the-masters-and-boston-marathon/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Within the past week, a college friend and a colleague at the University of Georgia asked me about the weather forecast for the Boston Marathon . The race is scheduled for Monday April 15th. Unfortunately, there looks to be some pretty wet and windy conditions. Meanwhile, the Masters golf tournament is in full swing in Augusta, Georgia. Many of the top names in golf are near the top of the leader board including Tiger Woods. While interest is certainly high in this signature golf tournament, the chance for rain and even thunderstorms this weekend is also. Here are the latests updates on the weather for both of these iconic sporting events. Severe weather outlook for Sunday NOAA/SPC
The Masters is happening as I write this so perhaps that is a good place to start. Round 3 on Saturday is likely to start without major weather problems, but the afternoon could prevent a few challenges. There is a 50% chance of rain showers and thunderstorms after 11 am. This is a good chance to remind you that 50% is not some coin flip estimation. According to the National Weather Service (NWS) Peachtree City website:
The ""Probability of Precipitation"" (PoP) describes the chance of precipitation occurring at any point you select in the area. PoP = C x A where ""C"" = the confidence that precipitation will occur somewhere in the forecast area, and where ""A"" = the percent of the area that will receive measureable precipitation, if it occurs at all.
The 50% value could be arrived at in multiple ways. The forecaster could be 100% confident that 50% of the forecast area around Augusta, Georgia will see rain. However, the forecaster could be 50% confident that 100% of the area is going to see rain. That is still a 50% chance of rain. ""Percent Chance of Rain"" is one of the most misunderstood elements of a weather messaging and why many in the public misunderstand forecast accuracy.
The culprit for the rain chances Saturday is related to a moist, unstable air mass, a weak boundary, and air temperatures reaching the middle 80 degree range. However, as a meteorologist, I am particularly concerned about Sunday. Sunday is typically the final round and brings high drama at the Masters. The official NWS forecast for Sunday calls for an 80% chance of precipitation (showers and thunderstorms) mainly after 3 pm. Some of these storms could be severe: The NWS forecast discussion warns:
This will bring a line of showers and thunderstorms through the area before noon. These storms should not be severe, but cannot rule out some stronger storms with gusty winds. A line of convection ahead of the approaching cold front will move in during the late afternoon, and cross the region during the evening.
NOAA's Storm Prediction Center has an Enhanced/Slight risk (see graphic above) for this period, and damaging winds, hail, and a few isolated tornadoes are possible. Later in the evening, another line of storms associated with the actual frontal passage is possible. Unlike the afternoon storms, the instability will be limited because of lack of daytime heating. Officials at the Masters will certainly have to be diligent (and perhaps proactive) about the potential storms in the afternoon on Sunday.
Up in Boston, officials are already being proactive because of the expected weather. According to a report on the WCVB5 ABC website,
Because of that forecast, runners assigned to the fourth wave will start their race immediately after those in the third wave. Originally, a 25 minute gap was scheduled between those two waves.Under the new plan, Wave 3 will start at 10:50 a.m. and Wave 4 will follow immediately afterward.
Organizers are trying to reduce the waiting time for runners as rainfall and windy conditions are expected. There will also be additional medical capacity and resources on hand. The National Weather Service in Boston is calling for a 90% chance of rain on Monday and some of it could be very heavy. In the morning, there may even be patchy fog. The rain is going to be a problem for runners, but there will also be winds blowing at 11 to 14 mph and with gusts to 28 mph. Forecasters are not ruling out the chance for a thunderstorm also. The culprit for this weather is a potent low pressure system (below) that is currently making its way out of the Plains and into the Northeast by Monday. Parts of the southern United States will need to be on high alert for tornadic storms on Saturday because of this same storm system. This is also the same system that could affect the Masters. A low pressure system will be situated in the Northeast by Monday morning. This is from the U.S. GFS forecast model for that time period. NOAA/Tropical Tidbits

Financial Education: Revisited,www.forbes.com,Jodie Cook,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2018/05/16/financial-education/,"A third of millennials will never own their own home , personal debt continues to rise and the social pressure to consume has never been so intertwined in the fabric of our existence. Financial education became a statutory requirement of the British national curriculum for secondary schools in 2014 , but what it means to the next generation is more than learning how much change to expect from £5 if you buy two apples and an orange. Financial education, or ‘financial literacy’ is not just about pocket money and saving, or even income and outgoings. It is important that it’s much more than a maths lesson with a currency symbol.
Financial education can be defined in many ways and what makes someone have a good understanding or a bad understanding is completely subjective. Furthermore, people’s understanding of the way money works in the real world or what constitutes good money sense differs dramatically.
There are as many different models of financial education as there are people. While Robert Kiyosaki’s best-selling book, Rich Dad Poor Dad , tells you that building a property portfolio to create passive income is the way to go, a careers advisor suggests climbing the corporate ladder so your six figure salary can pay for the house, car and family of your dreams. A money saving magazine might discuss clipping coupons for your groceries and the benefits of ISAs, while an independent financial advisor advises you buy a commercial property for your pension fund and a digital nomad tells you to secure contracts that cover your flights and AirBnBs so you can see the world. Suddenly, the assumptions we have been making (and teaching) for years come into question. Is it right to get a mortgage? Is it right to save? Who is right? Is anyone right? Which should we teach kids about?
Deepak Taylor, a Dragon’s Den contestant, wrote a book, How To Live For Free , to address the problem of people not having enough time or money. It quickly shot up Amazon’s bestselling list and Taylor’s website, latestfreestuff.co.uk , updates offers every day. Is this money sense? Should we all be trying to live for free?
In Tim Ferriss’ book, 4 Hour Work Week , he talks of the new rich , described as those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the new rich: time and mobility. This is an art and a science he refers to as lifestyle design. It alludes to the fact that not everyone wants to work longer hours for more money, hinting that the concept of financial success means different things to different people, as does financial security.
Many of the teachings from modern influencers in financial education address money in relation to value, not time. The literature teaches how you can create something of value, or spot a gap in the market, not how can you sell your time.
Individuals’ attitude towards money is equally, if not more, important than understanding the pounds and pence of it all. What any individual is comfortable with is entirely dependant on their upbringing, current situation and future aspirations, as well as the role models they have around them and what they do. But we can’t expect to know the risk profile of a primary school student, can we?
To further complicate the issue, financial understanding will differ wildly between generations. Concepts such as property crashes, cryptocurrency and angel investing, to name a few, mean that each generation’s experience of how (not) to make and spend money comes from a different foundation. Compare the baby boomers of today with the 8-year-old children in school. The huge growth of the gig economy and the prevalence of freelancing as an occupation [ source ] will mean that these kids will more than likely never be paid the same amount at the same time each month. They might never experience a salary. So is dispensing pocket money on a monthly basis conditioning children to expect a salary, and is this out-dated? Should we discuss salaries as the only option of being paid for working, or do we tell kids about freelancing and the pros and cons of contract work?
Financial education is important, but seeing as it is constantly evolving, enterprise education must be the foundation of learning how money and business works.
Put simply, each area of finance relies on someone being enterprising before entering into it, including a full time, salaried job. An enterprising person will ask questions. They will do their research before committing, not get involved in scams, know how to spot a pyramid scheme, be ‘streetwise’ with money and financial decisions. They’ll be able to work out when something is too good to be true.
This is especially important when many of the role models children have are YouTube vloggers or Instagram influencers. Recently, Insider Magazine tweeted “7 websites that will pay you to do absolutely nothing” [ source ] to their 211k followers. Social media leads to the type of clickbait content that means you could easily be fooled by as an adult, never mind a school pupil.
Vloggers, influencers and passive income aside, the old systems of salary in, expenses out, just don’t match up to the reality we now face, and certainly not the reality our current school kids will face. What will money in the future even look like? Will we have a universal basic income one day?
It is the missing piece in the puzzle that money needs to be earned before one decides how to spend it, save it or invest it. Therefore, there is a strong case for careers and enterprise education to hold far greater kudos than financial education and it should be crystal clear that the two are not the same thing.
Enterprise education transcends culture, opinions and language barriers, and is transferrable to any financial model the country or the individual subscribes to. Thus it’s a sustainable way to ensure the schoolchildren of today can handle and adapt to anything the future throws at them."

It’s only been a day since BTS returned with their new single “Boy With Luv,” but they have already made history with the track…and the group is likely just getting started.
On Friday, April 12, t he K-pop superstars uploaded the official music video for their new single “Boy With Luv,” which features American pop singer Halsey, onto YouTube, and in just a day, it has set a new record for the most plays on the platform in just 24 hours. While the Google-owned video hosting site hasn’t shared an exact number of plays the clip received in just 24 hours, the visual easily blew past the previous best showing.
Just a few hours after it passed the 24 hour-mark, “Boy With Luv” had already earned 78 million plays on YouTube alone, according to Variety . That astounding number easily passes fellow K-pop outfit Blackpink’s “Kill This Love,” which set a new high point with just under 57 million plays in just its first full day on YouTube. That record was set this month as well, showing how powerful K-pop remains on the site.
While that 78 million figure likely incorporates views racked up after the first 24 hours had passed (though only a few), it’s easy to see that “Boy With Luv” broke the record, and that it wasn’t even close.
“Boy With Luv” serves as the lead single taken from BTS’ new album Map of the Soul: Persona , which was released in full on Friday at the same time the song and video were pushed. The visual will likely set more records as the days progress, and all those views on YouTube, when combined with perhaps equally-as-impressive streams on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, as well as predictably strong sales, should be enough to make the Halsey collaboration a serious global smash when the charts refresh in about a week.

These Airline Quality Secrets Will Make Your Next Flight Better,www.forbes.com,Christopher Elliott,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2019/04/13/these-airline-quality-secrets-will-make-your-next-flight-better/,"

Erin Bowen explained that the difference between what passengers think and what the airline performance data say could be explained by marketing. In years past, Southwest Airlines remained at the top of the passenger preference rankings even as performance fell into a tailspin. And other larger airlines with well-marketed loyalty programs like United and American tended to do better with passengers even when they performed badly.
The airline secret : The best airlines in America probably aren't the ones you think are the best. And you may find a lower fare on a carrier that performs better but isn't as aggressively marketed.
Do loyalty programs distort airline quality?
The researchers were puzzled by American Airlines' performance. The airline ranked as the third-favorite among passengers but eighth in performance, the lowest of a legacy carrier. Even Spirit Airlines outperformed it this year. And yet, one of the researchers freely admitted that she goes out of her way to collect miles on American Airlines.
""Loyalty programs give you one thing,"" says Brent Bowen, the founding co-author of the AQR. ""Then they take two of them away.""
Of course, airline loyalty programs are meant to encourage people to pay more for their tickets in a desperate effort to collect enough miles for a ""free"" flight. They create legions of blindly brand-loyal customers who are willing to overlook lousy performance and substandard service.
But to what extent do loyalty programs distort the perception of an airline? American Airlines, for example, reported revenues from fees and the sale of frequent flier miles rose 6.3 percent to $712 million in 2018 , due primarily to higher loyalty revenue.
Are these airlines that happen to have loyalty programs -- or loyalty programs that happen to be run by airlines? Perhaps if you removed the programs, the perception of airline quality would more closely align with reality.
One thing the researchers agreed on: Loyalty programs, at least in their current form, are unsustainable. Either a disgruntled flying public will start to lose interest in collecting miles or airlines will cut the programs to the point of irrelevance. But it can't go on like this.
The airline secret : If, indeed, the handwriting is on the wall for loyalty programs, this might be a great time to cash in those miles for a ticket -- and to shift to a more sensible payment system than the overpriced affinity card you're carrying .
Who are the winners and losers in 2019?
Can this year's AQR results, which are based on 2018 data, predict the quality of your summer flight? They might.
The current 737 Max controversy, the researchers said, will affect Southwest Airlines the most . Southwest operates 34 of the aircraft. That, combined with a bitter dispute with its mechanics , will likely have repercussions on customer service. The biggest impact will be on consumer complaints, which the airline must report to the Department of Transportation and which is used to determine the AQR.
""Southwest is going to decline in 2019,"" predicted Brent Bowen.
Among his other predictions: Alaska Airlines will continue to underperform as it deals with the fallout from its merger with Virgin America. Typically, it takes about three years for an airline to recover from a merger but it can sometimes take much longer. American will also continue to haunt the bottom part of the rankings and may come in dead last in 2019. That would be a first for a legacy carrier.
The researchers were also ""somewhat"" confident that Delta would retain its number-one place in 2019.
The airline secret : If you want to have a good flight this summer, consult this year's AQR winners. If you factored in the monthly performance data for the first three months of the year, they would be virtually unchanged.
If there is a lesson to be learned from the AQR backstory, it's that perception of airline quality doesn't always match up with performance. Personal preferences and heavily marketed loyalty programs can -- and do -- distort reality. But if you want a reliable indicator of flight quality this summer, the 2018 AQR is a good place to start.

Why Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship Is The Next Billion Dollar Combat Sport,www.forbes.com,Peter Kahn,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterkahn/2019/04/13/why-bare-knuckle-fighting-championship-is-the-next-billion-dollar-combat-sport/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Artem Lobov in his corner after his victory over Jason Knight on April 6, 2019 at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum Phil Lambert Three hundred years: That's how long it has been since James Figg of England claimed the first-ever bare-knuckle championship, in 1719. He went on to hold that title until his retirement in 1730. It was this form of fist fighting that gave birth to the modern sport of boxing.
Enter 2019, and here we are again having a conversation about bare-knuckle fighting. Many people have compared bare-knuckle fighting to street fighting; the difference between the two is one simple thing: rules. Still, bare-knuckle fighting is fighting in its purest form. Two men in a ring standing just feet from each other going toe to toe with nothing protecting them. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. No hand wraps. No padding. No mercy. The fighters simply use a little gauze under the wrap that simply protects their wrist and thumb. Everything else is exposed.
Professional bare-knuckle fighting was never legal under any federal or state laws in the United States until Wyoming legalized the sport on March 20, 2018. Since then, Mississippi and New Hampshire have followed suit, and five more states are expected to provide legal sanction within the next six months.
Sound Familiar?
If this narrative sounds familiar, it's because it is. Another company faced the same challenges in its early development when Zuffa LLC was founded in January 2001 in Las Vegas, Nevada, by Station Casinos executives Frank Fertitta III and Lorenzo Fertitta to be the parent entity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) after they purchased it from the Semaphore Entertainment Group. Fifteen years later, after it rebuilt, relaunched and grew the brand into a global combat sport phenom, the UFC would be sold for $4 billion to a group led by Hollywood talent agency WME-IMG.
So why am I telling you all of this? When Jason Knight's tooth hit the canvas on April 6 in Mississippi, Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship had arrived. It was like watching a star being born in real time. In this case, it isn't a person, it's a movement. The response to the main event between Artem Lobov and Jason Knight was palpable. Everyone finally got it. This is what they needed to see to understand what its founder has been telling anyone that would listen, but I'll get to that in a minute. There is only one word for the fight that took place in #BKFC5 between Jason Knight vs Artem Lobov; ＥＰＩＣ‼️ . .Congratulations Artem Lobov on your win by unanimous decision (48-47 X 2, 48-46) @RusHammerMMA .BKFC5 is available on PPV On Demand & FITEtv #BKFC #KnuckleUp pic.twitter.com/80Imp5nw4N

Overnight Success
Well, sort of. This overnight success has been a decade in the making behind the hard work and perseverance of Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship founder and CEO, David Feldman. Feldman, a Philadelphia native has roots in boxing, having boxed himself in addition to growing up with father, Marty Feldman, who was a well-liked and well-known trainer in Philadelphia prior to his passing in 2017. Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship Founder and CEO David Feldman Phil Lambert
Feldman's enthusiasm and belief in his mission are admirable. His intensity and determination to make Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship a success reminds me of Dana White in the early days of his UFC tenure. I asked Feldman what inspired him to pursue bare knuckle. Feldman said,
I promoted a fighter in boxing named Bobby Gunn, who as a Gypsy would tell me how they would do bare-knuckle fights in Scotland and England to solve family disputes and bet on them. I started researching it and got really intrigued. So, I told him I was going to do a real, legit one. I did a bare-knuckle fight in 2011 at Fort McDowell Casino in Arizona. We sold it out and had almost one million people attempt to purchase the event, but the paywall crashed. That’s when we knew it could be big. We pushed for seven years, pitching 28 states, to no avail. Finally, Bryan Pedersen, the chairman of the athletic commission in Wyoming gave us a chance. On June 2, 2018, we made history by becoming the first legally, state-regulated, bare-knuckle fighting company in US history.
History Repeating Itself
The last time I had this feeling was on April 9, 2005, when Forrest Griffin defeated Stephan Bonnar to win the inaugural season of the Ultimate Fighter. The fight was credited by Dana White as the ""most important fight in UFC history."" I talked with famed cutman Jacob Duran, better known as ""Stitch"" Duran in the world of professional fighting, who remembers that night very well as he worked in Forrest Griffin's corner for that fight.
Stitch, who had long stints with Pride Fighting Championship before going exclusive with the UFC for 15 years, had the following to say about the future of bare-knuckle, ""It does follow the same parallel of the UFC and the reason I say that is before, boxing people wouldn't talk about the UFC. After the Griffin vs. Bonnar fight, everybody was asking me questions."" Stitch continued, ""The same is happening now with Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship after the success of the Lobov vs. Knight fight. Bare Knuckle is a cutman's dream. Guaranteed work.""
A Bloody Success
— MMA Junkie (@MMAjunkie) April 7, 2019
The bottom line is that just as the UFC stole market share from a boxing industry in the early 2000s that became complacent, the UFC can be roadkill for Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship that is providing a platform for strikers that want to compete minus the kicking, grappling and wrestling. It's also a place for boxers to reinvent themselves and fight more often without the waiting periods they have to go through while under traditional promotional agreements.
Just ask former world champion Paulie Malignaggi who is the first former boxing world champion to take the leap and enter the bare-knuckle arena. His encounter with Artem Lobov in advance of their June 21 showdown already provided much of the passion and pre-fight animosity that is sure to make their fight an instant classic. Come to my city talking shit get smacked like a bitch @bareknucklefc @RusHammerMMA pic.twitter.com/quxOXjmmqB
— Paul Malignaggi (@PaulMalignaggi) April 2, 2019 Big Opportunities Feldman is currently in talks with the major TV networks and streaming services that could become the home for Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship. Major brands are already showing interest in getting in on the ground floor because they know the potential this sport has and the overall appetite for the combat space continues to grow worldwide. In 2018, DAZN signed a $1 billion deal with boxing promotional company Matchroom, boxing promotional company Golden Boy Promotions engineered an 11-fight $365 million dollar deal with DAZN for Canelo Alvarez, boxing promotional company Top Rank Boxing signed a seven-year deal with ESPN consisting of 54 shows per year, and the UFC signed a $1.5 billion dollar deal with ESPN that includes both cable and streaming of its events. Asia's juggernaut mixed martial arts promotional company One Championship is about to enter the USA market this year and recently boasted a Nielsen Sports worldwide viewership in excess of 41 million people for their most recent event in Tokyo. Add sponsorship, merchandise and a plethora of licensing opportunities, Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship is positioned to own its space and be able to obtain its share of the combat sports category.
As states begin to provide legal sanction, more and more opportunities are going to become available for fighters that want to be a part of the oldest and newest combat sport. Knuckle up.

"'Rise Of Skywalker' Is Last 'Star Wars' Film For Awhile, Thanks To 'Avatar' And 'Aquaman'",www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/13/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-avatar-aquaman-game-of-thrones-disney-marvel-pixar-box-office/,"Bob Iger confirmed yesterday morning that Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is both the end of the ongoing Skywalker/Solo saga (which began, obviously, in 1977 with Star Wars ) and the last theatrical Star Wars movie for a while. That’s not news in and of itself since we knew that the Star Wars Story movies were on the backburner after Solo earned just $394 million worldwide. While we know that there are two standalone Star Wars trilogies in development, one via Rian Johnson (who directed The Last Jedi ) and another from David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (two of the creators of the just-about-to-end Game of Thrones show), it’s not like those movies are gearing up to shoot anytime soon. So unless Kathleen Kennedy has the Time Stone (or a time-turner), new Star Wars filmed content will be found exclusively on Disney+ ( The Mandalorian , Clone Wars , etc.) for a while. There’s another perfectly logical reason The Rise of Skywalker is going to be the last theatrical Star Wars movie for a while: In short, there’s no place to release it. Presuming that Disney intends to keep Star Wars as an end-of-year Christmas cash cow, and frankly, it should, then this will be the last Christmas at least until 2023 that isn’t otherwise occupied. Since Disney now owns Fox, Disney now owns James Cameron’s four planned Avatar sequels, the first of which will debut on December 18, 2020, or one year and one day after Rise of Skywalker .
Presuming Cameron sticks to his schedule (and Avatar 2 performs at least well enough to avoid panic over Avatar 3 ), that third installment will open on December 17, 2021. And then we’ll get a two-year break from Avatar sequels before Avatar 4 opens on December 20, 2024 and Avatar 5 seemingly ends the saga on December 19, 2025. But wait, there’s more! Because Warner Bros. saw an opening in mid-December of 2022 and scheduled James Wan’s Aquaman sequel for December 16, 2022. Presuming Disney would rather keep Star Wars in the same slot where they’ve been kicking butt since 2015, the first opening would be December of 2023. That would actually be a pretty appropriate four-year-gap between Rise of Skywalker and whatever else comes next.
You may be asking why can’t Disney just slate a new Star Wars movie outside of December. Of course, they could, but would they want to? The MCU already has the summer kick-off date sewn up and Memorial Day seems downright cursed for the Mouse House (pray for Aladdin ). They’ve usually got a Pixar movie in mid -June and then another Marvel movie (even if it’s a Sony Spider-Man flick) in early July. So either they plunge into unknown waters and drop a Star Wars movie in the pre-summer offseason, they drop it around Thanksgiving and hope it can coexist with Avatar , or they hold their cards until they have another December opening. And with the MCU, Pixar and Avatar hopefully cleaning up, Disney can afford to wait.
A four-year-gap would give Johnson, Benioff and Weiss plenty of time to A) figure out which trilogy goes first and B) just what those movies will be about. It would also indeed be something of a breather from Star Wars movies, even though once upon a time a four-year gap between regular sequels ( The Dark Knight Rises , Star Trek Into Darkness , etc.) was almost par for the course. Heck, we only got ten years between Revenge of the Sith and The Force Awakens , even if it (arguably?) felt like longer by virtue of the new hyper-frenetic news cycle. By comparison, it’ll be 11 years between installments by the time we get Avatar 2 in two Christmases from now. Point being, a four-year gap sounds about right.
Yes, some of this is merely Disney wanting to maintain at least some “specialness” of theatrical Star Wars movies, especially as the next batch isn’t connected to the George Lucas movies. A good way to make a brand feel special is to take it away for a while, as Disney learned with The Force Awakens in late 2015. The Fox deal gives Disney some breathing room in terms of holding back on Star Wars movies, especially if Avatar 2 delivers accordingly. I would argue the biggest reason we won’t get new Star Wars movies for a while is the simplest reason. If Disney wants to drop a Star Wars movie at Christmas, they have to wait until December of 2023 due to Avatar and Aquaman ."

"First-Ever Picture Of A Black Hole, Still No Picture Of A True Driverless Car",www.forbes.com,Lance Eliot,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2019/04/13/first-ever-picture-of-a-black-hole-still-no-picture-of-a-true-driverless-car/,"Scientists are abuzz with the release of a picture depicting a supermassive black hole that is over 55 million light-years away in outer space, the first time any picture of a black hole has ever been produced, meanwhile here on Earth there is still not a picture of a true driverless car. Yes, it is true, we do not yet have a Level 5 driverless car and no one can even say for sure what it will look like.
The efforts you keep hearing about and seeing in online videos and ads are at-most touching upon Level 4, or lesser capable levels such as Level 3 and Level 2, often improperly and inappropriately professed as self-driving or driverless cars.
Keeping Score About Driverless Cars
The official scoring system, promulgated by the Society for Automotive Engineers (SAE), indicates that a Level 5 is essentially a true driverless car, one that has the AI driving the car and there is no need for a human driver.
The Level 5 self-driving car has either passengers in it or might be empty and simply be cruising around to its next designated destination, but there is no requirement that a human driver be present. In fact, the odds are that the Level 5 won’t have any driving controls for humans, thus, any human driver is precluded from driving regardless of their interest or willingness to drive.
Level 4 consists of cars that can self-drive in stipulated limited circumstances, formally known as Operational Design Domains (ODD). An ODD might be that the driverless car is okay in dry weather and confined to a geofenced suburb area, which means that once the rain starts falling or you want to visit your relatives in another state, the driverless car won’t go. That’s not the kind of driverless car that we would likely agree is truly self-driving.
U.S. Department of Transportation Level 3 and Level 2 are not really self-driving cars at all, since they require that a human licensed driver be present and be able to handle the driving task, co-sharing the wheel with the automation. Some like to refer to these as semi-autonomous cars, though the attempt to qualify the word “autonomous” can be misleading and suggest autonomy that really doesn’t fully exist.
Experts in the automotive world tend to rightfully describe Level 2 and Level 3 cars as having ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). A human driver must not only be in the driver’s seat, they need to be alert and continually ready to takeover the wheel. The ADAS might suddenly toss the driving back into the human’s lap, or the human driver might notice something amiss with the ADAS and yank back control.
With ADAS, at any moment, throughout a driving journey, the human driver must be attentive. For the existing Level 2 and Level 3 cars, those videos you see of drivers sleeping or reading a book, well, those are human drivers that are driving on the edge of calamity and misery. Whether they grasp their predicament or not, they are nonetheless undercutting their part of the co-sharing bargain. It’s a recipe for disaster and will be heightened as Level 3 cars emerge and become prevalent.
In a bit of irony, the more advanced the ADAS becomes, the more likely human drivers will become inattentive, lulled into believing that the car is a true self-driving car (but, it’s not).
Clarifying When A Rose Is a Rose
Banner headlines often make use of the alluring sounding self-driving, driverless, and robot car monikers, yet this is a blanket style of name-calling that muddies the matter. This might also explain why the general public is a bit confused about the varying claims of self-driving cars. A rose is not a rose by any other name, if it is really an orchid or a sunflower.
It could be that the Level 4 cars that are currently being tried out on our roadways, doing so in limited areas and in limited ways, will validate progress toward true Level 5 self-driving cars. If so, those Level 4 cars are a harbinger of the vaunted Level 5 and therefore you are possibly seeing an early image of what a Level 5 will look like. Or, there might be aspects that require a departure from the Level 4 and researchers must find other ways to bolt together a Level 5.
Astrophysicists have said that putting together the first-ever picture of a black hole, sitting at the center of galaxy Messier 87 (M87), took a tremendous amount of research and effort, even though it might seem as though they merely clicked a button on a camera and snapped a handy photo of the swirling mass of dust and gas.
I assure you that creating a true Level 5 driverless car is still a distance away, maybe not as far away as the M87, but we are not yet there, and the full instant-photo picture of a road-ready Level 5 is still somewhat fuzzy and a bit out-of-focus."
Why Virtual Reality's Disruption Of Hollywood Isn't Here Yet (But It's Not Dead Either),www.forbes.com,Paul Armstrong,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularmstrongtech/2019/04/13/why-virtual-realitys-disruption-of-hollywood-isnt-here-yet-but-its-not-dead-either/,"From Bandersnatch to Instagram Stories, new content formats are beginning to emerge that usher in new opportunities for filmmakers and content producers. Virtual Reality is another area that has plenty of potential but not mass adoption by Hollywood but that may be about to change if Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Ugly Dolls) 'THE LIMIT' is an early taste of a future that's almost here. The trailer for Rodriguez's ' THE LIMIT ' is fast-paced and offers a glimpse at an immersive thrill-ride that involves jumping out of a plane, a high-speed car chase amongst other heart-rate elevating elements. The drawbacks are not the desire to make content like this but the challenges that come with filming. Aside from costs , creating in this medium is a challenge according to Rodriguez; ""I couldn’t really plan even simple things, like how close the vehicles should get to each other until we were there on the day and I was looking through the camera because the lens is very wide. POV works much better in VR than in traditional film and TV, but it takes a lot of coordination between all involved.""
Creating cinematic VR requires new 'languages' that lead to a different relationship with the audience according to Rodriguez; ""Designing a story that is immersive and a lean-back experience [is tough], one where the audience has freedom of movement and can choose where to look, but at the same time you want to direct them as well to see and hear what you want them to in order to get the most out of the film, is harder.""
All in all, VR is a challenging paradigm for Hollywood, do they lean in or lean out? What relationship do the filmmakers of today (and tomorrow) want to have with the audience? Jess Clark , Manor House Productions, Producer is not convinced the road will be fast or easy for VR; ""[VR] is still very much personal preference for filmmakers. You either want to experiment, or you're more dedicated to your medium. The future of movies may be more technology, but it won't be a fast conversion. A huge stamp of approval would be the Academy pushing it harder.""
Speaking to the DGA , Jon Favreau (Avengers) isn't convinced on VR's cinematic future either; ""Part of the job of the filmmaker is to support that immersion. And often it relates to how you make choices that you believe the audience would make. So, if you're cutting a scene properly, it's almost like you don't need VR because you're looking where they want to look anyway.""
Bertie Millis, Co-Founder of Virtual Umbrella believes VR isn't the future of film, it's just one part of the experience; ""Virtual Reality will not be the future of Hollywood film, but it's going to be a powerful tool for immersing viewers into stories in ways that 2D & 3D film never could. We will see immersive elements added to VR experiences such as smell and touch. These are already present in art installations such as Marshmallow Laser Feast's 'We Live in an Ocean of Air' and Greenpeace's 'Munduruku'. These experiences add deeper engagement with their stories and viewers remember it for much longer than traditional film.""
Offline experiences like ' The Grid ', Cineworld's 4Dx and Marshmallow Laser Feast's ' Ocean of Air ' hint at a future where people go to the movies for full immersion rather than simple distraction or escapism. The Tribeca Film Festival just announced an immersive line-up this year. Rodriguez believes the future will be having the choice and genre dependent; ""Immersive cinema puts the viewer inside of an action film and makes them a main character, which is the ultimate in wish fulfilment if you’re a fan of action-adventure films. For me, it also bridges the gap between movies and video games. It’s still a lean-back experience like a film is, but with a feeling of immersion similar to but that goes even beyond video games.""
The future of VR is anything but decided. Facebook-owned Oculus recently received another hefty discount, Google and the IMAX Corporation abandoned a joint venture to build cameras for filmmakers, but it is too early to dismiss VR. VR remains the natural progression for Hollywood's evolution, but the makers and tech platforms refocusing on AR may slow the progression for VR. Creatives may have to push VR over the line until Hollywood catches up."
IRS Addresses Top Tax Refund Myths As Tax Day Approaches,www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/04/13/irs-addresses-top-tax-refund-myths-as-tax-day-approaches/,"It was a clunky tax season opening on January 28, 2019, with taxpayers grappling with new tax forms, new rules, and a government shutdown. While some 50 million taxpayers have yet to file ( as of April 12, 2019 ), tens of millions have already filed and are eagerly awaiting their tax refunds. While they wait, taxpayers are often bombarded with bad information about what to expect. To help sort out the truth from the confusion, the Internal has issued a list of refund-related myths : Myth 1: Calling the IRS or a tax professional will provide a better refund date.
Put the phone down. You might have heard that calling the IRS or calling their tax professional is the best way to find out when they will get their tax refund. It is not. Here’s what will really happen:
You may stay on hold for a phenomenally long time; and Your tax professional will hate you (he or she is still trying to get returns out for other clients)
The fastest way to check on your refund is online through the Where’s My Refund? tool at IRS.gov or via the IRS2Go mobile app (you can find out more here ). Those without access to the internet can call the IRS automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954.
When you go online or call, you’ll need your Social Security number, filing status and the amount of your anticipated refund. If you filed your return electronically, you can check your refund status within 24 hours after IRS indicates receipt of your return. If you file a paper tax return, you’ll need to wait longer – usually about four weeks. There’s no need to check over and over throughout the day: records are only updated by IRS once per day, usually overnight.
Still itching to pick up the phone? You should only call the IRS tax help hotline to talk to a representative if it has been:
21 days or more since you e-filed your tax return; Six weeks or more since you mailed your tax return; or If Where’s My Refund? indicates that you should contact the IRS.
Myth 2: Ordering a tax transcript is a ""secret way"" to get a refund date.
It’s always fun when you find a life hack on the internet. Who knew that trick about how to best eat a pineapple or the special method to clean your ceiling fan? But when it comes to taxes, don’t believe the hacks. Specifically, ordering a tax transcript will not help you find out exactly when you might get your refund. The information on a transcript does not necessarily reflect the amount or timing of a refund. While you can use a tax transcript to validate past income and tax filing status for mortgage, student, and small business loan applications and to help with tax preparation, you should use Where’s My Refund? to check the status of their refund. The codes that you’ll see on your tax transcripts do not offer additional information about when your refund will be issued.
Myth 3: Where’s My Refund? must be wrong because there’s no deposit date yet.
Not all tax returns are created equal. Even if you and your best friend filed at the same time and had relatively similar tax returns, there’s a chance that they won’t be processed at the same time. Even though the IRS issues most refunds in less than 21 days, it’s possible a refund may take longer for a variety of reasons including when a return is incomplete or needs further review.
And remember, updates to Where's My Refund? are made once per day, usually overnight. This means that in some cases, a taxpayer who filed later may receive their refund sooner than someone who filed earlier in the season.
If you don’t see your deposit date just yet, don’t call. The IRS will reach out to you by mail (or signal on the Where’s My Refund? app) if it needs more information to process your tax return. See again Myth #1.
Myth 4: Where’s My Refund? must be wrong because the refund amount is less than expected.
Just because you think you know what your refund check will look like doesn’t mean that’s what will land in your bank account. According to the IRS, several factors that could cause your tax refund to be larger (or smaller) than expected, such as:
Math errors or mistakes; Delinquent federal taxes; State taxes, child support, student loans or other delinquent federal non-tax obligations; and IRS holds a portion of the refund while it reviews an item claimed on the return.
If the IRS makes an adjustment on your return, they will mail a letter to you explaining the changes. You may also receive a letter from the Department of Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service if all or part of your refund was reduced and offset to pay certain financial obligations.
(For more on offsets that might affect your refund, click here .)
It’s also possible that your refund check could be affected by your spouse’s liability or obligation (child support is a common). If that’s the case, you may be able to get the portion attributable you by applying to the IRS for Injured Spouse Relief.

Finally, if you filed your taxes and requested a refund anticipation loan, fees and other deductions might apply to your refund check - not from the IRS, but from the loan originator or agency.

Myth 5: Getting a refund this year means there’s no need to adjust withholding for 2019.
Withholding was a huge tax topic this year following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). But checking withholding is important every year, refund or not. IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig says, “We urge people to check their withholding again this year to make sure they are having the right amount of tax withheld for 2019.”

And that's it. There are no magic codes, keys or other tricks to getting your tax refund faster this tax season. The IRS encourages taxpayers who are expecting tax refunds to file as early as possible, using e-file and direct deposit. The IRS issues nine out of 10 tax refunds in less than 21 days.

Literally Everyone On Earth Has The Same 'Star Wars Episode 9: Rise Of Skywalker' Theory,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/13/literally-everyone-on-earth-has-the-same-star-wars-episode-9-rise-of-skywalker-theory/,"Yesterday, we got our first look at the last Star Wars movie for a good long while, the end of the Skywalker era, but not before putting the name in actual title of the movie for once. The film is called Star Wars Episode 9: Rise of Skywalker , which has led to a flurry of speculation about what exactly that means. The immediate theories that first leapt to everyone’s mind are all, no doubt, wrong. They include:
Skywalker referring to Rey’s true parentage as this film looks to change the Rian Johnson “Rey’s parents are no one” reveal in Episode VIII. Skywalker referring to Ben reclaiming the name and turning from the Dark Side. Skywalker referring to Leia. Skywalker referring to Luke going full force-ghost and showing up a lot to influence things.
All of these theories were encapsulated in a single tweet from Mark Hamill , which is the final nail in the coffin that should tell you that none of them or true, or he wouldn’t be egging people on with potential spoilers.
Once you move past the idea that anyone is a secret Skywalker or reclaiming the family name, a second theory forms. I thought of this on my own, until I went on the internet and saw that roughly a hundred million people had come up with the same idea.
The theory is that ‘Skywalker’ is going to replace the term ‘Jedi,’ as Luke gets his wish when he said that the Jedi must end. As in, you can now train to become a Skywalker rather than a Jedi, and hopefully it comes with some important distinctions.
While the Jedi were not flat-out evil like the uber-facist Sith going around torturing people and destroying planets, they were not exactly great either. They effectively created Darth Vader by ripping Anakin away from his mother, not allowing him to visit or bring her with him (leading to her death) and forbidding love so he had to keep his relationship with Padme a secret (leading to her death as well). The Jedi’s rules about attachment to family or significant others are ludicrous, which leads to a bunch of lonely force hermits who become at best, members of the Jedi council who are dumb enough to be blind to a galaxy-wide conspiracy to wipe them out, or at worst, actual Sith. Luke, when he was in full Jedi teacher mode, was the one who ultimately caused Ben to fully flip to the Dark Side, leading to that cascading chain of horrible events.
The point is, Luke is right, the Jedi should end. Not that everyone has to stop using the force and throw away their lightsabers, but if Rey becomes the first of a new order of Skywalkers that truly brings balance to the force and bridges the divide between creepy arrogant monks and murderous tortured souls, that would probably be better for the universe at large.
Episode VIII has already set this up to a certain extent. The idea is that a Skywalker can come from anywhere. Rey’s parents are no one (and they will stay no one), and the final tease of the film is some random stable boy showing force prowess. This pulls away from the idea where fans are desperately searching for someone, anyone to be a secret Skywalker offspring because that overlooks the point that the family name and genetics shouldn’t matter. Skywalker is not heritage, it’s a philosophy that is hopefully better than anything the Jedi or Sith came up with for thousands of years which resulted in endless wars as miserable warriors on both sides.
Is this theory true? We have no real way of knowing for sure until Episode 9 gets here, but I am 20x more likely to believe it than the idea that Rey’s parentage is being retconned or Kylo Ren is going to be going by Ben Skywalker by the end of the movie. It may not play out exactly like this, but I think there’s a reason everyone jumped to this theory immediately.

IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig Has A Message To Taxpayers: Thank You For Filing,www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/04/13/irs-commissioner-chuck-rettig-has-a-message-to-taxpayers-thank-you-for-filing/,"Charles (""Chuck"") P. Rettig is the 49th Commissioner of the Internal and was sworn in on October 1, 2018. Prior to joining the agency, Rettig spent 36 years as a tax lawyer in private practice. He earned his college degree in economics from the University of California at Los Angeles, his JD (law degree) at Pepperdine University School of Law and his LL.M. (masters of law degree) in Tax at New Your University School of Law. It's been a challenging year for some taxpayers. In response, Chuck Rettig has a message : Thank You.
The text of his message follows, unedited, in its entirety.
As the tax filing deadline approaches on April 15, I’d like to thank taxpayers for taking the time to file and pay their taxes. Our nation’s tax system is built around the concept of voluntary tax compliance, meaning citizens comply with their civic duty each year by preparing and filing their taxes – without direct government intervention.
This principle has helped make our tax system a model for the entire world. Thanks to taxpayers, this system helps fund our great nation. Each year, 95% of the gross receipts of our country flows through the IRS – about $3.5 trillion last year – funding critical aspects of the U.S., ranging from roads and schools to the nation’s military.
Behind the scenes, this couldn’t happen without the devoted work of IRS employees across America, in places like Atlanta, Austin, Ogden, Kansas City and elsewhere. We have employees in every state and working in numerous different capacities. Our employees interact with more Americans than any other institution, public or private. They make a difference, they care, and they take great pride in serving taxpayers and our country.
This year, their work has taken on even more importance as we faced the biggest tax law changes since 1986. Our teams labored through two holiday seasons, weekends and many even missed birthdays and family events to ensure IRS filing systems were starting in January 2019.
Due to these efforts, we’ve had a smooth filing season. Our IT systems set a new record in January, accepting more than 1.9 million tax returns in a single hour – that’s 536 tax returns a second. By the time the filing deadline hits more than 130 million tax returns will have been filed, and more than $250 billion in refunds will have been processed – all while helping protect against tax-related identity theft. Efforts to provide quality taxpayer services and protecting taxpayer data will always remain a priority for the IRS.
When taxpayers file their returns, they should feel confident that others are doing the right thing too. Fair but rigorous enforcement of the tax laws is critical to ensuring fairness in our tax system. Our employees who audit returns, collect taxes, and investigate fraud all work hard throughout the year to fairly enforce the laws while respecting taxpayer rights.
As the tax deadline approaches, I want you to know the IRS appreciates the time and personal effort everyone takes to file their taxes in support of our great nation. If someone needs tax help in the coming days, IRS.gov has many options available. And if more time is needed to file, don’t panic – taxpayers can file for an automatic six-month extension.
We sometimes refer to our employees as ""IRS Ambassadors"" recognizing that they routinely give back to their communities. Many volunteer to help low-income and older Americans prepare their taxes. When disaster strikes, thousands of our employees routinely help answer phone calls for victims calling in to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, provide tax information at Disaster Recovery Centers and lend a hand providing security.
I’m very proud of every IRS employee. They remain dedicated to helping taxpayers understand and meet their filing obligations. Our employees make a difference, and they take pride in serving taxpayers and our country. We’re also hiring people to join our IRS family– if you know someone who may be interested, please suggest they visit usajobs.gov.
Beyond technical skills, the success of the IRS also depends on respecting taxpayer rights and treating everyone we encounter with fairness. My pledge to taxpayers is that we at the IRS will continue to keep taxpayer rights paramount in all of our interactions. Inside our agency, we understand, accept and value our differences, and strive to maintain an inclusive and diverse workplace, where employees treat each other with kindness and civility. We will continue to carry those values with us in all of our dealings with taxpayers as well. We believe every person is important, none more or less so than any others. By valuing and respecting each other, we are better able to move forward together.
I’m Chuck Rettig, and that’s why I’m proud to say: ""I work for the IRS."""
Fortnite Buccaneer Challenge: Where To Shoot Yourself Out Of A Pirate Cannon In 5 Different Matches,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/13/fortnite-buccaneer-challenge-where-to-shoot-yourself-out-of-a-pirate-cannon-in-5-different-matches/,"The final stage of Fortnite ’s new Buccaneer Bounty mini-event has arrived, which asks players to shoot themselves out of a pirate cannon in 5 different matches. Doing this will get you 1000 XP for the season, but also if you combine it with the other three challenges, you will unlock a special emote that has you opening a treasure chest only to get ambushed by an octopus monster. It’s pretty solid. You only have three more days to complete all these challenges, so you probably want to get it done this weekend before you forget. And if you’re going for this final pirate cannon one, it would help to know where those are, right?
We have already seen a number of different challenges this season involving pirate cannons, including on where you have to do damage to structures after shooting yourself out of them. This time, all you have to do is shoot yourself out of cannons in different matches, which is easier.
There are about 16 or so locations on the map with pirate cannons, some of which contain more than one pirate cannon in a single spot. My internet friend @Fortrisen has probably made the best map of this I’ve seen, which you can check out below:
Cannon location map
@Fortrisen As you can see, the most cannons are concentrated near the new areas of Lazy Lagoon and the volcano, so if you hot drop there every match you can probably get this done very quickly indeed.
If you still have not done one of the visiting the pirate camps challenges , you can kill two birds with one stone, because all those camps also feature a few pirate cannons. I mean, what’s a pirate camp without a cannon to defend it, right? So with 7 or so pirate camps on the map, those alone should be more than enough to get you the amount of cannons you need to complete this challenge. I think that if one building has 2-3 cannons in it, you can also keep landing there and shooting yourself out of those, and it will count as different cannons, but I need to check. The same goes for the pirate ship docked at the lagoon.
Fortnite
Epic All in all this is not a bad free event where you can rack up a lot of free stuff relatively easily thanks to these challenges that have you checking out the pirate parts of the map finding treasure and placing high in one single match. Easy enough.
Season 8 is still far from over so we may see another event like this still to come. Epic rarely gives out truly free stuff, so it’s always a good idea to get these goodies when they show up. Happy hunting.

"Three Worthy 2019 Subcompact Vehicles, Test-Driven",www.forbes.com,Josh Max,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshmax/2019/04/11/three-worthy-2019-subcompact-vehicles-test-driven/,"Subcompacts are like fresh 7-11 coffee or a good roadside diner. They do a job, they do it relatively cheaply, and sometimes they do it handsomely. Here are three 2019 models I recently drove - two subcompacts and one classic subcompact that's biting the dust this year - and liked for different reasons. 2019 Nissan Kicks
2019 Nissan Kicks
Josh Max The answer to anything one might find wrong in this oddly-shaped-but-compelling four-cylinder, 35 MPG ode to 20 th century technology can be answered with “But it starts at $18, 540.” (Loosely) replacing the outgoing Nissan Juke, the Kicks delivers a defanged turbocharger-less experience and is available in front-wheel drive only, making it the ideal city-and-surrounding-areas chariot. On highways, sharing space with tractor trailers and much larger, heavier and well-padded vehicles, you’ll need to be on your toes. What it’s got going for it, mainly, is personality. For the price, its exterior design gives its rivals a run for their money.
It comes in three trims; the base SV, the SR and our tester ,the SR Premium package. The recommended SV base price sticker is $18,540, not including the $990 destination charge. The SR starts at $20,870 and the de-luxe SR Premium package isn’t much more expensive at $1,000 extra, delivering heated front seats, upgraded fabric, an 8-speaker Bose sound system and a vehicle security system, all worth it.
2019 Nissan Kicks
Nissan How does it drive? A job needs to be done, a job is done. You step on the gas pedal, the car moves – eventually, via a 1.6 liter, 122-horsepower engine that won’t throw a scare into the Charger or 911 you’re next to at traffic lights. Need to steer, need to stop? The Kicks does both well, and it’ll even stop you automatically if you’re distracted and about to tap the car in front of you. Once you are up and running at speed, the vehicle’s as nimble as can be expected – after all, it’s only around 2,700 pounds. A tight turn radius is one of its particularly pleasing talents, making u-turns a snap.
The trunk is generous for the car’s size - sousaphonists, stand-up bassists, those in the trades and skiiers will welcome the space. There is also a built-in armrest to the right of the captain’s chair, something one doesn’t always find in cars of this price range.It’s got a snappy “floating roof” design, available in black or white for another $200; roof rails come standard, for those who wish to tie a canoe up there or similar. If you order a base Kicks, you’ll roll on 16-inch steel wheels with covers; upgrade to SV and SR to get the 17-inchers. Overall, it's a fun experience and if you're a loyal Nissan-lovin' motorist, the Kicks fits the bill.
2019 Toyota CH-R
2019 Toyota CH-R
Manufacturer I felt more kindly toward the angular, nerdy, $20,000-or-so CH-R for my 2019 test than I did last year, partly but not entirely due to the amount of public reaction I got, such as “I love the color of your car.” (It was “Blue Flame.) The other wonderful thing about the CH-R, described as a ""subcompact crossover,"" is the simplicity of its phone sync mechanism. I got in, I connected within 60 seconds, and never was there a moment’s difficulty ever-after, unlike so many manufactures who design and produce incomprehensible, frustrating units. The CH-R also boasts some of the most mod, effective safety features available, always a plus in a subcompact. They include a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, dynamic radar cruise control, automatic highbeams, a rearview camera and “Toyota Safety Sense” which includes lane departure alert with steering assist, and more. The back seats are based on Toyota’s Camry sedan and are therefore more roomy than you’d expect for this pint-sizer.
2019 Toyota CH-R
Manufacturer Along with a more “sporty” feel than one experiences in this type vehicle, the above are the strong points. Some of the weaker points include anemic acceleration via the CH-R’s 144 horsepower engine and lack of all-wheel-drive capability no matter what you pay. But! If you go for the top-of-the-line trim, Toyota throws in an upgraded infotainment system including a Wi-Fi hotspot, genuine leather upholstery, heated front seats, foglights and automatic wipers and other goodies. Three trims are on deck: the entry-level LE, the XLE and my tester, the Limited. An “R-Code” option, delivers a white-painted roof and side mirrors, because why not go nuts? The exterior’s already polarizing in the public area between those who love and those who don't.
The top-of-the-line Limited trim brings you leather upholstery, heated front seats, driver two-way power lumbar adjustment, and an upgraded infotainment system (optional on XLE) that adds a Wi-Fi hotspot, remote vehicle controls, and satellite and HD radio. A navigation system can be integrated into the standard touchscreen only on the Limited trim.
Its drive is as good as can be expected under the circumstances. Want to dart into an available space on the freeway? You can do it if the other guy’s also driving a CH-R. Want to take corners on tight country roads? That’s more likely to happen. While the CH-R can’t possibly be labeled a “sports” subcompact car, it does supply around 27 miles to the gallon and therefore the 2019 configuration at its base level is a cheap thrill.
2019 Volkswagen Beetle Final Editi0n
2019 Beetle final edition
Manufacturer The Beetle, as all interested parties know, is discontinued after this year. It’s a shame because a recent week’s test of the 2019 model over and around mountains and through snow as well as bright, sunny, warm days proved it a capable machine with enough interior space to hold a couple of suitcases, an acoustic guitar, a backpack and two adult passengers with room to spare. Aside from other drivers feeling free to cut me off and/or beep at my little hippie-lookin’ self, the Bug at $23,045 remains a distinctive and satisfying drive and is as fully mod as any other vehicle in its class, moreso in some cases, and I’ll miss it - and so will you.
For this year’s sendoff, Volkswagen offers either the convertible or coupe in SE and SEL trims, all outfitted with a 174-horsepower, 2.0 liter engine and 6-speed automatic transmission making around 29 miles per highway/city combined mileage. You’ve got two color choices; “Safari Uni” (beige-ish) and Stonewashed Blue, and it comes with aluminum alloy wheels and chrome accents as standard. It is conservative in steering, acceleration and braking, holding the road as well as can be expected for a light car, but be prepared for a good jolt if you strike a pothole. There is power when you need it, but its overall flavor is “steady as she goes.” The seats are more than comfortable, unlike Bugs of the 60s and 70s; two four-hour trips left no knots in the spines or posteriors of driver or passenger.
2019 Beetle Final Edition
Manufacturer The Beetle seats four but not really – in the back, space is limited for adults. By contrast, though, many supersize grownups have reported this car to be perfect for them despite outward miniscule appearances - there is lots of room for driver and passenger. Its infotainment system is sterling, easy-to-use and provides above-average, crispy and bass-y sound. There is also excellent visibility whether using the mirrors or turning your head left or right, something you very much want in a pint-sized car. Stickers start at a reasonable $23,045 for the SE Coupe trim, and $25,995 for the SEL Coupe. If you want the convertible – and you should - tack on another $4,250 for the Convertible SE, or opt for spending $4,000 on the Convertible SEL.
Volkswagen says the last Beetle is expected to be produced this summer, 70 years after the first one made its debut in America. To give context, Harry Truman was President, a top song of the year was “Buttons and Bows” sung by Dinah Shore, and the current President of the United States was three years old. I wouldn't count the Bug completely out, though. The badge is too familiar and its place in the cultural landscape is too solid. It may be a case of Volkswagen saying ""I can't quit you, babe/So I'm gonna put you down for awhile."""
'Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order' Won't Have Multiplayer Or Microtransactions,www.forbes.com,Erik Kain,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/04/13/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-doesnt-have-multiplayer-or-microtransactions/,"More good news from Apex Legends studio, Respawn Entertainment, as we approach the big reveal of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Yesterday at Star Wars Celebration 2019 in Chicago, Respawn chief Vince Zampella told IGN's Max Scoville that the game will have no ""multiplayer, no microtransactions, it’s a story game,” which was met with cheers from the crowd.
A single-player story-driven action-adventure Star Wars game with no microtransactions built with Unreal Engine 4 instead of Frostbite 3 ?
Yes, please!
That this is coming from an EA-owned studio is perhaps the most surprising thing of all. EA needs to make more games just like this, even if it doesn't line-up with their games-as-service driven model.
Let's hope that, all this aside, the game is actually good and fun to play. Given Respawn's track record with Titanfall, Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends, I have hope.
Much more will be revealed about Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order later today during the game's big Star Wars Celebration panel in Chicago. Find out when and where to watch that right here."
Maine Takes A Huge Step Forward In Teacher Evaluation,www.forbes.com,Peter Greene,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2019/04/13/maine-takes-a-huge-step-forward-in-teacher-evaluation/,"Maine has broken with the status quo of test-centered accountability for teachers. Beginning with No Child Left Behind, public schools have committed to test-centered accountability, using student results on a single standardized math and reading test to drive assessment of districts, schools and ultimately teachers. For years, the prevailing definition of a good teacher in this country has been one whose students score well on that standardized test.
The problems with this approach are legion. Schools have narrowed their focus and their curriculum to focus on tested subjects. States have developed bizarre assessment systems in which teachers of non-tested subjects might be evaluated based on the test scores of students they never taught . Nor has any convincing evidence ever emerged that raising a student's test scores improves her lot later in life. After a generation, the promised improvement in US education that test-centered accountability was supposed to drive simply hasn't arrived; NAEP scores (""the nation's report card"") have not budged significantly in all this time, nor have colleges announced that their freshman classes are now the best they've ever seen. Using standardized test scores to evaluate teachers has not fixed anything, and it has made things worse in many cases by pushing schools to focus on test taking skills instead of a broad and deep education for all students.
Now Maine has taken a step away from this with LD 92 (to see the full affect, look also at the amendments ). The bill removes any requirement to base teacher evaluation on test results. Maybe even more importantly, it requires districts to form a committee to regularly review and revise their evaluation process. This may seem like common sense, but teacher evaluation systems are historically taken out of the box and used without any subsequent discussion of how well they are actually working.
Maine's law also requires that a majority of that committee be teachers. Some critics may argue that giving teachers a voice in teacher oversight is a mistake, but I'd argue that aside from parents and students, nobody has a greater interest in improving a struggling teacher than the other teachers who have to work with her.
Teacher evaluation has never been easy. All good teachers do not look the same, and no good teachers are good for all students. Any system must be flexible and nuanced, but the overwhelming pressure exerted by everyone from overworked principals to bureaucrats who want easily-crunched data is for a system that is a simple cut-and-dried checklist. Madeline Hunter and Charlotte Danielson are two big names in teacher instruction models; their work has been debated and argued, but both have been surprised to find it reduced to simple evaluation checklists that have frustrated and angered teachers over the years.
And like all evaluation, teacher evaluation must have a specific purpose. Do you want to find weak teachers and help them get better, or do you want to identify them so you can fire them? Do you want to identify areas of improvement for the entire staff? Do you want to be able to compare teachers within a building, within a system, or within a state? Do you want to identify your exemplary teachers in order to reward them, or in order to enlist them as trainers? Each of these answers changes how the evaluation system is set up, and how teachers will react to it.
All of this means that much of the hard work lies ahead for Maine. That's okay. When challenged on the toxic results and general ineffectiveness of test-centered accountability, testocrats often reply, ""Well, then, what do you want to do instead."" That's not a legitimate answer. If I collapse on the sidewalk and someone runs up with a chainsaw and yells, ""Step aside. I'm going to cut off his legs!"" I don't need to have a better treatment to propose in order to know that sidewalk chainsaw amputation should not be happening. Every state should understand that test-centered teacher evaluation is not helpful, actually harmful, and should not be happening. Finding an alternative will not be easy, but getting rid of the toxic, ineffective, test-centered method is a necessary first step. Let the guy with the chainsaw step aside so that a real doctor can get through."
Friday Box Office: 'Little' Tops 'Hellboy' As 'After' Overperforms And 'Missing Link' Bombs,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/13/box-office-little-hellboy-after-missing-link-harry-styles-will-packer-marsai-martin-laika/,"While Warner Bros. and DC Films’ Shazam! will remain the top movie of the weekend (despite a moderate second-weekend drop), the biggest of the newbies was Universal’s Little . The Will Packer-produced comedy, about a micromanaging business owner (Regina Hall) who gets turned into her 13-year-old-self (Marsai Martin, who also executive produced this one), earned $5.3 million yesterday. That positions the $20 million-produced comedy, written and directed by Tina Gordon ( Peeples ) for a $15.4 million launch. The film received mixed-negative reviews (Martin is awesome but the rest of the film is not) but a B+ from Cinemascore (compared to 50% fresh and 4.95/10 on Rotten Tomatoes ). Considering the demographics (it’s an original, star-and-concept-driven comedy produced, written and directed by African-American women), it’s nice to see audiences actually showing up for what they claim to want.
Even a winning trio of Daniel Dae Kim, David Harbour and Sasha Lane can't save 'Hellboy'
Lionsgate
Hollywood was right all of these years in terms of telling Guillermo del Toro that a third Hellboy wasn’t a financially viable proposition. For that matter, so was I . Lionsgate and Millennium’s $50 million-budgeted, R-rated Hellboy reboot (sans del Toro’s involvement) earned just $4.9 million yesterday, including $1.38 million in Thursday previews.
With horrifically bad reviews and a C from CinemaScore, that sets the stage for a frankly mediocre $12.5 million debut weekend, below even the $13.6 million debut weekends of Underworld: Blood Wars and Resident Evil: The Final Chapter in early 2017. And, yeah, it’s way below the $23 million debut of Hellboy in 2004 and the $35 million debut of Hellboy II: The Golden Army in 2008. It will be lucky to earn in total (sans inflation) what the sequel earned over its debut Fri-Sun frame.
In a world less obsessed with IP and franchises, this Hellboy reboot would never have been a thing. You had a franchise that existed with strong reviews, a beloved geek-friendly director and an environment where superhero movies were still somewhat rare, and both films still failed to justify themselves financially. Hellboy earned $99 million in 2004 on a $66 million budget, while Hellboy II: The Golden Army earned $160 million in 2008 on an $85 million budget.
Even if you’d argue that nostalgia and changing demographics would’ve made a third Ron Perlman Hellboy into a bigger deal, this R-rated reboot did little to entice newbies while alienating the faithful fanbase. This reboot depended entirely on whether the mere idea of a Hellboy film was enticing to general moviegoers. At least in North America, the answer is “no.”
'After'
Aviron Aviron released After into 2,138 theaters yesterday. The romantic drama is based on Anna Todd’s novel, one which began life as an online story which was straight-up fan-fiction about a young woman dating Harry Styles. The film earned $2.9 million yesterday, setting the stage for a halfway $7 million Fri-Sun frame. The Voltage production is allegedly doing well in some European markets, and this is a slightly-better-than-expected opening weekend for the Jenny Gage-directed flick.
More tragic was Laika’s Missing Link , which earned just $1.611 million in 3,413 theaters. That sets the toon up for a $5.6 million debut weekend, a miserable result compared to the $12 million-to-$17 million debuts of the first four Laika flicks. Even noting that United Artists Releasing isn’t the comparative powerhouse that Focus Features was, this is a disaster for one of the best production companies in town. Credit a low-profile release and a new environment where a major animated film that isn’t part of a franchise (or a really well-known brand like Illumination) is every bit as doomed as an original live-action flick."

Adidas Is Beating Nike,www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/04/13/adidas-is-beating-nike/,"Adidas AG is beating Nike Inc. on Wall Street recently, with shares that have gained 21.87%, so far this year, compared to 16.92% for Nike. Adidas shares have also outperformed the overall market, while Nike’s shares have moved in line with the market.
Comparing the two stocks is tricky, though. While Nike has outperformed Adidas over a three-year period, the company lags behind its competitor over a five years period.

Koyfin At any rate, Adidas has emerged as a serious contender of Nike both on Wall Street and Main Street.
In several ways.
One of them is the expansion of the scale and scope of its operations, which now consist of Adidas, Reebok, TaylorMade and Runtastic, which has pushed Adidas' gross margins well above those of NIKE's--see chart. That's something Wall Street keeps a close eye on.
.
Then there’s marketing buzz targeting the “innovators” and “early adopters,” consumers in the 15-30 age range, with new products that create instant sales bonanzas. NMD R1, for instance, sold 400,000 pairs on launch day alone. Ultraboost sold 11,000 pairs in the first hour.
Marketing buzz is also fueled by the innovative ways Adidas makes its products. Like its Yoga Collection, which is made from recycled ocean plastic. And its AlphaEdge 4D sneakers, which is made by using light and oxygen through a process called Digital Light Synthesis.
Adding to the buzz are collaborations and partnerships with celebrities and companies such as Pharell Williams, Run DMC, Kanye West, Bape, and Beyonce .
To be fair, Nike has also expanded its scale and scope of operations over time by adding new brands. It has launched effective buzz marketing campaigns with both innovative products and celebrity endorsements and collaborations. In fact, Nike beats Adidas in Google searches—see table.
Google Search Results Adidas vs Nike
Company Search results Adidas 3.27 trillion Nike 3.78 trillion Meanwhile, equity analysts rave about Nike’s strengths and business strategy. ""Some of the biggest strengths that Nike has shown in recent years are its innovation, product creation and deepening of one-on-one connections with its customers,” says Haris Anwar, Senior Analyst at global financial platform Investing.com. “The result of these efforts is that Nike is grabbing a greater market share from its main European rival, Adidas, even in its home market.”
Nike’s strategy has been more successful in Europe, according to Anwar. “By applying this focused strategy, Nike has been able to attract younger customers in European fashion hubs such as Paris and Berlin. In the most recent quarter when the company’s growth in North America didn’t meet analysts’ expectations, its sales continued to expand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, showing a greater penetration.”
That’s why he thinks that Nike is a more promising investment going forward than Adidas. “Due to Nike’s better execution of its marketing strategy, its growing online sales and its greater brand appeal to a younger audience, its shares offer much better long-term value than Adidas.""
Dr. Joseph Belmonte, author of Buffett and Beyond: Uncovering the Secret Ratio for Superior Stock Selection, likes Nike, too. “When we look at Nike we can see that it has a Clean Surplus ROE of 17% projected for 2019,” he observes . “It’s averaged a bit over 17% for the past 8 years or so which tells us that this company is operating more efficiently than the average company in either the Dow or the S&P whose stocks average a Clean Surplus ROE of 13.5%.”"

"Last Minute Dash: When, Where & How To File Those Last Minute Tax Returns In 2019",www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/04/13/last-minute-dash-when-where--how-to-file-those-last-minute-tax-returns-in-2019/,"If you’re planning on filing your federal income tax return in the next few days, you’re not alone: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says some 50 million taxpayers have yet to file ( as of April 12, 2019 ). No matter how close to the wire you get, as long as your return is postmarked by April 15, the IRS considers your federal income tax return filed on time. If you're not quite ready just yet and are skimming this article in the hopes that I'll offer you the tax prep equivalent of magic beans, I'll stop you right now. If you're not ready to file your return, don't panic, just file for an extension . But if you are ready to file, here's what you need to know:
File timely. If you plan to file a paper return or pay by check, be sure to put the return and/or check in first-class mail by the due date, April 15, 2019. Assuming all goes well, you'll have filed timely.
Keep proof of filing. But what if the IRS claims that it doesn’t receive your return? What then? Saying that you tossed the envelope into the post box doesn’t help you in that case. It’s impossible to prove that you mailed something on time without documentation. And the IRS loves documentation. Your best bet? Get documentation.
The law that governs timely filed returns can be found at 26 USC §7502(c). It says that registered mail ""shall be prima facie evidence that the return, claim, statement, or other document was delivered to the agency, officer, or office to which addressed"" and ""the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date."" Prima facie evidence is a fancy way of saying sufficient proof (remember, lawyers love Latin). In other words, the IRS will only accept registered (or certified mail per the Regs) as sufficient proof of mailing.
So if you mail your tax return via first class mail and it gets there, awesome. You’re good. But if it doesn’t? You have zero proof. The only real proof through the mail is certified or registered mail. So keep that in mind when you’re standing in line at the post office. It’s only a couple of extra dollars to send mail certified or registered and doing so is proof that you mailed the return when you said that you did.
Mail your return to the right address. The IRS also requires that you properly address your tax form. To do that, you'll want to match where you live and whether you're enclosing payment with the correct address.
If you live inside of the 50 states, use these addresses:
KPE/IRS
If you live outside of the 50 states, use these addresses:
IRS/KPE
However, if you live in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Mariana Islands, see IRS Pub 570, Tax Guide for Individuals With Income From U.S. Possessions (downloads as a PDF).
Remember, your return is only considered timely filed if it’s mailed to the right place by the right time so double check those addresses.
Use the right postage. You’ll also want to make sure you have the correct postage. Assuming you don’t upgrade to certified or registered, regular first-class postage is 55 cents, but according to the USPS , “[m]ost tax returns are several pages long and weigh more than 1 oz. Tax returns sent without enough postage will be returned.”
While you need that postmark by April 15, that doesn’t mean that you have to be out the door by 6:00 p.m. The US Post Office has extended hours on Tax Day at some locations to make life easier. You can use the Post Office locator on their site to figure out the hours of those post offices near located near you.
Double-check private delivery services. If you don't want to rely on the post office, you can also use a private delivery service to file your tax return. The IRS will consider your return timely filed if you use one of these private delivery services:
DHL Express : DHL Express 9:00, DHL Express 10:30, DHL Express 12:00, DHL Express Worldwide, DHL Express Envelope, DHL Import Express 10:30, DHL Import Express 12:00, DHL Import Express Worldwide FedEx : FedEx First Overnight; FedEx Priority Overnight; FedEx Standard Overnight; FedEx 2 Day; FedEx International Next Flight Out; FedEx International Priority; FedEx International First; and FedEx International Economy. UPS : UPS Next Day Air Early AM; UPS Next Day Air: UPS Next Day Air Saver; UPS 2nd Day Air; UPS 2nd Day Air A.M.; UPS Worldwide Express Plus; and UPS Worldwide Express.
Remember that most private delivery services cannot deliver to a PO box. To figure out which address to use, locate your service center using the “regular” address filing table above and find the physical address below (or click here for more info ):
KPE/IRS
If you're sending payment along with your filing, make your check or money order payable to ""United States Treasury"" for the amount due. Write ""2018 Form 1040"" and your Social Security Number on your payment. If you are filing a joint return, enter the Social Security Number shown first on your tax return. You'll also want to include your name, address, and daytime phone number - it might already be on your check. Don't attach the payment to your return using staples or paper clips. Instead, just include it loose, together with a completed form 1040-V (downloads as a pdf) in your envelope.
(And for the love of Pete, do not send cash. If you want to pay in cash, find out how here .)
File even if you don't have the cash to pay. If you don't have money to cover your entire tax bill, you should still send in your tax return. You can make arrangements by paying with a credit card or setting up an installment payment.
E-file your return. You can avoid all of the post office hassles by e-filing your return to file on time. The IRS encourages taxpayers to e-file: it saves time and, according to IRS, your return is likely to be more accurate. Payment options remain the same.
Help is available. If you run into trouble this weekend, help is available. The IRS will keep its toll-free telephone service lines open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time on Monday, April 15, to assist taxpayers. Be prepared wait, though, since the IRS expects to receive nearly 20 million tax returns in the last week of tax season. For most taxpayers, the best number to call is 1.800.829.1040.
File for an extension. If you’re still not ready to file your tax return? File for an extension. It’s free and easy. The IRS expects to receive about 14.6 million extension requests from taxpayers. For more on filing for an extension, click here ."
Appearance Of New Species After Mass Extinction Has Evolutionary 'Speed Limit',www.forbes.com,GrrlScientist,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2019/04/13/appearance-of-new-species-after-mass-extinction-has-evolutionary-speed-limit/,"How long will it take life on Earth to recover from the current climate and biodiversity crises? According to a new study of planktonic foraminifera fossils, it will take at least 10 million years

John Maisano How long does it take for life to recover after a mass extinction event? According to a new study, it takes at least ten million years before the diversity of living species achieves a similar level to that seen before the mass extinction event. This is according to findings by an international team of scientists who studied fossils from a group of planktic creatures known as foraminifera, or “forams”.
Forams are single-celled microscopic creatures that ooze their way around their tiny worlds. Paleobiologist Karen Wetmore, who was the invertebrate and microfossil collections manager at the University of California Museum of Paleontology for ten years, estimates there are approximately 4,000 foram species alive today ( more here ).
Forams are primarily marine creatures: most live on or in seafloor sediments, whilst others float around in the water column at various depths. A few species are found in freshwater or brackish environments, and a very few are non-aquatic soil-dwelling species ( ref ). Most forams create shells out of calcium carbonate (like clams and other shelled animals) or from sediment particles that they’ve cemented together. The shape of these shells are unique to each foram species and can be quite elaborate and beautiful to behold. It’s these structures that can become fossilized.
In this study, paleobiologist Christopher Lowery, a postdoctoral fellow who studies forams at the Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin , and his collaborator, paleobiologist Andrew Fraass, a Research Associate in the School of Earth Sciences at University of Bristol , who also is a foram expert, compared the physical complexity of foram fossils and their overall diversity.
“Foraminifera are useful at the species level because of their superior fossil record, so we’ve been able to look at this process in a closer way than anybody else,” said Dr. Fraass in a press release.
When the dinosaurs were wiped out, foram populations were also devastated, but a few species managed to survive. Dr. Lowery and Dr. Fraass studied foram fossils from a time period covering roughly 20 million years, beginning around the end of the Cretaceous mass extinction and extending through the ensuing recovery, to determine how long it took these minibeasts to recover their species diversity (Figure 1).

Christopher Lowery Based on their findings, Dr. Lowery and Dr. Fraass concluded that it took at least ten millions years for foram species diversity to recover. They also noted that the general pattern of recovery was that obviously distinct forams popped up first, followed by an increasing array of similar-looking species. Further, they saw that the physical complexity of these creatures recovered long before the overall number of species did.
“From this study, it’s reasonable to infer that it’s going to take an extremely long time -- millions of years -- to recovery from the extinction that we’re causing through climate change and other methods,” Dr. Fraass said in a press release.
Why must morphological complexity recover before diversity recovers?
Earth has experienced five mass extinction events before today. The most rapid of those was also the most recent; the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event that occurred 66 million years ago. That mass extinction was an accelerated event that resulted from an asteroid strike that triggered sudden environmental and climactic changes that wiped out 75% or more of all terrestrial animal life, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The K–Pg extinction event is comparable to the current climate and biodiversity crises because these modern processes are also occurring with unprecedented speed, compared to previous mass extinction events.

John Maisano But why does it take so long for species diversity to recover after a mass extinction event?
Animals and plants evolve to fill available niches within an existing ecosystem. But a mass extinction event not only wipes out biodiversity, but it also destroys existing ecosystems and the special niches that species occupy. As a result, brand-new ecological niches must arise from the devastation before new species can evolve to specifically fit them. New species arise by filling broad ecological niches within a recovering ecosystem, and then later evolve innovations that allow them to specialize in filling niche gaps that arise as the ecosystem grows increasingly complex. This process takes time, and that time lag is the source of the evolutionary “speed limit” for recovery after a mass extinction event.
This study provides fossil evidence in support of an argument made by a number of scientists that there was a ten million year -- or longer -- wait for Earth’s biodiversity to recover after each of the five previous mass extinction events. But most niches lost in previous mass extinctions are not resurrected -- entirely new niches develop.
“This should serve as an important reminder: some ecological niches lost due to anthropogenic climate change will never reappear,” the authors wrote in their study. This means that Earth will be radically different after a mass extinction, as it has been after the five previous extinction events.
Further, Dr. Lowery’s and Dr. Fraass’s findings are a powerful warning regarding Earth’s eventual recovery in the aftermath of the escalating climate and biodiversity crises.
At this time, there is still some argument whether we have already entered Earth’s sixth great extinction event, but there is no argument who is to blame: it’s people ( ref ). Human-driven changes to the planet have been documented as the cause of warming and acidifying oceans, habitat destruction, increasing pollution, increasing introduction of invasive species around the world, and warming climate; all of which are impacting plants and animals by driving them towards extinction.
Already, more than half of all individual animals have disappeared from the planet, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund ( report here ) -- a clear sign we’re teetering on the edge of the sixth mass extinction, if we’ve not already tipped over the edge into an irreversible catastrophe.
Not only will the Earth that we know be radically and irrevocably changed by a mass extinction event, it’s likely that humans will become extinct long before the planet recovers from the damages we’ve caused.
Dr. Lowery and Dr. Fraass have already started examining more forams from the late Jurassic through the present day to gain a deeper understanding of the history of this group as well as the history of Earth’s biodiversity.
“We’re hoping that examining the rest of the planktic foraminiferal record will give us insight into how climate shaped their evolution,” Dr. Fraass said in a press release. “With the past, slower, changes in climate we have in the geological record, we should be able to tease out more details about how climate change might impact these important plankton.”

15 Key Questions Venture Capitalists Will Ask Before Investing In Your Startup,www.forbes.com,Richard Harroch,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2019/04/13/questions-venture-capitalists-will-ask-before-investing-startups/,"Share to linkedin By Richard D. Harroch and Larry Kane
Venture capitalists make decisions constantly about whether or not to invest in various startups. The majority of the time, the answer is no. There can be many reasons for this decision, including that the startup is not within the firm’s focus or stage of desired investment. But assuming the company is within the investment parameters of the fund, here are 15 key determining factors for whether a venture firm will or will not decide to invest in a startup that is seeking venture capital. Ready to pursue VC funding? Be sure you understand the kinds of questions investors will ask. © ra2 studio 1. Is There a Great Management Team?
Many investors consider the team behind a startup more important than the idea or the product. The investors will want to know that the team has the right set of skills, drive, experience, and temperament to grow the business. Anticipate these questions: Who are the founders and key team members? What relevant domain experience does the team have? What key additions to the team are needed in the short term? Why is the team uniquely capable to execute the company’s business plan? How many employees does the company have? What motivates the founders? How do you plan to scale the team in the next 12 months?
Ultimately, the investor will need to make a judgment about whether the founder and team will be enjoyable to work with. Does the investor believe in the team? Is the CEO experienced and willing to listen? Also, involving experienced advisors can be very helpful in the early stages to help bridge an early stage team that is still growing. 2. Is the Market Opportunity Big?
Most investors are looking for businesses that can scale and become meaningful, so make sure you address the issue right up front as to why your business has the potential to become really big. Don’t present any small ideas. If the first product or service is small, then perhaps you need to position the company as a “platform” business allowing the creation of multiple products or apps. Investors will want to know the actual addressable market and what percentage of the market you plan to capture over time.
For most investors, a “big” market opportunity is in excess of $1 billion in sales annually. 3. What Positive Early Traction Has the Company Achieved?
One of the most important things for investors will be signs of any early traction or customers. A company that has obtained early traction will be more likely to obtain venture financing and with better terms. Examples of early traction can include the following: The creation of a beta or minimally viable product Initial or pilot customers, especially brand name customers Strategic partnerships Customer testimonials Admission into competitive programs such as Y Combinator or other technology accelerators or incubators
Investors will want to know, How can the early traction be accelerated? What has been the principal reason for the traction? How can the company can scale this early traction?
Don’t forget to show early buzz or press you have received, especially from prominent websites or publications. Feature the headlines in a slide on your investor pitch deck. List the number of articles and publications mentioning the company. 4. Are the Founders Passionate and Determined?
Many venture capitalists look for passionate and determined founders. Are they individuals who will be dedicated to growing the business and facing the inevitable challenges?
As Paul Martino, General Partner of Bullpen Capital , says:
“We have a saying at Bullpen that we like ‘blue collar’ CEOs. That means that we like to see nuts-and-bolts operators, not pie-in-the-sky dreamers. Demonstrate that you’ve spent time looking up our background and investment portfolio finding mutual interests. I like founders who (1) know their metrics cold; (2) have a clear idea of the business they’re in; and (3) know how to grow it. What gets my attention is a hard-nosed, determined founder who, with a few operational pointers combined with a solid, already existing plan, can get to an even bigger outcome. That’s the kind of ride I want to take.”
Deepak Kamra, General Partner of Canaan Partners , makes a related point:
“Yes, you need to appear professional if you are going to be starting a serious business, but you need to show some passion and enthusiasm. Startups are hard, and they take a long time, and you will need to show that you have the inner drive to get through the highs and lows. This doesn’t mean you have to jump up and down and wave your arms. Perhaps it’s a story about what is driving you to get into your business, why it’s personal, or why there is nothing else you would rather do than spend the next 5 to 10 years living and breathing this idea of yours.” 5. Do the Founders Understand the Financials and Key Metrics of Their Business?
Venture capitalists look for founders who truly understand the financials and key metrics of their business. You need to show that you have a handle on all of those and are able to articulate them coherently.
Mark Patricof, founder of Patricof & Co. , says:
“Know exactly what you want to spend your money on. Don’t tell me how long it will last; tell me what you want to prove. The most impressive entrepreneurs communicate the value of their businesses through numbers. A conversation centered on a company’s revenue growth, sales funnel, and customer churn causes an immediate connection with investors because when entrepreneurs position themselves as metrics-driven, it’s as though they’ve entered an investor’s mind.”
Josh Stein, General Partner of DFJ Ventures , says:
“Know your KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Effective entrepreneurs understand what their top priorities are and manage their companies by focusing their teams around a handful of critical metrics that reflect those priorities. I’m always interested when a founder can articulate her KPIs, talk intellectually about her team executing to improve them, and has a clear sense of where those metrics can be in a year or two.” 6. Has the Entrepreneur Been Referred to Me by a Trusted Colleague?
Venture firms get inundated with unsolicited executive summaries and pitch decks. Most of the time, those solicitations are ignored. The way to capture the attention of a venture capitalist is to get a warm introduction from a trusted colleague: an entrepreneur, a lawyer, an investment banker, an angel investor, or another venture capitalist. 7. Is the Initial Investor Pitch Deck Professional and Interesting?
The first thing the venture investor will expect is to see a 15-20 page investor pitch deck before taking a meeting. From the pitch deck, the investor hopes to see an interesting business model with committed entrepreneurs and big opportunity. So make sure you have prepared and vetted a great pitch deck. Looking at other pitch decks and executive summaries can help you improve your own. See How to Create a Great Investor Pitch Deck for Startups Seeking Financing. 8. What Are the Potential Risks to the Business?
Investors want to understand what risks there might be to the business. They want to understand your thought process and the mitigating precautions you are taking to reduce those risks. There inevitably are risks in any business plan, so be prepared to answer these questions thoughtfully: What do you see as the principal risks to the business? What legal risks do you have? Will the business model comply with applicable laws, including expanding privacy protections? What technology risks do you have? Do you have any regulatory risks? Are there any product liability risks? What steps do you anticipate taking to mitigate such risks?
Startups that can show they have reduced or eliminated product, technology, sales, or market risks will have an advantage in fund-raising. 9. Why Is the Company’s Product Great?
The entrepreneur must clearly articulate what the company’s product or service consists of and why it is unique, so entrepreneurs should expect to get the following questions: Why do users care about your product or service? What are the major product milestones? What are the key differentiated features of your product or service? What have you learned from early versions of the product or service? What are the two or three key features you plan to add? How often do you envision enhancing or updating the product or service? 10. How Will My Investment Capital Be Used and What Progress Will Be Made With That Capital?
Investors will absolutely want to know how their capital will be invested and your proposed burn rate (so that they can understand when you may need the next round of financing). It will also allow the investors to test whether your fund-raising plans are reasonable given the capital requirements you will have. And it will allow the investors to see whether your estimate of costs (e.g., for engineering talent, for marketing costs, or office space) is reasonable given their experiences with other companies. Investors want to make sure at minimum that you have capital to meet your next milestone so you can raise more financing. 11. Is the Expected Valuation for the Company Realistic?
If you tell an investor you want a $100 million valuation even though you started the business three weeks ago, or don’t have much traction yet, the conversation will likely end very quickly. Often, it’s best not to discuss valuation in a first meeting other than to say you expect to be reasonable on valuation. But the venture investor also doesn’t want to waste a lot of time on a deal if the valuation expectations are unreasonable or not attractive.
Valuation at an early stage of a technology company is more of an art than a science. To help bridge the valuation gap for early stage startups, you often see investors looking for a convertible instrument with customary conversion discounts and valuation caps. These instruments, such as convertible notes and “SAFEs,” have become quite common. For more information about this, be sure to read A Guide to Venture Capital Financings for Startups . 12. Does the Company Have Differentiated Technology?
As most venture investors invest in software, internet, mobile, or other technology companies, an analysis of the startup’s technology or proposed technology is critical. The questions the investors will pursue include: How differentiated is the company’s technology? What competitive advantages will there be over existing technology? How easy will it be to replicate the technology? How costly will it be to build the technology into each product? 13. What Is the Company’s Intellectual Property?
For many companies, their intellectual property will be a key to success. Investors will pay particular attention to your answers to these questions: What key intellectual property does the company have (patents, patents pending, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, domain names)? What comfort is there that the company’s intellectual property does not violate the rights of a third party? How was the company’s intellectual property developed? Would any prior employers of a team member have a potential claim to the company’s intellectual property? Is the intellectual property properly owned by the company, and have all employees and consultants assigned the intellectual property over to the company? If the intellectual property was developed at a university or through government grants or with open source technology, how does the company have the right to use the technology? 14. Are the Company’s Financial Projections Realistic and Interesting?
If you present investors with projections showing the company will achieve $5 million in revenue in five years, they will have little interest. Investors want to invest in a company that can grow significantly and become an exciting business. Alternatively, if you show projections in which the company predicts to be at $500 million in three years, the investors will just think you are unrealistic, especially if you are at zero in revenues today. Avoid assumptions in your projections that will be difficult to justify, such as how you will get to a 400% growth in revenue with only a 20% growth in operating and marketing costs.
In order to believe your financial projections, investors will want you to articulate the key assumptions you have and convince them those assumptions are reasonable. If you can’t do that, then the investors won’t feel you have a real handle on the business. Expect that investors will push back on the assumptions and they will want you to have a cogent, thoughtful response. 15. Is Your Legal Formation Clean and in Compliance with Applicable Laws?
Investors don’t want to invest in a company that has legal issues with the founders or third parties, failed to properly issue stock or options, failed to make securities law filings, has unaccredited investors, or hasn’t complied with employment laws—these are all red flags. Before pitching your business, you need to make sure the company is clean from a legal perspective. An experienced startup lawyer can help significantly. See 10 Big Legal Mistakes Made by Startups .

Box Office: 'Shazam' Tops Friday Despite 69% Drop As 'Pet Semetary' Crumbles,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/13/box-office-shazam-pet-semetary-captain-marvel-dumbo-us-best-of-enemies-dc-films-stephen-king/,"It wasn't a great Friday for holdovers. Shazam! will easily top the weekend for the second frame in a row, but its hold was merely adequate for the genre. The well-reviewed and well-received DC Films flick earned $6.365 million on Friday, a 69% drop from its $20.5 million Friday gross. That positions the film for a $22.7 million Fri-Sun frame, a drop of 58% from the $53.5 million debut but a drop of 61% from the whole $56.8 million debut (counting $3.3 million in sneak previews). I'm inclined to count the whole thing since most folks who showed up for a sneak preview would have otherwise shown up on opening weekend. Depending on which stat you use, it either fell a little bit worse than Captain America: The Winter Soldier (-56% in weekend two) or about on par with Spider-Man: Homecoming (-62%) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (-61%). We're talking about a $90 million-budgeted flick that will have $92.5 million domestic in ten days and around $255 million worldwide by the end of the weekend. So, yes, it's a hit as it is now just shy of three times its budget. The question is whether it rallies after the second weekend (as did Spider-Man: Homecomin g) and becomes a group choice or second-choice pick (like the late-1990s/early 2000s Adam Sandler films) for general moviegoers.
For what it's worth, with Missing Link DOA (sob) and Avengers: Endgame clocking in at 182 minutes, it could stick around as the big kid-flick of choice until WB's Detective Pikachu on May 10. It's not like WB and New Line's Curse of La Llorona is going to pull in the kiddies next weekend, and the stuff opening on May 3 (Long Shot, The Intruder, etc.) are mostly for adults . I was hoping it would hold a little better, but money is money and WB was smart not to spend $150 million on this distinctly B-level character. At worst, we're still looking at Conjuring Universe-level grosses.
Pet Semetary fell 70.5% on Friday for a $2.93 million gross, setting the stage for a $9 million (-63%) second weekend and $40.1 million ten-day cume. I'm less optimistic about this one since A) it's not very good and B) it's going to face off against the aforementioned ""not a Conjuring movie"" next weekend. That drop is right in like with the likes of previous remakes of Halloween , Poltergeist and The Evil Dead . So, presuming it follows accordingly, Paramount/Viacom's $21 million-budgeted remake/re-adaptation of the Stephen King book should earn around $55 million domestic, or less than the $57 million earned back in 1989 by Mary Lambert's first adaptation of this story.
Walt Disney's Dumbo earned another $2.268 million (-54%) on its third Friday, setting the stage for an $8.4 million (-54%) third weekend and disappointing $89.2 million 17-day cume. It will pass $100 million domestic, but at best it's looking like the $170 million-budgeted Tim Burton movie will end up about $330 million worldwide. In better Disney news, Captain Marvel earned another $2.2 million (-35%) on its sixth Friday. That sets the MCU movie up for an $8.2 million (-35%) weekend and $386 million 38-day cume. So, yeah, it'll pass $400 million domestic over the next few weeks and could still climb past the $412.5 million cume of Wonder Woman .
Jordan Peele's Us earned another $2.09 million (-52%) on its fourth Friday, setting the $20 million horror flick up for a $6.612 million (-52%) weekend and $163.165 million 24-day domestic cume. That'll put it right between Halloween ($159 million in 2018) and Hannibal ($165 million in 2001) among R-rated horror flicks. It should pass the $175 million cume of Get Out but the $189 million total of A Quiet Place may be a challenge. The film hasn't been very leggy, but then sometimes that happens when a horror movie opens with $71 million. Blumhouse's Halloween barely made double its $76 million last October.
STX's Best of Enemies earned $600,000 (-63%) on its second Friday. The indifferently received civil rights drama (starring Sam Rockwell and Taraji P. Henson) will earn $2 million (-54%) in weekend two for a mediocre $8.19 million ten-day cume. Any hope that this would leg out as an adult multiplex flick of choice alongside the pre-summer and in-summer tentpoles is essentially gone. To be fair, it's just not a very good movie, and the way it frames racism as something that imperils white people (most of the menace or violence is directed at white folks) is just odd even if you argue that the film is intended for white audiences."

A Major Weekend At The Masters - Tiger Woods Now Betting Favorite And 1 Shot Back Of 5 Co-Leaders,www.forbes.com,Jay Ginsbach,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayginsbach/2019/04/13/a-major-weekend-at-the-masters-tiger-woods-now-betting-favorite-and-1-shot-back-of-5-co-leaders/,"A record five players are tied for the 36-hold lead at the 2019 Masters. And all five players are major champions, including the lone Masters champ Adam Scott (2013). First round leader Brooks Koepka along with Francesco Molinari, Louis Oosthuizen and Jason Day are all 7-under par heading into ‘moving day’ on Saturday. If the star power on top wasn’t enough, Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson are both 6-under par along with Xander Schauffele and South African Justin Harding. Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter are still in contention at 5-under par followed by an American foursome at 4-under - Matt Kutcher, Charles, Howell III, Patton Kizzire and 3-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson. Tournament favorite Rory McIlroy is even par and tied for 36th into the weekend at Augusta National. Bettors interested in wagering on the Masters winner can do so following each round, as the oddsmakers adjust the odds to win. Despite chasing five major champions and having himself not won a major championship in more than a decade, 4-time Masters champion Tiger Woods is now the favorite to win the Green Jacket at 6-1.

Despite being the favorite in the updated betting market, Woods is given just an 8.8% chance to win the Masters by a professional bettor and analytics expert. Dustin Johnson is the favorite at 15.6%.

But while the big names and big hitters rise to the top of the leaderboard on the weekend, Mother Nature is making some noise over the hallowed grounds at Augusta National. A 50% chance of rain is in the forecast at Augusta Saturday with scattered thunderstorms in the morning. The leaders on Sunday will likely be dealing with thunderstorms in the afternoon and chance of rain at 80%. Winds could reach 20 miles per hour.
The soft conditions should result in lower scorers, as players will be able to hold the greens more with their longer irons into softer greens. However, the putting greens are where problems persist for many players at Augusta that also fail to hit their approach shots closer to the pin.

ASSOCIATED PRESS The ultimate hole-by-hole guide to Augusta National And Augusta National, of course, is no place to have putting problems.
Tiger Woods’ weekend will come down to his putting. A year ago, in Woods' first Masters since 2015, he three-putted twice on the final day and took 32 putts after hitting 15 of 18 greens. He missed five putts inside of 6 feet and still shot 69. In Friday’s second round this year, Woods missed more short putts, but also bombed in a few from outside 25 feet on the back nine on his way to a 4-under 68 to move him within 1 shot of the lead into the weekend.
The Westgate Superbook head golf oddsmaker Jeff Sherman has posted Tiger Woods 3rd round over/under score at 69.5.
Woods seems to be happy with his putting following Friday’s round.
” I had great speed today. The only two bad putts I hit today were all on the same hole, over on 8, I 3‑putted. I had a bad first putt and a bad second putt. But other than that my speed was great and I hit a lot of putts that looked like they were going in, but they were on my lines, so that's fun.”
Tiger Woods winning the Masters would not be fun for the sportsbooks. Woods is a major liability if he wins, and some sportsbooks would take a 7-figure hit including William Hill US and FanDuel following their huge promotion. Prior to the tournament, William Hill took an $85,000 bet on Woods to win the Masters at 14-1 odds - a $1.19 million score for the bettor if Woods wins.
DraftKings said it has 27% of the money bet is on Tiger to win, while William Hill has 14%, FanDuel and Westgate SuperBook 10%. A good weekend of putting and a Woods win at the Masters will really hurt many sportsbooks.
But the putts Tiger used to make just aren't going in as much. Going into the Masters, Woods has three-putted 14 times out of 288 holes to rank 209th on tour. Jordan Spieth is tied for 162nd as he’s struggled with the flat stick. Justin Rose leads the category, having three-putted just three times in 360 holes.
It’s quite common for players to struggle on the greens at Augusta, and pre-tournament Masters favorite Rory McIlroy is one of those that is having putting problems and sits even par and tied for 36th into the weekend.
How hard are the greens at Augusta ? Over the past four years, Augusta has the highest three-putt rate of any Tour stop. Players three-putt 5.4 percent of Augusta National’s greens (once per round), compared to the Tour average rate of 3 percent (once in 1.9 rounds). From any distance, you’ll see about 80 percent more three-putts at Augusta.
The Masters is annually one of the toughest scoring courses on Tour. In four of the last six years. Augusta has played as one of the seven toughest courses on the PGA Tour, and last year the average score was 72.93. The two previous years it was higher and averaged better than 74.00, or more than two shots over par.
This year, the field scoring average was 71.98 on Friday, and no player in the field scored a triple bogey or worse. In Thursday’s opening round, the field average was 72.87. More stats and numbers to know heading into the weekend include the a verage score for Masters champions in the third round - 70.16.
 The players over the weekend that are more precise with their approach shots and gain more strokes on approach and putting will be the group of players remaining on the back 9 Sunday with a chance to win the Masters and wear the Green Jacket.
Tiger Woods may now be the betting favorite with 36 holes to play at the Masters, but odds are still stronger that he will not be wearing another Green Jacket on Sunday.
You can bet on it."
Black Hole Storage,www.forbes.com,Tom Coughlin,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2019/04/13/black-hole-storage/,"Black holes are created when a supermassive star collapses, creating a region in space where the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. These strange objects don’t emit radiation directly, but radiation is emitted by matter accelerating as it enters the event horizon of the black hole (this is the region around the center of the black hole where the gravity becomes so high that light, once it enters, cannot escape). Radiation can also be emitted when particle/antiparticle pairs are created at the event horizon, where one of the pair enters the black hole and the other does not (this is called Hawking radiation after the physicist, Stephen Hawking). Using an array of 8 international radio telescopes astrophysicists have used sophisticated signal processing algorithms to turn 14 petabytes of data obtained from observations of a black hole in a neighboring galaxy into the first image of the event horizon of a black hole. The figure below, which appeared on the front of newspapers worldwide a few days ago, is shown below.
Messier 87 Black Hole Event Horizon Image
From International Event Horizon Telescope Project This particular black hole is located 55 million light-years away (in galaxy Messier 87), is 3 million times the size of the Earth, with a mass 6.5 times that of the Earth’s sun. An article in the Register gives details on the 8 detection sites and the very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) method used to combine the various images.
The actual images processed were captured from April 5-11, 2017. Each telescope generated about 350 TB of data a day. The data was recorded in parallel on 32 HGST (Western Digital) helium filled HDDs, first obtained in 2015. According to Western Digital, “In 2015, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project shared they would be using our (then HGST branded) Ultrastar® HelioSeal® hard disk drives (HDDs) to store the captured imaging data for the supermassive black hole. These were the first, and at that time the only, sealed helium-filled HDDs in the world. Using helium-sealed drives was the only way for EHT ensure that data could be captured in remote locations, particularly high-altitude observatories, where all other storage devices physically failed due to the harsh environmental conditions.”
The real key to extracting this amazing image of the event horizon of a black hole was the use of advanced signal processing algorithms to process all this data. An important algorithm for this work was contributed by IEEE Signal Processing Society member, Katie Bouman. Katie developed the algorithm while she was a graduate student at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT. The below picture shows Katie with hard disk drives used in the black hole event horizon imaging project.

"Last Minute Dash: When, Where & How To File Those Last Minute Tax Returns In 2019",www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/04/13/last-minute-dash-when-where--how-to-file-those-last-minute-tax-returns-in-2019/?ss=taxes,"If you’re planning on filing your federal income tax return in the next few days, you’re not alone: the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says some 50 million taxpayers have yet to file ( as of April 12, 2019 ). No matter how close to the wire you get, as long as your return is postmarked by April 15, the IRS considers your federal income tax return filed on time. If you're not quite ready just yet and are skimming this article in the hopes that I'll offer you the tax prep equivalent of magic beans, I'll stop you right now. If you're not ready to file your return, don't panic, just file for an extension . But if you are ready to file, here's what you need to know:
File timely. If you plan to file a paper return or pay by check, be sure to put the return and/or check in first-class mail by the due date, April 15, 2019. Assuming all goes well, you'll have filed timely.
Keep proof of filing. But what if the IRS claims that it doesn’t receive your return? What then? Saying that you tossed the envelope into the post box doesn’t help you in that case. It’s impossible to prove that you mailed something on time without documentation. And the IRS loves documentation. Your best bet? Get documentation.
The law that governs timely filed returns can be found at 26 USC §7502(c). It says that registered mail ""shall be prima facie evidence that the return, claim, statement, or other document was delivered to the agency, officer, or office to which addressed"" and ""the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date."" Prima facie evidence is a fancy way of saying sufficient proof (remember, lawyers love Latin). In other words, the IRS will only accept registered (or certified mail per the Regs) as sufficient proof of mailing.
So if you mail your tax return via first class mail and it gets there, awesome. You’re good. But if it doesn’t? You have zero proof. The only real proof through the mail is certified or registered mail. So keep that in mind when you’re standing in line at the post office. It’s only a couple of extra dollars to send mail certified or registered and doing so is proof that you mailed the return when you said that you did.
Mail your return to the right address. The IRS also requires that you properly address your tax form. To do that, you'll want to match where you live and whether you're enclosing payment with the correct address.
If you live inside of the 50 states, use these addresses:
KPE/IRS
If you live outside of the 50 states, use these addresses:
IRS/KPE
However, if you live in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or the Northern Mariana Islands, see IRS Pub 570, Tax Guide for Individuals With Income From U.S. Possessions (downloads as a PDF).
Remember, your return is only considered timely filed if it’s mailed to the right place by the right time so double check those addresses.
Use the right postage. You’ll also want to make sure you have the correct postage. Assuming you don’t upgrade to certified or registered, regular first-class postage is 55 cents, but according to the USPS , “[m]ost tax returns are several pages long and weigh more than 1 oz. Tax returns sent without enough postage will be returned.”
While you need that postmark by April 15, that doesn’t mean that you have to be out the door by 6:00 p.m. The US Post Office has extended hours on Tax Day at some locations to make life easier. You can use the Post Office locator on their site to figure out the hours of those post offices near located near you.
Double-check private delivery services. If you don't want to rely on the post office, you can also use a private delivery service to file your tax return. The IRS will consider your return timely filed if you use one of these private delivery services:
DHL Express : DHL Express 9:00, DHL Express 10:30, DHL Express 12:00, DHL Express Worldwide, DHL Express Envelope, DHL Import Express 10:30, DHL Import Express 12:00, DHL Import Express Worldwide FedEx : FedEx First Overnight; FedEx Priority Overnight; FedEx Standard Overnight; FedEx 2 Day; FedEx International Next Flight Out; FedEx International Priority; FedEx International First; and FedEx International Economy. UPS : UPS Next Day Air Early AM; UPS Next Day Air: UPS Next Day Air Saver; UPS 2nd Day Air; UPS 2nd Day Air A.M.; UPS Worldwide Express Plus; and UPS Worldwide Express.
Remember that most private delivery services cannot deliver to a PO box. To figure out which address to use, locate your service center using the “regular” address filing table above and find the physical address below (or click here for more info ):
KPE/IRS
If you're sending payment along with your filing, make your check or money order payable to ""United States Treasury"" for the amount due. Write ""2018 Form 1040"" and your Social Security Number on your payment. If you are filing a joint return, enter the Social Security Number shown first on your tax return. You'll also want to include your name, address, and daytime phone number - it might already be on your check. Don't attach the payment to your return using staples or paper clips. Instead, just include it loose, together with a completed form 1040-V (downloads as a pdf) in your envelope.
(And for the love of Pete, do not send cash. If you want to pay in cash, find out how here .)
File even if you don't have the cash to pay. If you don't have money to cover your entire tax bill, you should still send in your tax return. You can make arrangements by paying with a credit card or setting up an installment payment.
E-file your return. You can avoid all of the post office hassles by e-filing your return to file on time. The IRS encourages taxpayers to e-file: it saves time and, according to IRS, your return is likely to be more accurate. Payment options remain the same.
Help is available. If you run into trouble this weekend, help is available. The IRS will keep its toll-free telephone service lines open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time on Monday, April 15, to assist taxpayers. Be prepared wait, though, since the IRS expects to receive nearly 20 million tax returns in the last week of tax season. For most taxpayers, the best number to call is 1.800.829.1040.
File for an extension. If you’re still not ready to file your tax return? File for an extension. It’s free and easy. The IRS expects to receive about 14.6 million extension requests from taxpayers. For more on filing for an extension, click here ."
How To Pay Your Tax Bill In 2019,www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/04/13/how-to-pay-your-tax-bill-in-2019/?ss=taxes,"Ready to file your federal income tax return? If you owe taxes, don't forget to pay what you owe by Tax Day. If you pay your taxes in full by April 15, 2019, you'll avoid additional penalties and interest. Here are several options for paying your tax bill this year: 1. Pay by cash. It used to be the case that you couldn't pay your federal income tax bill in cash. Now, however, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offers a way for you to pay your taxes using PayNearMe. You can find a list of locations near you here .
To make a payment, you'll need to visit the Official Payments page and follow the instructions. The IRS will then send you a code that you can take to a participating retailer where the clerk will scan the code so that you can make your payment. The whole process generally takes five to seven business days - which means your payment won't be timely for 2019 - but if cash is your only option, it's better to pay late than not at all. There is a fee ($3.99) to use the PayNearMe system, and the largest payment you can make is $1,000.
For more on paying with cash, click here .
2. Pay by check or money order. You can pay by check or money order even if you e-file. To pay what you owe, make your check or money order payable to ""United States Treasury"" for the full amount due. Write ""2018 Form 1040"" on the memo line together with your Social Security Number (if you are filing a joint return, write the SSN shown first on your tax return on the memo line). Make sure that your name, address, daytime phone number are on the check; that info may already be printed on your check so no need to duplicate it. Include payment together with a form 1040-V, Payment Voucher (downloads as a pdf) and mail the payment together with your form 1040-V to the address that corresponds to the state where you live:
IRS/KPE
While I know that writing a check to pay your taxes can be painful, be smart: Don't write a check that you don't have the funds to cover. You're not fooling anybody, and there is a penalty for writing a bad check to the IRS ($25 or 2% of the check, whichever is more). It's not worth it.
And remember that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) no longer accepts checks over $100 million (you're welcome)
3. Direct Pay. You can pay your taxes directly from your checking or savings account. To make a payment, click on over to the Direct Pay page . You'll choose the tax form (1), the reason for payment (2) and the tax year (3):
IRS/KPE
You'll need to verify your identity by providing information about your filing status from your last return as well as your name, SSN, birth date and address. Enter the payment amount, payment date and your bank account information. Click through to the end and you're done. The IRS doesn't keep your bank account information after payments are made and there is no fee for using the system.
You can schedule a payment or pay the same day, but IRS Direct Pay won't accept more than two payments within a 24-hour period. And if you owe bunches, note that each payment must be less than $10 million.
4. Pay by wire. Consider a same-day wire from your bank or financial institution. Contact your bank or financial institution - not the IRS - for details, including fees and deadlines. To make a payment, download and complete the Same Day Payment Worksheet to take with you to make the wire.
For information on making international wire transfers, check out this prior post .
5. Pay by Electronic Funds Withdrawal. Electronic Funds Withdrawal (EFW) is an option that you can use to pay by direct debit from your bank account. The IRS doesn’t charge a fee to use EFW but your financial institution might (check first to avoid a last-minute panic). You'll need to know your bank routing and account numbers (more on those here ). For more information about EFW, click here .
6. Pay by Debit or Credit Card. You can pay what you owe by debit or credit card. Most of the approved IRS payment processors accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. You can find a list of payment processors here .
Generally, there's no limit on the amount you can pay, but you are restricted to paying by credit card two times in one year for the same individual tax bill . High-balance payments of more than $100,000 may require coordination with your credit card or debit card provider.
Third-party credit and debit card providers may charge a fee, which may vary by provider, card type, and payment amount. Applicable fees for debit cards range from $2.00 to $3.95 while fees for credit cards range from 1.87% to 1.99% (minimum fees apply). The convenience fee paid to your provider will be listed as ""Tax Payment Convenience Fee"" or something similar, while the tax payment will show ""United States Treasury Tax Payment.""

To make a payment using EFTPS online, log in and follow the prompts. You can schedule your payment by 8 p.m. EST at least one calendar day in advance of the due date. It's worth noting that your tax payment is due even if the website is not available, so plan ahead.
You must be enrolled to use EFTPS. To enroll, click here and follow the steps. After your information is validated with the IRS, you'll receive a personal identification number (PIN) in the mail in five to seven business days. Between the IRS and the U.S. Postal Service, you're going to need to be patient.
Also, as scammers ramp up their efforts to steal your personal and financial information, keep in mind that EFTPS will never contact you via e-mail . If you receive an e-mail that claims to be from the EFTPS tax payment service or from a sender you do not recognize that claims to have information about a payment scheduled through this service, forward the e-mail to phishing@irs.gov or call the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at 1.800.366.4484.
A few more payment tips:
Plan ahead. If you pay by mail, your payment is generally treated as paid as of the date of the postmark. For other payment options, your payment is considered received when accepted, not initialized. Be sure to schedule electronic payments in advance to avoid late fees and penalties. And remember that accidents happen, so leave some extra time, just in case. These options apply if you’re filing your tax return and if you’re filing for an extension. Remember, an extension extends the time to file, not the time to pay. You’ll want to make a payment with your extension request if you will owe tax. For more on extensions, click here . Paying late? Pay anyway. Notwithstanding the above, it's better to pay late than not at all. If you're going to be late, don't let it stop you. Be smart. No matter how you choose to pay, do not send cash through the mail. Pay attention to your clicks. If you’re not sure that you’re using a legitimate payment method, you can always click back to the IRS website. Only use the methods approved by the IRS. Remember that you cannot pay your taxes with iTunes or other gift cards (more here ). Use the right currency . Even if you’re paying tax on foreign income, you must pay in U.S. dollars. And here's your money-saving tip of the day: You do not have to send payment if the amount you owe is under $1.
This information, of course, assumes that you have the money to pay your tax bill. If you can't pay your tax bill in full, consider an installment agreement or check out these options ."
IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig Has A Message To Taxpayers: Thank You,www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/04/13/irs-commissioner-chuck-rettig-has-a-message-to-taxpayers-thank-you-for-filing/?ss=taxes,"Charles (""Chuck"") P. Rettig is the 49th Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and was sworn in on October 1, 2018. Prior to joining the agency, Rettig spent 36 years as a tax lawyer in private practice. He earned his college degree in economics from the University of California at Los Angeles, his JD (law degree) at Pepperdine University School of Law and his LL.M. (masters of law degree) in Tax at New Your University School of Law. It's been a challenging year for some taxpayers. In response, Chuck Rettig has a message : Thank You.
The text of his message follows, unedited, in its entirety.
As the tax filing deadline approaches on April 15, I’d like to thank taxpayers for taking the time to file and pay their taxes. Our nation’s tax system is built around the concept of voluntary tax compliance, meaning citizens comply with their civic duty each year by preparing and filing their taxes – without direct government intervention.
This principle has helped make our tax system a model for the entire world. Thanks to taxpayers, this system helps fund our great nation. Each year, 95% of the gross receipts of our country flows through the IRS – about $3.5 trillion last year – funding critical aspects of the U.S., ranging from roads and schools to the nation’s military.
Behind the scenes, this couldn’t happen without the devoted work of IRS employees across America, in places like Atlanta, Austin, Ogden, Kansas City and elsewhere. We have employees in every state and working in numerous different capacities. Our employees interact with more Americans than any other institution, public or private. They make a difference, they care, and they take great pride in serving taxpayers and our country.
This year, their work has taken on even more importance as we faced the biggest tax law changes since 1986. Our teams labored through two holiday seasons, weekends and many even missed birthdays and family events to ensure IRS filing systems were starting in January 2019.
Due to these efforts, we’ve had a smooth filing season. Our IT systems set a new record in January, accepting more than 1.9 million tax returns in a single hour – that’s 536 tax returns a second. By the time the filing deadline hits more than 130 million tax returns will have been filed, and more than $250 billion in refunds will have been processed – all while helping protect against tax-related identity theft. Efforts to provide quality taxpayer services and protecting taxpayer data will always remain a priority for the IRS.
When taxpayers file their returns, they should feel confident that others are doing the right thing too. Fair but rigorous enforcement of the tax laws is critical to ensuring fairness in our tax system. Our employees who audit returns, collect taxes, and investigate fraud all work hard throughout the year to fairly enforce the laws while respecting taxpayer rights.
As the tax deadline approaches, I want you to know the IRS appreciates the time and personal effort everyone takes to file their taxes in support of our great nation. If someone needs tax help in the coming days, IRS.gov has many options available. And if more time is needed to file, don’t panic – taxpayers can file for an automatic six-month extension.
We sometimes refer to our employees as ""IRS Ambassadors"" recognizing that they routinely give back to their communities. Many volunteer to help low-income and older Americans prepare their taxes. When disaster strikes, thousands of our employees routinely help answer phone calls for victims calling in to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, provide tax information at Disaster Recovery Centers and lend a hand providing security.
I’m very proud of every IRS employee. They remain dedicated to helping taxpayers understand and meet their filing obligations. Our employees make a difference, and they take pride in serving taxpayers and our country. We’re also hiring people to join our IRS family– if you know someone who may be interested, please suggest they visit usajobs.gov.
Beyond technical skills, the success of the IRS also depends on respecting taxpayer rights and treating everyone we encounter with fairness. My pledge to taxpayers is that we at the IRS will continue to keep taxpayer rights paramount in all of our interactions. Inside our agency, we understand, accept and value our differences, and strive to maintain an inclusive and diverse workplace, where employees treat each other with kindness and civility. We will continue to carry those values with us in all of our dealings with taxpayers as well. We believe every person is important, none more or less so than any others. By valuing and respecting each other, we are better able to move forward together.
I’m Chuck Rettig, and that’s why I’m proud to say: ""I work for the IRS."""
IRS Addresses Top Tax Refund Myths As Tax Day Approaches,www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/04/13/irs-addresses-top-tax-refund-myths-as-tax-day-approaches/?ss=taxes,"It was a clunky tax season opening on January 28, 2019, with taxpayers grappling with new tax forms, new rules, and a government shutdown. While some 50 million taxpayers have yet to file ( as of April 12, 2019 ), tens of millions have already filed and are eagerly awaiting their tax refunds. While they wait, taxpayers are often bombarded with bad information about what to expect. To help sort out the truth from the confusion, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a list of refund-related myths : Myth 1: Calling the IRS or a tax professional will provide a better refund date.
Put the phone down. You might have heard that calling the IRS or calling their tax professional is the best way to find out when they will get their tax refund. It is not. Here’s what will really happen:
You may stay on hold for a phenomenally long time; and Your tax professional will hate you (he or she is still trying to get returns out for other clients)
The fastest way to check on your refund is online through the Where’s My Refund? tool at IRS.gov or via the IRS2Go mobile app (you can find out more here ). Those without access to the internet can call the IRS automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954.
When you go online or call, you’ll need your Social Security number, filing status and the amount of your anticipated refund. If you filed your return electronically, you can check your refund status within 24 hours after IRS indicates receipt of your return. If you file a paper tax return, you’ll need to wait longer – usually about four weeks. There’s no need to check over and over throughout the day: records are only updated by IRS once per day, usually overnight.
Still itching to pick up the phone? You should only call the IRS tax help hotline to talk to a representative if it has been:
21 days or more since you e-filed your tax return; Six weeks or more since you mailed your tax return; or If Where’s My Refund? indicates that you should contact the IRS.
Myth 2: Ordering a tax transcript is a ""secret way"" to get a refund date.
It’s always fun when you find a life hack on the internet. Who knew that trick about how to best eat a pineapple or the special method to clean your ceiling fan? But when it comes to taxes, don’t believe the hacks. Specifically, ordering a tax transcript will not help you find out exactly when you might get your refund. The information on a transcript does not necessarily reflect the amount or timing of a refund. While you can use a tax transcript to validate past income and tax filing status for mortgage, student, and small business loan applications and to help with tax preparation, you should use Where’s My Refund? to check the status of their refund. The codes that you’ll see on your tax transcripts do not offer additional information about when your refund will be issued.
Myth 3: Where’s My Refund? must be wrong because there’s no deposit date yet.
Not all tax returns are created equal. Even if you and your best friend filed at the same time and had relatively similar tax returns, there’s a chance that they won’t be processed at the same time. Even though the IRS issues most refunds in less than 21 days, it’s possible a refund may take longer for a variety of reasons including when a return is incomplete or needs further review.
And remember, updates to Where's My Refund? are made once per day, usually overnight. This means that in some cases, a taxpayer who filed later may receive their refund sooner than someone who filed earlier in the season.
If you don’t see your deposit date just yet, don’t call. The IRS will reach out to you by mail (or signal on the Where’s My Refund? app) if it needs more information to process your tax return. See again Myth #1.
Myth 4: Where’s My Refund? must be wrong because the refund amount is less than expected.
Just because you think you know what your refund check will look like doesn’t mean that’s what will land in your bank account. According to the IRS, several factors that could cause your tax refund to be larger (or smaller) than expected, such as:
Math errors or mistakes; Delinquent federal taxes; State taxes, child support, student loans or other delinquent federal non-tax obligations; and IRS holds a portion of the refund while it reviews an item claimed on the return.
If the IRS makes an adjustment on your return, they will mail a letter to you explaining the changes. You may also receive a letter from the Department of Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service if all or part of your refund was reduced and offset to pay certain financial obligations.
(For more on offsets that might affect your refund, click here .)
It’s also possible that your refund check could be affected by your spouse’s liability or obligation (child support is a common). If that’s the case, you may be able to get the portion attributable you by applying to the IRS for Injured Spouse Relief.
(To find out more about Injured Spouse Relief, click here .)
Finally, if you filed your taxes and requested a refund anticipation loan, fees and other deductions might apply to your refund check - not from the IRS, but from the loan originator or agency.
(For more about refund anticipation loans, click here .)
Myth 5: Getting a refund this year means there’s no need to adjust withholding for 2019.
Withholding was a huge tax topic this year following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). But checking withholding is important every year, refund or not. IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig says, “We urge people to check their withholding again this year to make sure they are having the right amount of tax withheld for 2019.”
(For more on form W-4, click here . For more on withholding, click here .)
And that's it. There are no magic codes, keys or other tricks to getting your tax refund faster this tax season. The IRS encourages taxpayers who are expecting tax refunds to file as early as possible, using e-file and direct deposit. The IRS issues nine out of 10 tax refunds in less than 21 days.

Get Tax Refunds Quick Product Fees Are Murky Charges GAO,www.forbes.com,Ted Knutson,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tedknutson/2019/04/12/fees-to-get-tax-refunds-quick-are-murky-charges-government-watchdog/?ss=taxes,"Fees to get tax refunds quick are murky, the Government Accountability Office, the watchdog of Congress, charged in a report today.

Banks and tax preparation services generally follow government guidance for revealing the costs, the agency said.
However, GAO gave banks higher marks for providing disclosures on fees and terms of tax-time financial products.
“(Tax preparers) do not consistently explain products or disclose fees to taxpayers,” the authors of the report said,
On undercover visits to nine tax preparers, GAO said its investigators were rebuffed in their requests to see literature on tax refund product fees.
Consumer advocates claim disclosures given to taxpayers by tax preparers on products to speed refunds are were inadequate, unhelpful, or timed into prevent meaningful comparison shopping, according to GAO.
The murkiness of tax refund product fees is common in both the online and store-front worlds, according to the investigators.
“A taxpayer trying to determine the cost of using a tax refund to pay for online tax preparation services only would be able to compare the prices of two of the eight online providers we reviewed, GAO said.
Price comparisons are also difficult for taxpayers choosing between tax refund products at brick-and mortar tax preparers, the report added.
Last year, fees increased for refund transfers, according to the report.
Fees ranged from $39.95 to $49.95 for faster tax refunds from paid tax preparers last year and from $12 to $39.99 from online providers of software for people who prepare their own taxes.
More than 20 million taxpayers used refund advance loans and other financial products to get quick access to this cash, the report said.
Workers making less than $40,000 and African Americans were the predominant users.
For low earners, tax refund products generally can provide cash cheaper and easier than payday, pawnshop or car title loans, according to the report.
In recent years, the use of refund transfers (temporary bank accounts for refunds) has risen while the popularity of refund anticipation loans (short-term loans subject to finance charges and fees) has declined.

If We Divorce, Could My Wife Collect On Her First Husband's Record? ​​
Hi Larry, We have computed that my wife's Social Security retirement benefits will be less than her divorced spousal benefits would be from her first marriage. I understand that she cannot claim these benefits since she remarried. Would she be able to claim divorced spousal benefits from her first marriage if she and I were to divorce? We've been married 5 years. She was married to her first husband for 27 years. Thanks, Curtis
Hi Curtis, Yes, assuming that she meets all of the other requirements for entitlement to divorced spousal benefits on her first husband's record. But, that would likely also disqualify her from being able to draw benefits on your record. That may not be important depending on the potential benefit rates involved now and in the future, but you'll want to make sure that you know all of the ramifications involved if you're considering divorce simply for monetary reasons. Best, Larry
Can Someone Help Me? ​​
H Larry, My father passed in early June two years ago and his last Social Security retirement benefit check came in mid June. We had already withdrawn a portion of it before finding out about a month or two later, when we went to withdraw the remaining portion, that the Social Security put a hold on his funds. I have written letters and made numerous calls to Social Security and the bank. They keep blaming each other. I now went to Social Security and they swear they cannot put holds and that the bank must release the funds. The bank swears they cannot release the funds until the hold is removed. This is now an almost two year battle. Can someone help me? Thanks, Sandra
Hi Sandra, I'm sorry for your loss. Here's the deal: the payment that came in mid June was apparently your father's Social Security payment for May. Since he lived throughout May, that payment would be due. However, since it was delivered after his death, the bank would have to return the funds to the US Treasury department.
In order to claim the underpayment, someone needs to submit a written request for the underpayment on a form SSA-1724. As his daughter, you are authorized to submit the form. There is a specific priority order for payment of a Social Security underpayment, which is explained on Social Security's website: https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-1724.html. Best, Larry
When Can I Expect To Get Some Of The Money Back That Social Security Withheld? ​​
Hi Larry, Last year Social Security withheld $7,900 of my retirement benefit because I am still working. When can I expect to get some of it back? I will be 66 in July. Thanks, Art
Hi Art, Assuming that the correct amount was withheld, that money won't be returned to you directly. However, if Social Security withheld more than $1 of benefits for each $2 that you earned in excess of $16,920 last year then they will refund the excess withholding as soon as they've verified your 2018 earnings. You may be able to speed up the process by submitting proof of your 2018 earnings to Social Security.
Indirectly, you'll begin to recoup money lost to the earnings test in the form of a higher monthly benefit rate effective at your full retirement age (FRA). Social Security should raise your monthly rate by roughly 5/9ths of 1% for each month that your benefits were reduced for age but for which you ended up not receiving benefits due to the earnings test. Those types of recomputations are done automatically but it could take up to 18 months after your FRA to receive the higher rate. Any applicable rate increase would be paid retroactive to FRA, though. Best, Larry"
Taxes From A To Z 2019: Z Is For Zip Drive,www.forbes.com,Kelly Phillips Erb,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/04/12/taxes-from-a-to-z-2019-z-is-for-zip-drive/?ss=taxes,"It’s my annual Taxes from A to Z series! This time, it’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) style. If you’re wondering whether you can claim house office expenses or whether to deduct a capital loss under the new law, you won’t want to miss a single letter. Z is for zip drive.
Yes, zip drives still exist. The disk drives - called zip drives for their at-the-time-of-launch blazing fast speed - debuted about 25 years ago as a way for consumers to back-up computer data. With a zip drive, you could easier copy and store files off-site, and it was much faster and stored more data than a compact disk (CD). When CDs hit the market ten years before zip drives, they could typically hold about 10 megabytes of data; zip drives were capable of storing ten times that amount out of the gate.
Getty
About ten years later, consumers started moving towards USB-drives, often called flash drives or thumb drives. USB-drives are typically operating system (OS) neutral and don’t require additional software - all you need is a USB port (though those are slowly disappearing). When USB-drives debuted, most stored around 100 megabytes of data but USB-drives can now save nearly two million times that much, or 2 terabytes (that’s not a typo: a terabyte is 1,000,000 times bigger than a megabyte).
Getty
Today, consumers use all kinds of methods to store data offsite. External hard drives are in fashion and should last at least a decade. And, of course, cloud storage is increasingly popular, albeit constantly evolving.
(For more on what you need to know about professional services and cloud computing, click here .)
No matter which option you choose, you should have a system for storing your data, especially when it comes to your tax and financial information.
So what should you hang onto? The general rule is that you should hold onto your tax returns and supporting documentation until the statute of limitations runs for filing your tax returns or filing for your tax refund. Supporting documentation for your tax returns includes not only your forms W-2 and 1099 but also bills, credit card and other receipts, invoices, mileage logs, canceled, imaged or substitute checks, proofs of payment, and any other records to support deductions or credits you claim on your return.
(You can find out more about record-keeping, including what you can toss, here and info on statutes of limitations here .)
Some taxpayers feel more comfortable hanging onto original papers but to save space, you can scan your records and store them electronically. The IRS has accepted scanned records since 1997, a policy that was memorialized by Rev. Proc. 97–22 (downloads as a pdf). Your scanned or electronic records must be as accurate as your paper records, and you must be able to index, store, preserve, retrieve, and reproduce the documents if asked (produce them in a hard copy form if required).
A back-up system is always a good idea. I have represented clients who have lost records in floods and hurricanes, moves and basement or attic storage gone bad (pests and humidity are real threats to paper). Reconstructing records isn’t always impossible, but it’s generally costly, time-consuming and stressful. Your best bet is to plan ahead and have a storage system that works for you.
Whether you use a zip drive, a flash drive, cloud storage or something else, be sure to keep a back-up of your tax and financial records. You never know when it will come in handy.

Where The Tax System Takes The Biggest Bite Out Of Your Paycheck [Infographic],www.forbes.com,Niall McCarthy,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/04/12/where-the-tax-system-takes-the-biggest-bite-out-of-your-paycheck-infographic/?ss=taxes,"The amount of tax and social security contributions docked from your paycheck depends heavily on your country of residence. The OECD has released the latest edition of its ""Taxing Wages"" report which looks at the net personal average tax rate across all of the organization's member states in 2018. On average, slightly more than a quarter of gross wages were devoured by tax and social security in OECD countries last year. Tax rates vary hugely between countries, depending heavily on earnings and family status. At first glance, Belgians and Germans seem to get a raw deal on tax and social security with the system taking a 40% bite out of average wages in both countries last year. Depending on who you talk to however, Belgian and German workers are often quick to emphasize everything they get in return for the high rate of taxation including health insurance, pension plans, old-age care, unemployment benefits and no highway tolls. Elsewhere in Europe, income tax and social security account for 31.4% of gross Italian earnings on average while in France, the total share adds up to 28.7%.
Outside of Europe, Australians see their pay docked by nearly a quarter on average while in the United States, it all adds up to 23.8%. In Asia's economic powerhouses, Japanese workers pay a relatively low level of income tax at just 7.9% but a higher level of social security payments push the overall total up to 22.3%. In South Korea, the overall figure is less at just 14.9%, of which 6.4% is income tax and 8.5% is social security.

OMG-It's Tax Time! What's The Deal With Taxes?,www.forbes.com,Will Jeakle,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamjeakle/2019/04/12/omg-its-tax-time-whats-the-deal-with-taxes/?ss=taxes,"There’s a great scene in the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid where Paul Newman and Robert Redford, as Butch and Sundance, are chased by a posse to a rocky crag high above a canyon with no way out. With the lawmen’s bullets flying past their skulls, Newman tells Redford that they have no choice but to jump to the stream below and hope for the best. Redford demurs and finally admits that he doesn’t want to jump because he can’t swim. Newman responds dryly: “ Why, you crazy — the fall ' ll probably kill ya! ”
So it is with taxes. If you spend all of your time worrying about the tax implications of things instead of focusing on creating a great product and serving your customer, you won’t need tax benefits. The failed business will probably kill ya.
There’s another great adage: “don’t spend a dollar to save 20 cents” (assuming a 20% tax rate). Taxes are levied on top of earnings, not in place of them. Still, for most left-brain types, the right-brain thinking involved in tax planning is enough to make them put it off entirely. But here’s the thing: if tax planning is an afterthought, you’ll inevitably pay too much in taxes.
“I’m not good with numbers!” you say. Doesn’t matter. Either way, you have to pay your taxes. Columns like this usually follow up by saying that you should find a good tax professional and pay them a few hundred bucks to get your return done. But that's not my advice early in your business or career. Your first few years out of school, I recommend doing your taxes on your own so you can begin to understand what gets taxed and why. There's lots of software that can make this process less painful. You can even get free tax forms & booklets from the IRS, sharpen a pencil, and do your taxes manually. Either way, you’ll learn what the government wants to encourage, and what it wants to tax.
Before you can begin to do tax planning, it helps to know what the goal of taxes are in the first place. Seems obvious: to raise money for the government, right? Well, if that’s true, then why is there a $22 trillion national debt ? Clearly, taxes don’t raise enough money to offset all government spending. Until the 16 th amendment in 1913, there was no federal income tax at all in the U.S. Our country has spent more time without federal income taxes than with them. So what’s the point of income taxes?
The tax code does two things: encourage spending and discourage it. In general, taxes encourage spending on stuff that the government deems good for its current vision of society. Hence: business expense deductions (the government wants you to start businesses), 401K and other pension plan deductions (the government wants you to save for your retirement), home mortgage deductions (the government wants you to buy a house). The limitations placed on deductions fall into the “discourage” category—you can deduct a mortgage on up to two homes, up to $750K in mortgage expense, but not on three, and not on the amount over $750K. ""Two pretty big homes are enough,"" says the government. You can deduct meals where you talk business, but only 50% of the charges, which means the government thinks that 50% of the time, you’re probably not talking business.
With a little understanding, there's a lot you can do to take control of the tax beast. We'll take a look at some strategies in my next post."
Is A Fragmented Internet Inevitable?,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/13/is-a-fragmented-internet-inevitable/,"As governments across the world have awoken to the immensely disruptive power of the internet, they have moved swiftly to contain and shape its forces in ways that mirror their national interests. Not since satellite television removed the last vestiges of informational sovereignty by enabling nations to forcibly beam their narratives and beliefs inside the borders of foreign countries have governments dealt with such a loss of control. Yet, as Google General Counsel David Drummond noted in 2013, those governments “have learned in what might be the steepest learning curve in history that they can shape this global phenomenon called the Internet and in ways that often go beyond what they can do in the physical world and they’re doing so at an alarming pace.” As the world’s cultures collide in the digital sphere and our nation-based societies show little signs of converging on a universal global set of internet rules, is a fragmented future for our once unified internet inevitable? The internet has profoundly reshaped our informational landscape. No longer do a small pool of elite gatekeepers in each country control informational access. Instead, the failure of governments to foresee the impact of the web meant its early years were largely left to the hands of technology companies to oversee. The ad-supported nature of these platforms meant they naturally gravitated towards freely provided user-generated content, creating distribution systems that enabled anyone in the world to broadcast their thoughts and beliefs in realtime to the entire planet or communicate privately with their friends, neighbors and colleagues.
Over time, the web naturally consolidated into a handful of walled gardens that today have in many ways become the internet itself. These digital dictatorships transcend traditional national borders, enforcing their beliefs, narratives and rules on the world at large.
Rather than a small set of elites in each country setting the ground rules for the internet for their respective societies, a single centralized set of elites in Silicon Valley set the rules for all countries. These rules prioritize profit over privacy and physical safety, are entirely opaque, have no genuine recourse or appeals process and change constantly at the whims of their owners.
Most importantly, these global rules are built on a premise that Silicon Valley represents the perfect pinnacle of human achievement that all peoples on this planet must strive towards as the one true correct set of narratives, beliefs, perspectives and understandings. In essence, Silicon Valley’s enforcement of a single set of global rules of what is permissible to say, see and believe online represents a new generation of enforced cultural colonialism.
Under Silicon Valley’s approach to internet governance there is no room for societies, cultures or beliefs different from its own. Much like its colonial predecessors, the Valley believes the world should look like itself and leverages its near-absolute power over the informational landscape in countries across the world to forcibly delete narratives and beliefs that run contrary to its own and corral entire societies into conforming to what it believes they should be like.
The early internet flourished so successfully because it respected society’s differences.
Across the world people speak different languages, have different backgrounds and experiences, are shaped by different narratives and share different beliefs.
The early internet’s distributed nature was designed for survivability and redundancy, but such an architecture meant it respected our global differences. Entirely by accident, the internet came into being in a way that respected that across the world we are different people.
In contrast, today’s increasingly centralized web is restoring the concept of centralized gatekeepers, but this time replacing country-specific gatekeepers that reflected local cultural narratives and beliefs with a single set of global gatekeepers enforcing Silicon Valley’s version of culture globally.
Under this new centralized gatekeeping model there is no room for difference. Countries are not permitted to have their own unique cultures consisting of narratives and beliefs that differ from those of Silicon Valley. There is only one set of rules and they apply to all countries equally.
Such an approach simply cannot work in a world in which countries have the power to push back.
National governments throughout the world are increasingly finding that Silicon Valley’s profit over privacy and safety mindset is incompatible with their own societal values. Definitions of what constitutes illegal and unethical content also differ wildly across societies.
Rather than forcibly export America’s beliefs to the world to the point of replacing all other cultures, social platforms have instead run into the reality that when cultures collide, governments will take steps to ensure the continuation of what their societies value to protect their cultural heritage.
As Silicon Valley’s beliefs increasingly conflict with those of the rest of the world, there is simply no alternative but for this centralized model to give way.
There are only three possible pathways forward.
The first is that Silicon Valley embraces our collective diversity and differences and replaces its centralized set of rules with country-specific rules that voluntarily fragment themselves. This would ensure global connectivity that reflects local diversity.
The second is that governments across the world pass new legislation that forcibly fractures the internet by creating mutually incompatible rules that balkanize digital regulation. Under this model the companies will either be broken up via legislation or will be forced to change to localized rules, but under the terms of governments across the world, rather than on their own terms.
The third option is both the most Orwellian and perhaps the most likely in the immediate term. Leveraging their immense control over the informational landscape, social media companies could take active control over the narratives in each country, blocking any discussion or embracing of local regulations and promoting narratives that portray their centralized rulesets in a positive light. Given that Facebook and Twitter in particular increasingly form the conduit between civil society and their elected or appointed representatives, it would not take much effort for them to combat the push towards increased regulation.
Putting this all together, it is clear that the current approach of a single centralized set of content rules enforced at planetary scale and their attendant demands for a single uniform society that removes all diversity and difference from the earth’s population is simply not tenable. The centralized web has no choice but to fracture.
In the end, the only question is which path we take towards a fragmented internet and how successful it will be."
Motorola Razr 2019: Prepare To Be Disappointed,www.forbes.com,Simon Rockman,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonrockman1/2019/04/13/motorola-razr-2019-prepare-to-be-disappointed/,"The buzz around the new Motorola Razr is electric. It’s taken off well beyond Lenovo’s ability to control it and the result is that we are all going to be disappointed. To understand why it’s necessary to understand how the original Razr came into being. I was a Director at Motorola in Chicago at the time, and while many of my colleagues, even those who opposed the project, now have LinkedIN profiles claiming to have been involved in its creation I’m happy to say I was only an observer. But I was close to the people, the super smart people, who did make it happen, and the way it was done means that there is no hope that the forthcoming folding screen Razr can be any bit as good as the original.
It’s not the fault of today’s Motorola, the Lenovo owned company is just a victim of circumstance. My job here is to explain why the circumstances are different. Perhaps the most important difference is that there had never been a Razr before, but it’s also about how that came to be.
Razr was a skunkworks, produced by a bunch of engineers in their spare time and time stolen from other projects. Indeed the Motorola Aura which was to have been the follow-up was codenamed GD2 for “Go Dark 2”, the second project from the same skunkworks, but under the glare of Razr publicity GD2 failed to stay dark and suffered the development malaise that saw a nine month project take the best part of three years so the best ever 2G phone was launched into a 3G world and it failed. The existance of new Razr is already out and that’s the first thing which means this year’s model won’t be as good. The original Razr had no input from mobile operators, no customer requirements, no research or focus groups. And most importantly no sales targets. The development team just built what they thought was cool. Without needing to meet targets they didn’t need to ensure component supply. The keypad came from a manufacturer who could only do limited quantities. It was an enthusiasm. A hobby for some of the most gifted engineers the mobile industry has ever seen who enjoyed what they did. Bo, who looked at screens knew everything there was to know about screen manufacture, where the bodies where hidden, what manufacturing processes where giving what yields, and which technologies were likely to fail despite being promoted by their companies. Joel loved audio, he spent all day worrying about sound quality in phones and then went home to work out what he needed to do to improve the audio on his hi-fi. Roger knew and loved hinges. And most of all Moto had the very best radio engineers. The project was led by Roger Jellicoe a fantastically talented engineer who was protected from the rest of the business by Tracy and her boss Rob. It was a very special team building a very special phone without any commercial pressure.
The new Razr is being built by Lenovo. I don’t know much about the company and I assume that the internal processes and politics are very much better than those of the Motorola I worked for, but I’m just as sure that the environment in which the new Razr is being built is much more commercial and less indulgent. The RF will be on an established platform, the design will be dictated by component availability and there as a commercial project there will not be the passion and engineering flair.
Into this mix you need to add the renderings and anticipation. The concept models flying around the ‘net haven’t come from Lenovo they are people who are great at 3D modelling pleasuring themselves. They don’t have to worry about drop tests and SAR. They don’t have to consider the optical path for the camera, the rf occlusion from someone holding the device or the antenna packaging. All you see in a rendering is what someone thinks looks cool. It’s as though a car geek showed the next generation Ferrari as a flying carpet without stopping to think about where he engine would go.
It makes me sad for Lenovo because it is a great engineering company, but not as great as the fantasies of the 3D modellers. The modelers in turn have been fuelled by the way the original Razr was so radically different from anything before.
That was a perfect storm. Razr only happened because there was a very special team of people, protected from company politics by Geoffrey Frost. So when the new Razr comes out, and it’s a bit thicker than you were hoping, there isn’t a nice snap to the hinge, the screen isn’t as good as you were expecting and it’s not quite as polished as you’d hoped, don’t blame Lenovo, blame the fantasists."

An iHeartMedia IPO Could Show The Future Of Music Radio,www.forbes.com,Bobby Owsinski,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbyowsinski/2019/04/13/an-iheartmedia-ipo-could-show-the-future-of-music-radio/,"Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg
2018 Bloomberg Finance LP iHeartMedia is about to file an IPO that's meant to pay down its massive debt but could show what the future of music radio in the United States is going to be. The company, which is the largest station group in the country with 848 stations, filed paperwork earlier in the month for the potential offering.
iHeart has been in bankruptcy for the last year and has managed to cut its massive debt of $21 billion down by about a third. The proceeds from an IPO would go a long way to trimming that down even further and allow the company to exit bankruptcy later in the year.
There's more to this than just the financials, however. Radio, especially music radio, is changing fast and what happens here might give us a sense of what the future might bring to both.
If you look at the numbers in various reports and surveys, radio listenership is stronger than ever. Despite giant inroads made by streaming, radio is still the most consumed audio source in the car and there are a host of other metrics that seem to indicate that radio is still popular and growing. There's a chink in the data armor though. The number of listeners below the age of 25 is decreasing rapidly, as radio becomes unimportant for music consumption to them.
Radio used to be the primary driver of new music. Listeners discovered new artists from the radio, and program directors, even in small markets, had the ability to ""break"" a song that was relatively unknown by the rest of the country.
Those days are now long gone, as music radio has become a reactive medium, with program directors (there are fewer of them as station groups have gobbled up most smaller stations and program them from a central location) now relying more on streaming charts from Spotify or Apple Music than their own tastes. As a result, the hits that are added to radio playlists are often past their freshness date. Gen-Z listeners have already moved on to something newer and radio has lost any chance of getting them as a result.
Since there are so many other audio entertainment sources available, radio has taken a hit in advertising as well. Although iHeart's revenue is still strong at a bit less than $1 billion , just give a listen to most stations during a commercial pod and you'll probably hear at least one free public service announcement. Radio listeners are clearly fed up with the commercial load per hour, yet radio, in general, insists on having as many commercial spots as possible, even if they're not generating money. That's not a way to attract new and skeptical listeners.
Things have even changed with college radio, which was once a major source of music discovery with the demographic most interested in music. For budgetary reasons many colleges have sold off their terrestrial transmitter and moved their station online, and have lost much of their audience as a result.
Record labels still view radio as important though - not so much for breaking an artist but for taking what already has traction to the next level. Radio may not deliver the prime music lovers, but it does deliver casual music consumers, which is a bigger market but tougher to crack.
iHeartMedia has not stood still in terrestrial radio though. It made a big move into digital as soon as CEO Bob Pittman (of MTV fame) took over in 2010 and now boasts 128 million registered users. It's value to the music industry is in the terrestrial stations it owns, however, even though the company's online offering is close to Spotify in consumption among what are known as "" heavy listeners ."" iHeart provides radio stations online while most of the music consumers that count to the music industry want on-demand or customized playlists that they get from most streaming services.
So iHeartMedia's IPO should be interesting in that it will give the company some financial breathing room and space to work. Will it continue to offer up the same old radio the same way, or will it try to innovate in an attempt to get Gen-Z on board? If it does nothing to change, music radio's audience will continue to erode until it's a shadow of its former self."
The San Francisco Giants' Samardzija Wars Wage On,www.forbes.com,Jules Posner,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julesposner/2019/04/13/the-san-francisco-giants-samardzija-wars-wage-on/,"Most people who are vaguely familiar with the San Francisco Giants are familiar with the ""Belt Wars"". The lesser known, but equally intense ""Samardzija Wars"" have been waging since he inked his 5 year $90 million deal back in December of 2015. Don't look now, but Jeff Samardzija is off to a good start in 2019.
Actually, do look now. Look at Jeff Samardzija's cutter. Look at it ! Look at his Three Musketeers inspired facial hair. Well, maybe don't look at that. Unless you're into that. Then by all means knock yourself out.
That cutter though. It's beautiful. You can see as it approaches the plate there's a small wrinkle and the ball works its way back towards the outer third of home plate. Wrinkles like that are helping him re-establish himself this season after missing most of the 2018 season due to injury.
If you like his cutter, you'll be pleased to find out he's been throwing it 20% more than he did last season and nearly 10% more than he did when he threw it 15.5% of the time in 2016, which was his highest career usage in a full season. Over at Baseball Prospectus, Zach Crizer discussed the different classifications for why pitchers turn to the cut fastball ($). One classification was pitchers that turn to the cutter to compensate for diminishing fastball velocity. Jeff Samardzija falls into this category.
Per Baseball Savant:
Season FB Velo 2019 91.59 2018 91.42 2017 93.73 2016 94.56 Jeff Samardzija has been utilizing his cutter more frequently in 2019, but that's not the only wrinkle he has thrown at hitters this season. Samardzija has also changed his approach to pitch selection in general. He has discussed how he has altered his approach to attacking batters now that he is no longer expected to throw 200 innings a year and it shows in his 2019 pitch usage.
According to Baseball Savant, Jeff Samardzija is also boasting his highest slider usage to date throwing it roughly 25% of the time. In his previous start against the Rays, Samardzija used the slider as his primary pitch throwing it 38% of the time. This was a 26% increase from the start before that against the Padres where he relied mostly on his three different fastball grips and mixed in an occasional curveball. Then his last start, he dominated the Rockies with an even mix of Two Seam Fastballs (32%), Sliders (29%) and Cutters (29%).
Samardzija featured a different wrinkle to throw at opposing batters every start this season. Whether it was a pitch or a game plan, Jeff Samardzija has been very effective against some tough line ups to start the season. However, it is a third wrinkle that Jeff Samardzija added, or reintroduced to his arsenal that may be the only consistent thread you will see across all of his starts this season.
During Spring Training, Jeff Samardzija revealed his new wind up for the 2019 season, which looked a lot like his old wind up from 2016.
Jeff Samardzija used to slightly turn his back towards the batter before rotating, separating his hands and delivering the pitch. He eliminated that turn in 2017. In 2017, Jeff Samardzija posted 205 strike outs to 32 walks which is insane, but according to many metrics he was arguably less effective than he was in 2016.
Per Fangraphs:
Season ERA BABIP HR HR/9 HR/FB 2017 4.42 .303 30 1.30 13.8% 2016 3.81 .285 24 1.06 11.9% A twitter thread analyzing the changes in Jeff Samardzija's wind up can be found here . The results of that thread in regards to perceived velocity were incorrect. In fact, the data showed that there was a bigger differential between his perceived velocity and real velocity in 2017 than in 2016. Why? Perhaps, the cleaner mechanics in 2017 allowed him to get better extension and therefore his perceived velocity improved.
The next question: why did he surrender more runs in 2017? That's harder to answer. There could be a lot of reasons. Maybe the competition was better and he faced better hitters in his 32 starts in 2017 than he did in his 32 starts in 2016. Or, when looking again at that incredibly low walk rate, maybe Jeff Samardzija was simply throwing too many strikes in 2017. Hitters knew that Samardzija was going to pound the strike zone, so they became more aggressive.
That would explain the uptick in strikeouts and whiff percentage. More swings equals more swings and misses. It also equals all that over stuff mentioned in the table above. The amount of strikes thrown in combination with a more streamlined, but less deceptive throwing motion might be what led to the increased offensive output against Samardzija.
The main feature of Jeff Samardzija's wind up is deception. The turn allows him to hide the ball behind his body longer which makes the ball harder to pick up for hitters. Unfortunately, there's no metric for measuring deception, as perceived velocity is based off of release point and extension. The other result of his mechanics is he's a little more wild. So far this season Samardzija has walked 6 batters in his three starts, which is a pace that would double his 2017 output.
The wrinkles Jeff Samardzija added to his game like his return to his more deceptive motion, his new approach to pitch selection and more reliance on his cutter are yielding positive results so far. If Samardzija keeps up this production, he could make himself a valuable trade commodity and his contract which was once considered immovable by many, may become easier to move. If he's not traded, there's a chance he plays out the remainder of his contract and in the end it will go down as a mutually beneficial deal. Either way, the better he pitches the more it seems like the two sides in the Samardzija Wars will put their arms down and call a truce."
Implementing AI The Right Way,www.forbes.com,Tom Taulli,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2019/04/13/implementing-ai-the-right-way/,"For many companies, when it comes to implementing AI, the typical approach is to use certain features from existing software platforms (say from Salesforce.com's Einstein). But then there are those companies that are building their own models. Yes, this can move the needle, leading to major benefits. At the same time, there are clear risks and expenses. Let's face it, you need to form a team, prepare the data, develop and test models, and then deploy the system.
In light of this, it should be no surprise that AI projects can easily fail.
So what to do? How can you boost the odds for success?
Well, let's take a look at some best practices;
IT Assessment : The fact is that most companies are weighed down with legacy systems, which can make it difficult to implement an AI project. So there must be a realistic look at what needs to be built to have the right technology foundation -- which can be costly and take considerable time.
Funny enough, as you go through the process, you may realize there are already AI projects in progress!
""Confusion like this must be resolved across the leadership team before a coherent AI strategy can be formulated,"" said Ben MacKenzie, who is the Director of AI Engineering at Teradata Consulting .
The Business Case : Vijay Raghavan, who is the executive vice president and CTO of Risk and Business Analytics at RELX , recommends asking questions like:
Do I want to use AI to build better products? Do I want to use AI to get products to market faster? Do I want to use AI to become more efficient or profitable in ways beyond product development? Do I want to use AI to mitigate some form of risk (Information security risk, compliance risk…)? ""In a sense, this is not that different from a company that asked itself say 30 or more years ago, 'Do I need a software development strategy, and what are the best practices for such?,'"" said Vijay. ""What that company needed was a software development discipline -- more than a strategy -- in order to execute the business strategy. Similarly, the answers to the above questions can help drive an AI discipline or AI implementation.""
Measure, Measure, Measure: While it's important to experiment with AI, there should still be a strong discipline when it comes to tracking the project.
""This should be done at every step and must be done with a critical sense,"" said Erik Schluntz, who is the cofounder & CTO at Cobalt Robotics . ""Despite the fantastic hype around AI today, it is still in no way a panacea, just a tool to help accomplish existing tasks more efficiently, or create new solutions that address a gap in today’s market. Not only that, but you need to be open about auditing the strategy on an on-going basis.""
Education and Collaboration : Even though AI tools are getting much better, they still require data science skills. The problem, of course, is that it is difficult to recruit people with this kind of talent. As a result, there should be ongoing education. The good news is that there are many affordable courses from providers like Udemy and Udacity to help out.
Next, fostering a culture of collaboration is essential. ""So, in addition to education, one of the key components to an AI strategy should be overall change management,"" said Kurt Muehmel, who is the VP of Sales Engineering at Dataiku . ""It is important to create both short- and long-term roadmaps of what will be accomplished with first maybe predictive analytics, then perhaps machine learning, and ultimately - as a longer-term goal - AI, and how each roadmap impacts various pieces of the business as well as people who are a part of those business lines and their day-to-day work.""
Recognition : When there is a win, celebrate it. And make sure senior leaders recognize the achievement.
""Ideally this first win should be completed within 8-12 weeks so that stakeholders stay engaged and supportive,"" said Prasad Vuyyuru, who is a Partner of the Enterprise Insights Practice at Infosys Consulting . ""Then next you can scale it gradually with limited additional functions for more business units and geographies.""
And finally, AI is really a marathon, which requires taking a long-term view of things. ""Business leaders need to understand and realize that the adoption of AI is not a sprint,"" said Kalyan Kumar, who is the Corporate Vice President and Global CTO of HCL Technologies . ""It is critical that the people driving AI adoption within an enterprise remain realistic about the time-frame and what AI is capable of doing.""

Black Holes And Climate Change - A Case Study In Selective Science Consumption,www.forbes.com,Marshall Shepherd,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2019/04/13/black-holes-and-climate-change-a-case-study-in-selective-science-consumption/,"One of the most important scientific results of my lifetime was revealed this month. Scientists released an image of a black hole and its event horizon. My colleague Ethan Siegel has an outstanding discussion in Forbes of 10 important lessons from the revelation . As a fellow scientist, I was really excited for everyone involved in the countless years of work preparing for that moment. As a human being, I was just fascinated by what I was seeing. I also pondered something else. A subset of the public is in complete awe of science that showed us evidence of a black hole 55 million light years away. Yet, they might be completely dismissive of observations that Earth's climate is changing and that humans are part of the reason why?
A supermassive black hole at Messier 87.
EVENT HORIZON TELESCOPE COLLABORATION ET AL Apparently, I wasn't the only person that had this thought. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson tweeted :
SCIENTISTS: “We’ve produced the first-ever image of a supermassive Black Hole, 55-million light years away”
RESPONSE: “Oooh!”SCIENTISTS: “We’ve concluded that humans are catastrophically warming Earth” RESPONSE: “That conflicts with what I want to be true, so it must be false”
Lee Constable had a similar and equally thought-provoking tweet about the apparent selective acceptance of science :
Weird how scientists can use data to create an image of a black hole in a neighboring galaxy and everyone is cool and chill about that. But the recommendations scientists make based on data that gives us a picture of climate change ON EARTH... apparently up for debate.
When I think about the point being made with those Tweets, Julie Beck's 2015 article in The Atlantic , ""Americans Believe in Science, Just Not Its Findings,"" comes to mind. Beck's outstanding piece dissected a Pew Research Center study finding that ""79% of adults say that science has made life easier for most people and a majority is positive about science’s impact on the quality of health care, food and the environment."" Roughly 70% of those surveyed also thought government investments in science and technology pay off in the long run. This is certainly encouraging because our smartphones, GPS, and advanced medical procedures didn't appear out of thin air.
Beck's article also made the point that Pew's study found public opinion about certain ""hot button"" topics like climate change, evolution, and genetically modified foods diverged from scientists. It is tempting to chalk this up to ""confirmation bias"" whereby people align with information consistent with their belief systems, ideologies, or faith perspectives. However, I think there is a bit more to the story.
A 2011 study published in the Journal of Risk Research posed the simple question: ""Why do members of the public disagree - sharply and persistently - about facts on which expert scientists largely agree?"" They find that something called ""cultural cognition of risk"" helps to inform individuals’ beliefs about science, consensus, and related processes. They point out that a collection of psychological mechanisms allows some people to selectively accept or dismiss scientific information in ways that fit with others. For example, though a large percentage of scientists might conclude that anthropogenic climate change or vaccination denial are threats, cultural cognition of risk might cause a person to believe a smaller minority of scientists that align with their perspective.
I touched on some of these cognitive biases in a recent Ted talk, but I didn't know the fancy psychological terms. I just know what I have experienced in my 25 years as an atmospheric scientist who does weather-climate research and broader communication. A 2018 article in the journal Public Understanding of Science further demonstrated how a person's ""cultural way of life"" in combination with news media choices further polarize consumption and understanding of science.
I find the particular euphoria about the black hole image particularly interesting because there are actually elements of its science that should create the same type of skepticism observed with climate change: Remote observations from a distance, an element of tension between science and faith-based narratives, and a constantly changing astronomical ""landscape."" I suppose the difference is that with climate change stakeholders are perceived as ""winners"" or ""losers"" and may infect the broader discussion. Erik Conway and Naomi Oreskes point this out in the book Merchants of Doubt. For now, black holes have no ""special interest"" bias.
I constantly argue that science is a good thing, and it should not threaten your core values. However, your core values and perspectives should not automatically dismiss sound scientific facts either.

"Music Shines Through At Day One Of Coachella, ' The Super Bowl Of Branding'",www.forbes.com,Steve Baltin,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/04/13/music-shines-through-at-day-one-of-coachella-the-super-bowl-of-branding/,"Coachella is not only the biggest festival in America by a wide margin at this point, it is the most fascinating. Back in 1999 before the first Coachella I flew from Philadelphia, where I was living and working, to Los Angeles to meet with Goldenvoice's Paul Tollett for a piece on the making of the first Coachella. So it has been remarkable for me to watch the transformation over 20 years from a completely alternative-minded festival and thinking to the festival's current status, where companies from H&M and Marriott to American Express now treat Coachella as the ""Super Bowl Of Branding.""
So being at the massive festival grounds and surrounding areas are a thought-provoking deep dive into sociology. There are die-hard music fans who are excited for the festival; the journalists assigned to cover the festival who are not even sure how many albums Kacey Musgraves has released; the influencers there for the parties; the music industry members there to network and discover the potential breakout stars, and the brands foaming at the mouth to reach the coveted demographics that comprise the Coachella audience.
In all of that there are still performances. And more than any other festival, because of the audience size and the stunning brand recognition that the Coachella name carries, Coachella offers the chance for artists to break out, reach the next level of fame or just win over some new fans.
As I wrote in January one of the most exciting aspects of this year's lineup was the strong female artist contingent. And day one lived up to that hype with two of last year's breakout artists, Ella Mai and Grammy winner Musgraves, making strong impressions day one with their more mellow sets.
Mai's sunset hour set at the Outdoor Theater was an outstanding 45 minutes of soulful R&B grooves with ""She Don't,"" which featured snippets of Lauryn Hill's ""Doo Wop (That Thing),"" ""Shot Clock"" and ""Boo'd Up,"" which had both men and women in the audience singing along and dancing, proving to be a few of the highlights.
Musgraves, playing in what she dubbed ""The Golden Hour,"" showed many of the audience members who only have discovered her this year with her Grammy-winning Album Of The Year, Golden Hour , why she is one of the brightest young stars in all of music, regardless of genre. Opening with ""Slow Burn,"" Musgraves, who let everyone know how delighted she was to be on the main stage of Coachella, delivered a strong dozen songs, including ""Wonder Woman,"" ""Oh, What A World,"" ""Love Is A Wild Thing"" and an acoustic ""Mother.""
The most anticipated set of day one though, with the exception of headliner Childish Gambino, was the coming out party for K-pop group BLACKPINK, who delivered a production that would have made past Coachella performers like Madonna and Lady Gaga proud. Dominating the Sahara Tent, the group was a perfectly precise machine in choreography and performance on songs like the remix version of ""Stay,"" the live debut of ""Kick It,"" their version of ""Kiss And Make Up,"" a collaboration with Dua Lipa and more. What was most impressive about BLACKPINK though was despite the precision, it felt totally natural and they were completely engaged. In short they were a lot of fun.
So yes there was as much branding at day one of Coachella as there is at the Super Bowl, but the heart of Coachella remains the sense of discovery and joy at the music and that shone through for those who actually cared enough to find it. And those there just for the parties missed out."

Formula One's Free To Air TV Audience Crashes By Half in Britain,www.forbes.com,Christian Sylt,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2019/04/13/formula-ones-free-to-air-tv-audience-crashes-by-half-in-britain/,"The number of people watching Formula One on free to air television in Britain reversed by 44% to 1.7 million for last month’s Bahrain Grand Prix driven by the live race broadcast being moved on to pay TV according to new data. Over the past 11 years, F1’s total TV audience has crashed by 18.3% to 490 million as the series has signed more pay TV contracts. Some expected that F1 might put the brakes on this following its takeover in 2017 by Liberty Media, the investment firm which is listed on the Nasdaq with the ticker FWONK. One of Liberty’s presentations referred to the “opportunity to improve fan experience” but it soon became clear that this didn’t involve giving the red light to pay TV.
In 2017, we revealed that Liberty’s chief executive Greg Maffei hoped to boost F1’s broadcast revenue by “moving potentially to free-to-air to competitive pay services.” Testimony to this, in January last year F1 signed an exclusive contract in Italy with Sky Italia which had previously shared coverage with free to air station RAI. Sky Italia is paying for the privilege and according to a report last year from investment bank Morgan Stanley, its annual fee comes to $125 million which is a 53% boost on 2017.
Pay TV broadcasters can often afford to outbid free to air stations because they are flush with subscription fees and use them to buy content which tempts new customers. One of F1’s biggest-ever pay TV deals began last month when Sky Sports became the exclusive live broadcaster of all of the races in Britain. For the previous three years around half of them were shown live on British free to air network Channel 4 which also broadcast delayed highlights of the remainder. That arrangement came to an end this year and has fueled concern.
Britain is an incredibly significant market as it is home to F1’s headquarters, six of the ten teams are based there and the first-ever F1 race took place there in 1950. That race, the British Grand Prix, will be the only one live on Channel 4 this year as it is showing delayed highlights of all the others.
The contract sees Sky’s broadcast fees in Britain doubling as it is paying F1 an estimated $150 million annually. The high-octane deal was signed by F1’s former boss Bernie Ecclestone and Liberty inherited it when it bought the business. As we reported , even though viewers can’t watch the races live for free, F1’s global research director Matt Roberts claimed in December that the new agreement would rev up its audience on Channel 4.
“Channel 4 will have the highlights next year and we have worked with them to ensure they show the races in a favourable prime time slot. We estimate that we will actually have more viewers next year in the UK (thanks to this prime time slot) than we had this year.” It seemed to fly in the face of logic and research.
Before the 2019 season began we carried out detailed analysis of Channel 4’s audience data to get an idea of how much damage could be done by eradicating almost all of F1’s live free-to-air coverage. The data couldn’t be more authoritative.
It came from the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (BARB), the organisation that collects TV ratings in Britain. BARB is owned by six networks, including Sky, Channel 4 and the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), the trade body for advertising, media and marketing agencies in Britain. BARB’s data is so highly-regarded that it is referred to as the ‘gold standard’ and is the official estimate of TV viewing which British networks use to sell advertising spots.
BARB’s data showed that the average audience for each live race on Channel 4 last year came to 2.65 million whereas the highlights broadcasts attracted 2.07 million each. It suggests that Channel 4 could lose as many as 5.2 million viewers this year as its tally of live races is falling by nine and each one is watched by 580,000 more people than the highlights. It could actually be on track to lose a lot more viewers than that.
This weekend’s Chinese Grand Prix is the 1,000th F1 race and the third this year. The season-opener took place in Australia in mid-March and Bahrain hosted the second at the end of last month. BARB’s data shows the dent that the Sky deal has made and it has only recently come to light.
BARB has a byzantine categorization system which involves its broadcast day beginning at 6am. This was chosen because it is when Britain’s breakfast TV services begin broadcasting in the early 1980s. Accordingly, it is rare for programming to cross the 6am divide and when it does it can create confusion.
This is because there is a risk of the BARB log entry being cut off at the 6am threshold thereby making the programme appear shorter than it actually is. It is a particular problem for live sport as the peak viewing time could be after the cut off point.
It can affect events such as boxing matches on the west coast of the United States, tennis tournaments in Asia and F1 which has several races that cross the 6am divide in Britain due to the time difference. The Australian Grand Prix is one of them and it calls into question the accuracy of the audience data for the race. However, the Bahrain Grand Prix isn’t affected by it as it is takes place in the afternoon in Britain.
It takes just over a week for BARB to update its system so the audience figures for the Bahrain Grand Prix have only been available for the past few days. True to its word, F1 got Channel 4 to show its highlights at prime time and the broadcast started at 9pm, five hours after the race took place.
The Channel 4 broadcast attracted 1.6 million viewers on TV, 16,869 watching on PC/laptop, 4,881 on a tablet and just 3,987 on a smartphone. It gave the highlights a total of 1,658,137 viewers which was lower than the audience for the programmes at the same time almost every day of the week leading up to the race. The Bahrain Grand Prix highlights had a lower audience than ‘Married at first sight’, a show about legal marriage with a complete stranger, reality series ‘24 hours in police custody’ and Gogglebox which shows viewers’ reactions to TV programmes and was watched by 3.5 million people.
Indeed, the Bahrain Grand Prix highlights attracted Channel 4’s lowest audience for the race since it started showing F1 in 2016. Its live broadcast steadily increased from 2.42 million in 2016 to 2.85 million the following year and reached a peak of 2.94 million in 2018.
The sharp crash in viewers this year reveals two potential flaws with Liberty’s strategy. Although it may seem ideal to screen the highlights at prime time, it puts them up against the leading shows on rival networks. This may be fruitful for a blockbuster movie or a series starring A-list actors but it’s a bold gamble to do it with a sports event which took place five hours earlier.
Liberty’s belief that more fans would tune in five hours after the event suggests that it thinks the racing itself is attracting most of them. In fact, the crash in viewers suggests that viewers are watching races to find out the result and once that it is known there is little need to see the highlights. If the trend continues it may only be a matter of time before the checkered flag comes down on Channel 4’s coverage completely.

Coca-Cola Created A Brand New Bottle Design Specifically For Disney's Galaxy's Edge,www.forbes.com,Rachel Paige,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rpaige/2019/04/13/disney-star-wars-galaxy-edge-coca-cola-redesign/,"Over the past few years, specialty food and beverages have completely taken social media by storm when it comes to what you can consume (and photograph) at the Disney Parks around the world. Instagram is often flooded with perfectly color-corrected images of guests holding a cookie, or a cupcake, or a donut, or some sort of multi-colored drink in front of a backdrop so others can comment and say, “I want that.” While it’s worked incredibly — to bring both attention to influencers and new Disney offerings — can the same magic be replicated for an actual brand in the park? Coca-Cola is about to find out. And right away, it looks like it’s working. At the Disney Parks panel at Star Wars Celebration Chicago for Galaxy’s Edge (opening May 31 at Disneyland Park and August 29 at Disney’s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World), it was announced that when the lands open up later this year, Coca-Cola will be rolling out a brand new bottle design for visitors in the area.
It’s literally just a new bottle, compared to the old bottle. But this new bottle is more like a circular orb, and sphere-like in shape. Is it meant to slightly resemble the Death Star? Probably not, but that’s the image it immediately envokes and all it took was the mere mention of this new product for social media to completely light up with users commenting , “I want that.”
That’s also even before we really get into the details about the fact that Coca-Cola (along with Diet Coke, Sprite and Dasani) have all been given new labels and a different language for the packaging: Arabesh, which is a printed language used throughout the Star Wars galaxy.
The reason for this complete redesign — that will only be available within Galaxy’s Edge, don’t even try to find something like this in Fantasyland — is so that guests to the park can really feel like they’re living in their own Star Wars story. You’re not just visiting this place, you’re living and breathing the environment around you, and all traces of the real world is being stripped away. Clearly, that includes beverages.
(It’ll be interesting to see what happens to other commonplace Disney offerings at outdoor food carts in the area. You can usually find things like potato chips and ice cream bars at them. Will they receive any sort of Star Wars makeover, or be completely removed all together? More pressing, what happens if and when these special Star Wars bottles run out in the land? Will regular Coca-Cola products be reintroduced while the stock is replenished, or will guests literally be sent elsewhere to grab a Diet Coke?)
Disney made this reveal with a cute video showing stormtroopers guarding a red case, and when a situation calls them away, a visitor cracks the case and goes in for a drink.
Social media was quick to jump on board with this new design, and Coca-Cola was trending on Twitter within the hour. It’s impressive that a beverage bottle can quickly become a must-have item for the parks, and it can only be assumed that the new design, complete with the Arabesh logo, will quickly become a collector's item. Will we start seeing used Sprite bottles pop up on eBay for Disney collectors?
Disney didn’t offer up any sort of pricing for the new bottles and seeing as how a bottle of Coke right now is going for around $5 in the Disney Parks, the price point should be the same. However, seeing as how they’re already in demand, Disney could easily increase the price, considering these are more than likely more expensive to make. They’re custom, after all.
So if you're already planning a trip to Galaxy's Edge this year, be prepared to not only wait in line for attractions and photo opportunities but also beverages you could easily just snag from a vending machine elsewhere. Maybe this is the true power of Disney, and Disney marketing when it comes to products."
The World's Largest Airplane Takes Flight. Next Stop? Outer Space,www.forbes.com,Alex Knapp,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2019/04/13/the-worlds-largest-airplane-takes-flight-next-stop-outer-space/,"On Saturday, the world's largest aircraft, the Stratolaunch, made its first complete test flight. The aircraft flew for about two and a half hours over the Mojave desert, reaching a speed of 189 miles per hour and an altitude of 17,000 feet. The aircraft was created by the Stratolaunch Systems Corporation, which was founded by the late Paul Allen. The purpose of the plane isn’t normal commercial travel but rather to carry rockets into high altitudes, then launch those rockets from the plane itself.
“What a fantastic first flight,” Jean Floyd, CEO of Stratolaunch, said in a statement. “Today’s flight furthers our mission to provide a flexible alternative to ground launched systems.”
Scaled Composites, which was acquired by Northrop Grummon in 2007, worked on the design and build of the Stratolaunch aircraft. Saturday’s test flight was piloted by Scaled Composites test pilots Evan Thomas and Chris Guarente.
“I honestly could not have hoped for more on a first flight especially of an airplane of this complexity and this uniqueness,” Thomas said in a press briefing following the flight.
Stratolaunch in flight on Saturday, April 13, 2019.
Stratolaunch Systems Corporation The Stratolaunch aircraft was first announced in 2011 and is the largest plane ever built out of composite materials. Its wingspan is 385 feet, the longest of any aircraft that has ever flown, including the Spruce Goose, which had a wingspan of about 320 feet. By comparison, a Boeing 747 has a wingspan of about 212 feet—making the Stratolaunch plane nearly twice the size. It’s propelled by six PW4056 turbofan engines and is actually capable of launching multiple rockets on a single flight, up to about 500,000 pounds.
Airplane-launched rockets seemed at one point to be a good bet as a way of providing more convenient flights into space. Scaled Composites won the Ansari X Prize for launching the first private, reusable spacecraft into space in June of 2004. That effort was backed by Paul Allen, and this approach was adopted not only by Stratolaunch but also by Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic.
However, it has taken much longer than expected to develop these types of spaceflight. Virgin Galactic only first reached a space-approaching altitude at the end of 2018 —14 years after that first Scaled Composite flight—though it hopes to be providing passenger service as early as later this year . Stratolaunch at one time was developing a rocket for its aircraft but abandoned that effort earlier this year.
Rather than launch its own rockets, Stratolaunch has shifted strategy to be a platform for other aircraft-launched rockets. In particular, for Northrop Grumman’s Pegasus family of rockets . First demonstration Pegasus flights off of the Stratolaunch plane are scheduled for 2020.
Though they’ve taken longer to develop, the arrival of private plane-launched rockets via Virgin and Stratolaunch may be well-timed, as more satellite startups are looking for options to get satellites into space on their own timetable. Rockets launched from airplanes have more flexibility in terms of timing than their counterparts that launch from the ground, which may be a critical factor for companies looking to build up constellations in a hurry.

Facebook Was A Democracy 2009-2012 But We Didn't Vote So It Turned Into A Dictatorship,www.forbes.com,msn.com,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/13/facebook-was-a-democracy-2009-2012-but-we-didnt-vote-so-it-turned-into-a-dictatorship/,"We think of Facebook today as a digital dictatorship ruled with absolute power by its founder with no rights for its two billion users to weigh in on its evolution. This was not always the case. In fact, in its early days Facebook was actually an earnest digital democracy, in which policy changes were put forward to its users to vote on. It was our collective failure to show an interest in exercising those rights that pushed the company towards the dictatorship that it is today. What might we learn from this cautionary tale? It can be hard to imagine that just under a decade ago Facebook was actually a rudimentary democratic state. Unlike our modern democratic republics in which we elect representatives whose votes actually create policy, Facebook was a true democracy in which all of its users were granted the right to vote on policy changes directly.
Once upon a time, Facebook submitted its major policy decisions to a vote by its users. These votes were even certified by an outside auditor, with the results of its inaugural Facebook Site Governance Vote being reported April 24, 2009.
The company held its second global governance vote from June 1 to June 8, 2012, regarding changes to its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and Data Use Policy. In a concession almost unthinkable today, the company noted that according to its official policies , “if more than 30% of all active registered users vote, the results will be binding. If turnout is less than 30%, the vote will be advisory.”
In other words, if more than 30% of Facebook’s users voted, their decision would be binding upon the company.
This great experiment in internet democracy was to be short-lived.
In its 2012 announcement, the company noted that it had begun its voting process when it had just 200 million users and as it eclipsed 900 million users , “our growing relationship with regulators around the world has created a new layer of accountability with respect to our practices and policies” that no longer necessitated its reliance on its users to help set its policies. In particular, the company stated that it would be reconsidering its democratic process “to determine whether it appropriately reflects the growth of our community and business and to ensure it still serves its original purpose.”
In a twist of irony considering the role each of the organizations have played in its current scandals, Facebook justified reconsidering its democratic process because “we have entered into a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade Commission which involves regular audits of our privacy practices; we work closely with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s Office, which completed a comprehensive audit of our data practices last year; and we are now subject to the regulatory authority of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.”
The company pointed to the difficulties of maintaining a democratic process as it approached a billion users. In its push to eliminate the right of its users to vote on governance and policy changes, Facebook noted in particular that the 30% threshold was almost impossible to meet when such a percentage required more than 300 million users to read through a complex set of legal terminology and agree to them.
Indeed, few democratic societies today are true democracies in which all citizens vote on all issues. Instead, bowing to the realities of scale as their populations grow, most turn into republics. The fact that even the virtual world of Facebook, in which geography was no longer a constraint on the ability to vote, faced this same conundrum, suggests this is an intrinsic limit of democratic governance.
At the time, proposed changes that received more than 7,000 comments would be automatically placed to a vote and if more than 30% of Facebook’s users voted for the change, it would be binding upon the company.
One of the challenges pointed to by the company was that it was fairly easy to reach the 7,000-comment requirement, but hard to mobilize large numbers of users to care sufficiently about the issues to actually vote on them. In one famous example, Austrian law student Max Schrems managed to launch a successful copy-paste campaign that generated 47,824 comments to trigger a policy vote, but just 0.038% of Facebook’s users actually voted, demonstrating that users simply couldn’t be bothered to actually vote when it mattered.
Finally, in November 2012 the company concluded that users simply weren’t interested in exercising their right to vote on its major policy changes. It asked all billion of its users to vote on whether it could revoke democracy and forever transition to the digital dictatorship that we know today.
It would have taken almost insurmountable odds, a total of more than 300 million votes, to preserve Facebook’s fledgling democracy and in the end just over 650,000 users out of nearly a billion had voted a few hours before the deadline. Of those, 88% voted to keep democracy, but the indifference of the remaining nearly billion users ultimately doomed digital democracy.
A spokesperson confirmed that nearly nonexistent voter turnout ultimately convinced the company to abolish its voting process.
Of course, it is important to note that Facebook carefully controlled which issues were put up to a vote, keeping its most controversial features like facial recognition well away from user interference. Still, the ability of users to have some say on the company’s actions was a bulwark against the kinds of adhoc existential changes the company has made to the rights of its users in the years since. Unencumbered by concerns that users might reject a given change if given the right to vote on it, the company has been free to pursue policies that maximized profits at all cost.
It is no coincidence that so many of its data, security and privacy scandals of the past year have their roots in the post-2012 era after voting was abolished.
Putting this all together, we can complain all we like about Facebook’s digital dictatorship, but the sad reality is that we ourselves allowed this to happen by refusing to exercise our democratic rights when they were given to us. For three years Facebook allowed its users to vote on select major policy changes. While imperfect and limited in scope, this process granted Facebook’s users a voice. Yet, for three years we apathetically failed to exercise those rights and so they were taken away from us.
In fact, we valued our voting rights so little that almost a billion people couldn’t be bothered to part with a single mouse click to save those rights when the company decided to eliminate them.
Gifted a democracy, we couldn’t be bothered to vote to preserve our rights as that democracy transitioned into a digital dictatorship.
In the end, we can’t truly complain about everything Facebook has become in the years since, when we never exercised the rights we were given to have a voice in its development or even to ask to retain those rights when the company actually asked our permission to transition to a dictatorship.
We sat back and granted Facebook permission to revoke our rights and transition into the profit-minded dictatorship that has become synonymous with all that is bad about the web today.
Instead of criticizing the company we should sit back and contemplate the fact that we let this happen.
It seems we never wanted democracy or a say in how our data is used after all."
What Career Confusion Looks Like At Three Key Stages Of Life,www.forbes.com,Kathy Caprino,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2019/04/13/what-career-confusion-looks-like-at-three-key-stages-of-life/,"Part of the new series “Close Your Power Gaps To Build a Happier Life” Recently I was asked to contribute to a piece for The M Dash , the online magazine for clothing brand M.M.LaFleur , about what it’s like to feel lost at work at various stages in life. While my deepest area of expertise is coaching and training mid-career women who recognize they want and deserve a better, happier professional life, I’ve worked with hundreds of women and men across a fuller span of their lives, including recent grads, post-baby and later career. As we all know, people can feel seriously adrift in their careers at any and all of these stages. But each stage brings with it specific challenges and questions.
Below is a look at what contributes to feeling lost and confused in your career at three key stages of our lives, and some first steps to take.
Recent Graduation
In just starting out, recent grads often feel lost in a number of critical ways. First, many feel that what they went to school for was something their parents and authority figures told them was the “stable, secure” choice, but in their hearts, they never enjoyed what they were studying or felt that it wasn’t aligned with who they are and what they care about.
When these folks graduate, they already feel like they’re behind many others who had a focused passion for what they studied and are thrilled about the possibility of doing work that leverages all that they learned.
Another way recent grads feel lost is that they may have studied something they loved, but now, in their efforts to land gainful employment, they find that what they learned in school, while interesting, just isn’t helping them get jobs. I’ve interviewed scores of young people who graduated from good schools, with great grades, and solid majors, only to discover that they couldn’t find a job to save their lives.
Thirdly, today’s workforce has become fiercely competitive , and recent grads often find that they’re behind the eight ball and not competing successfully with other young people who’ve already racked up impressive internships and other related work experience in the years before graduation. Without these internships or related work experience, many recent grads, especially in highly competitive fields, feel that their opportunities are very slim and they’re already falling behind their peers.
Another contributing factor—how you were raised
It’s a very common time to feel lost because we’re moving out of the teen phase where our parents have been very influential in our lives (and often too hands-on), doing so much for us. Here we are on our own, trying to handle adult responsibilities that, in many cases, we haven’t been properly trained or prepared for. We can feel at sea with all the steps we have to take to create new, successful adult lives.
Several years ago, I published an interview here on Forbes.com with leadership expert Tim Elmore in which he shared the 7 Crippling Parenting Behaviors That Keep Children from Growing Into Leaders . Close to 8 million people have read this article and it has had viral reach, I think, because millions of parents are realizing that they are not helping their children grow up to lead their own lives authoritatively and confidently.
Tips: In a recent interview on my Finding Brave podcast, I spoke with Austin Belchak, Founder of Cultivated Culture , on How To Land a Dream Job at the Salary You Deserve . He shares his personal experience feeling totally lost after graduation. Austin studied science but when he left school, he simply couldn’t find a job, no matter what he tried. He decided to explore a new approach and went on to interview scores of other young people who had had very little work experience yet were able to land amazing jobs at the nation’s most coveted employers. Austin researched exactly how they did that, and in this research process, he learned so much. Austin eventually got a great job and also launched his own business helping other recent graduates do what’s necessary to find jobs of their dreams. It’s an inspiring story with great tips and strategies.
What to do:
Don’t go it alone
When we’re feeling lost, the very first thing is to reach out to someone who can help. This is true no matter what stage of life you’re in. Einstein said, “We cannot solve a problem on the level of consciousness that created it.” I know that if I had reached out for help back when I was just starting out, I wouldn’t have accepted the very first job that I was offered (which I didn’t want, and it set me on a trajectory of unhappy corporate life for 18 years).
When you’re lost and overwhelmed, don’t try to tackle the situation on your own. Find a mentor, a friend, a coach or coaching buddy, a therapist, someone who can help you address what you’re feeling and thinking, and help you see other perspectives and strategies to address what seems insurmountable.
Recognize your strengths and identify work outcomes you care about
Begin to do the work of recognizing what you’re great at (those natural talents and skills that have been with you for a long time and that you love to use). Explore different jobs that require those specific skills and talents. Secondly, know that, in order to succeed in your work, it’s not enough to do tasks you enjoy. You also have to feel good about the outcomes that you’re striving hard to achieve in your job. The company’s goals have to be aligned with what you care about and respect. If you’re working incredibly hard every day for outcomes that you don’t believe in, you won’t thrive.
Understand the culture that you’ll feel good in
Every organization has its own culture, “feel” and style. And not every individual will be a fit with those cultures. Take some time to identify the specific traits of work cultures that appeal to you and will be a strong fit with your values and personality. Then start to network extensively ( and become a true connector ) to help you identify and connect with organizations that you’d love to contribute to.
Post-Baby
What I hear most often from women who are new mothers (and men who’ve become new fathers) and are feeling lost in their careers is this: the very process of having a baby has changed everything for them and made them rethink how they want to spend their time, and how they want to balance parenting with being an active and successful professional.
Childbirth is such a monumental experience that often leads us to rethink who we are in the world, and what matters most to us. Frequently, people experience a new sense of frustration and disappointment as they realize that they’re leaving their baby in the care of others while trudging off to do work they find meaningless, harmful or unsatisfying.
As time goes on and the children grow, the sheer challenge of balancing new and evolving parenting responsibilities with an already-full plate at work can lead parents to feel utterly lost and unable to cope.
Tips: Whenever we feel lost, it’s essential to take some time to get in closer touch with what we feel and think. It’s common to get flooded by our emotions and feel unable to see the possibilities in front of us, for taking control of our lives, making different kinds of choices, and honoring what we care about most. Take some time to simply be and adjust to this monumental change in your life, and to get to know yourself as this new person who has another important role in life to balance. Find some quiet time each day (even if it’s 5-10 minutes) to just allow yourself to think, feel and be quiet with yourself.
This will help you sort out what is causing the most distress or challenge right now. Is it that you don’t have enough time in the day to do what you need to? If so, it’ll be important to re-evaluate everything you’re trying to achieve, and start fiercely prioritizing what matters most. It'll be important to stop being a perfectionistic overfunctioner and get more help where you need to).
For others, it’s that in the wake of just having a child, what they didn’t like about their careers is more glaring than ever. Explore all those feelings more deeply, and try to tease out the specific parts of your career and professional life that are no longer acceptable. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Just decide on some small, doable steps you take to address what isn’t working.
Midlife
I’ve worked with thousands of mid-life professionals, and so many of them are lost in a way that’s different from recent grads and younger adults. Commonly, they’ve spent 20+ years working so hard to build a career that they hoped would be satisfying and sustainable, often to find it’s neither of those things, and they have no idea what to do about it.
The challenge at this stage is that we often have a great deal to lose if we want to leave our old careers behind. Many people at this time in life have children who rely on them, expensive mortgages, credit card debt, student loans to pay off, and other responsibilities that make changing course at 40 very challenging. That feeling of “lost” can be extremely depressing and confusing. And they stay paralyzed.
I’ve discovered there are five core steps that anyone can take to help them out of that feeling of being lost and paralyzed. These steps are highly effective, and also prevent us from making costly mistakes as we try to discover what we really want out of life, and get on a more rewarding and successful path.
Those steps are:
Step Back – for an empowered perspective of who you are, what you’re capable and what you’ve already accomplished that makes you valuable in the world. Watch my TEDx talk ""Time To Brave Up"" for exercises that will help.
Let Go – of the thinking, patterns and behaviors that are keeping you stuck
Say YES! – to your most compelling visions and dreams for your future and your life
Explore – Try on – behaviorally, emotionally, and physically - with doable (risk-free) microsteps, the top three directions that excite you most, to help you determine if these new pathways will in fact be what you really want
Create It S.M.A.R.T. – build a sound plan, with specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound goals, and with an accountability structure, to help you move forward in ways that will get you to your goals.
The truth is, we can feel lost at any time in our lives when the way we’re living isn’t aligning with what makes us happy and what we believe is right for us. We can feel lost when our work has pulled us away from our core values and our sense of integrity and honesty. We can feel lost when we’re being mistreated and discriminated against. We can feel lost when our relationships change and we’re no longer with people we enjoy and respect. We can feel lost when our children grow up and leave us feeling empty and despairing because our life’s work has dramatically shifted. And we can feel lost when we’re experiencing what I’ve found to be the 7 most damaging power gaps that keep us from taking control and being powerful and effective authors of our own lives.
In all cases, reach out to someone to get outside help to see yourself and what you’re capable of more clearly. Gain awareness of (and honor) what you’re feeling and thinking and try to understand more deeply what is contributing to the challenges you face today. Then, start taking “ finding brave ” microsteps every day that will shift your life experience and mindset and give you proof that you can change what isn’t working, and transform your career and life in ways that are satisfying and joyful.

5 Digital Marketing & eCommerce Success Stories To Draw Inspiration From,www.forbes.com,Maciej Duraj,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maciejduraj/2019/04/13/5-digital-marketing-ecommerce-success-stories-to-draw-inspiration-from/,"In today's highly competitive e-commerce and digital marketing world, it is not easy for a company to stand out. Many startups facing great odds of even making it and end up falling or being absorbed by bigger companies along the way. However, some incredible success stories have also arisen that are worth learning from and aspiring to in order to learn how to follow in their footsteps. One thing to take away form these individuals is many of them started out from humble beginnings but had a drive to succeed despite the odds. They relied on unique products, innovative methods of marketing, and finding the right people to surround themselves with in order to keep going. 1. Driving E-commerce Logistics the Smart Way
If you want to build a successful e-commerce brand, particularly your own platform for transactions, you need to find the right logistics behind it. One such company focusing on the logistics part of the business, namely drop shipping, is uDroppy . The company focuses on sourcing, fulfillment, and shipping and can alleviate this burden for companies that want to focus on their main tasks of marketing, development of their platforms or product design.
Udroppy was by Luca Borreani and Nicolo Manica. Both are Italian-born entrepreneurs and world traveler. What makes their story interesting is that they actually paid for their master's degrees (both hold multiple each) with money they generated from marketing campaigns. They continue to be an inspiration for many young entrepreneurs and marketing professionals worldwide. Sometimes all it takes is a good idea or simple concept and with the right people behind it, the idea can turn into something special.
“The concept was really simple at the beginning: creating a B2B platform that connects E-Commerce stores, both using dropshipping and warehouse business models, to suppliers,” according to their profile on Ideamensch .
2. Teaching Marketing Strategies Through Online Coursework
Another success story worth taking a look at and be aspired from is that of Eric Dyck from iStack Training . This is an educational community with courses available, events, podcasts and other advice that can help aspiring online marketers and e-commerce hopefuls gain some useful knowledge in the field.
Eric has a captivating and interesting history as he originally started as an independent affiliate and promoted toolbar downloads on Google Adwords. He specializes in “performance marketing” and focuses on helping entrepreneurs and marketers leverage their technical skillsets associated with digital and online marketing campaigns.
3. Leveraging Online Privacy to Start a Successful Venture
Online privacy is a very hot topic today due to the many controversies that stemmed over the last couple of years from Wikileaks revelations of NSA eavesdropping to Facebook data snooping and many others. People want to be in control over their own data and privacy online. One entrepreneur who has leveraged this need into something worth drawing inspiration from is Alexandru Iulian Florea from online.io .
Online.io is a peer to peer virtual private network that leverages p2p residential networking with cryptocurrency. If you check out the site, it is quite captivating with moving images or gifs showing elaborate graphics in minuscule form. However, the focus is clearly on various methods of securing privacy and private communication online.
What makes this entrepreneur and privacy advocate unique is his story of success, which you can read in-depth on Entrepreneur . He started out from humble upbringings with a stark choice in hand: go to college (he was dropped out at this point), leave his mother's house, get a job in a hotel, or figure out some crazy way to make money online within weeks. He chooses the latter and it was affiliate marketing that brought him some fame and fortune and thus paved the way for his latest venture.
4. Utilizing Facebook as an Effective Marketing Platform
Using social media for marketing is nothing new and many marketing professionals have made careers out of it. The social media platform truly morphed over the years to become a great way to reach out for new audiences and customers as well as even sell directly to customers. Facebook after all also offers e-commerce and many ways to generate profits.
One entrepreneur and marketer who we can draw inspiration from in her success of leveraging the Facebook platform is Christina Szekeres of IMQueen Consulting . She does not hold back on her success with the moniker “FBQueen” and offers various workshops and other consulting services to help new entrepreneurs succeed. She was born in Hungary and currently resides in Southern California. Some of her advice to take away is to attend meetups and network instead of trying to figure everything out yourself; start out with an email submit affiliate if you have a limited budget and have strategic calls with your team weekly.
5. Hiring Those in Need & Often Underemployed Populations to Allow a Brand to Shine
Imagine finding out that a company is leveraging 30 mothers to run a jewelry company. That is exactly what Founder of ShineOne Jewelry , Eric Toczko, has done. ShineOn, being leveraged through Shopify uses a mobile app to function as an affiliate e-commerce platform. It also launches its own jewelry products regularly.
Toczko's history as an entrepreneur truly speaks of itself when the phrase, “coming from humble beginnings” is ushered. He started out in a basement in Brooklyn while sleeping on a bare mattress at night. The way he entered into jewelry production and e-commerce was that he saw a gap in the market for digital marketers to be able to sell jewelry with zero upfront costs and minimal risk. He also credits his success to his morning routine of exercising, cold showers, tea, and meditation.
All of these entrepreneurs offer something unique to the table to take away from and learn in order for you to drive a new business venture successfully forward. Startups and new ventures these days have to be able to compete on a stage with other players that may have had a head start, more VC funding and already have the right marketing in place to drive growth. However, do not be discouraged as these entrepreneurs and marketing pros showed that sometimes it just takes a good idea or strong will to mark your presence and create a successful brand."

Getty On Saturday, the UFC visits Atlanta for the first time in nearly three years when it presents UFC 236 from State Farm Arena, and while the two most recent events in the city featured title fights, UFC 236 has two interim title bouts at the top of the card.
In the main event, Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier run back their 2012 matchup. The interim UFC lightweight title is on the line in the rematch.
A lot has changed since Poirier submitted Holloway in the first round of their meeting on the preliminary card of UFC 143. Most notably, that bout was Holloway’s first trip to the UFC octagon. Holloway, who was just 20 years old at the time, brought a 4-0 record into the contest. Poirier, who was 23 when the first fight between these two took place, was 11-1 overall and 3-0 in the UFC. Holloway, who is the current UFC featherweight champion, is now 16-4 with the promotion and on a 13-fight winning streak. Poirier, who moved up to lightweight in 2015, is 8-1-0-1 since changing weight divisions. His career record stands at 24-5-0-1. Poirier has won his past three fights by way of stoppage. UFC 236 marks Holloway’s first foray into the 155-pound division.
In the co-headlining bout, Kelvin Gastelum and Israel Adesanya face off in a matchup to determine the interim middleweight champion. Gastelum is coming off a long break. His most recent bout was a May 2018 split-decision triumph over Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza. Meanwhile, Adesanya has been very busy. He made his UFC debut in February 2018 with a win over Rob Wilkinson. Since then he has racked up four additional victories, most recently earning a split-decision win over former middleweight champion Anderson Silva in the main event of February’s UFC 234.
The UFC elected to reward interim titles in these two weight divisions because the current champions are going to be sidelined for some time. UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov is serving a suspension tied to the brawl that broke out after his UFC 229 submission victory over Conor McGregor. As for the middleweight division, 185-pound champion Robert Whittaker is recovering from emergency surgery. He was scheduled to face Gastelum in the main event of UFC 234 but was unable to compete on that card after he was rushed into surgery on fight day to deal with an abdominal hernia and a ruptured bowel.
UFC 236 marks a significant change in how American fans can purchase pay-per-view cards. The UFC has moved all of its PPV events to ESPN+ in the States. Potential viewers are now required to have an ESPN+ subscription to purchase the event. Cable and satellite services will no longer carry the UFC OOV events. This change is something to keep in mind when looking to buy UFC 236 and future PPV cards. ESPN+ is $4.99 per month and the UFC PPV price is $59.99. Previous PPV events carried a $64.99 price tag. ESPN+ offers a one week free trial.

"Chinese Investments: Malaysia Dares Something Sri Lanka, Pakistan, And Philippines Didn't",www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/04/13/chinese-investments-malaysia-dares-something-sri-lanka-pakistan-and-philippines-didnt/,"In dealing with China, Malaysia has dared to do something Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and the Philippines didn’t: bring Beijing back to the negotiating table to cut the cost of the investment projects assigned to Chinese contractors. This week, China agreed to cut the cost of East Coast Rail Link project by one-third.
The new deal is a big win for Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He made good on his election campaign promise to re-negotiate China’s investments in the country, which served the interests of Beijing more than they served the interests of Kuala Lumpur.
The East Coast Rail is one of the dozens of China’s infrastructure projects around the world – a bid to write the next chapter of globalization and advance Beijing’s geopolitical agenda.
“China has political and military ambitions to fill this void,” says Xiaomeng Lu, China practice lead at Access Partnership, a global public policy consultancy for the tech sector. “Chinese President Xi aims to realize the ‘great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’ by projecting power overseas through the “Belt and Road” initiative, which covers both Southeast Asia and Africa. This political economy effort is paired with China’s growing military might in the South China Sea and the African continent, posing a growing challenge to the U.S. security umbrella worldwide.”
The trouble is that many of China’s infrastructure projects aren’t economically viable, as they are built at inflated costs and leave countries involved heavily indebted to Beijing.
That’s what happened to Sri Lanka.
“While some of China’s infrastructure projects benefited the island, others proved to be costly white elephants that forced Sri Lanka into a debt trap,” say Neil DeVotta and Sumit Ganguly in “Sri Lanka’s Post—Civil War Problems,” published in the April issue of CURRENT HISTORY. Like the deep-sea Hambantota port project, the Colombo Port City complex, and the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport. “The overpriced projects left Sri Lanka owing $8 billion, or around 10 percent of the island’s debt. That is close to what Sri Lanka owes Japan and India, but what rankles many is how Chinese loans have been used to fund questionable projects that generate little income.”
:The situation has fueled accusations that China seeks to entice strategically located countries (others include Djibouti and the Maldives) into debt traps that it then leverages to seize control of key infrastructure.”
It’s this debt trap that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been trying to avoid. Back in August he canceled the East Coast Rail Link project, forcing China back to the negotiating table. And he is winning, as evidenced by the new deal, which has cut the cost of the project substantially.
Will Duterte and Imran Ahmed Khan dare to do the same, and save their countries from the fate of Sri Lanaka? It remains to be seen.

Why Uber Lacks A Sustainable Competitive Advantage,www.forbes.com,Peter Cohan,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/04/13/why-uber-lacks-a-sustainable-competitive-advantage/,"As I wrote on April 11 , Uber is unprofitable because it lacks a moat -- which I prefer to call a sustainable competitive advantage . What Is a Sustainable Competitive Advantage?
Competitive advantage is measured by profit share -- a company's share of an industry's profits. This definition means that a competitive advantage is impossible if an industry lacks profitability.
And based on the financial results of Lyft and Uber, there are no profits to be had in the ride-sharing industry. For instance, Lyft posted a $900 million loss in 2018 and Uber topped that with a $3 billion loss from operations.
The problem with ride-sharing -- a so-called two-sided market -- is that there are low barriers to entry and the switching costs are low on both the supply side -- the drivers -- and the demand side -- consumers.
As a result, the industry features ""numerous players offering virtually the same services. They are in a spending arms race to draw new drivers and consumers, bidding up ads on Facebook and Google and forking out hefty bonuses to new drivers,"" according to the Wall Street Journal .
Uber's market share lead is a pyrrhic victory since the company is losing money. Nevertheless, those market share gains provide an opportunity to highlight the fundamental problems with its strategy by examining where Uber falls short on three key elements of competitive advantage.
1. Giving customers more bang for the buck
When people buy things, they compare different suppliers on a ranked set of factors. For Amazon customers those factors, or customer purchase criteria (CPC), include price, fast delivery and reliable service. Consumers choose Amazon because it does better than its competition on these CPC.
My experience suggests that ride-sharing CPC include how long riders must wait for a driver, whether the fare is competitive, and whether the driver is competent and unlikely to do something nasty.
Lyft's ability to increase its U.S. ride-sharing market substantially when Uber was suffering from its period of worst public attention in 2017 suggests that Uber has been losing out on that third factor.
Indeed, Uber's prospectus highlighted this problem noting that ""in 2017, the #DeleteUber campaign prompted hundreds of thousands of consumers to stop using our platform within days. Subsequently, our reputation was further harmed when an employee published a blog post alleging, among other things, that we had a toxic culture and that certain sexual harassment and discriminatory practices occurred in our workplace.""
Lyft gained market share as a result of its perceived superiority over Uber on that third criterion. In May 2018, Lyft said its U.S. ride-sharing market share had increased to 35% from 20% in the fall of 2016, according to CNBC .
Sadly for Uber, its new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, has not made these problems disappear. For example, an April 4 New York Times article documented passengers getting into a car that they thought was an Uber -- but was in fact driven by a criminal. And on April 13, the Sun Sentinel wrote about an Uber driver arrested for attempted sexual battery.
2. Harnessing capabilities to win at scale
Winning and keeping customers — especially when a company has millions of them — depends on doing certain things well. For Amazon, such capabilities include offering a wide selection of products and services, operating an efficient supply chain to fulfill orders; and providing excellent customer service.
Uber's prospectus documents what sounds like a brilliantly conceived collection of capabilities -- which it dubs the Liquidity Network Effect.
The basic idea is that as the number of drivers increases in a new location, Uber's market coverage improves which reduces average wait times and attracts more consumers. The boost in demand increases the volume of trips which in turn increases driver utilization -- attracting more drivers and cutting fares.
3. Sustaining competitive superiority
Uber's advantage -- it clearly dominates the U.S. ride sharing market -- is not sustainable because investors are willing to fund rivals who compete away all the profit in the industry and more.
The capital lets rivals replicate Uber's basic strategy while charging low fares and paying up for drivers.
For example, Lyft raised over $4 billion since the start of 2018—including more than $2 billion in its March 29 IPO—""and lured numerous riders as Uber struggled with scandals that hurt its brand. Lyft has also aggressively offered discounted fares in recent months,"" according to the Journal.
This put the brakes on Uber's growth. For example, in its S1, Uber said that its revenues have been diminished due to “heavy subsidies and discounts by our competitors” which the company has been matching “in order to remain competitive.”
In the last quarter of 2018, this price war cost Uber growth in the revenue it gets from ride-sharing. For instance, total fares paid by riders rose 9% but its adjusted revenue -- which tracks Uber's share of rider fares paid was unchanged, according to the Journal.
The total bill paid to drivers and restaurants by Uber Eats customers rose an impressive 20% while Uber's share of those revenues tumbled 14% during the quarter.
And that trend is likely to persist -- Uber expects that its ""take rate"" -- its share of the customer payments -- will “decrease in the near term,” after having improved over the past few years, noted the Journal.
Since Lyft is suffering from a busted IPO -- its shares have fallen 32% from their first day peak of $88 -- and Uber is in danger of suffering a similar fate; it remains to be seen whether public investors will be willing to continue to fight this money-losing battle where scale does not confer pricing power or lower costs.
The share prices of these companies could rise if they can grow revenues much faster than investors expect. But since they compete in inherently unprofitable markets without sustainable competitive advantage, investors should look elsewhere for public equity profits."
