ALL the people that are around him know he has a problem and don't address it.
It is a fact that Joe Biden in February, 1988, underwent surgery to repair one of the
weakened/ballooning arteries on one side of his brain. In August, 1988, the second damaged artery (bleeding) on the other side of the Vice President’s brain needed to be repaired (it is clipped).
Could this be causing him to make tactless remarks, to laugh inappropriately,and to be over-familiar towards others. Includes sexual behavior -making inappropriate sexual advances or remarks? Needs to be investigated.
As a nurse for over thirty years, I have seen three cases like his (can be retrained). Remember the ""nude"" swimming in front of female Secret Service? (the man has no filter)."

An amendment to a bill on violence against women was passed unanimously in the Italian parliament on 2 April, setting prison terms of up to six years for the unsolicited sharing of compromising erotic pictures or video, known as “revenge porn”.
The proposal was put forward by the opposition Forza Italia party of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and is part of a reform bill that aims to give greater protection to victims of violence and stalking.
The vote was unanimous after it gained support both from the centre-left Democratic Party. Italy’s ruling populist coalition — made up of the hard-right Lega , or League, party of Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and the leftist anti-establishment Five Star Movement of Luigi di Maio , who also serves as deputy prime minister, had largely rejected the revenge porn proposal last week.
The decision caused an outcry amongst Italian lawmakers which sparked a much-heated protest from opposition members from both the left and the right. Share on Facebook"

Each member chairs the UN Security Council for a month. France held the position in March and now with Germany taking over for April, the two countries fulfilled their “twinning arrangement”– a largely symbolic move that aims to show their common standing as the core central players of the EU. The common agenda of the dual presidency is a focus on crisis-prevention in Africa, small arms trade in the Balkans, and spearheading a campaign against sexual violence in conflict zones. In April, Germany will chair a Security Council meeting that will focus on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. France and Germany also coordinated closely with the other EU members of the Security Council, including the UK, Belgium and Poland, regarding issues tied to defence and multilateral cooperation frameworks. Several countries are vying to become permanent seat on the UN Security Council. including Germany, Japan, Brazil, and India. The current structure of the security council is largely a consequence of World War II. Since the early 2000s, however, support for Germany to become a permanent member of the Security Council has been steadily growing. Germany is the third largest contributor to the UN budget, after the United States, and Japan and the biggest provider of troops within the UN framework. Share on Facebook"

Unemployment has dropped dramatically in Ireland since 2012 when the country was immersed in a financial crisis and the jobless rate stood at 16%. The Irish economy continued to expand in 10 of its 14 main economic sectors in the fourth quarter of 2018, with services and construction driving the economy. Ireland is also attracting EU migration, particularly in the technology sector, but also in civil engineering and health services. The Irish economy continues to grow robustly, despite Brexit uncertainty and the deceleration of growth in Italy, Germany, and France. Tax revenue continues to surpass projections, with a 7.1% increase in the first quarter compared to last year. Thus far, corporation tax is double of what was projected for the 2019 budget while the budget deficit is also on a downward trajectory, despite a surge in Irish contributions to the EU budget.

The head of a leading Muslim group has voiced his concerns about the “negative treatment” that many Muslim minorities feel that they’re subjected to in Europe.
Addressing the Faith and Freedom Summit in Brussels, Bashy Quraichy , the secretary general of the European Muslim Initiative for Social Cohesion, said populists and others were “spreading hatred” against Muslim communities, and noted that the number of hate crime incidents directed at Muslims had “jumped many folds…This, in turn, is breeding violence, murders and property damages.”
The summit is a non-partisan coalition of faith-based NGOs which seeks to raise awareness about threats, including within Europe, to religious freedom and belief. It is asking election candidates this May to sign a pledge that, in part, commits them to deal with the issues in the next parliamentary term.
Quraichy said that according to Tell Mama, a national project that records anti-Muslim incidents in the United Kingdom, that hate crimes against Muslims had soared after the recent shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Tensions exist all over the world, he noted, citing the recent conflict between India and Pakistan as well as the treatment of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar and China’s oppression of the Uighurs in the country’s Xinjiang province.
The European Muslim Initiative for Social Cohesion is a “powerful movement” against religious discrimination and according to Quraichy, and it should appeal to the EU, especially the European Parliament, “to be more proactive in order to warn those countries who commit acts of oppression against religious minorities.”
Europe, he believes, needs to act in an “inclusive fashion” and not be “selective as to who to put pressure on and who not.”
A need for more NGOs like his own that are able to build visible alliances that help shed light on issues like China’s crackdown on the Uighurs “is needed,” Quraichy said, adding that he wants to go beyond the proposals put forth by the Faith and Freedom Coalition and would like to see the Commission set up an office that deals with religious discrimination.

(Worst Prime Minister Ever Title) Christopher Furlong JAMES DELINGPOLE 3 Apr 2019 By George, I think she’s got it! There were those who thought that Theresa May never had it in her: that she was just too charmlessly dull, too grindingly, maddeningly tediously vanilla, too robotically ordinary to clinch the title.
And the competition was so stiff too:
From Lord North, the prime minister who lost the American colonies, to Anthony Eden, the fellow responsible for our abject humiliation at Suez; from Tony Blair, the simpering perma-tanned spiv who took us into the Iraq War on a false prospectus, put thought crime on the statute books, and transformed Britain into nirvana for lefty human rights lawyers and SJW cry bullies, to Gordon Brown, the curmudgeonly loser at the helm during the last crash; not forgetting circus clown John Major and dodgy Harold Wilson and Grocer Heath, the creepy chipster who dragged us into the Common Market on yet another false prospectus; then there’s Atlee the hideously overrated Socialist who gave us our Stalinist healthcare system and Chamberlain, who thought he’d solved Hitler by waving that piece of paper… On and on the list of shame goes.
But there’s no doubt who’s at the top. Not any more. Theresa May is now beyond all question the worst prime minister in history.
How did she do it?
Well it was a stroke of genius, really. She’d just reached the stage in her political career when there was only one sane and proper thing she could have done to justify her gravely mistaken decision to have a go at being prime minister of the greatest country on earth: deliver Brexit.
And it would have been so easy, too. All she had to do was admit that her government had reached such an impasse on Brexit that it was impossible for her to proceed any further with her proposed Withdrawal Agreement; and that therefore she had no option but to accede to the electorate’s clearly and democratically expressed wishes for a so-called No Deal Brexit. Then, having said that, she could have tendered her resignation.
If she had wanted to be remembered favourably by history, this would have been a genius move. At a stroke it would have silenced all those critics who have written her off as the thick, stubborn, grotesquely anti-democratic, wilful anti-Brexit saboteur who presided over the destruction of the Conservative Party and the wrecking of the constitution. In one bound, she would have become the nation’s almost-heroine: the woman who finally did the right thing once all the possibilities had been exhausted.
Yes, Theresa May really did come that close to nearly being mentioned in the same breath as Margaret Thatcher. Just an “OK then. No Deal Brexit it is” would have been all it took to elevate her to the status of, well, not quite national treasure but definitely to “well she really wasn’t that bad, was she, all things considered — especially the last bit…”
But she blew it, didn’t she? That’s because all along she had her glowing red cyborg eyes on the greater prize.
“You think I can’t get any worse?” she asked the nation. “Hold my Prosecco!”
And that’s when she did it. Here was her masterstroke. She became the Conservative prime minister who decided that the solution to the constitutional crisis enveloping Britain was this: to ignore the result of the biggest vote in history, trample over her party grassroots, make the Conservatives pretty much unelectable for a generation — and let the decision be taken instead by the Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Yes, by Red Jeremy Corbyn, the terrorist-supporting, anti-capitalist, antisemitic, anti-free-speech, economically illiterate Socialist who has decided — or rather his puppet-masters have — that Britain can best honour the referendum result by staying in the Customs Union. (The Customs Union being the part of EU membership everyone who understands the EU agrees is the most damaging and restrictive because it stops Britain making free trade deals with other countries and means that for all eternity Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, will have its international trading rules decided by its traditional enemies the French and the Germans.)
If this is the outcome then a heap of trouble lies ahead, for the people who voted Brexit — and they are, remember, the majority; also, this is how democracy is supposed to work, and everyone is aware of this — are not going to take this betrayal lying down.
Here’s a taste from Twitter:
