The Russian military says it has tested its most up-to-date version of the Pantsir air defense system. The test took place in March at a test site in the Astrakhan region, according to Moscow’s TASS news agency.The Pantsir, or SA-22, combines short and medium range missiles with guns or anti-aircraft artillery. It is self-propelled, meaning it is mounted on a large truck. The Pantsir system tested in Russia in March is the SM variant, according to the report, which has an extended range of up to 40 km. “The Pantsir-SM showed its high efficiency against ultra-small targets,” said Air Defense and Missile Defense Forces Deputy commander Yuri Grekhov. This means the system was tested against small drones or quadcopters. Drones and other types of UAVs have become a major problem for militaries in recent years, as technology allows the best armies to be more versatile using their drones and even allows terrorist groups to re-purpose civilian drones to harass forces. For instance, Russia’s Khmeimim Air Base in Syria has been regularly targeted by drones, according to reports. Most of these are likely flown by terrorist or Syrian rebel groups based in Idlib. But Russia has also hinted that the US or others have coordinated drone attacks.The benefit of using drones to knock out air defense systems is that a military can lose drones more readily than risking the loss of a pilot. In addition, modern armies now have access to loitering munitions or “suicide drones,” which is basically a drone that is designed around a warhead and destroys itself on impact. Unlike a cruise missile or smart bomb, these kinds of drones can theoretically return to base or self-destruct – and can “loiter” over the target for hours – whereas a guided missile can’t fly in circles for hours. A variety of different weapons have reportedly been used in Syria against Syrian air defense. This includes hundreds of airstrikes Israel has said it carried out.Russia has been seeking to showcase its air defense systems in recent years, with major sales of the S-400 to Turkey and other countries. In addition, Moscow wants to show that its layered missile and air defense is high quality. This is made more complex by the fact that Syrian regime-operated Pantsir systems have been destroyed in airstrikes. These were older versions; Russia wants to show that it now has a missile and air defense solution that can deal with small drones and other threats. This potentially can be a lucrative market for Moscow if the system is shown to work well. Very few countries produce cutting edge air defense – the US and Israel being two others – and Russia has a long list of worldwide customers that it has sold to in the past.

The natural disaster has also revealed some of the fundamental weaknesses of a dysfunctional system that, having devoted its principal resources and much of its energies to promoting a weird ideology, seems to be incapable of coping with basic tasks of a normal nation-state.

Iranians watched in amazement as special units of the regular army moved to save lives, prevent floods from spreading further, reopen roads and even start repairing some of the damage.

It may take weeks if not months before the full facts of the current nationwide floods in Iran are established. But we already know that the floods represent one of the biggest natural disasters Iran has suffered in half a century.
According to provisional data from the Islamic Red Crescent, the floods struck in over 300 towns and cities in 22 of Iran's 31 provinces, affecting 18.5 million people, almost a quarter of the nation's total population. Some 1.2 million people have been made homeless, at least temporarily.
The damage done to infrastructure across the nation is equally massive. With 141 rivers in flood and some 500 landslides over 3,000 kilometers of roads and highways connecting thousands of villages, 78 medium or large cities have been partly or totally destroyed.
Also destroyed are 87 bridges, 160 dams and over 1,000 kilometers of railway lines. The floods have put over 18,000 factories and workshops out of action while the damage done to farming is described as ""incalculable.""
From a broader point of view perhaps, the natural disaster has also revealed some of the fundamental weaknesses of a dysfunctional system that, having devoted its principal resources and much of its energies to promoting a weird ideology, seems to be incapable of coping with basic tasks of a normal nation-state.
It took the parallel authorities that coexist in Tehran more than 48 hours before they realized what was going on, giving the state-controlled media the green light to report on it.
Then it took another two days before the various duplicating organs of the state, decided who was supposed to do what. President Hassan Rouhani, spending a week-long holiday in the island resort of Qishm, appeared beyond reach. ""Supreme Guide"" Ali Khamenei, too busy with a poetry gathering, was unavailable for days and found it unnecessary even to comment.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), often boasting about its imaginary conquests in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen and promising to hoist the flag of Khomeinism in Washington, was forced to intervene -- not to save the stricken citizens but to protect some of the infrastructures it has built and runs as businesses.
It was soon revealed that those infrastructures, including railway lines built in traditional flood channels and dams hastily erected in wrong places and wrong rivers, massively contributed to the floods.
The IRGC has built over 300 crude dams to divert waters of various rivers to land it had seized and transferred to active and/or retired officers.
In a strategy that recalls that of the Chavistas in Venezuela, the IRGC has also helped many peasants, seen as part of the regime's support base, to cut down large tracts of forests, further raising the risk of floods.
More than a week after the disaster had struck, Rouhani, using thinly veiled words, put the blame on the IRGC's cowboy-style ""social"" building projects and profiteering schemes. IRGC chief General Muhammad-Ali Aziz-Jaafari riposted by accusing Rouhani's cabinet of incompetence and poor leadership.
The failure of the official government led by Rouhani and the unofficial one led by Gen. Jaafari, both under Khamenei's ultimate control, at least theoretically, provided a space for other actors to jump in.
The first to do so was the national army which, since the mullahs seized power in 1979, has been treated as a Cinderella in boots.
Iranians watched in amazement as special units of the regular army moved to save lives, prevent floods from spreading further, reopen roads and even start repairing some of the damage. Buoyed by the presence of regular army units, thousands of volunteers also poured in to help deal with the disaster. Contacts across Iran describe the solidarity shown by average citizens as ""exemplary"", implying that Iran deserves a better government.
The IRGC reacted by ferrying in dozens of ""Madaheen"", professional reciters of religious chants whose patron is Khamenei. The ""Madaheen"" jumped into flood waters chanting ""Suffering makes us strong!"" and ""We are not afraid of death"" while beating their chests the way they do when they mourn the martyr Imam Hussein at Muharram .
In some places they were accompanied by women who attend Muharram mourning sessions as ""tear-shedding assistants.""
The parallel governments also spent time debating whether or not to appeal for outside assistance.
While the official foreign ministry awaited instructions regarding contact with the International Red Cross and other aid agencies, the unofficial foreign ministry, located in Khamenei's office, decided that ""those who know how to mourn Hussein"" need not humiliate themselves by shaking a begging bowl at ""Cross-Worshippers and Zionists.""
In the Bam earthquake in 2003, over 60 countries rushed to help Iran cope with the disaster. The façade government at the time, led by President Muhammad Khatami, had welcomed foreign aid. That had angered the ""Supreme Guide"".
""How could we humiliate Islam in the face of the Infidel?"" Khamenei had demanded.
This time, however, the façade government, headed by the hapless Rouhani, dared not defy the ""Supreme Guide"". Rouhani's First Assistant, Eshaq Jahangiri, had this to say: ""A country as rich as the Islamic Republic has no need of foreign assistance.""
However, to fool his American apologists, Muhammad Javad Zarif, the man who plays the role of foreign minister, still had to blame the United States for lack of any foreign assistance or even sympathy.
""American sanctions prevent help from reaching Iran,"" Zarif's spokesman said last Monday.
However, everyone knows that humanitarian aid as well as food and medicine and other items of trade with no probable military use are not covered by the US, the European Union and the United Nations sanctions.
In any case there is no sanction against a foreign leader, our dear friend President Vladimir Putin for example, phoning someone in Tehran to express condolences and sympathy.
The problem is that Putin wouldn't know whom to phone in Tehran: Rouhani the mullah, who plays as president, or Khamenei, who may feel insulted if he is told there has been a catastrophe in his ""Islamic"" paradise?

"'A Model of Hope for the World': 25 Years After Rwandan Genocide, New Film Shows Journey Toward Justice and Healing",www.commondreams.org,commondreams.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/04/07/model-hope-world-25-years-after-rwandan-genocide-new-film-shows-journey-toward,"Three orphans turned professional photographers interview survivors and perpetrators of the 100-day killing spree that left 800,000+ dead
by Jessica Corbett, staff writer 0 Comments Three orphans of the Rwandan genocide who became professional photographers are featured in a forthcoming film, entitled Camera Kids . (Photo: The GroundTruth Project /Vimeo)
As the world marks the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide on Sunday, a forthcoming documentary sheds light on the survivors and perpetrators' long journey toward justice and healing.
On April 7, 1994, members of Rwanda's dominant Hutu ethnic group launched a 100-day killing spree targeting Tutsis, an ethnic minority in the landlocked East African country. The international community stood by while an estimated 800,000 people or more were slaughtered—leaving 95,000 children without parents.
Gadi Habumugisha, Bizimana Jean, and Mussa Uwitonze were orphaned by the massacre. They are now professional photographers and fellows at The GroundTruth Project , the Boston-based nonprofit media organization behind the new film, entitled Camera Kids .
Watch the trailer :
After the genocide ended, Gadi, Bizimana, and Mussa were raised by American humanitarian Rosamond Carr at the Imbabazi Orphanage in Mutura, Rwanda. There, they received disposable Fuji cameras from Through the Eyes of Children, a nonprofit started in 2000 that holds photography workshops to teach vulnerable children how to capture and share their stories with the world.
The 19 orphans in Rwanda who participated in the nonprofit's first workshops became known as ""the camera kids."" Today, the three men featured in the documentary, who are now in their late 20s, are all project coordinators for Through the Eyes of Children.
""When we were kids, [Carr] used to tell us that we have to share with others what we have,"" Bizimana told TIME . ""This is the heritage she gave us. Giving other kids photography is doing what we promised her.""
Storytelling through a camera lens, Mussa explains in the film, ""that can be a like a medicine. That can heal someone.""
""When I learned photography, that's when I was able to express myself,"" Gadi reveals. ""I realized that I matter.""
The GroundTruth Project 's film , due out in 2020, follows the trio as they explore the genocide that claimed their parents' lives by interviewing and photographing those who survived, those responsible for the mass killing, and their families.
On Friday, PBS NewsHour aired a segment featuring clips from the film.
""I met this couple,"" says Gadi. ""One is a son of a perpetrator and the other one is a survivor. From killing each other, forgiving each other, reuniting with each other, living with each other, and now marrying, it's a sign of how far things have come.""
Watch the segment :
In a director's statement published by The GroundTruth Project , American filmmaker Beth Murphy emphasized the lessons about hatred and peace that the global community can take from the Rwandan genocide—and, hopefully, Camera Kids .
""It is impossible to study this history without drawing parallels to what's happening in our world today,"" Murphy wrote. ""With the rise of far-right populism around the world, white nationalists throughout the U.S. and all Western countries are using the same fear-stoking language Rwanda's genocide perpetrators used in the months and years leading up to the 1994 genocide. That's chilling.""
""When Rwanda emerged from its 100 days of darkness, forgiveness and reconciliation programs were not only encouraged, but also enforced,"" she noted. ""As people had been taught how to hate, now they were taught how to make peace. Twenty-five years after the genocide, the country has found a way to balance justice and healing, vengeance and forgiveness, and has become a model of hope for the world.""
This post has been updated with the planned release date for the film, due out in 2020.

BTRTN: Pete Buttigieg... Jimmy Carter Redux?,www.borntorunthenumbers.com,anonymous (noreply@blogger.com),04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.borntorunthenumbers.com/2019/04/btrtn-pete-buttigieg-jimmy-carter-redux.html,"You will love this site if you: (1) want accurate national election predictions, (2) are a political junkie, (3) don't have the time to track the campaigns, and/or (4) crave an informed overview of where things stand. BTRTN has everything you really need to know to stay informed – all in one place. Sunday, April 7, 2019 BTRTN: Pete Buttigieg... Jimmy Carter Redux? So when do we start to take Mayor Pete seriously? Steve is thinking 43 years ago. A Republican administration is reeling from the stench of unprecedented scandal. The incumbent Republican President is tarnished, widely unpopular, and considered such a buffoon that he is constantly ridiculed and lampooned by late night comedians. Democrats feel they have a clear shot to take back the White House, and a full seventeen candidates announce campaigns for the Presidency. We are not talking about 2020. We are describing 1976. That was the year that a peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia stormed out of absolutely nowhere to seize the Democratic Presidential nomination from rivals with far more relevant resumes, overwhelming advantages in name recognition, and vastly more experience in Washington. Now may be a good time to pull out the history books and understand the dynamics that led the country to elect a man who only a year before was an utter unknown, and who began his Presidential bid with national awareness below one percent. A year later, Jimmy Carter was President of the United States. There is an eerie echo of 1976 in the nascent ebbs and flows of the 2020 campaign, particularly in the unexpected surge of Pete Buttigieg, mayor of a city that does not even qualify as one of the three most populous cities in Indiana. If past proves prologue, it would be extremely unwise to dismiss the 37 year-old mayor of South Bend. Here’s why. Let’s start with a twitter-grade synopsis of the 1976 campaign. When Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace because of the Watergate scandal, Vice President Gerald Ford was sworn in as President. Ford had been named Vice President due to the resignation of elected VP Spiro Agnew, himself shamed by tax violations wholly separate from Watergate. Ford was earnest and well-meaning, and widely viewed to be a man of integrity. However, he made the decision to grant Richard Nixon a full pardon, causing cynics to believe that there had been a quid pro quo. Nixon, the theory went, would select Ford as VP if Ford promised to pardon Nixon. Ford’s popularity took a nose-dive. No longer the clean new sheriff in town, he was suddenly part of the scandal. The Republicans were on the run. However, America’s disillusionment with their government in that era was most certainly not solely a Republican issue. In fact, there were two seismic instances in which the government betrayed the public trust in this timeframe… Watergate and Vietnam. While the most horrific carnage to American troops in Vietnam war occurred in the late sixties, the war did not end until 1975. The Pentagon Papers, published in 1971, had revealed the government’s deceit about the history of the war. Vietnam was still a visceral and bitterly alienating issue in America in 1976, and it was an equal opportunity disaster for Republicans and Democrats. Presidents from both parties had contributed mightily to America’s disaster in Vietnam. Nevertheless, facing a weak Republican incumbent, Democrats saw a huge opportunity to win back the White House, and the field of candidates quickly swelled to 17. But the biggest names on the list were not very big. The most notable were Walter Mondale, who would become the party’s candidate eight years later, and Jerry Brown, then known as the youthful, enigmatic, and eccentric “Governor Moonbeam” of California. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana was thought to have a good shot at the nomination until he was revealed to be terminally dull. Other Senators --- Fred Harris of Oklahoma, Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson of Washington, and Frank Church of Idaho were in the mix, but none were able to break from the field. It’s worth noting that Ted Kennedy had star power the full Richter scale above any of these names, but that he was still rehabilitated his reputation following the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick in 1969. In short, the Democratic field was not terribly impressive. More important: these candidates were largely viewed to be “of Washington.” They were career politicians at a point in time when Americans were appalled and betrayed by corruption, criminality, deception, stupidity, arrogance, ignorance, and deceit at the pinnacle of their government. The Democrats may have thought that they stood wholly apart from Nixon, but in the minds of voters across America, the issue may have been bigger than Nixon… it may have been alienation from a perceived culture of corruption in Washington. Watergate and Vietnam had made Washington toxic on all sides. One of the more consequential factors shaping the Democratic race of 1976 was that many changes had been made to the campaign and primary rules following messy conventions in both 1968 and 1972. Those nomination processes has been conducted in the old-fashioned way with party bosses making deals in back rooms, and mediocre candidates had emerged. There was a call to open the process more directly to voters, and the importance of primary elections in the selection process was elevated. James Earl Carter, Jr., a one-term Governor of Georgia, was the one candidate who shrewdly realized the significance of the rule changes. He made an audacious bet, calculating that strong finishes in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary would generate broad media coverage and give him the air of a winner and the momentum that would accompany it. While many traditional candidates did not even bother make an effort in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, Carter won both. But the most brilliant tactic Carter employed was to market himself precisely on his lack of association with Washington and traditional politics. Carter was so unknown that the newspaper in the biggest city in the state where he has served as governor – the Atlanta Constitution -- ran this headline: “Jimmy Who is Running for What ?” Carter intuited that a candidate wholly insulated from the industrial grade waste Americans saw in Washington, D.C. was best positioned to win in 1976. He understood that the country was disgraced by Nixon, but also torn and wounded by Vietnam, and that what was needed was a powerful cleansing agent of change, pristine integrity, and the restoration of values and ethics in government. “I will never lie to you” was the central promise of his candidacy. Jimmy Carter was deeply religious, and made no secret of his faith and the manner in which it informed his world view. Carter parlayed his wins in the early primaries to quickly become the front-runner, and he kept the momentum all the way to the nominating convention. His Presidential campaign was notable for some rookie mistakes (giving a too-candid interview to Playboy magazine was far off-brand), but Gerald Ford proved to be an incompetent candidate, declaring that Communist bloc countries in Eastern Europe were “not under Soviet influence.” Jimmy Carter was elected the 39 th President of the United States in November, 1976. There sure are shades of 1976 in the spring air of 2019. The parallels between these two moments in history are striking. Yet another Republican administration is filthy with corruption, scandal, deceit, and arrogance. And yet the popular sentiment does not appear to perceive the other side as particularly virtuous. The anger aimed at Washington is equal opportunity loathing: citizens think that government does not work, and that the polarization and extremities of the parties has created nothing but gridlock. Still – as in 1976 – the unpopularity of the Republicans seems to exceed the unpopularity of Democrats, and so an identical number of candidates have lined up to take a swing at the Presidency at a moment when the Republican incumbent appears vulnerable. And – as in 1976 – the vast majority of the Democratic candidates are elected officials in the Federal government, aggressive partisans who are party to polarization and gridlock. They may well be perceived as a part of the problem and therefore ill-equipped to be the solution. As in 1976, none of the Democratic candidates stand head and shoulders above the others in the early going. None of these traditional candidates are generating a real buzz. Compared to prior Presidents, Donald Trump’s approval ratings may be in the toilet, but approval ratings of Congress are down in the septic tank. As low as Donald Trump’s approval ratings may be, attitudes toward Congress are lower still. Trump’s approval seems frozen in the low 40s… but the approval rating of Congress is in the mid-20s. Perhaps this partially explains why the Senators in the field are struggling to gain traction. Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, and Sanders are well-established Senators at this point. Experience in Washington may not be a good thing. Revisit the 2016 election through this lens: precisely because Hillary Clinton was viewed to have such a wealth of relevant experience for the Presidency, she was also perceived to be deeply embedded in the Washington establishment. She lost to perhaps the most unprepared and least qualified candidate in U.S. history. Even worse than the guilt by association with Washington, many of the major Democratic candidates have already seen their reputations pulled down by past behaviors. Presumed front-runner Joe Biden, himself a Washington insider since the 1980s, is fumbling as he tries to deal with me-too explosions in a party that is exceedingly sensitive on this point. Yes, the table seems set for a fresh, young, telegenic charismatic new face: Beto ! But a funny thing has happened on the way to Beto-mania. The RFK doeppleganger and monster fund raiser has been considerably eclipsed a totally different young white guy who has burst upon on the Democratic Presidential race with such a surprising impact that he is making Beto O’Rourke seem s 2018. In the last month, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has generating more buzz than O’Rourke, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar combined. 37 years old? Mayor of South Bend, Indiana? Pete who is running for what ? But we look at this guy, and all of a sudden we feel that we just may be back on a peanut farm in 1976. If Jimmy Carter was the ultimate outsider at a moment that Americans loathed insiders, then Pete Buttigieg may simply be a startling re-incarnation. Being the telegenic and media savvy 37-year-old gay mayor of a modest midwestern city alone is a package that seems a million miles from the crusty old farts club in Washington, D.C. If America craves an outsider, Pete Buttigieg is not just outside of geographic proximity of the nation’s capital, he is outside of the typical candidate resume, outside the age norm, and outside of sexual orientation norm. Pete Buttigieg is turning the Democratic party inside out. But Buttigieg has that martial arts gift of being able to grab your biggest criticism, use it to effortlessly flip you at the elbow, and recast it as his greatest strength. His razor thin resume? He will calmly point out that he has had more executive experience in government than that current President and Vice-President combined. He will point out that as commander-in-chief, he will bring more military experience to the job than any president since George H.W. Bush in 1988. And that’s just the start of his resume… which includes Phi Beta Kappa at Harvard, a Rhodes Scholarship, a stint at McKinsey, command of seven languages, and an appearance as a piano soloist with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra. What’s particularly fascinating is where Buttigieg fits – or chooses not to fit -- in the raging party controversy between the far left ideologues, who passionately favor an aggressively progressive policy agenda, and the practical centrists who feel victory is better pursued by softening extreme partisanship and polarization. There is an implicit electoral college strategy in each: progressives feel the path to victory lies in flipping states in the southeast by turning out the progressive vote, while centrists believe that the more certain victory lies in winning back the Trump-regretting centrists in the rust belt states that Hillary neglected. Buttigieg seems more in the centrist space. He made that clear in declaring that he is a “Democratic Capitalist,” pointedly refusing to play along with the Bernie Babies and AOC advocates who seem to have a litmus test for ideological commitment in publicly identifying with “Democratic Socialism.” Pete is clearly not signing on to that suicide pact. Moreover, his entire demeanor and tonality is not that of a firebrand. He appears earnest, thoughtful, and preternaturally reasonable . At a point in time when we don’t really need any more rage in our politics, Buttigieg stands out from a field of Democrats determined to prove they can out-Trump Trump. The entire effect is to make Buttigieg seem, well, more mature than everybody else in the race. Go figure. Interestingly, some of the big-name candidates who would seem best positioned to compete in the “centrist” space are failing to impress. Amy Klobuchar – the only candidate other than Mayor Pete who actually from the Midwest -- is nowhere in the polls and very slow to announce her first quarter fundraising totals… a bad sign. Joe Biden, whose candidacy would be premised on Rust Belt appeal, has not even formally announced yet, and has spent the last two weeks inelegantly fighting off a reputation as being just a little too “hands on.” Beto O’Rourke is raising a ton of money, but he is off to a wobbly start due to a lack of policy specifics. In short, the “centrist” lane currently appears less crowded than the “ideologue” lane, where Sanders, Warren, and Booker are already in a full throated battle. By getting out early and aggressively, Buttigieg is taking advantage of the relative quiet in the centrist lane, and he is being rewarded with coverage and sharp upticks in early polling. Yep… exactly what Jimmy Carter did. Most important of all, Pete Buttigieg is creating a stir. Joe Scarborough had his “I saw rock and roll future” moment when he sent this tweet: “Mika and I have been overwhelmed by the reaction @PeteButtigieg got after being on the show. The only other time in twelve years that we heard from as many people about a guest was after @BarackObama appeared on the show.” Yeah, it’s early. Long way to go. Lots of ups and downs and bumps in the road ahead. But it feels like we’ve seen a lot of those bumps before. A corrupt Republican administration. A broad field of underwhelming Democratic candidates. Wide revulsion across America at the scandal, polarization, gridlock, ineffectiveness of government. A need for a new broom to sweep clean. If you are a Democrat, a liberal, a progressive, or just a patriot who knows that the future of our democracy, the rule of law, our country, and perhaps our planet rests on finding the person who can defeat Donald Trump in 2020, you have a choice. You can either be terrified that the boyish mayor of South Bend, Indiana is generating more excitement than any of the far more traditional candidates. Or you find out a bit more about him. Perhaps start with a look back to 1976. If you would like to be on the Born To Run The Numbers email list notifying you of each new post, please write us at borntorunthenumbers@gmail.com. Posted by"

Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a note issued to investors on Friday, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Snap-on has underperformed the industry in the past six months. Moreover, the company has a soft sales trend in the past few quarters, mostly due to sluggishness in the Tools Group segment. The company reported negative sales surprise for the third straight quarter in fourth-quarter 2018. Lower sales at the International franchise business hurt revenues for Tools Group. This along with shortfalls in the OEM dealership arena weighed on organic sales. Further, adverse currency movements impacted top line. Volatility in raw-material prices and stiff competition are additional woes. However, the company delivered in-line earnings in the fourth quarter, after posting bottom line beat for more than seven years. The company is benefiting from robust business model and focus on value-creation processes. Further, broad-based strength in Commercial & Industrial Group division is also aiding performance.” Get Snap-on alerts:

Education Experts underscored need for providing quality education,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/education-experts-underscored-need-for-provid-588133.html,"Education Experts Underscored Need For Providing Quality Education Zeeshan Aziz (@imziishan) 6 minutes 04:30 PM
Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 07th April, 2019) Education Experts, parents and teachers have underscored the need for providing quality education saying the government will have to patronize educational institutions to increase literacy rate.These views were expressed by educational experts, parents and teachers during a debate here.
Renowned academician Dr Akbar Yezdani said private sector has played pivotal role in upgrading the standard of education and maintaining it but government has paid no heed towards it.The way the government encourages the farming community by providing them subsidy on different crops, the private educational institutions should have been encouraged on this pattern.
But the situation is otherwise because government educational institutions are in a miserable situation. A good number of schools lack boundary wall and bath rooms and in rural areas there are such schools operating to which accounts huge funds are going from government budget but they own neither a building nor the people of the respective areas taken any interest in education .On the other hand if the private educational institutions are charging high fees, they too are placing enormous focus on the students.
They are providing facilities. If they are forced to curtail their fees then it will impact negatively on the standard of education . One Zafran Ali said this impression has been given wrongly that the private educational institutions are amassing wealth with both hands and the fact is this that 25 percent schools are functioning in rented building and they are paying a huge amount on account of rent .
If fees are reduced then single branch schools will stand closed.He remarked private educational institutes pay tax and they incur heavy expenses on fool proof security arrangements. They provide air conditioned environment to provide quality education to the students.
The gas and electricity bills are becoming inflated due to day to day hike in the tariff. The expenses are also on rise owing to upswing in value of Dollars . The services of costly teachers are hired due to competition among the educational institutions in private sector so that could outpace their fellow institutes in performance.Ms Memoona Shahid said the private educational institutions have provided such a base to the students that they succeed in seeking admission in educational institutes of international level.
On the other hand the government educational institutes have shut their eyes to their responsibilities. The best teachers are instrumental in raising the best nation. Government should devise policies to improve education standard besides providing quality education to the citizens rather than curtailing the fee of private educational institutes.The salary is paid to the teachers against summer vacations in private educational institutes as well.
They also spend a robust amount on decoration and repairs of their buildings during summer vacations. If the fees are decreased under compulsion then the buildings will become neglectful in terms of renovation and repairs and the teachers will move to other institutes.
Therefore, under this expediency the fee is received from students against summer vacations. Ms Salma Asad said ""I think being a mother if government educational institutes arrange quality education then why will we pay high fee of private educational institutions.Ms Nabila said I accept that the private schools are focusing highly on improvement in education standard besides providing facilities by receiving high fees.
Bushra Bokhari said the expensive schools are not only in Pakistan but they are operating all over the world . People get admit their children to private educational institutes so that attention is paid to them on individual level."

WASHINGTON, Apr 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :An American spacecraft moved closer to Mars to act as a telecommunications relay for Mars landers and rovers after a two-month orbit tightening ended Friday.
The four-year-old spacecraft called Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) slowed down gradually by aerobraking, a process taking advantage of the Martian upper atmosphere to place a small amount of drag on the spacecraft, according to NASA.
""It's like applying the brakes on a car but instead of brake pads, we used Mars' atmosphere,"" said Stuart Demcak, the navigation team lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
The spacecraft lowest altitude of the orbit lowered from 151 km to about 132 km above the Martian surface. At this altitude, the atmosphere is dense enough to provide the small amount of drag on the spacecraft to slow it down.
Also, the highest point in orbit dropped from about 6,050 km to about 4,570 km, improving MAVEN's availability to support relay communications with NASA's landers and rovers on the surface of Mars. It allowed the MAVEN orbiter to circle Red Planet more frequently and thus communicate with the Mars rovers more frequently.
The data-relay satellite will be working with NASA's Mars 2020 rover to be launched next year.
While not conducting relay communications, MAVEN will continue to study the structure and composition of the upper atmosphere of Mars.
The MAVEN, launched in November of 2013, has completed its two-year mission in space, but its fuel allows it to last through 2030, according to NASA."

"Trump highlights his policies benefiting Israel, slamming Muslim lawmaker",www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/trump-highlights-his-policies-benefiting-isra-588122.html,"Trump Highlights His Policies Benefiting Israel, Slamming Muslim Lawmaker Fahad Shabbir (@FahadShabbir) 6 minutes 04:15 PM
NEW YORK, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :US President Donald Trump used a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition Saturday to highlight his policies benefiting Israel while targeting the opposition Democratic Party as one rooted in anti-Semitism.
Trump started his nearly hour-long speech in Las Vegas thanking lawmakers and public officials in the room, then joked, ""Special thanks to (Congresswoman Ilhan Omar) of Minnesota,"" a mention of the newly-elected Democrat, a Muslim , who sparked controversy for criticizing Israel 's treatment of Palestinians and Israeli lobbying efforts.
""Oh, I forgot. She doesn't like Israel ,"" Trump said sarcastically as the crowd booed. ""I forgot. I'm so sorry."" The president's joke about Ms Ilhan Omar came just one day after a New York man was arrested on Federal charges of threatening to kill her and accusing her of being a terrorist , according to media reports.
""Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she's an (expletive) terrorist . I'll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull,"" Patrick Carlineo, 55, is accused of saying to a member of Ms Omar's staff after calling her office last week.
Throughout Trump 's speech, he touched on his administration moving the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem , which was denounced by the international community as violation of the United Nations resolutions and international law, stopping illegal immigration, halting the Iran nuclear deal and his claim of working to restore peace in the middle East.
""I would like to see peace in the Middle East ,"" the president said. He added, ""If those three can't do it, you'll never have it done,"" referring to White House advisers Jared Kushner, who is also his son-in-law, Jason Greenblatt, a former Trump Organization employee and adviser on Israel , and David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel .
Trump also took credit for eliminating hundreds of millions of Dollars in aid to the Palestinians and for pulling the US out of several UN organizations, the UN Human Rights Council and UNESCO, citing what he called anti-Israel bias in their agendas.
He attacked Democrats , painting them as ""anti-Israel"" and pointing to the controversy surrounding Omar, whose comments spurred a resolution in the House denouncing hate and anti-Semitism.
"" Democrats have even allowed the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism to take root in their party and in their country. They have allowed that,"" the president said. ""Republicans believe that we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism."" He pinned Israel 's future to the 2020 elections, saying that ""the Democrats ' radical agenda would destroy our country, cripple our agenda and leave Israel all by itself."" The Jewish Democratic Council of America denounced Trump 's speech as lies and fantasy, saying policy between the United States and Israel should be bipartisan and not pivot parties against one another.
""Trump's claims of Republicans 'doing well' in the 2018 election and of American Jews leaving the Democratic Party are completely false. This is a fantasy of the Republican Party,"" said the organization's executive director Halie Soifer. ""What happened today in Las Vegas was a shameful display of lies and arrogance. We hope Trump 's continued assault on decency and truth will stay in Vegas."" The president spoke to the group in Vegas following a two-day swing through the west that included a visit to newly replaced border barriers in California and a pair of fundraisers.
Trump's remarks come just weeks after he and others in the White House opened a new line of attack against Democrats by claiming the party had become ""anti-Israel"" and ""anti-Jewish"" in the aftermath of Congresswoman Omar's comments.
Democrats increased their share of the Jewish vote between the 2016 and 2018 elections, from 71% to 79%. A new Gallup report, based on tracking poll data from 2018 , said that ""one in six U.S. Jews identify as Republican."" About half described themselves as Democrats .
After a fractious House debate last month over a resolution condemning hate, Trump raised the stakes while speaking with reporters as he left the White House on a weekend trip to Florida , describing the Democrats as an ""anti-Israel party.""""They've become an anti-Jewish party and that's too bad,"" he said while traveling to Alabama to review tornado damage.

Thousands of Sudanese press on with rally outside army HQ,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/thousands-of-sudanese-press-on-with-rally-out-588115.html,"Thousands Of Sudanese Press On With Rally Outside Army HQ Sumaira FH 5 minutes 04:10 PM
Khartoum, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Thousands of Sudanese protesters rallied outside the army 's headquarters in the capital Sunday for a second day calling on the military to back them in demands that President Omar al-Bashir resign as police fired tear gas to disperse them.
Chanting "" Sudan is rising, the army is rising,"" crowds of men and women massed outside the complex that also houses Bashir's official residence and the defence ministry, many of them having spent the night there, witnesses said.
""After what we did yesterday, we will not leave this area now until our mission is accomplished,"" said protester Osama Ahmed, who spent the night outside the compound.
""We won't leave this area until he steps down,"" he said, referring to Bashir.
Protesters whistled and waved at military vehicles entering the compound, prompting some soldiers to wave back, a day after demonstrators said they were gathering to ask the army to ""come join us"".
Riot police deployed near the complex Sunday morning, firing tear gas to disperse the crowds, a witness told AFP.
Protest organisers chose April 6 to begin the rally outside the army headquarters to mark the 1985 uprising that toppled the then regime of president Jaafar Nimeiri.
Ahead of the demonstration, organisers had urged the army to either ""take the side of the people or the dictator 's"".
Chanting the movement's catchcry ""freedom, peace, justice"", thousands of men and women marched through the streets of the capital Saturday, reaching the fortified army complex for the first time since anti-government protests first broke out.
The rally was the biggest yet since protests erupted on December 19 in the central town of Atbara , quickly spreading to the capital and towns and cities across the country.
Rally organisers on Sunday urged the demonstrators to continue with their sit-in outside the army complex.
""We call on our people from areas near Khartoum to join those who are at the army headquarters,"" the organisers said in a statement.
Since the start of the protests, security agents and riot police have cracked down on demonstrators but the army has not intervened.
- 'Losing Bet' - Witnesses said groups of women , men and children were walking towards the complex from several parts of the capital.
Some protesters blocked a nearby bridge linking Khartoum with the northern Bahari district with rocks causing huge traffic jams, onlookers said.
Outside the army complex, protesters sang nationalist songs, whistling and clapping as they pressed on with the rally.
Several private companies declared a holiday at their offices, while some arranged to ferry water , snacks and juice to the protesters, according to witnesses.
In a separate demonstration on Saturday a protester was killed in Khartoum 's twin city of Omdurman , police said.
Officials say 32 people have died since protests erupted in the east African country after a government decision to triple the price of bread.
Human Rights Watch has put the death toll to 51 including medics and children.
Rallies over bread prices quickly morphed into protests against Bashir's government , with demonstrators accusing it of mismanaging the economy, leading to soaring food prices and regular shortages of fuel and foreign Currency .
Bashir has acknowledged that the economic concerns raised by protesters are ""legitimate"", but he imposed emergency rule on February 22 after an initial crackdown failed to rein in the protests.
The scale and intensity of protests have shrunk since the emergency rule went into effect.
But with Saturday's rally analysts say the protest movement has gained new momentum.
""The scale of protests on Saturday illustrate that Bashir's gamble that he can save his regime through repression is proving to be a losing bet,"" said Murithi Mutiga of the International Crisis Group.
Bashir, wanted by the Hague-based International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and genocide in conflict-wracked region of Darfur, swept to power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.
The veteran leader has remained defiant, introducing tough measures that have seen protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists arrested. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Berlin, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The US military said Sunday it had temporarily pulled some of its forces out of Libya amid an upsurge of fighting in the North African country.
""Due to increased unrest in Libya , a contingent of US forces supporting US Africa Command temporarily relocated from the country in response to security conditions on the ground,"" it said in a statement.
It did not detail how many military personnel had been withdrawn from Libya .
Forces loyal to Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar were pressing on at the weekend with an offensive on the capital Tripoli , seat of the internationally-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).
US Africa Command, headquartered in Stuttgart , Germany , said its mission in Libya involved ""military support to diplomatic missions, counter-terrorism activities, enhancing partnerships and improving security across the region"".
It said it would ""continue to monitor conditions on the ground in Libya and assess the feasibility for renewed US military presence as appropriate"".
""The security realities on the ground in Libya are growing increasingly complex and unpredictable,"" said US Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser, commander of US Africa Command.
""Even with an adjustment of the force, we will continue to remain agile in support of existing US strategy."" Libya has struggled since the 2011 overthrow of dictator Moamer Kadhafi which left dozens of militia to fill the void and ally with either the GNA or the rival administration in the east backed by Haftar.
In the renewed fighting, forces backing the GNA have launched air strikes on Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) around 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Tripoli .
Tripoli residents fearing that large-scale fighting could break out have begun stocking up on food and petrol ."

Urgent structural reforms can revive Pakistan's economic growth: WB Report,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/urgent-structural-reforms-can-revive-pakistan-588108.html,"Urgent Structural Reforms Can Revive Pakistan's Economic Growth: WB Report Sumaira FH 5 minutes 04:05 PM
ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :The World Bank (WB) in its recent report has said that structural reforms can revive Pakistan 's economic growth, which is expected reach to 4 percent in Financial Year 2021.
""As macroeconomic conditions improve, and a package of structural reforms in fiscal management and competitiveness is implemented, growth is expected to recover to 4.0 percent in FY21,"" said latest edition of the 'South Asia Economic Focus, Exports Wanted,' The report on twice-a-year regional economic update, predicted that Pakistan 's economic growth will decelerate to 3.4 percent in FY19 and 2.7 percent in FY20, as fiscal and monetary policies are tightened to address macroeconomic imbalances.
It said, domestic demand is expected to contract while at the same time export growth will be gradual.
On the supply side, services growth, which has been leading growth in the past, is projected to decline to 4.4 percent in FY19 compared to 6.4 percent in FY18. The agriculture and industrial sectors will also grow significantly lower in FY19 and FY20.
Growth is expected to recover to 4% in FY21 as structural reforms take effect and macroeconomic conditions improve, the report added.
Remittances flows are likely to support the current account balance next year. A more stable external environment will also support a pickup in economic activity starting from FY21.
The trade deficit is projected to remain elevated during FY19, but to narrow in FY20 and FY21 as the impacts of Currency depreciation, domestic demand compression, and other regulatory measures to curb imports set in.
""Pakistan's growth must be driven by investment and productivity, which will put an end to the boom and bust cycles that affect the country every few years,"" said Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan .
""It is entirely possible for Pakistan to transform its regulatory environment and reduce the cost of doing business . On the revenue front, reforms to improve tax administration and widen the tax base are critical. Over the adjustment period and beyond, actions outlined in the recently announced Ehsaas Program can protect the poor and vulnerable through social safety nets and safeguarding public spending on health and education ,"" Patchamuthu added.
Overall, across South Asia , imports grew much stronger than exports in the last two years, reversing the region's exports dynamics of the early 2000s.
Strong domestic demand, fueled by a consumption and investment boom, resulted in high import growth of 14.9 percent in 2017 and 15.6 percent in 2018 , which is nearly twice as high as the region's export growth. In comparison, exports grew by only 4.6 percent in 2017 and 9.7 percent in 2018 .
According to the report, South Asia holds on to its top spot as the world 's fastest growing region, with growth set to step up to 7.0 percent in 2019 , then 7.1 percent in 2020 and 2021, but the region needs to increase its exports to sustain its high growth and reach its full economic potential, report added."

The first round of Ukraine 's presidential election was held on March 31 and did not reveal a winner, since none of the candidates secured an absolute majority of votes. Zelenskiy finished first with over 30 percent of the vote , while incumbent Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko came in second with almost 16 percent. The two candidates are now set to face each other in a runoff round on April 21.
""The punishment for corruption must be more significant than all possible profits from it! We stress that there is no need to reinvent the wheel in this domain. It has been known what needs to be done for a long time. There has simply been no political will,"" the candidate's campaign team said on Telegram.
According to the anti-corruption plan, Zelenskiy suggests that politicians must no longer enjoy immunity; that economic crimes must be decriminalized; that officials who make unfounded claims to businesses must be punished; and that most of public services extended to companies should be provided online.
""[The Ukrainian government shall] increase the severity of punishment for public servants [for corruption] by [obliging them to] sign a consent to the voluntary resignation and, due to the introduction of an additional punishment in the form of confiscation of all property and a life ban on holding posts in the [federal] or local governments, introduce a ban on ... [releasing suspects] on bail,"" the program says.
The program specifies that anti-corruption bodies should be formed with the help of independent international commissions.
Zelenskiy's team also wants to boost public participation in the fight against corruption by financially rewarding them for their help in revealing such crimes.
Moreover, Zelenskiy suggested that Ukrainian security forces should no longer investigate economic and financial crimes and an international supreme economic court should be created.
The candidate also believes that Kiev should turn to law enforcement agencies in Western countries with a request to launch investigations against those Ukrainian corrupt officials who have been identified by Ukrainian anti-corruption bodies."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 07th April, 2019) Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei held a meeting on Saturday with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi and urged Baghdad to take action so that the United States would withdraw its forces from the neighboring country.
""U.S. military presence in Iraq is detrimental to countries and nations of the region. You should take actions to make the U.S. withdraw its troops from Iraq because wherever they have had enduring presence, forcing them out has become problematic,"" Khamenei said at the meeting, as quoted by his press service on Twitter .
Abdul-Mahdi arrived in Tehran on Saturday for a two-day visit at the invitation of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.
On February 3, US President Donald Trump told CBS news in an interview that the United States was keeping its troops in Iraq in order to be able to ""watch Iran ."" Following the statement, Iraqi Parliament First Deputy Speaker Hassan Kaabi said that the legislature intended to work out a bill on the termination of the security agreement with the United States , which will lead to withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country.

PESHAWAR, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Known for its architectural wonder, heritage value and glorious history world over, Balahisar fort has become main centre of attraction for general public and tourists to see rare view of its various primitive places and architectural designs of this great national monument.
Spreading over an area of 15.4 acres and built of red bricks with 92 feet height, Balahisar fort has been opened for tourists and general public for two days in a week since December 29, 2018 in line with the directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan .
Visitors who travel through historic Grand Trunk (GT) road in Peshawar city can't remain unimpressed while passing under its shadows of huge battlements, frowning structure and glorious primitive past.
Impressed with its architectural beauty and glorious primitive history, Founder of the Nation, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah , King Raza Shah Pehlawi of Iran , Mohtarama Fatima Jinnah , Mrs John F Kennedy and Lady Diana were among the few dignitaries who visited the fort on different occasions.
Situated opposite Jinnah Park (old Cunningham Park), the fort reminds the visitors of numerous actions of the past rulers, conquerors and kings of various dynasties.
There are different opinions about the origin of the fort but mostly Mughals were believed to be the architects of the present fort.
""Balahisar seems to be as old as the Peshawar City itself,"" Muhammad Asif Raza, In-charge Peshawar Museum told APP.
""The archaeological excavations recently conducted at Gor-Kathri Peshawar revealed that the city of Peshawar is more than 2500 years old and on the basis of numismatic evidence Peshawar could be termed as one of the oldest living cities in South Asia ,"" he said.
The main entrance of Balahisar directly faces the GT road that links Peshawar with Afghanistan and Central Asia on the west and extends towards Pushkalavati ( Charsadda ), Hund and Taxila on the east.
Renowned historian, Dr A.H. Dani in his book ""Peshawar-Historic City of Frontier"" wrote that when Hiuen Tsang, a Chinese traveller, visited Peshawar in 630 AD, he spoke of a ""royal residence"".
He said Chinese word ""Kung Shing"" used for its significance and is explained as fortified or walled portion of the town in which the royal palace stood. Hiuen Tsang then makes a separate mention of the city, which was not fortified. This shows that the royal residence formed the nucleus of a Citadel, which must have been further protected by a moat.
Peshawar had always been a strategic city due to its geological location and its capturing and ruling over t was of great importance for invaders, monarchs and kings in the past.
In 11th century AD, the Hindu ruler, Raja Jaipal of the Hindushahi dynasty was defeated in the vicinity of Peshawar and Mehmud Ghaznavi garrisoned the fort with his army .
It was later redesigned and built by Mughal emperor Zaheeruddin Babar in 1526 and was later used by Hari Singh Nalwa as royal residence for Maharaja Ranjeet Singh during the Sikh rule during 1818-1848.
Afghans' Durrani rulers used it as their winter camp residence in the early 19th century . The Afghan rulers named it ""Balahisar"" a persian name, meaning high fort while the Sikhs renamed it as Samargarh in 1834 but the name remained unpopular.
Balahisar was destructed and reconstructed several times by conquerors, worriers, invaders and kings.
According to renowned historian Abul Fazl, the Afghans had destroyed the fort after their King Shershah Suri overthrow emperor Humayun.
Hamyun rebuilt it before proceeding to Kabul and wanted to use it for his conquest of India at later stage. As his officers did not want to stay back, Hamayun himself supervised the rebuilding process.
Nizamuddin Ahmed in Tabaqat-e- Akbari records that in 1585 AD a fire broke out in Balahisar as a result of which merchandise loaded on 1000 camels was destroyed.
It also saw the vigour of Nadir Shah when he entered India via historic Khyber Pass and after treaty with Mughals, Nadir Shah was appointed as Governor of Peshawar and his residence court used to be in Balahisar.
The fort also remained the residence of Afghan king, Ahmed Shah Durrani and his son Taimur Shah Durrani. After the death of Taimur in 1793 AD, the Durrani Rule was weakened and the Sikhs rose to power in Punjab .
The Sikhs captured Peshawar and the fort in 1834 following the battle of Nowshera . Firstly, the Sikhs destroyed the fort but later regretted and Hari Singh Nalwa ordered to rebuild it. However Sher Singh, on the orders of his father Ranjeet Singh, had erected the fort with unbaked bricks.
On the entrance of the main courtyard of the Balahisar fort, a Sikh period inscription on marble slab can be seen on an arch gate. This is the only inscription available today in Balahisar, which reads, ""Victory to Porak. This was built by Raja Bikramajit and was named Samir or Samar Garh."" In 1902, British rulers had reconstructed Balahisar after annexation of Sikh Shahi areas in 1849. At that time the fort had mud walls and was not sustainable. The British replaced the structure with red bricks and the present shape was given to this historical monument of Pakistan .
The British kept its troops in Balahisar till the cantonment was laid out. When the Afridi tribesmen launched a massive attack on Peshawar city in 1930, the fire of British artillery dispersed them from Balahisar. Balahisar has the honour of hoisting national flag on the morning of August 14, 1947 and the headquarters of Frontier Corps (FC) was later shifted to it in 1948 till to date .
According to FC officials, Balahisar fort will remain open for general public including tourists, students and families on every Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 4pm.
""I came with my family to visit this historic fort, which was always a source of inspiration for me,"" said student Ehtisham Khan from Nowshera district while talking to APP.
He expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Imran Khan for taking a bold decision of opening the fort for general public and tourists. ""The PM has made my dream a reality,"" he said.
Like Ehitisham Khan, hundreds of thousands of people and tourists along with their families are coming to the fort to spend some times in a secure environment.
They are also taking keen interest in ancient weapons, dresses, antiques, agriculture tools, utensils , foot wears and musical instruments of different Pakhtoons tribes such as Afridi , Shinwari, Kohistani and Chitrali display at the fort's museum. The aerial view of Peshawar city's from rooftop of Balahisar is worth watching. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

.:Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said when India violated Line of Control (LoC) and Pakistani air space, the international community remained silent.
He said the international community should not be silent spectator but should play role for maintaining peace in the region.
In order to gain political milage, Modi was putting regional peace at stake, Qureshi remarked.
Moreover, Indian atrocities on innocent Kashmiris in Indian Occupied Kashmir have also increased.
Qureshi reiterated that Pakistan had always supported peaceful struggle of the people of Indian held Kashmiris and it would continue to extend moral and diplomatic support.
The Foreign Minister observed that India made three claims related to surgical strike including targeting of three terrorists camps, killing 350 terrorists, and shooting down F-16 plane of Pakistan and all proved baseless as international community including America has also rejected it.
Qureshi, however, hinted at the new planning of Indian attack , terming it could be dangerous for the region.
India resorted to continuous firing at civilian population near LoC following incident of Pulwama.
He said, Pakistan had released Indian pilot as a good will gesture for peace of the region as it wanted to de-escalate the situation.
Despite the Indian aggression, he said, Pakistan sent its delegation for dialogue to frame terms and conditions for opening of Kartarpur corridor .
The second phase of dialogue was scheduled for April 2 at Wahga border but India denied these talks, he observed.
Despite all these steps, Pakistan once again, decided to release 360 Indian prisoners as a peace gesture, Qureshi said and added that Pakistan wanted that the international community should acknowledge that who was endeavouring for peace and who was putting it in jeopardy.
""Again let the world see Pakistan 's true, and obstinate behaviour of India and let it decide who wants peace and who has political designs,"" stated foreign minister.
He added Pakistan always wished for peace and it would continue the same spirit in future. Talks were only way forward to settle issues including Kashmir, water , Sir Creek , corridors, economic cooperation and some others, between the two nuclear states.
Responding to a query, the foreign minister categorically stated that Pakistan reserved the right to safeguard its frontiers.
The morale of Pakistan armed forces and masses were very high and they were united against any sort of aggression.
Responding to another question, Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi said the government and opposition were on the same page on national security.
He, however, added that opposition had right for political protests. The government had never denied for talks with opposition parties, he added. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Tehran, April 7 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called on Iraq to demand US troops leave ""as soon as possible"", warning that Washington is plotting to remove the Iraqi government .
The remarks came during a visit to Tehran on Saturday by Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, whose country is under pressure from the United States to distance itself from Iran .
""You should take actions to make sure the Americans withdraw their troops from Iraq as soon as possible because wherever they have had an enduring presence, forcing them out has become problematic,"" Khamenei told Abdel Mahdi.
""The current government and parliament in Iraq and the political figures are not what the US desires; they plot to remove them from the political scene of Iraq ,"" he said, according to his official website.
Abdel Mahdi, on his first official trip to Iran , also met Saturday with President Hassan Rouhani, who visited Iraq last month.
Baghdad is under pressure from Washington to limit ties with its neighbour, particularly after the United States withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year and hit Tehran with sanctions.
Iran has close but complicated ties with Iraq , with significant influence among its Shiite political groups.
The two countries fought a bloody war from 1980 to 1988 and Tehran 's influence in Baghdad grew after the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq toppled the government of Saddam Hussein.
Iran was the first country to respond to Iraqi calls for help after Islamic State group jihadists captured Mosul in 2014 and threatened to overrun Baghdad and Kirkuk .
Tehran dispatched ""military advisors"" and equipment overnight along with the Revolutionary Guards elite Qods Force commander Qasem Soleimani to prevent IS jihadists from approaching its western borders."

According to the minister, the country is not facing any shortfall and electricity production is beyond demand.
The minister for energy said that loadshedding is being held in areas having power theft while PEPCO says loadshedding is being conducted because of the sudden increase in electricity shortfall.
According to PEPCO , there has been a 6000 MW fall in electricity production because of the delay in RLCG import . Because of this, only 13,500 MW electricity could be produced against the demand of 18,000 MW.
PEPCO sources said that Jamshoro and Muzaffargarh power plants are also not operational, causing a fall in electricity production but according to Omar Ayub, electricity production is sufficient."

DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 07th Apr, 2019) H.H. Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, has expressed his happiness at Dubai ’s number one ranking globally among the ‘Top fDi Performers 2018 ’ and termed the achievement ""a precursor to Dubai ’s future achievements.""
Dubai’s top FDI ranking follows the city being featured among the best performers in reports like the Global Cities of the Future; Digital Economies of the Future; Aerospace Locations of the Future; and top global free zones of the year. The ‘Top fDi Performers 2018 ,’ published by the Financial Times’ fDi Intelligence magazine is based on data compiled by fDi Markets , the world ’s leading online platform that monitors capital flows and new FDI projects around the world , and fDi Benchmark, which identifies the best FDI destinations based on comparison of latest FDI data.
The report highlighted that Dubai has dominated global FDI rankings throughout 2018 , followed by London , Paris , Dublin and Singapore , as the leading city globally in foreign direct investment, FDI, in 2018 .
Sheikh Hamdan emphasised that the latest achievements revealed in the annual ‘DUBAI FDI Results & Rankings Report 2018 ’ of the Dubai Investment Development Agency, Dubai FDI, an agency of the Department of Economic Development, DED, in Dubai , reflect global investors’ continued confidence in Dubai ’s ability to sustain economic growth, and further boosts its global leadership. The first rank is a precursor to Dubai ’s future achievements, he added.
Sheikh Hamdan said, ""We are proud to announce the latest results of FDI capital inflows in 2018 , which has reached AED38.5 billion , a growth of 41 percent over 2017 , taking Dubai to the sixth place from 10th in global capital flows into greenfield projects. Dubai has also attracted 523 FDI projects in 2018 , an increase of 43 percent over 2017 , elevating the emirate’s global ranking in the number of new investment projects to third from fourth.""
He stated that Dubai ’s continued achievements in FDI are the result of the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai , who laid the foundations for a world-class investment ecosystem in Dubai . FDI plays a central role in the transfer of knowledge and technology as well as in attracting global talent, which are the pillars supporting the emirate in achieving its goals set in the Dubai Plan 2021 and the 50-Year Charter aimed at strengthening Dubai ’s position as a pivotal hub in the global economy, said Sheikh Hamdan.
His Highness expressed his appreciation for the concerted efforts that have made the latest achievement possible, particularly the cooperation among government entities, free zones and the business community in Dubai in developing opportunities and new investment projects in various economic sectors, thereby enhancing Dubai ’s position as a preferred FDI destination. His Highness also commended the initiatives of Dubai FDI which helped improve the emirate’s investment ecosystem, highlighting the role of ‘Dubai FDI Monitor,’ the FDI open data platform which provides the latest information and data round the clock. "" Dubai FDI Monitor is a testament to Dubai ’s commitment to enhance competitiveness and transparency of the emirate’s investment ecosystem, using innovative technologies and services to serve the global investor community,"" His Highness said.
Sami Al Qamzi, Director-General of DED, hailed Dubai ’s success in achieving record levels of FDI inflows despite global FDI flows declining by 19 percent in 2018 as reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, UNCTAD. He said the achievement reflects the resilience, diversity and competitiveness of Dubai ’s economy on a global scale.
He underscored that following the directives of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid and Sheikh Hamdan, the emirate has continuously developed its investment ecosystem, offering new strategic advantages for investors and the business community, including developing the emirate's infrastructure and regulatory environment as well as launching a range of incentives to accelerate economic growth. These efforts have contributed to enhancing business competitiveness and investor confidence as key drivers of sustainable economic development in the emirate.
Al Qamzi noted that fDi Benchmark, which identifies the best FDI destinations in the world by comparing FDI data, has clearly identified Dubai ’s leading position and strong presence in all areas of investments in 2018 . Dubai has been ranked first globally among the top 20 cities for renewable energy investments between 2013-2018 and second globally in the ‘Global Cities of the Future 2018 – 2019 ’ report in terms of economic potential. Dubai also ranked first among the top FDI cities in the ‘City FDI Performance Index,’ issued for the first time in 2018 , which further confirms the success of the Dubai Government ’s plans and strategic initiatives in creating investment opportunities in the emirate.
He said that the Eight Principles of Dubai , which places economic diversification on the top of its strategic priorities to create new economic sectors, and the 50-Year Charter launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, further strengthen the sustainability and growth of FDI in the emirate, taking the city to further global prominence.
Al Qamzi said that the ‘DUBAI FDI Results & Rankings Report 2018 ’ has added a new index which monitors the contribution of FDI to job creation. As per the index, about 25,000 new jobs were created in 2018 , an increase of 77 percent compared to 14,065 jobs in 2017 , effectively placing Dubai in ninth position globally in job creation through FDI. Recent policies which support the role of investors, innovators, skilled professionals and students in building an innovation and knowledge-based economy for Dubai and the UAE further adds to Dubai ’s attractiveness for the world 's most promising talent.
Al Qamzi cited medium and high-tech FDI projects being a major tool in job creation, accounting for 28 percent of the jobs added in 2018 . Medium and high-tech FDI projects comprise 43 percent of the total FDI projects in 2018 and accounted for 15.6 percent of total capital inflows. The ‘Dubai FDI Monitor’ classifies medium and high-tech FDI projects based on the definition of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.
Fahad Al Gergawi, CEO of Dubai Investment Development Agency, Dubai FDI, reiterated that the record results achieved by Dubai in 2018 and its leading position among the top FDI destinations globally reflect the vision of the leadership of Dubai and translates the emirate's strategic initiatives into milestones as reflected in the ‘DUBAI FDI Results & Rankings Report 2018 .’ He added that it clearly indicates the readiness of Dubai ’s investment ecosystem which offers unique investment opportunities and supports the growth and expansion plans of global conglomerates and start-ups. ""The results and rankings speak volumes of Dubai ’s transformation into a smart and sustainable city and a global hub for talent, innovation and entrepreneurship,"" he added.
Al Gergawi further noted that Dubai has continued to advance to become the third most attractive location in the world for greenfield FDI projects and also promote the growth of FDI projects classified as New Forms of Investment, NFI. NFI accounted for 28.9 percent of total investments in 2018 , compared to 20.7 percent in 2017 . He said that the data analysis provided by ‘Dubai FDI Monitor’ reveals the trends that are shaping future growth, while clearly indicating Dubai 's success in attracting a large number of small and medium-sized investments with high levels of technology and innovation capacity.
He explained the importance of the growth of NFI, which signifies investors' interest in building strategic partnerships with local companies as well as the great diversity of investment opportunities in Dubai with unique market entry opportunities through multiple partnership models. ""NFIs will enhance the emergence of mature domestic companies, development of emerging companies and new business models capable of boosting the transfer of knowledge and technology , attracting new talent and contributing to the transformation of Dubai into a knowledge-based economy,"" he added.
Al Gergawi said the ‘DUBAI FDI Results & Rankings Report 2018 ,’ showed that the number of FDI projects rose to 523 in 2018 , a 43 percent increase compared to 367 projects in 2017 . The report revealed that 63 percent were new projects and 28.9 percent were NFI, 5 percent were re-investment projects, two per cent were joint projects and one per cent mergers and acquisitions. Strategic investment projects comprised 94 percent of total FDI inflows to Dubai in 2018 , with 55 percent of the projects introduced in 2018 .

The ‘DUBAI FDI Results & Rankings Report 2018 ’ detailed the most important data and achievements of the emirate based on globally recognised data and rankings sources such as the fDi Markets , fDi Benchmark, as well as the data analysis provided by ‘Dubai FDI Monitor,’ which tracks greenfield projects, new forms of investment projects, reinvestment projects, merger and acquisition projects, joint venture projects and NFI.

South Asia needs more exports to maintain growth: WB Report,www.urdupoint.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/south-asia-needs-more-exports-to-maintain-gro-588055.html,"South Asia Needs More Exports To Maintain Growth: WB Report Muhammad Irfan 8 hours 02:55 PM
ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Apr, 2019 ) :South Asia holds on to its top spot as the world 's fastest growing region, with growth set to step up to 7.0 percent in 2019 , then 7.1 percent in 2020 and 2021, but the region needs to increase its exports to sustain its high growth and reach its full economic potential, says the World Bank in its twice-a-year regional economic update.
The latest edition of the 'South Asia Economic Focus, Exports Wanted,' finds that the region's growth, while still robust, is mainly driven by domestic demand, which in turn swelled imports and far outstripped exports , further widening trade gaps and current account deficits, and triggering Currency depreciation in some countries.
""South Asia 's exports performance has dropped in the last few years to languish at far below its potential and while growth still looks robust we are concerned about whether this can hold up over the longer term,"" said Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Vice President for the South Asia Region.
""To ensure growth in the long run, the region needs to integrate further into international markets to sustain its upward growth trajectory, create more jobs , and boost prosperity for its people"" Schafer added.
Across South Asia , imports grew much stronger than exports in the last two years, reversing the region's exports dynamics of the early 2000s.
According to the report, strong domestic demand, fueled by a consumption and investment boom, resulted in high import growth of 14. 9 percent in 2017 and 15.6 percent in 2018 , which is nearly twice as high as the region's export growth.
In comparison, exports grew by only 4.6 percent in 2017 and 9.7 percent in 2018 .
""There's no single solution that can unleash South Asia 's export potential and policymakers need to implement an ambitious range of reforms that can turn the region into the world 's next export powerhouse,"" said Hans Timmer, World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia Region.
""Efforts should include trade liberalization, spurring entrepreneurship, and equipping citizens with the skills they need to compete on the global market . It would be good to be creative and relentless in all these efforts,"" Timmer added.
The report offers a positive outlook based on recent months as export growth is picking up from its low levels, even outpacing imports growth in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 .
This recent acceleration of export growth, combined with a slowdown in import growth, is expected to continue in 2019 and beyond, with both rates eventually converging at an average 11 percent growth rate.
But despite this recent progress , South Asian countries still export only one-third of their potential, and the gap is widening.
The report estimates that the region's export gap widened over time, standing at over 20 percent of GDP in 2017 , as South Asia did not fully take advantage of a favorable international global trade environment and remained on the margins of global value chains."
