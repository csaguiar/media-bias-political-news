'America deserves better': Former GOP governor to take on Trump | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/america-deserves-better-former-gop-governor-take-trump,"By Steve Benen Two months after launching a presidential exploratory committee, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld made a rather audacious announcement yesterday: he kicked off a Republican primary challenge against the sitting president of his own party, Donald Trump.
“America deserves better,” Weld’s campaign announcement video said, before showing video clips of Trump mocking John McCain, imitating a disabled reporter, praising Wikileaks and the notorious “Access Hollywood” tape where he was caught on audio making inappropriate comments about women.
“It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag. It is time to return to the principles of Lincoln – equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. There is no greater cause on earth than to preserve what truly makes America great. I am ready to lead that fight,” Weld said in a statement.
By any fair measure, the former governor has traveled a non-traditional political path. In the 1990s, Weld was a popular two-term Republican governor of one of the nation’s bluest states, before being tapped by a Democratic president to serve as an ambassador. Weld’s nomination was blocked, and ultimately killed, by a senator from his own party – North Carolina’s Jesse Helms – who concluded he wasn’t far enough to the right.
More recently, Weld abandoned the GOP altogether and ran in 2016 as the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee. After Donald Trump’s election, the former governor rejoined the Republican Party, and yesterday, the 73-year-old candidate decided to launch a quixotic challenge against a sitting president who enjoys strong support from his party’s far-right base.
“I’m here because I think our country is in grave peril,” Weld said in February after launching an exploratory committee. “I cannot sit quietly on the sidelines any longer.”
One need not be a political expert to know Trump will be the overwhelming favorite in the race for the GOP nomination – to the extent that there will even be an actual “race” – but I’m nevertheless interested in the possibility of a sitting president having to deal with an intra-party rival.
Because the historical pattern paints an interesting picture.
In the modern presidential primary era – beginning with the 1972 election cycle – there have been eight presidents: Ford, Carter, Reagan, H.W. Bush, Clinton, W. Bush, Obama, and Trump. Of those eight, three lost after a single term in the White House: Ford, Carter, and H.W. Bush.
And while every cycle has its own unique quirks and qualities, Ford, Carter, and H.W. Bush each have one important thing in common: they each faced a credible primary challenge as part of their re-election campaigns, before going on to lose in the general election. Every incumbent president who didn’t face an intra-party rival went on to win a second term.
All of this comes with plenty of caveats. We are, after all, talking about a fairly modest sample size. For that matter, there’s a correlation/causation question that’s far from clear.
That said, we’ve known for months that Donald Trump’s political operation has worried about a primary challenge, and now it has one.

Trump's lawyers scramble to keep his tax returns hidden from view | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-lawyers-scramble-keep-his-tax-returns-hidden-view,"The Rachel Maddow Show, 4/15/19, 9:06 PM ET Trump hires new legal team to fight release of tax returns Rachel Maddow reports that even as Donald Trump has hired new lawyers to fight to keep Trump’s tax returns away from public view, subpoenas to financial institutions from Congress, looking into Donald Trump’s finances are multiplying faster than Trump’s share tweet email save Embed Last week, Donald Trump hired a new group of lawyers to do one very specific thing: keep the president’s tax returns secret. Yesterday, those attorneys sent a letter to the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, urging administration officials to look past the letter of the law .
President Trump’s personal lawyer on Monday urged the Treasury Department not to hand over Mr. Trump’s tax returns to House Democrats, warning that releasing the documents to lawmakers he accused of having a “radical view of unchecked congressional power” would turn the Internal Revenue Service into a political weapon. […]
Mr. Trump’s lawyer, William S. Consovoy, said on Monday that the legal rationale behind [House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal’s] dismissal of the Treasury Department’s concerns was wrong.
As regular readers know , Richard Neal, exercising his authority under the law, formally told the Treasury Department two weeks ago that he’s demanding access to the president’s tax returns. The Massachusetts Democrat did so under a law that says the Treasury “shall furnish” the tax materials in response to a formal request from one of a handful of congressional lawmakers, including himself.
Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a written statement last week, “How many lawyers and how much time does it take for [Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin] to understand that ‘shall’ means ‘shall’?”
And yet, yesterday, Trump’s new private attorney told the Treasury that those pointing to the letter of the law are not making “a serious legal argument.”
The correspondence added that “no one actually believes” Richard Neal is interested in legitimate congressional oversight. To bolster the point, the president’s lawyer pointed to … wait for it … quotes from congressional Republicans.
What’s more, in case the keep-the-tax-returns-secret legal team wasn’t busy enough yesterday, Politico noted that the attorneys sent a separate letter to Trump’s accounting firm.
President Donald Trump’s attorneys are warning of potential legal action if an accounting firm turns over a decade of the president’s financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee.
Trump attorneys William S. Consovoy and Stefan Passantino are urging Mazars USA not to comply with a subpoena that Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) issued on Monday for Trump’s financial documents, calling it a politically motivated scheme to take down the president.
It’s not every day we see a president’s legal team urge private entities not to comply with federal subpoenas. (The correspondence from Consovoy and Passantino was, by the way, very much on brand: it used the Republicans’ deliberately wrong grammar, complaining about “the Democrat Party.”)
I won’t pretend to know how this will play out in the coming weeks and months, but it’s nevertheless worth pausing to appreciate the desperation with which the president and his team are fighting to make sure Trump’s tax returns are hidden from view. Explore: "

Barr's credibility faces new questions ahead of Mueller report's release | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/barrs-credibility-faces-new-questions-ahead-mueller-reports-release,"U.S. Attorney General nominee William Barr testifies at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee January 15, 2019 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Barr’s credibility faces new questions ahead of Mueller report’s release 04/16/19 10:15 AM By Steve Benen It’s been 25 days since Special Counsel Robert Mueller delivered his findings to Attorney General Bill Barr, and pretty much all we know about that final report comes from Donald Trump’s handpicked AG. Barr’s characterization of the document – he included some fragments, but no complete sentences from Mueller’s report – have served as the basis for Republican celebrations, a White House victory lap, and taunts from skeptics of the Russia scandal.
With a redacted version of the report scheduled to be released in about 48 hours, we’ll get a better sense of whether those pro-Trump cheers had merit, but in the meantime, there’s a question that lingers over the debate: why exactly are so many so quick to take Barr’s assessment at face value?
The president’s allied attorney general has faced a series of legitimate questions about his credibility, stemming from years of controversies , his unsolicited memo criticizing the Mueller investigation, and more recently, his willingness to endorse a Trump conspiracy theory .
Yesterday, a new area of concern came to light. NYU law professor Ryan Goodman wrote at Just Security:
On Friday the thirteenth October 1989, by happenstance the same day as the “Black Friday” market crash, news leaked of a legal memo authored by William Barr. He was then serving as head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). It is highly uncommon for any OLC memo to make headlines. This one did because it was issued in “unusual secrecy” and concluded that the FBI could forcibly abduct people in other countries without the consent of the foreign state. The headline also noted the implication of the legal opinion at that moment in time. It appeared to pave the way for abducting Panama’s leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega.
Members of Congress asked to see the full legal opinion. Barr refused, but said he would provide an account that “summarizes the principal conclusions.” Sound familiar?
Goodman’s piece is worth reading in its entirety, but to briefly summarize, Barr wrote a summary of an important document for lawmakers, and a few years later, it became obvious that his account omitted key conclusions from the original document.
In effect, Barr took a major legal report, used his discretion to remove relevant portions, and told lawmakers what he wanted them to know.
Three decades later, Barr has the Mueller report, which he’s already been accused of mischaracterizing for political reasons, and we’re waiting for his office to complete a redaction process before sharing the findings with the public.
Maybe the history is irrelevant. Maybe the attorney general will handle this in a perfectly responsible manner, the redactions will be minor and defensible, and the questions about his independence and credibility will be answered in a satisfying way.
But given the circumstances, it’s difficult to blame skeptics for having doubts.

* Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) yesterday unveiled a new public-land-use plan that includes, among other things, an executive order that would impose “a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases, including for drilling offshore and on public lands.”
* Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), meanwhile, unveiled elements of his tax plan yesterday, including an expansion of existing Earned Income Tax Credit.
* A new national poll from Emerson found Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) leading the Democratic presidential field with 29%, followed by former Vice President Joe Biden (D-Del.) at 24%. A month ago, Emerson found the two men tied at 26%. No other candidate reached double digits, though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) came close.
* Speaking of Sanders, the Vermont senator released a decade’s worth of tax returns yesterday. Around the same time, Beto O’Rourke did the same thing .
* With the North Carolina Republican Party facing turmoil and scandal, Dallas Woodhouse is stepping down in June as the state GOP chair.
* There’s a very interesting new Mason-Dixon poll out of Alabama, where Sen. Doug Jones (D) has a 45% approval rating, though 50% of voters are prepared to replace him during his re-election bid next year. That said, the top choice among Alabama Republicans for that Senate race is none other than former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore (R).
* The Democratic presidential candidates’ fundraising totals from the first quarter continue to come in, with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) reporting a $2.25 million haul, while former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D) raised $1.1 million over the first three months.
* And in South Carolina, Kamala Harris has picked up an endorsement from one of the state’s leading Democrats: former state Rep. Bakari Sellers, the former vice chair of the state party, is backing the Californian and will campaign with her this weekend.

Senate Republican on ACA: 'You got to look at it as positive' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/senate-republican-aca-you-got-look-it-positive,"By Steve Benen As far as Donald Trump is concerned, Senate Republicans should take the lead on crafting the GOP’s alternative to the Affordable Care Act. Evidently, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee isn’t eager to help in the endeavor.
Even Republicans who furiously fought the creation of the law and won elections with the mantra of repeal and replace speak favorably of President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.
“Quite obviously, more people have health insurance than would otherwise have it, so you got to look at it as positive,” Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a recent interview.
At a certain level, comments like these may seem so anodyne, they’re hardly notable. Any responsible assessment of the Affordable Care Act and its effects would conclude that it obviously deserves to be seen in a positive light.
But in Republican politics over the last decade, rhetoric like Grassley’s has been verboten. The only acceptable labels for “Obamacare” in GOP circles are words like “failure,” “disaster,” and attacks not suitable for publication on family websites like this one. To concede that the Affordable Care Act has helped millions, and has had a positive impact on the country, is to betray the Republican Party’s goals and principles.
Indeed, Iowa’s senior senator is an observer of particular relevance. Those who followed the debate over health-care reform closely may recall that by the fall of 2009, “ no Republican received more TLC from Barack Obama ” than Chuck Grassley. The Democratic president and his team reached out to him constantly, hoping that he was the kind of senator who would work in good faith towards bipartisan solutions.
He was not. While Grassley claimed to be serious about bipartisan solutions on health care reform, he was also, at the same time, making fundraising appeals urging donors to send him cash to help him “defeat Obama-care.” Grassley proceeded to talk up “ death panel ” garbage and tout Glenn Beck’s book .
By August 2009, Grassley told MSNBC that he was negotiating with the White House on a health care compromise, which Grassley was prepared to vote against, even if it included everything he asked for .
In the years that followed, the conservative Iowan did what hundreds of other GOP lawmakers did: Grassley voted to repeal the reform law – in whole or in part – several times.
And yet, here we are.
The Washington Post ’s Aaron Blake recently added , “It is worth taking stock of this moment. What we are seeing here is the marking of a willful GOP capitulation to Obamacare. Republicans are essentially admitting it is here to stay, barring unforeseen changes. They are trying to dress it up and put a good face on it for Trump, given that he apparently is not willing to concede the point. But it appears their long-emphasized push to get rid of this allegedly destructive law is effectively over.”
I agree with 95% of this. GOP policymakers in Congress and the White House will occasionally go through the motions, condemning the ACA more out of habit than conviction, realizing that they will never come up with an alternative that can both gain the necessary political support and meet the public’s needs and expectations.
But there is one related detail to keep in mind: there’s still that ridiculous lawsuit hanging over the ACA like a sword. A Republican judge in Texas has already used the case to begin the process of destroying “Obamacare” in its entirety, and Donald Trump’s White House recently agreed that the federal courts should do what elected officials could not: tear down the existing American health care system.
The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will take up the case in July, and whatever the outcome, the case may yet send the ACA to the U.S. Supreme Court for a third time.
When it comes to the legislative fight, Republicans have all but thrown in the towel, as Chuck Grassley’s comments help demonstrate. When it comes to the electoral fight, GOP officials are now running around telling anyone who’ll listen how much they love the Affordable Care Act’s core elements.
But when it comes to the legal fight, Republicans still have a Hail Mary pass in mind, and much of the party still hopes it will successfully take health security from tens of millions of Americans.

* A sensible reversal : “Immigration officials last week deported the spouse of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan in 2010, leaving the couple’s 12-year-daughter in Phoenix, then abruptly reversed its decision on Monday when the deported man was allowed to return to the U.S.”

GOP senators turn their attention to Clinton email probe,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-senators-turn-their-attention-clinton-email-probe,"Republican presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) speaks at the Growth and Opportunity Party, at the Iowa State Fair Oct. 31, 2015 in Des Moines, Iowa. Photo by Steve Pope/Getty GOP senators turn their attention to Clinton email probe 04/17/19 09:20 AM By Steve Benen Last summer, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) not only expressed confidence in the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections, he also boasted about what he’d do if elevated to the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Near the top of the senator’s list of priorities: the Hillary Clinton email probe.
Graham wasn’t kidding . Indeed, we were reminded yesterday that Graham is both focused on the Clinton email probe and recruiting some friends for his endeavor.
A trio of top Republican senators are doubling down on their demand for the Justice Department to hand over information on the handling of the probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.
Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) – the chairmen of the Judiciary, Homeland Security and Finance committees, respectively – sent a letter Tuesday to Attorney General William Barr arguing that now that special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe has wrapped up, the department should hand over the requested documents.
It’s possible the GOP senators have forgotten this pesky detail, but the Justice Department inspector general’s office already examined the probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server and it discredited the conspiracy theories .
As the New York Times ’ David Leonhardt explained last year, “Federal investigators and prosecutors did not give preferential treatment to Clinton. They pursued the case on the merits. They were guided by, as the inspector general’s report puts it, ‘the prosecutor’s assessment of the facts, the law, and past Department practice.’”
There was no pro-Clinton bias. As Rachel explained on the show 10 months ago, the Justice Department’s exhaustive review determined that the reason Clinton wasn’t charged was because there simply wasn’t reason to charge her. The investigation into her emails was handled properly.
And yet, there are Graham, Johnson, and Grassley, on the eve of the Mueller report’s release, turning their attention once more to partisan conspiracy theories surrounding Clinton and emails, raising questions that have already been answered.
Is it any wonder Democratic senators are laughing at them ?
The Hill had this report a few months ago.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), asked about Graham’s plans, started laughing and compared them to the “thrilling days of yesteryear.”
“This is going to be like the History Channel it turns out. Instead of taking a look at the current issues, Lindsey Graham wants to go back and answer important questions about the Bermuda Triangle and Hillary Clinton,” Durbin told The Hill.
Durbin said he was “concerned” about Graham’s plans but quipped that “you know there is that question about Jimmy Carter which he probably wants to ask.”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), another member of the panel, said maybe Graham should “investigate Benghazi some more too” – an apparent reference to a years-long House probe that Democrats considered a political stunt.
Graham, Johnson, and Grassley will very likely impress conservative media and their party’s far-right base with their latest efforts – but no one else.
Perhaps, in their eyes, no one else matters.

As Politico reported last night, however, there’s an increasingly obvious political difference when it comes to policymakers working on the issue.
Most Republicans are rejecting Democrat-led state bills to tighten childhood immunization laws in the midst of the worst measles outbreak in two decades, alarming public health experts who fear the nation could become as divided over vaccines as it is over global warming.
Democrats in six states – Colorado, Arizona, New Jersey, Washington, New York and Maine – have authored or co-sponsored bills to make it harder for parents to avoid vaccinating their school-age children, and mostly faced GOP opposition. Meanwhile in West Virginia and Mississippi, states with some of the nation’s strictest vaccination laws, Republican lawmakers have introduced measures to expand vaccine exemptions, although it’s not yet clear how much traction they have.
In the not-too-distant past, policymakers working on stopping the spread of preventable infectious diseases wouldn’t have been overly concerned with partisan political splits. Officials would’ve simply followed the science, consulted with experts, prioritized public health, and approved appropriate policies.
But in 2019, it appears more than a few GOP officials have adopted their own unique posture on the issue.
Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted in recent weeks that the Republican Party is well on its way to becoming the “party of health care.” Perhaps that was premature.
Indeed, before becoming president, Trump peddled bizarre theories about vaccinations, making the public discussion even more difficult. Politico ’s report added:
[O]fficials worry they are “three Trump tweets away” from an even more polarized situation, noted MIT political scientist Adam Berinsky, who has studied communication around politicized public health and scientific issues.
In Texas, the Tea Party and related groups created an anti-vax PAC in 2015. It hasn’t yet gotten its chosen candidates elected, but the very existence of a vaccine-oriented political action committee shows the political salience is growing. Influential voices on the right, including Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones, have all raised suspicions about vaccines.
“There’s a credulity gap between the parties in regard to science that wasn’t there 25 years ago,” Berinsky said.
If Republicans want to be the “party of health care,” they can start acting like it.

"Wednesday's Campaign Round-Up, 4.17.19 | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/wednesdays-campaign-round-41719,"By Steve Benen Today’s installment of campaign-related news items from across the country.
* The new national Monmouth poll shows Donald Trump’s approval rating dipping from 44% last month to 40% now. While Gallup recently found a bump in presidential support following the release of Bill Barr’s memo, other polling isn’t yet pointing to a broad shift.
* While Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) weighs a re-election bid despite being under criminal indictment, the Republican incumbent did not receive a campaign contribution from literally any individual in the first three months of 2019. Collins did, however, receive a couple of checks from political action committees.
* In Connecticut’s state House special election yesterday, Tammy Exum (D) won by a two-to-one margin, keeping a “blue” seat in Democratic hands. That said, at a national level, Democratic performance in special elections in 2019 isn’t quite as strong as the results we saw in 2018.
* As the Stop & Shop strike continues in the northeast, several Democratic presidential candidates have expressed their support for striking workers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who brought them coffee and donuts over the weekend.
* Dan Baer, who served as the Obama administration’s Ambassador for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, launched a Democratic U.S. Senate campaign in Colorado this week, hoping to take on Sen. Cory Gardner (R). More recently, Baer served as head of his state’s Department of Higher Education.
* The latest Marquette Law School poll found Trump with a 46% approval rating in Wisconsin, a swing state he narrowly carried in 2016 with 47% of the vote.
* Add Illinois to the list of states weighing new measures that would require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns as a prerequisite to appearing on the ballot.
* And in Arizona’s U.S. Senate race, Democratic leaders are no longer waiting for possible primary contenders: the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has officially endorsed retired astronaut Mark Kelly.

Some White House staffers worry about exposure in Mueller report | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/some-white-house-staffers-worry-about-exposure-mueller-report,"By Steve Benen As the investigation into the Russia scandal unfolded over the course of many months, plenty of White House officials did what Donald Trump refused to do: they spoke to investigators and answered their questions.
In theory, so long as they were truthful, the aides’ cooperation with the probe seems like an inherently good thing. But in practice, as NBC News reported yesterday, some White House staffers are concerned about possible cameos in the Mueller report, due to be released tomorrow morning.
Some of the more than one dozen current and former White House officials who cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller are worried that the version of his report expected to be made public on Thursday will expose them as the source of damaging information about President Donald Trump, according to multiple witnesses in the investigation.
Some of the officials and their lawyers have sought clarity from the Justice Department on whether the names of those who cooperated with Mueller’s team will be redacted or if the public report will be written in a way that makes it obvious who shared certain details of Trump’s actions that were part of the obstruction of justice probe, people familiar with the discussions said. But, they said, the Justice Department has refused to elaborate.
As one former White House official put it, in reference to White House officials, “They got asked questions and told the truth, and now they’re worried the wrath will follow.”
How worried? One person close to the White House told NBC News there is “ breakdown-level anxiety ” among some current and former staffers who cooperated with the investigation.
It’s important to emphasize that the president’s own attorneys told aides they should cooperate with the special counsel’s probe. As best as we can tell from the outside, those directions did not come with a wink and a nod – staffers were encouraged to answer investigators’ questions, and so they did.
But these same aides are suddenly faced with the prospect of appearing in the Mueller report, alongside revelations that their volatile president may not appreciate.
Indeed, the NBC News report is important, if for no other reason, because it offers a peek behind the curtain: if these staffers didn’t have damaging perspectives to offer, they wouldn’t be nervous right now .
In other words, if White House aides sat down with investigators, answered questions fully and honestly, and left confident that they hadn’t said anything that would cast Trump in a negative light, they wouldn’t have any cause for concern.
The fact that some are feeling “breakdown-level anxiety” offers a pretty big hint that they conveyed information to Team Mueller that didn’t make their boss look especially good.
Over the last week or so, the president himself has appeared, to put it mildly, highly agitated over what Americans may soon learn about Mueller’s findings. But let’s not forget those who work on his team, who are apparently quite nervous, not because they’re worried about Trump’s fate, but rather, because they’re worried about their own.

* There’s simply no reason for this : “The Trump administration is re-imposing limits on the amount of money Cuban Americans can send to relatives on the island and ordering new restrictions on U.S. citizen, nonfamily travel to Cuba, national security adviser John Bolton said Wednesday.”
* Bill Barr finds another way to make Trump happy: “The nation’s top prosecutor broadened the Trump administration’s authority to detain asylum seekers who cross the border illegally by declaring Tuesday that they are not entitled to bond hearings.”
* I guess we’re supposed to be thankful for her restraint : “White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump says her father asked her if she was interested in taking the job of World Bank chief but she passed on it.”
* How’s the whole “drain the swamp” thing going ? “Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has a new job: a more than $100,000-a-year post with a gold mining firm that’s pursuing project approvals involving the federal agency that Zinke left fewer than four months ago.”
* Keep in mind, Dowd hasn’t actually read the Mueller report: “John Dowd, President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, is calling the Mueller report ‘pure mischief’ and ‘not fair,’ believing that it will cause undue problems for the president.”
* Family separations : “Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union said in a federal court filing Monday night that the Trump administration’s one- to two-year timetable for reuniting potentially thousands of separated migrant families shows ‘a callous disregard for these families and should be rejected.’”
* A case we’ve been following: “A new victim has gone public in the Jeffrey Epstein case, filing a sworn affidavit in federal court in New York Tuesday, saying that she was sexually assaulted and her then-15-year-old sister molested by Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 1996.”
* The predictable reaction : “On Monday, the Trump administration followed through on its promise to formally label a segment of Iran’s military forces ‘terrorists.’ Today, Tehran fired back with its own provocative move: It now considers all US troops in the Middle East to be terrorists too.”
