Hope Hicks Says Hope Hicks Was Great at Her Job. Should We Trust Her?,slate.com,Christina Cauterucci,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/hope-hicks-mueller-report-donald-trump.html,"Trump Tweet Claiming Millions Killed in Sri Lanka Bombings Stays Up for 20 Minutes Hope Hicks has long been one of Trump World’s greatest mysteries. She had never so much as volunteered for a political candidate when Donald Trump tapped her, at age 26, to be his campaign’s press secretary in 2015. At the time, she seemed like the ne plus ultra of a Trump hire: a young, glamorous model who worked for his daughter’s clothing company. It wasn’t hard to see why Trump picked her. It was hard to imagine why a woman with no obvious ideological ax to grind would stunt her nascent career in public relations by signing on with a PR disaster. After the release of a redacted version of Robert Mueller’s special counsel report on Thursday, it’s gotten a lot easier to comprehend Hicks’ motives. She emerged as a somewhat unexpected breakout star of the report, a candid source for investigators who shed light on the president’s unwillingness to take his aides’ advice and confront inevitable consequences. The Hicks of the Mueller report is a capable PR professional who tried her darnedest to protect her boss from his worst impulses, advocated for him when appropriate, and ultimately stood on the side of truth and decency. At least, that’s according to Hicks. The anecdotes that make Hicks look adept and intelligent all come from the same source: Hope Hicks. There are at least two instances where Hicks recounted for investigators—with no corroborating accounts from anyone else—how hard she worked to get Trump to stop saying obstruction-y things to the press. After Trump hinted in a pre-taped interview with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo that he might ask James Comey to resign his FBI post, Hicks claims to have told him they should have Fox remove the quote from the final broadcast version. “But the President wanted to keep it in, which Hicks thought was unusual,” the report says. A few months later, Trump gave an “unplanned interview” to the New York Times, in which he badmouthed then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Here’s how the report says it went down: “Hicks, who was present for the interview, recalled trying to ‘throw [herself) between the reporters and [the President]’ to stop parts of the interview, but the President ‘loved the interview.’ ” What an American, making a human wall of herself to preserve the integrity of the special counsel’s investigation! What a communications director, pulling a Secret Service–taking-a-bullet move to prevent her client from making a fool, or criminal, of himself! There’s nothing to suggest Hicks didn’t take these smart (if no-brainer) steps in the course of her duties. But the Hicks who emerges in these anecdotes only bears responsibility for the heroic behind-the-scenes efforts to contain Trump, not any of the bad stuff she surely commended, ignored, or egged him on to do. During Trump’s campaign and presidency, Hicks was one of the few people trusted with helping craft Trump’s tweets, which have famously bullied private citizens, fomented hate for Muslims and immigrants, made sexist cracks at women who criticized him, and edged the country closer to a nuclear showdown. According to one Trump campaign official , some of Trump’s most merciless Twitter insults have come from Hicks’ keyboard. The Mueller report does contain one challenge to Hicks’ glowing account of her own tenure. It concerns a conversation in summer 2017, when Hicks made a valiant effort to get Trump to understand the potential damage that could be inflicted by the emails setting up a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr., other campaign staffers, and a Kremlin-linked attorney. Hicks “recalled being shocked by the emails,” and tried to convince Trump to release them before they could leak and suggested arranging a “softball interview” with Trump Jr. Hicks says, per the report, that she was stymied by Trump, who was convinced the emails would never leak and wanted to keep them private. Here, Hicks sounds like a solid crisis communications strategist who wants to show the public that Trump and his family have nothing to hide. And her story may be true. But another Trump staffer contradicts her account. Former Trump legal team spokesman Mark Corallo produced notes for investigators from a conversation he had with Hicks and Trump after the New York Times ran a piece on the Trump Tower meeting. Regarding the emails Hicks said she tried to get Trump to release, Corallo wrote, “Hope says ‘only a few people have [them]. [They] will never get out.’ ” Hicks told investigators she didn’t remember saying that—or maybe she did, and she was simply “channeling the President.” The Mueller report has given Hicks and her former colleagues the opportunity to write themselves into the first draft of the Trump chapter of U.S. history, and no one’s compiled a better press release for themselves than Hicks. In talking to investigators, she studiously followed the advice she says she gave Trump: She got out ahead of the story and set her own narrative before anyone else could define her time in the administration. The parts of Hicks’ story that might reflect poorly on her character—her admission to House investigators that she’s told “ white lies ” for Trump, for instance—don’t make it into the Mueller report. Those aspects of her narrative will now be buried under this substantive and politically powerful document. Hicks’ accounts of trying to protect Trump from himself speak volumes about her PR acumen. Her ability to shovel those accounts into a widely read and highly trusted public record says even more. Support our journalism

Immigrants Can Be Denied Citizenship for Working in Legal Marijuana Industry,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/immigrants-denied-citizenship-legal-marijuana.html,"So Is Impeachment Plausible, Necessary, or Stupid? Green-card holders may want to think twice about celebrating 4/20 too publicly this year. That is because U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued guidance a day before the unofficial marijuana holiday that makes clear working in the marijuana industry, or even just possessing cannabis could be grounds to reject a citizenship application—regardless of whether it is done in a state where it is legal. Violations of federal marijuana laws “are generally a bar to establishing good moral character for naturalization, even where that conduct would not be an offense under state law,” according to the guidance issued Friday . Merely being “involved in certain marijuana-related activities” could be sign that an applicant for citizenship “may lack good moral character” regardless of whether “such activity has been decriminalized under applicable state laws,” according to the USCIS statement. mmigration lawyers who work in states where marijuana is legal say they have been dealing with this issue for a while now, leading Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock to send a letter to Attorney General William Barr asking for clarification about policies that have been affecting immigrants. This isn’t just a theoretical issue either. CNN reports that two immigrants who have lived in the United States for more than two decades were told they were not eligible for naturalization due to their work in the marijuana industry . “I work hard in an industry that offers opportunity and that’s unquestionably legal within the state. For the government to deny my citizenship application because I’m a bad person is devastating,” one affected immigrant tells CNN. Advocates for legalization say the guidance is more a reflection of the government’s anti-immigrant attitude than about drugs. “I don’t think this is about marijuana at all,” said Michael Collins, national affairs director of the Drug Policy Alliance . “I think this is about them using the war on drugs to go after migrant community and that’s what they’ve been doing since Day 1.” A total of 33 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana while 10 states and D.C. have legalized recreational marijuana.

Lyra McKee killing: Two teenagers arrested.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/lyra-mckee-killing-two-teenagers-arrested-northern-ireland.html,"So Is Impeachment Plausible, Necessary, or Stupid? Two teenage men have been arrested in the connection to the murder of 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee. The men—aged 18 and 19—were arrested under the terrorism act and taken to a police station in Belfast for questioning . McKee, a prominent freelance journalist, was killed in Londonderry, which is known to many of the locals as Derry, on Thursday night while she covered a riot. Police had blamed a militant splinter group known as the New Irish Republican Army for the killing. Police released video footage from surveillance cameras that captured McKee’s final moments in an effort to get the public to hand over information about the murder. The young journalist was standing near a police vehicle with other reporters when she was shot . The riot took place on the 21st anniversary of the Good Friday agreement, the 1998 deal that largely marked the end of decades of conflict. The New IRA group opposes the peace deal.

At a vigil in Derry on Friday, McKee’s partner, Sara Canning, said McKee’s “ amazing potential was snuffed out by this single barbaric act .” Canning also characterized McKee as a “tireless advocate and activist” and said the killing “has left me without the love of my life, the woman I was planning to grow old with.” In 2016, McKee was named on a Forbes list of 30 remarkable media professionals under 30 . She crowdsourced funds for her first book, Angels With Blue Faces , about the killing of a unionist lawmaker in 1981.

Vermont likely to become third state to officially scrap Columbus Day for Indigenous Peoples’ Day.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/vermont-to-officially-scrap-columbus-day-indigenous-peoples-day.html,"So Is Impeachment Plausible, Necessary, or Stupid? Columbus Day is likely to be a thing of the past in Vermont in the near future. The Vermont Legislature passed a bill on Wednesday that would permanently recognize the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Gov. Phil Scott said he’ll likely sign it into law. “I see no reason that I would not sign it,” Scott told the Burlington Free Press , “but we’re reviewing the bill as we speak.” Vermont actually hasn’t celebrated Columbus Day for a few years. Former Gov. Peter Shumlin signed a gubernatorial proclamation in 2016 recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day and that continued even after the current Republican governor took office. But the measure now awaiting the governor’s signature would do away with Columbus Day altogether, turning Vermont into the third state to legally rename the holiday after New Mexico and South Dakota. Alaska is in a special circumstance because it never actually recognized Columbus Day as a holiday but did declare Indigenous Peoples’ Day a state holiday in 2017. Many cities around the country have also moved to rename the Columbus Day holiday as a way of honoring indigenous people and recognizing that the history many learned in school ignored the brutality of colonization. “Things that are symbolic can carry very far,” Rich Holschuh, a member of the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs, told the Burlington Free Press. “The degree of disinformation and lack of understanding around the situation of native people in Vermont, as a microcosm of the national situation, is totally exemplified in the way that Columbus has been celebrated and the native people ignored.” Maine is likely to follow suit and be the next state to do away with Columbus Day after Maine’s Senate gave the final approval to a bill that would rename the holiday on Thursday. Gov. Janet Mills, whose administration has previously expressed support for the measure, would now need to sign the bill to turn it into law. Oami Amarasingham, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine celebrated the decision by state lawmakers. “It’s time to stop celebrating a man whose arrival brought death, disease and slavery to hundreds of thousands, and start honoring the people who lived here long before,” Amarasingham, said .

Ben Simmons vs. Jared Dudley: Who's winning this bizarre feud?,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/ben-simmons-vs-jared-dudley-nets-sixers.html,"The Best College Gymnast in America Is Also the Most Hated Were it not for the playoffs, Ben Simmons and Jared Dudley would exist as two distant planets in the vast expanses of the NBA universe. Simmons is an All-Star and one of the league’s brightest young talents. Dudley is a 33-year-old journeyman who was traded to the Brooklyn Nets last summer for Darrell Arthur. The postseason provides its own gravity, though, and these two seemingly unrelated entities have collided during the Philadelphia 76ers’ first-round matchup with the Brooklyn Nets. Somehow, the two are in the midst of an honest-to-goodness beef. A fabled beef, even. — Howard Beck (@HowardBeck) April 20, 2019 How did we get here? Who’s winning this bizarre (and fabled) showdown? The inciting incident. After Philadelphia evened up the series in Game 2, Dudley—who sat out that contest with a calf injury—talked to reporters about the team’s strategy for slowing Simmons down. “ Ben Simmons is a great player in transition ,” he said. “And once you get him into half court, he’s average.” Simmons’ rejoinder. When asked about the evaluation, Simmons scoffed. “That’s coming from Jared Dudley,” he said. “Come on.” #Sixers PG @BenSimmons25 responds to Jared Dudley’s comment about the #NBAAllStar being “average” in half court. pic.twitter.com/0BQTtHOnUL — Keith Pompey (@PompeyOnSixers) April 18, 2019 Simmons may have been dismissive of Dudley to reporters, but he was pointedly aggressive in Game 3, putting up 31 points and 9 assists in the Sixers’ win. Dudley, meanwhile, scored 0 points in 17 minutes, and Simmons looked particularly pleased after Dudley airballed a shot from behind the arc. Ben Simmons had fun trolling Jared Dudley after Dudley called him an “average” half-court player 🙃 pic.twitter.com/SYJdgJLOrP When asked about the beef after the game, Simmons gave his answer from the passing lane of the high road. “I don’t really have energy for it,” he said. “It’s done.” Dudley’s response. “Saturday’s Game 4 was a quiet affair, and both parties respectfully kept to themselves.” So begins the latest entry in my wildly unpopular basketball fan fiction series, NBA Players Getting Along . In reality, Dudley was a pest all afternoon, and he reacted to a made 3-pointer with the same celebration Simmons had used for Dudley’s Game 3 airball. Jared Dudley had a message for Ben Simmons 😂 #WeGoHard | #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/90FR34uRe3 — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) April 20, 2019 Dudley was probably still feeling the adrenaline rush of that made field goal when he got in the face of Sixers center Joel Embiid in the third quarter. He and Simmons tumbled into the crowd during the ensuing tussle, and the officials ejected Dudley and the Sixers’ Jimmy Butler, the latter of whom helped escalate the argument from a skirmish to a full-blown scuttlebutt. This left Simmons to continue the game without his foil, and he finished with 15 points, 8 assists, and 8 rebounds in a 112-108 win for Philadelphia. Who’s winning the feud? Simmons provided two key plays for the Sixers down the stretch. First, he found an open J.J. Redick for a go-ahead jumper. (Note: this kind of occurred in a half-court setting.) JJ knocks down the BIG triple when it counts! Sixers up 1! 🔥 #PhilaUnite | #NBAPlayoffs pic.twitter.com/GgFaCKZ5ei — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) April 20, 2019 Then, after the teams traded 3-pointers, Simmons stole the ball from Jarrett Allen and secured the win for Philly. Despite these late-game heroics, it’s obvious that the winner of the Simmons-Dudley showdown is Jared Dudley. Dudley averaged 4.9 points per game during the regular season. He is averaging 3 points in the postseason. The fact that he’s been able to generate a feud out of thin air despite those meager stats is a truly remarkable accomplishment. The Sixers and Ben Simmons may be up 3 games to 1, but Dudley has already managed the upset of the postseason."
Berry Tramel describes Russell Westbrook's icy relationship with the Oklahoma City media.,slate.com,Nick Greene,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/russell-westbrook-berry-tramel-next-question-2019-playoffs.html,"The Best College Gymnast in America Is Also the Most Hated The Oklahoma City Thunder clawed their way back into their first round playoff series with the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday with to a 120-108 victory. It was a hard-fought affair and, during the postgame press conference, Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook was asked about both teams’ choppy starts in the first half. “Next question,” he grumbled. The reporter continued his inquiry, but Westbrook remained silent. ""You want me to tell him...?"" PG to Russ as Westbrook continues feud with Oklahoman columnist pic.twitter.com/aEfyz6VALD — NBC Sports Northwest (@NBCSNorthwest) April 20, 2019 Westbrook’s ire had less to do with the innocuous question than with the reporter who asked it. Berry Tramel is a columnist for the Oklahoman and has been covering sports in the state for over 40 years. Westbrook’s one-sided rivalry with Tramel dates back to at least 2015 when, during a postgame scrum, he told the writer, “I just don’t like you.” That year, Bryan Curtis used the incident as the central hook for a Grantland feature about how the Thunder organization coddles and shields its players from the media. “That’s not really Russ’s fault, I don’t think,” Tramel told Curtis at the time. “I think the culture created that.” A lot has happened in the years since—Kevin Durant left, Westbrook won an MVP—but little has changed with the team’s relationship with the press, and with Westbrook’s relationship with Tramel. During the 2017 playoffs, Westbrook took exception to the columnist’s question (which had been directed to Thunder center Steven Adams) about why the Thunder played poorly when the team’s star point guard went to the bench. Westbrook’s “next question” on Friday night may have gotten a lot of attention, but it’s not a new tactic. Earlier this month, Tramel wrote a column in which he referenced Westbrook’s penchant for telling the writer “next question,” and explained why he continues to quiz the Thunder star. “I think Westbrook puts on a façade during the season, and when it’s an interview relationship, he’s playing a character and won’t give an inch. He’s playing the intimidator,” Tramel wrote. “So I’ll keep asking questions, because he’s giving me no other choice.” I reached Tramel by phone on Saturday to ask him about Friday’s interaction, how the Thunder organization has handled it, and what it’s like to be next question -ed by Westbrook. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Nick Greene: Do you think Thunder PR will reach out to you now that Friday’s interaction has become a national story? Berry Tramel: I assume not. Frankly, I thought it had gone national even before last night. Once the playoffs got here it sort of snowballed. Somebody told me that I was trending on Twitter even though I don’t really know what that means. I didn’t expect anything to happen after last night. Certainly nothing has. Did you expect Westbrook to give you a response on Friday because it was at the podium and not in the locker room? No. I knew. The same thing happened in Portland for Games 1 and 2. He’s been doing that for the last three months. I didn’t think it would change with the playoffs, but I didn’t know for sure. Do you have any idea of what happened three months ago to spark this? Three months ago they played the Lakers. He’s been struggling from the foul line this year and with 2 seconds left in the game he drew a three-shot foul and made all three to send the game into overtime . After the game someone asked him about his struggles at the free throw line, and he basically didn’t answer the question. So I asked him about how he found the confidence to make three with the game on the line even though he hadn’t been shooting well from the line. And he basically didn’t answer again. I responded by saying, “You not only don’t want to talk about the free throws you miss, you don’t want to talk about the free throws you make.” I was just trying to be funny and bring a little levity to the situation. He sort of glared at me. He never looks at people when they ask him questions, so when he looks at you you know he’s upset. Since then, he’s been saying “next question.” What does it feel like to be stonewalled like that? Does it get easier the more it happens? It’s not a big deal to me. I find the whole thing a little bit humorous. I find it interesting that it’s such a big deal to everybody because he’s really been doing this for years and years. Not always to me, but he’s always combative with the media. I don’t really see what the big news is. Later in the press conference, Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts singled you out and said he’d answer your question , which was a pretty funny moment. Do you find that people with other teams take notice of the fraught OKC-press relationship? Stotts was the first one from another team to reference it that I know about. We’re sort of secluded here in Oklahoma. They follow the games and Westbrook is a wonderful player, but as far as his dealings with the Oklahoma media, nobody pays attention to that until the playoffs. I’m not aware of any other teams even knowing about it, until Terry Stotts said what he said. The Thunder have enjoyed success since moving to Oklahoma City. Do you think if the team were less successful then they would be more open with the press? I think the Thunder believes that they’re in pretty good standing with the media, outside of Westbrook. And maybe they are. As far as I know, there’s never been any serious rifts between any media and any player besides Westbrook. Kevin Durant might get mad at somebody, Kendrick Perkins might get mad at somebody. Dennis Schröder got mad at somebody this year. But they get over it. It doesn’t linger. Westbrook’s different. He likes to invent enemies. He does it on the court, does it in media scrums. I guess it fuels him. The Thunder, by league standards, are a pretty insular franchise. But, with that said, the NBA still provides incredible access to interviews. You can talk to most people most any day you want to. The problem with the Thunder is that there are hardly any one-on-one interviews. There’s hardly any opportunity to get to know each other. The first time Westbrook ever showed any type of disdain for me, I came away sort of encouraged because it was the first time I had any acknowledgement that he knew who I was. There’s no relationship there. I’m not talking about being friends or going out to lunch. I’m talking about knowing each other’s names. Having a professional relationship. There’s very little of that going on with the Thunder. That’s by design. They want to keep everything as player-friendly as they can.

United Constitutional Patriots: FBI arrests head of armed militia group that was detaining migrants at border.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/united-constitutional-patriots-fbi-arrests-head-of-militia.html,"Hope Hicks Says Hope Hicks Was Great at Her Job. Should We Trust Her? The FBI arrested on Saturday the head of a right-wing militia that had been detaining migrant families at gunpoint . Law enforcement officers arrested Larry Mitchell Hopkins, who went by the alias Johnny Horton Jr., in New Mexico on charges of firearms possession by a felon. Hopkins had previously been arrested in 2006 on charges of impersonating an officer and for felony firearm possession. “This is a dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families,” the New Mexico attorney general, Hector Balderas, said in a statement . “Today’s arrest by the F.B.I. indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes.” Although the charge isn’t particularly serious, it could open the door to other investigations and sends a clear message regarding the type of vigilante justice the group has been carrying out along the border. Please see below release: pic.twitter.com/hFte1F1vNQ — NM Attorney General (@NewMexicoOAG) April 20, 2019 The arrest came mere days after it was reported that the United Constitutional Patriots were publishing videos on social media showing how they were illegally detaining migrant families. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union had denounced the actions of the militia and called for authorities to investigate. “We cannot allow racist and armed vigilantes to kidnap and detain people seeking asylum,” two ACLU lawyers wrote in a letter to government officials. In the videos that had been published online, the militia members spoke in favor of a border wall and referred to the arrival of migrants as an “invasion,” echoing language used by President Donald Trump. Some members of the group had set up camp near the border since November and claim they’ve detained more than 3,000 migrants since then. Support our journalism

Singleton checked himself into the hospital after his leg started hurting on a flight to the United States from Costa Rica. Doctors described the stroke as “mild,” according to TMZ . His family confirmed Singleton’s hospitalization in a statement on Saturday:

That’s natural on fictional shows—nobody wants Arli$$ to break character and start eulogizing a set designer in the middle of an exciting new episode of Arli$$— but there’s no reason a talk show can’t do better than that, and on Friday, Stephen Colbert did.

Sri Lanka bombings: Blasts at churches and hotels kill hundreds on Easter Sunday.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/sri-lanka-bombings-churches-hotels-easter-sunday.html,"The Supreme Court’s New LGBTQ Cases Could Demolish Sex Discrimination Law as We Know It Bombs struck three churches in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday and three luxury hotels popular with foreign tourists, killing at least 207 people and wounding 450 in what are being described as a series of coordinated terrorist attacks . The death toll has been increasing in quick succession since the blasts and the latest number comes from law enforcement officials . A seventh and eighth bombing Sunday afternoon that took place at private house and another hotel appear to have been carried out by suspects as they were fleeing from police. Seven suspects have been arrested in the attacks that officials say were mostly suicide bombings and marked the deadliest violence to strike the country since the end of the civil war a decade ago. There were at least 27 foreigners, including British, Dutch, and American citizens, among the dead, according to hospital officials. Some of the bombings, which were mostly carried out in or around the capital city of Colombo, at the churches appear to have been timed to hit the highest number of worshippers possible. So far the deadliest explosion appears to have taken place at St. Sebastian’s Church in Negombo , which is about 20 miles north of Colombo. More than 50 people were killed in that blast that blew out much of the church’s roof. The church posted horrific photos showing the aftermath of the blast on Facebook as it appealed for help. The other bombed churches were St. Anthony’s Shrine in Colombo and Zion Church in the eastern city of Batticaloa. “It was a river of blood,” N. A. Sumanapala, a shopkeeper near St. Anthony’s said. “The priest came out and he was covered in blood.” As panic spread to other churches, most stopped or canceled their Easter services. The three high-end hotels targeted in Colombo were: the Shangri-La, the Cinnamon Grand and the Kingsbury. Sri Lankan authorities imposed a curfew and blocked social media networks as they launched a massive security operation to locate the culprits. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks but Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena blamed religious extremists for the blasts that rocked a country that once regularly saw bombings in Colombo during a decades-long war with Tamil separatists. Around 70 percent of Sri Lanka’s population of around 22 million are Buddhist, 12.6 percent are Hindu, 9.7 percent, Muslim, and 7.6 percent Christian, according to the 2012 census .

Schiff on Mueller report: “In every way this is more significant than Watergate.”,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/schiff-mueller-report-more-significant-watergate-nixon.html,"Rep. Adam Schiff, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, pushed back against suggestions that the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report somehow aren’t as serious as he and other Democrats had suggested . In particular, the allegations surrounding obstruction of justice that are outlined in the Mueller report are “far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did,” Schiff said. The host of ABC’s This Week , Martha Raddatz, questioned Schiff about his previous statements comparing the actions of the Trump administration to Watergate, leaving the door open for him to take back some of those comments. But Schiff, who has become a favorite target of Republicans ever since Attorney General William Barr released his summary of the Mueller report, made clear that as far as he was concerned his previous statements on the seriousness of the president’s misdeeds continue to stand. Rep. Adam Schiff on the Mueller report and President Trump: ""The obstruction of justice in particular this case is far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did ... so yes, I would say in every way this is more significant than Watergate"" https://t.co/yZdNkbTlSI pic.twitter.com/ijtCWc2w4B — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) April 21, 2019 “The obstruction of justice in particular in this case is far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did,” Schiff said . “The break in by the Russians of the Democratic institutions, a foreign adversary far more significant than the plumbers breaking into the Democratic headquarters. So yes, I would say in every way this is more significant than Watergate.” Beyond that though, Schiff also said that the way Trump “would not only not stand up and resist Russian interference in our election but would welcome it goes well beyond anything Nixon did.” Taking Moscow’s side over those of his own intelligence agencies goes is one of the main reasons why “I think it is far more serious than Watergate.” When asked whether Trump obstructed justice, Schiff said that as far as he’s concerned, there is no doubt about that, noting the obstruction came “in many ways.” Even though Trump’s allies say Mueller’s report exonerates the president, Schiff insists that Mueller “made it abundantly clear he felt he could not indict the president” and beyond that “I think he also felt that he could not say that the president should be indicted, because that would be effectively the same thing.” At the end of the day, Mueller “came as close to saying that the evidence of obstruction was evidence of a crime as he could within the Department of Justice regulations.” . @MarthaRaddatz : ""Do you believe the president did obstruct justice?""Rep.

Michael Avenatti accused of embezzling nearly $2 million NBA star Hassan Whiteside paid to ex girlfriend.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/michael-avenatti-embezzlment-nba-star-hassan-whiteside.html,"The Supreme Court’s New LGBTQ Cases Could Demolish Sex Discrimination Law as We Know It When Miami Heat center Hassan Whiteside wired $2.75 million to celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti in January 2017 it was supposed to cover most of the settlement to prevent a potential lawsuit that had been threatened by his former girlfriend, Alexis Gardner. In the end, most of the cash—$2.5 million—went to help Avenatti buy a share of a private jet, according to the Los Angeles Times . Gardner, an actress and barista, had hired Avenatti to help her reach a settlement with Whiteside and the two quickly came to agree on a $3 million deal. That January 2017 transfer was supposed to be the first payment. Avenatti was entitled to take a little more than $1 million in legal fees, but he did not tell Gardner about the cash. Instead, he told her client she would receive 96 monthly payments over the following eight years. Avenatti then allegedly proceeded to make 11 payments to Gardner, totaling around $194,000 before those stopped and he began claiming that Whiteside was not coming through on his end of the deal. Hassan Whiteside #21 of the Miami Heat motions for the fans to get louder during the final moments of the game against Brooklyn Nets at Barclays Center on November 14, 2018 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Sarah Stier/Getty Images It isn’t clear what the lawsuit between Gardner and Whiteside would have entailed but it does seem they both wanted to keep the whole thing quiet. “We entered into a mutually agreed upon settlement more than two years ago following the end of our relationship; a settlement that reflected Alexis’ investment of time and support over a number of years as Hassan pursued a career in the NBA,” Whiteside and Gardner told the Los Angeles Times in a statement. “It is unfortunate that something that was meant to be kept private between us is now being publicly reported. We have both moved on amicably and wish nothing but the best for each other.” The alleged embezzlement is detailed in the April 10 indictment of Avenatti by a federal grand jury in Santa Ana, California. Last month, prosecutors unveiled a spate of criminal charges against the lawyer who rose to stardom for representing adult film star Stormy Daniels. But the 36-count indictment didn’t identify Whiteside or Gardner, only referring to them as “Individual 1” and “Client 2.” Prosecutors claim Avenatti embezzled money from five of his clients, one of whom was Gardner. Prosecutors also allege that Avenatti embezzled from Geoffrey Ernest Johnson, a mentally ill paraplegic man who won a $4 million settlement but only received $124,000 from his lawyer. He also allegedly embezzled some $4 million from Michelle Phan, a makeup artist who has a huge following on YouTube. Avenatti, who faces a maximum penalty of 382 years in prison, denies any wrongdoing. “No monies were ever embezzled from anyone and I look forward to all of the relevant documents and facts being presented at trial,” Avenatti said in an email to the Los Angeles Times Sunday morning. Avenatti also took to Twitter Sunday to say he looks “forward to ALL of the details coming out regarding Hassan Whiteside’s settlement, the money received by the client, the money deducted for fees and costs, etc. and the reason why he paid the money.” I look forward to ALL of the details coming out regarding Hassan Whiteside’s settlement, the money received by the client, the money deducted for fees and costs, etc. and the reason why he paid the money.

He would have personally advised against it, mind you, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong . Giuliani uttered the words while answering a question from CNN’s Jake Tapper regarding Sen. Mitt Romney’s statement in which he says he was “appalled” that “ fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia .” Giuliani quickly fired back and accused Romney of being a hypocrite . “Stop the bull,” Giuliani said. “Stop this pious act.” The former mayor said Romney was “trying to dig up dirt on people, putting dirt out on people” when he was running for president. When Tapper pushed back to say there was a difference between opposition research and accepting information from a foreign adversary, Giuliani suggests it’s all the same. “What a hypocrite. Any candidate in the whole world—in America—would take information,” Giuliani said. “Who says it’s even illegal?” He then insisted that “there’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians” and says it all “depends on where it came from.” “There’s nothing wrong with taking information from Russians,” Rudy Giuliani tells @jaketapper . #CNNSOTU https://t.co/Fe78m3aDWq pic.twitter.com/wfcU38vTWX — State of the Union (@CNNSotu) April 21, 2019 Despite the insistence on the legality of the move, Giuliani said he “probably wouldn’t” have taken information from a Russian source. “I wasn’t asked,” he said. “I would have advised, just out of excess of caution, don’t do it.” Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press , Giuliani also refused to give a clear cut answer on whether it was acceptable for a political campaign to use material stolen by foreign adversaries. “It depends on the stolen material,” he said . Giuliani also suggested that the hacking of Democratic emails may have been good for voters. “They shouldn’t have stolen it, but the American people were just given more information about how deceptive, how manipulative her campaign was,” Giuliani said . “I wonder if there isn’t an argument that the people had a right to know that about Hillary Clinton.” Is it okay for political campaigns to use stolen information from foreign adversaries? @RudyGiuliani : ""Depends on the stolen material."" #MTP pic.twitter.com/s9QvAWGZoE — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) April 21, 2019 Support our journalism

Exit polls gave Volodymyr Zelensky more than 70 percent of the vote, leading incumbent Petro Poroshenko to concede defeat . The victory for Zelensky, 41, means a man with no political experience now leads a country that is at the center of the West’s standoff with Russia regarding the annexation of Crimea. Speaking at his campaign headquarters in Kiev, Zelensky apperead to suggest other former Soviet states could follow Ukraine’s example to change politics as usual . “As long as I am not officially a president, I can say as a citizen of Ukraine to all countries of the post-Soviet Union: Look at us—anything is possible,” he said. The election of Zelensky is seen as a rebuke not just of Poroshenko but also of the country’s entire political establishment. It also appeared to send a message that Ukrainians care more about their internal problems than any threat from Russia. But Zelensky has said his top priority would be to secure the release of around 170 members of Ukraine’s military who are being held in the east or in Russia. Beyond a promise to end the war in the eastern Donbass region and fight against corruption, Zelensky has been vague about his plans. “Since there is complete uncertainty about the economic policy of the person who will become president, we simply don’t know what is going to happen and that worries the financial community,” Serhiy Fursa, an investment banker at Dragon Capital in Kiev, tells Reuters . Before the election, Zelensky was best known for his role in the long-running show Servant of the People in which he plays a teacher who unexpectedly wins a presidential election after students post one of his angry rants about corruption online and it goes viral. Throughout the campaign he used his on-screen character to his advantage as he spoke broadly about combating corruption without offering many specifics about how he would run his government. “This feels like a massive protest vote,” writes BBC’s Jonah Fisher . Supporters acknowledged that while they may not believe all of Zelensky’s promises, at least he represents change. “I have grown up under the old politicians and only have seen empty promises, lies and corruption,” a 22-year-old who voted for Zelensky told the Associated Press . “It’s time to change that.” Support our journalism

In a police report, Kirckovich defended himself by saying that officers were vastly outnumbered by some 200 students “who were yelling, threatening us and surrounding us, I had to act quickly, fearing I would get stuck or having a student potentially grab weapons off of my belt or vest.” Kirckovich wrote that the 15-year-old boy approached them as they were arresting another boy on a trespassing charge. Although the officer says the boy had an “aggressive stance” the video appears to show that he was walking away from the deputies after he was pepper sprayed. The teenager didn’t suffer any serious injuries, according to the police report.

Dorothy Parker on Easter: Read her 1922 Life Magazine article roasting Easter coverage at other outlets.,slate.com,Dorothy Parker,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/dorothy-parker-contents-humor-magazine-easter-1922-life-magazine.html,"Dottie said WHAT? Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images Nothing kills comedy like sentimentalism, and nothing brings sentimentalists out of the woodwork faster than a holiday. This has probably always been true, but it was definitely true by April of 1922, when Life Magazine took aim at its competitors in an article headlined “Contents of the Easter Issue of Any Humorous Magazine.” The byline is “D.P.,” but if this is not by Dorothy Parker, it’s by someone even unluckier than George S. Kaufman : Although the same issue of Life includes Parker’s poem “ To Myrtilla, on Easter Day ,” credited to her full name, her 1926 poetry collection Enough Rope includes enough poems originally attributed to “D.P.” in Life Magazine that if there were another D.P., he or she would probably have complained. The piece is a Jazz Age version of “women be shopping”—including taking a shot at “women be shopping” as a premise, nearly 75 years before The Nutty Professor —and it’s cutting, apt, and hilarious. Although some of the precise strains of humor targeted here have gone the way of Prohibition, their descendants are easily recognizable today. Jokes about hipsters bear the distinct features of 1922’s jokes about Avenue A flappers, jokes about women being frivolous are very much still around, and the only reason we don’t run sentimental cartoons about the spirit of peace anymore is that we’ve been at war for 18 years running. But there’s something very reassuring about the idea that, although you can pretty quickly locate terrible comedy from any culture in any era—it’s often what survives—looking a little closer often reveals contemporaneous critics blowing a well-deserved raspberry. –Matthew Dessem Contents of the Easter Issue of Any Humorous Magazine One illustrated joke based on the theory that women attend church on Easter morning less to derive benefit from the service than to display their new hats to the congregation. Three illustrated jokes, variations of the above theme. One cartoon showing the world wearing an Easter bonnet. Two illustrated jokes showing the harrowing effect on Father of the bills for his wife’s and daughter’s Easter finery. Five jokes, without illustrations, along the above lines. One poem about the way Grandma used to look in her Easter hat, supposedly written by Grandpa. One poem comparing the cost of Grandma’s Easter hat with the price of those to-day, intimating that times have changed, and not for the better, since Grandma was a girl. Three illustrated jokes dealing with the Easter costumes of Avenue A flappers. The joke, in each instance, begins with the words “Hully gee!” supposedly uttered by one of the flappers. One drawing of the devil gleefully returning to business at the conclusion of Lent. One drawing of Spring emerging from a large Easter egg. One drawing entitled “Little Willie’s Dream After Dinner,” showing Willie cowering in bed, while a gigantic Easter bunny sits on the footboard. Poem to Phyllis, congratulating her on the becomingness of her Easter hat. Poem to Phillida, implying that the writer’s heart will be found entangled in the trimmings of her Easter hat. Poem to Amaryllis, stating that the author’s affections are held fast by the ribbons that tie her Easter hat. Poem to Chloe, hinting that though her manner is demure and her eyes innocently cast down, she is not unaware of the devastating effect on the local swains of her Easter hat.

Fortunately, Last Week Tonight is willing to do what Barr wouldn’t, taking an in-depth look at the report and reveling in its most ridiculous and profane moments, like Trump’s “ I’m fucked ” reaction to Mueller or the White House counsel telling Reince Priebus that the president asked him to “do crazy shit.” For all that Oliver is having fun, he explained why it’s better to have everything, even troubling signs of corruption , out in the open. “I’m not saying any of that is good news,” he said. “But it is definitely good that we know about it.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Coming out on top of the jampacked race were Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Beto O’Rourke, whose donations from individuals totaled $18.2 million, $12 million, and $9.4 million, respectively. But we’re here to share a far less critical, and far more fun, discovery from the reports: which candidates scored the celebrity donations. With some help from Spin and Axios , we combed through the Federal Election Commission data to figure out to whom the big names were donating the big bucks. (And by big bucks, we mean less than $2,800, since individuals are barred from contributing more than that per primary campaign.) Some of the findings surprised us. Others, not so much. Note: We compiled this list based on the donors’ full names, occupations, and states. We did not contact donors to verify their contributions. Tip: The options are Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, Kirsten Gillibrand, Andrew Yang, and Cory Booker. No candidate is repeated twice. 1.

We should thank Mueller for his decision not to accuse Trump of a crime.,slate.com,Rebecca Roiphe,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/robert-mueller-trump-crime-obstruction-justice-doj.html,"Don McGahn Is No Hero Now that the dust has settled and people have had a chance to sift through the 448 pages of facts and evidence contained in the Mueller report—or stream the 20-hour audiobook version—the president, as expected, has continued to claim absolute exoneration, and critics have recoiled in shock at what looks like a pattern of inappropriate conduct with Russians and a sustained effort to cover it up. There is one conclusion, however, that seems less controversial and at least as salient. By issuing the report the way he did, special counsel Robert Mueller sought to preserve the legitimacy of the Department of Justice—and largely succeeded, after two years of repeated attacks from the president and his spokespeople. By refusing to decide whether President Donald Trump’s conduct constituted obstruction of justice, and instead simply laying out the facts, Mueller’s report appears to be the work of a professional prosecutor. The search for truth is at the core of every prosecutor’s mission. Although prosecutors are sometimes accused of hiding inconvenient facts or obscuring weaknesses in their cases, such criticism only resonates because we recognize that prosecutors have an absolute obligation to pursue truth in an evenhanded way. Mueller’s report seems exemplary in this way: thorough, careful, and unbiased. To follow the evidence wherever it leads is a fundamental prosecutorial duty, one that defines the unique role that prosecutors play in upholding the rule of law, and indeed democracy itself. If the government could take away a person’s life or liberty based on a distortion of fact, or fact seen through the lens of partisan political advantage, then our democracy would cease to function. Anyone in power could hound his adversary, fabricating facts or spinning reality to look a particular way in order to jail opponents and consolidate personal political advantage—the sorts of things our president daydreams about at his MAGA rallies and on his Twitter feed . Ultimately, whatever the president tweets, democracy requires well-informed voters and lawmakers. It thus relies on prosecutors who fulfill their duty to uncover and present facts impartially and in a manner untainted by the pursuit of partisan advantage. Of course, in most instances prosecutors are supposed to do more than just uncover and present facts. They are also supposed to reach legal conclusions and, if warranted, bring criminal charges. Attorney General William Barr emphasized this role during the press conference he held hours before the Mueller report was released. Barr insisted that it was this mandate that led him, along with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to reach their own conclusion that the president had not committed a crime. In a normal case, this is exactly what prosecutors should do. But the special counsel’s mandate was not normal. Investigating a sitting president for criminal conduct is not a run-of-the-mill criminal prosecution and so it would be a mistake to abide by all the rules without giving some preliminary thought as to whether they apply. Mueller managed to deliver facts without exposing his investigation to partisan accusations. Critically, Mueller explains in the report why he chose not to reach a conclusion on the difficult question of whether or not the president obstructed justice. Mueller notes that well before he was appointed special counsel, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel had concluded that “the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive to perform its constitutionally assigned function.” Mueller then offered a constitutional rationale for this restriction, observing that reaching a conclusion about whether the president’s conduct was criminal would “potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential conduct.” In short, Mueller believed that, currently, the question of whether the president obstructed justice is, as a constitutional matter, for Congress and the voters to decide, not the special counsel. He believed that his duty was not to decide whether the president’s conduct met the legal standard of obstruction of justice, as that standard was only relevant if he could indict a sitting president. And he did not think he could. Rather, his duty was to—as he put it—“preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available” and to serve the bodies who are empowered by our Constitution to hold the president accountable: Congress and the voters. And both of those bodies require honestly presented facts, which Mueller provided. But Mueller may have had another, unstated goal. He may have wished to restore the reputation of the DOJ as an apolitical body of professional prosecutors whose mandate is to find facts and hold individuals responsible for their acts in an impartial way. Over the past three years, the DOJ has been in the political crosshairs. When James Comey decided not to charge Hillary Clinton for using an unsecured email server, instead issuing a statement about her culpability, both the left and the right accused him of partisanship (itself a fairly good indication he wasn’t being partisan at all). When, just weeks before the election, Comey informed the public that he had found additional information that required the probe be reopened, the Democrats again accused him of foul play. Conversely, when Rod Rosenstein—who was in charge of the Russia investigation because of Jeff Sessions’ recusal—appointed a special counsel, there were accusations that Rosenstein was not a true Republican, and when he chose to share documents with House Republicans, he was accused by the left of being a partisan player. And, of course, there were the past two years of endless presidential tweets, denouncing the investigation into Russia’s election meddling as a “witch hunt” by a gang of 12 (or 13, or 18 … the number kept changing) “angry Democrats.” In this climate, Mueller may have realized that offering a conclusion regarding obstruction of justice would inevitably trigger additional accusations that the special counsel was, like everyone else, playing for political advantage. By exercising the restraint needed to stay out of this fray, Mueller managed to deliver facts without exposing his investigation to partisan accusations, thus preserving the legitimacy of an agency that is critical to American democracy. It is thus no surprise that Mueller did not appear at Barr’s press conference on Thursday, which many have criticized as both misleading and an act of partisan loyalty instead of professionalism. Attorneys general will come and go, though some will be perceived as independent actors, while others will be seen as seeking to serve as their presidents’ personal attorneys. But Mueller has reminded us that behind these political appointees is a department of career prosecutors whose job is to uncover and present the truth, without fear or favor. This task should be a simple one, but it is necessary to the integrity of our institutions. For the manner in which he fulfilled this task, the American people owe Robert Mueller a great debt of gratitude. Support our journalism

Robert Caro’s Working: Why does the Lyndon Johnson biographer overlook LBJ’s misogyny?,slate.com,Joshua Kendall,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/lyndon-johnson-robert-caro-affairs-misogyny.html,"Jeopardy! ’s Latest Champion Isn’t Just Winning the Game. He’s Changing It. About five years ago, I placed a call to Mary Margaret Wiley, who served as President Lyndon Johnson’s personal secretary from 1954 to 1962. I was writing a chapter on LBJ for my book First Dads: Parenting and Politics From George Washington to Barack Obama , and I figured that Wiley could shed some light on Johnson’s relationships with his daughters, Lynda and Luci. As soon as I identified myself as a biographer, Wiley shot back, “Do you want the dirt?” “No,” I replied, “I am interested in talking to you about how LBJ interacted with his children.” Without further ado, Wiley, who died last fall at the age of 85, hung up the phone. My interview was over before I could pose a single question. Puzzled about her remark, I turned to LBJ: Architect of American Ambition by Randall Woods. Wiley did not speak with Woods either, but he learned a lot about her by talking with her successor, Marie Fehmer, who worked for Johnson from 1962 to 1969. In her interview with Woods, Fehmer said that Wiley and Johnson had had a long affair. And Fehmer also admitted that LBJ had tried to seduce her. In November 1962, just a few months after she took over for Wiley, Johnson offered to set Fehmer up in an apartment in New York City, if she would agree to have his child—a proposal she politely declined. So the “dirt” that Wiley was alluding to likely had something to do with the fact that our 36 th president was a sexual predator who preyed on his secretaries. As noted by Woods and a few other Johnson chroniclers—say, biographer Robert Dallek and longtime aide George Reedy—he also repeatedly groped his female staffers. Presidential speechwriter Horace Busby reported that once, while he was seated in the back seat of a car, he saw Johnson grab a woman under her skirt with one hand while driving with the other. This unreflective use of the misogynistic term bimbo is disturbing. Surprisingly, in the first four volumes of The Years of Lyndon Johnson , the definitive chronicle of LBJ’s life and career, Robert Caro says nary a word about the president’s predatory behavior. (He is now finishing up the fifth and final volume.) In his new book Working , a primer on his approach to biography, Caro provides his rationale. His magnum opus, Caro explains, says little about “the many women with whom Lyndon Johnson had had sex … because none of them seemed to have any significance to him personally or to have any connection with his political or governmental activities.” The 83-year-old Caro also explains why he covers just two of LBJ’s affairs in detail—with Alice Glass, the wife of Johnson’s mentor, Charles Marsh, and with California congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas. As Caro notes, these women were political players in their own right: “Alice Glass was in truth not just another bimbo … [she] had a political mind that made her advice on politics worth listening to, so much so that there were moments when her advice was decisive in Lyndon Johnson’s decisions.” This unreflective use of the misogynistic term bimbo is disturbing, especially in the midst of the #MeToo movement. After all, bimbo was injected into the political lexicon by Bill Clinton’s aide Betsey Wright in the early 1990s—a move that she now deeply regrets. As the Arkansas governor was gearing up for his first White House bid, Wright compiled a list of all the women with whom Clinton had had a sexual encounter of one sort or another; the campaign needed to be ready to respond if any of these women ever talked to the press—or, to use her infamous words, in the case of “bimbo eruptions.” For Wright, the shame for these encounters always fell upon the women (say, lounge singer, Gennifer Flowers) rather than upon her boss. And Wright was never bothered by the fact that some of these “bimbos” (say, Paula Jones or Juanita Broaddrick) had credible stories to tell, not of consensual sex, but of harassment or even rape. How exactly does Caro address LBJ’s relationships with women other than his wife, Lady Bird, in The Years of Lyndon Johnson ? From the get-go, Caro is clear that LBJ’s deep insecurity affected his sex life. In The Path to Power , he introduces readers to “Jumbo,” the name that Johnson gave his male member. Caro observes that in college, Johnson liked to boast of many lovers, telling his brother, Sam, “Well, I gotta take ol’ Jumbo here and give him some exercise. I wonder who I’ll fuck tonight.” But as Caro notes, the young Johnson exaggerated his sexual exploits to the point of fabrication. In the next volume, Means of Ascent , we learn about Johnson’s intense connection with Alice Glass, with whom he began an affair in 1937, three years after his marriage. Caro stresses Glass’ intellectual heft, noting that “she possessed a political acumen so keen that the toughest Texas politicians enjoyed talking politics with her.” Glass longed to be Johnson’s wife, but he was unwilling to court the political suicide that a divorce would entail. Caro also notes that Johnson did not shy away from cheating on Glass with still other women—but these women go nameless. At the beginning of Master of the Senate , Caro describes the affair with Helen Gahagan Douglas, which lasted from 1944 until about 1949. Their bond, he emphasizes, also had strong political roots. He quotes Douglas, who said that a “mutual admiration of Franklin Roosevelt” is what drew them to each other. In Working , Caro emphasizes that his books are better classified as studies in political power than as biographies and that he is eager to show the effect of that power on ordinary Americans. Of Robert Moses, he writes, “I just couldn’t write the book about the great highway builder—couldn’t outline it, even—without showing the human cost of what he had done. There really was no choice involved.” Yet Caro ignores that one of the prime movers of LBJ’s ambition was to exert more power over women—so that he could have more success in his attempts to exercise “Jumbo.” As George Reedy puts it, “Sex to Johnson was part of the spoils of victory.” As Robert Dallek reports, throughout his career in elective office, Johnson “wanted beautiful women working for him and viewed them as fair game.” Dallek adds that Johnson, who would boast to his White House aides that he had “more women by accident than Kennedy ever had on purpose,” would not hesitate to use the Oval Office as a site for sexual activity. While Caro does briefly allude to Johnson’s harassing demands upon his female staffers—such as his insistence that they lose weight—he tosses these comments into a brief section on how LBJ emotionally abused everyone who worked for him, both men and women. Remarkably, Caro neglects to mention how LBJ repeatedly invaded the physical boundaries of his female employees by groping them. This curious omission by America’s preeminent biographer, whose work is otherwise so thorough and sensitive, points to the depth of the problem that the #MeToo movement is trying to redress—that the sexual violence endured by generations of working women has long been nearly completely buried. In the introduction to The Path to Power , Caro identifies a dark thread that runs through Johnson’s life, which he defines as “a hunger for power in its most naked form, for power not to improve the lives of others, but to manipulate and dominate them, to bend them to his will.” Perhaps nowhere is this cruel streak more salient than in Johnson’s relationships with his female staffers. That this exhaustive chronicler who writes so movingly of Johnson’s other character flaws overlooks his virulent misogyny is startling—and points to a long-standing blind spot not just in presidential biography but in the culture at large.

"Elizabeth Warren's ""Reaganomics"" Republican history.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-reaganomics-republican-history.html,"ISIS Claims Responsibility for Sri Lanka Attack. Should We Believe Them? On Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren introduced a plan to provide free public college and cancel a large portion of existing student debt. It’s another big policy proposal from the candidate who can’t stop coming up with them . As Politico noted recently , though, in a well-reported piece you might have missed because it was published during the Mueller speculation tornado, left-leaning policy was not always Warren’s “thing.” In fact, the icon of unapologetically populist wonkery used to be a Republican—and one who shared Ronald Reagan’s economic worldview at that. That’s relevant not just because it’s, like, interesting when people switch parties and change their minds, but because Warren’s greatest perceived weakness as a candidate is that she’s a snobby Massachusetts law professor who won’t be able to resonate with Joe Six Pack, who thinks she’s a total nag , some uptight teacher telling him what to do, and if he needed someone to do that he’d just ask his wife , am I right? Warren makes an effort to undermine this stereotype by centering her campaign message around her upbringing in working-class Oklahoma but doesn’t play up the fact that, as Politico writes, that upbringing involved her adoption of what you’d now call some very red-state political beliefs:
Katrina Harry, one of Warren’s best friends in high school in Oklahoma, remembers that she and Warren “talked politics a lot, taxes and welfare and such, and I was just a flaming liberal back then.” Harry adds, “Liz was a diehard conservative in those days.” We’re not talking about a brief high-school infatuation with Barry Goldwater , either: Warren’s apparent adoption of free-market conservatism persisted into her work as a law professor studying regulatory issues:
In 1980, one of Warren’s first papers as a full-time professor at the University of Houston took on one of the most divisive political issues of the time: utilities. A decade of energy crises and nearly unprecedented price hikes had made government-sanctioned monopolies a popular target for populist politicians. … In her paper, however, Warren argued that utility companies were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be institutionalized to avoid “regulatory lag,” in spite of consumer advocate concerns. Warren has talked and written about becoming actively involved in partisan politics after she started researching bankruptcy rules and decided that the Democratic Party was more supportive of the consumer-friendly policy changes that she became convinced were necessary. (She first registered as a Democrat in 1996, when she was studying bankruptcy law for a Bill Clinton–appointed federal commission.) But she has generally not volunteered that her previous work adhered to what Politico describes as a “Reaganomics”-style theories popular in legal-economics circles at the time; she told the site in a (present-day) interview that she never thought of herself as a conservative per se and that Gerald Ford was the last Republican presidential nominee she voted for. It makes some sense that Warren would have downplayed the Republican side of her personal political background when she was a relatively unknown figure running as a progressive in Massachusetts: Party-switchers often face intra-party criticism from those who are skeptical that they have a deep understanding of their new party’s worldview. (It’s simply also true that she was never active in Republican electoral politics.) In 2020 there is absolutely no danger that Elizabeth Warren will be accused of not being fully committed to progressive policy goals. But it is 100 percent certain that if she’s the Democratic nominee, she’ll be accused of being “out of touch” with the concerns of white working-class swing voters in the Midwest. Her political history seems like an opportune way to undermine those charges. Ronald Reagan himself famously won over many former Democrats in the Rust Belt and elsewhere with his personal story of having been a New Deal Democrat who changed parties because conditions around him changed . Perhaps 40 years later, with conditions having changed again , another humble child of the heartland who moved to the coast to make her name will argue the same case in reverse."
"Stephen Moore, Trump’s Pick for Fed, Once Wrote Multiple Columns Complaining About Women Participating in Sports",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-fed-stephen-moore-sexism-sports.html,"Mueller Clearly Thinks Trump Could Be Charged Once He’s Out of Office An economic commentator whom President Donald Trump has picked to fill one of the two open seats on the Federal Reserve Board wrote multiple columns in the early 2000s that railed against female sports commentators, female athletes, and the concept of pay parity in professional sports, CNN reported Monday. Stephen Moore made these points in columns for the conservative magazine National Review. While it’s true that some of his comments wouldn’t have looked out of place on many early sports blogs—posts for which some authors have since apologized for the sexism they casually promoted—Moore told CNN that his articles were satire. “This was a spoof. I have a sense of humor.” We’ll leave it up to the reader to decide whether you find the columns funny. First, from a 2000 column titled “ Battle of the Sexes ”:
Have you seen the latest Nike ad? A woman athlete makes a plea for pay equity in sports. She pleads to the camera: “Don’t we play as hard, sweat as hard, practice as hard, as the men? But we aren’t paid as much.” Ahh, the injustice of it all! No doubt sales of women’s sneakers will skyrocket in coming months.
If there is an injustice in tennis, it’s that women like Martina Hingis and Monica Seles make millions of dollars a year, even though there are hundreds of men at the collegiate level (assuming their schools haven’t dropped the sport) who could beat them handily. Yet these men make nothing. He hits a different note about gender dynamics in a jokey 2001 column about March Madness:
When Allison and I got married the hoops ground rules were already well established: She’s not allowed to talk to me during the NCAA tournament. Sometimes she slips up and pesters me by saying, “Steve, take out the garbage please.” And I will respond: “That’s funny, I didn’t think it was April yet.”
[The author’s son] was delivered in the middle of an Indiana-Temple game, a real nailbiter. I remember the game vividly because I kept running back and forth between the delivery room and the hospital TV room. The surly nurse kept asking me: “Mr. Moore, is this an inconvenient time for your wife to have this baby.” I told her, with all honesty, that the timing could have been a lot better. Admittedly, this column is more on the self-deprecating side. But lest you start to think his actual intention is only to mock his own participation in childish and tired gender tropes, he goes on to add in a dig against female announcers and commentators. (“Is nothing sacred? This is like having wives attend a bachelor party.”) He revisited the same theme (“keep those three crying kids out of my hair for the next three weeks,” he told his wife during March Madness) in a column the next year and went on to list ways to prevent March Madness from “being ruined by reformers” in ways that “are simply un-American.” One of those ways was to keep women out of the whole thing:
This year they allowed a woman ref a men’s NCAA game. … Is there no area in life where men can take vacation from women? What’s next? Women invited to bachelor parties? Women in combat? (Oh yeah, they’ve done that already.)
Here’s the rule change I propose: No more women refs, no women announcers, no women beer venders, no women anything. There is, of course, an exception to this rule. Women are permitted to participate, if and only if, they look like Bonnie Bernstein. The fact that Bonnie knows nothing about basketball is entirely irrelevant. He also extrapolates that message (one he repeats in a 2003 column) to the larger world of sports:
And while I’m venting on the subject, here’s another travesty: in playground games and rec leagues these days, women now feel free to play with the men — uninvited in almost every case. … It can get pretty competitive and, well, vulgar. I think I speak for almost all men when I respectfully tell the ladies that we don’t want you anywhere around during these precious moments of male bonding. This last bit of advice, apparently, led to some backlash, which he noted the next month in another column: “Several readers (all women) have called and e-mailed complaining about my last column as ‘sexist’ because I said that women shouldn’t be permitted to ref the men’s game. Their retort was: ‘Well then why should men ref the women’s games?’ Look, for all I care the women can use chimpanzees to ref their games. I hate women’s basketball.” Charming! And Moore didn’t limit himself to sports. In a column from 2000, he complained that his wife had voted for a Democrat, canceling out his own vote. “Women are sooo malleable!” he said. “No wonder there’s a gender gap.” Moore worked as an editorial board member at the Wall Street Journal after his time at the National Review, and until recently, he contributed to CNN, according to the news organization. Trump has not yet officially nominated Moore, though he said in March he plans to do so. Also on Monday, Trump announced that his other choice for a seat on the board, the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO and failed presidential candidate Herman Cain , would not be nominated after all. Cain has faced a pushback to the idea of his nomination because of sexual harassment allegations . “My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board,” Trump tweeted Monday. “I will respect his wishes. Herman is a great American who truly loves our Country!” Between Cain and Moore, Trump’s choices have shown that he is as comfortable as ever stocking the nation’s powerful institutions with men who appear to lack respect for women.

Game of Thrones: What does giant's milk taste like anyway?,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-giants-milk-tormund-giantsbane.html,"This Week’s Worst Person in Westeros: The Racist Girls of Winterfell On Game of Thrones last night, while Westeros’ dwellers used their last night in peace to sneak in a final glass of wine or roll in the hay, Tormund Giantsbane saw the perfect moment to recount a weird story from his childhood. When he was 10, the redheaded wildling says, he slew a male giant and then nursed at its wife’s teat for three months. “Thought I was her baby,” Tormund grunts, as Jaime Lannister, Davos Seaworth, and Brienne of Tarth look on awkwardly. “That’s how I got so strong. Giant’s milk.” The origin story, which also explains Tormund’s surname, derives from George R.R. Martin’s third novel A Storm of Swords, in which Tormund reveals a similar history while traveling with Jon Snow. In that version, Tormund explains that, as a boy, he once sliced open a sleeping giant’s stomach and crawled inside— The Revenant -style —for warmth. The giant awoke to confuse Tormund for “her babe,” and proceeded to suckle him “for three whole moons,” he says, adding, “There’s times I miss the taste o’ giant’s milk.” While Game of Thrones does feature actual giants on both page and screen, it’s unclear whether we’re meant to take Tormund’s story as real or invented—especially given his other nickname: Tall-talker. But veracity aside, we’re curious about one detail from the story: What, exactly, does giant’s milk taste like? If Tormund misses it so much—and is nostalgic enough to relay the memory to an audience that includes his crush, Brienne—the milk must be pretty good, right?

Aside from the fast food chain Wendy’s—who chimed in on Twitter to clarify to absolutely no one that their “Frosty is not made of Giant’s milk”—our biggest clue lies in a 19 th century folktale from the Grimm brothers called The Young Giant . The tale tells of a very small peasant boy (born the size of a thumb) who grows large and supernaturally strong after being kidnapped and nursed by a male giant. In the tale, the giant’s milk is presented as a substance of both reverence and fear: While it bestows the boy with extraordinary vigor, once he returns home to his peasant parents, they don’t recognize him and mistake him for a dangerous stranger. The boy, meanwhile, is no longer satisfied by human food and is forced to leave in search of extra nourishment. Presumably, this is due to his new size—after being reared by a giant, he’s too big for ordinary meals to sustain him. But if he was fulfilled by giant’s milk for so many years, it does suggest that the milk has a magical nourishing quality. ( Like Soylent, but good? ) Another clue as to the nature giant’s milk could lie in giant’s food , as diets do generally have a major effect on breast milk flavor. But in Game of Thrones , it’s not totally clear what giants eat. Along with rumors that they feast on human flesh, there are Old Nan’s fables of giants mixing blood into their morning porridge and gorging on bulls whole. Fortunately, it’s likely that these were only tall tales. Wun Wun, the giant we do meet, doesn’t fit the scary descriptions. Given the White Walkers’ imminent arrival, we may never receive further insight into Tormund’s bizarre origin story, nor into the giant’s milk mystery. Then again, with Tormund, you never know—particularly if he continues to gulp down whatever’s inside that ivory horn. The Game of Thrones TV Club Recaps Season 8

Netflix isn't killing people's sex lives.,slate.com,Shannon Palus,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/streaming-television-could-only-be-good-for-the-birth-rate.html,"A Netflix Adult Animation Q&A even had condoms on hand. (Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Netflix) Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images Humans are like rare zoo pandas—we mustmate for the future of our species, and yet it’s so hard to get the conditions just right. That’s what I thought while reading the latest entry in the “technology is bad for us” chronicles, an article in the Wall Street Journal that blames declining birth rates on Netflix. The premise of the piece: the streaming platform is so entertaining that people, even those who would like to have babies, sometimes watch Netflix with their partners instead of having procreative sex. Even though the author, Shalini Ramachandran, correctly notes that the link between streaming and reduced baby-making is largely anecdotal, it is nonetheless confusingly framed as a mood-killer so large that it’s contributing to the U.S. birth rate being at a 30-year low . Why is streaming so much worse for our libidos than old fashioned TV? According to the piece, it’s partly because back in the pre-Netflix days, human had the helpful mating assistance of … advertisements for services and goods. Now, “there are no commercials where you could look over and say, ‘Honey, you look cute tonight,’ ” Jean Twenge, who has made a rallying cry out of questionably linking screens to the ills of the world , told the WSJ. Yes—ads for mid-size cars and Swiffers are apparently the foreplay instigator we’re all now missing out on. You don’t need to take Twenge’s word for it, though. The piece is premised partly on the results of a survey of more than a thousand people the WSJ completed with Survey Monkey (which, it should be noted, focused on sex, not procreation). A quarter of respondents said they have sometimes turned down being intimate with a partner in favor of streaming television. Would those people have also occasionally turned down sex for bunny-ear-antenna broadcasting, or other pre-Netflix activities, like going to the movies, enjoying a hike, or people-watching at a cocktail bar? Because the survey does not ask, it’s impossible to say. But it stands to reason that even among the heterosexually coupled trying to have a child, people will sometimes choose to spend their time doing … other things. The WSJ’s own stats also seem to undermine, rather than support, the story’s thesis. While 12 percent of survey respondents overall said that television streaming habits were leading to less sex, 70 percent noted no effect, and 17 percent said that their streaming habits led to more sex. To be fair, for folks who were married or in a domestic partnership—presumably, those most likely to be having sex to make a family—an equal number of people said their streaming habits were helping their sex lives as said streaming was hurting sex. But the vast majority of couples said watching streamed TV was quality time with a partner. You’d think that would have a positive effect on a relationship, though it’s hard to know how that connects to reproductive choices, as the survey wasn’t limited to couples trying to conceive. All of this means that it’s hard to extrapolate the results of hypothetical Netflix-induced-sex-suppression—the story is mostly a handful of anecdotes from couples frustrated by Netflix’s presence in their lives—to the birth rate. But if anything, it seems that for most people, Netflix is probably bolstering the amount of intercourse that’s happening. “Netflix and Chill” exists as a euphemism for hooking up for a reason: it places two people in the same private room, often beneath the same blanket, in low lighting, with low stakes for missing the activity at hand. You zipped past a plot point because you were too busy canoodling? Rewind, or, just catch up later. I’d also argue that the automatic next episode feature, which Twenge derides for not letting couples have a break in which they could commence doing it, makes it so the atmosphere stays consistent for however long you need to “hang out.” Nothing kills the mood like an abrupt shift from Friends re-runs to the 11 o’clock news.

House Judiciary Committee issues subpoena for former White House counsel Don McGahn.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/house-judiciary-committee-issues-subpoena-nadler-former-white-house-counsel-don-mcgahn.html,"Mueller Clearly Thinks Trump Could Be Charged Once He’s Out of Office The House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for former White House counsel Don McGahn on Monday, the first to be issued post–Mueller report to the Trump White House as it was configured at key moments of the investigation. McGahn was a vital figure during his two years in the Trump administration and is seen as a pivotal witness in any potential obstruction case against Trump. According to the Mueller report, McGahn was instructed to lie on multiple occasions in response to a January 2018 New York Times story that said Trump had called McGahn in June 2017 and ordered him to fire the special counsel on a half-baked conflict of interest charge. McGahn, who sat for extended sessions with Mueller’s investigators, said he refused to fire the special counsel and then refused to put out a false public statement demanded by Trump that denied the president had ordered him to sack the special counsel. McGahn is therefore a central player not just because of his proximity to the president and his central role in the White House, but because ordering someone to lie is a big, bright red line when it comes to obstruction of justice. Now that the Mueller report is out and the onus for any obstruction charge is clearly on Congress, it makes sense that McGahn would be among the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee’s first calls. “The Special Counsel’s report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses,” Judiciary Committee Chair Rep. Jerry Nadler said in a statement Monday. “Mr. McGahn is a critical witness to many of the alleged instances of obstruction of justice and other misconduct described in the Mueller report. His testimony will help shed further light on the President’s attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others do the same.” If the Mueller report is any indication, what McGahn has to say could spell serious trouble for Trump. “I never said to fire Mueller,” Trump told McGahn, according to McGahn’s account of the incident in the report. “I never said ‘fire.’ This story doesn’t look good. You need to correct this. You’re the White House counsel.” “Did I say the word ‘fire’?” Trump asked. “What you said is, ‘Call Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can’t be the special counsel,’ ” McGahn replied. The White House did not claim executive or attorney-client privilege over McGahn’s testimony, although it’s unclear if such a claim would have held up in court. There is legal precedent that federal lawyers’ communications are not protected and can be compelled to cooperate with federal grand jury requests for information. McGahn is scheduled to appear before Congress on May 21."
Organizers of the Google walkout say they’ve been threatened with demotion.,slate.com,April Glaser,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/google-walkout-demotion-retaliation.html,"Stop Saying We Have 12 Years Left to Address Climate Change On the first day of November last year, some 20,000 Google employees at more than 40 offices across the world staged a walkout protesting how the company had dealt with serious accusations of sexual assault and harassment and what many employees described as a culture of impunity for executives. The event was planned by a core group of seven organizers who work at Google. On Monday, two of those women, Meredith Whittaker and Claire Stapleton, shared examples of retaliation they’ve face from the company since on a Google-internal mailing list. Wired first reported the two were facing blowback from Google for helping to organize the protest. Stapleton is a 12-year veteran at Google. Two months after the walkout, she got word that she would be demoted and lose half of the people who report to her. “I escalated to HR and to my VP, which made things significantly worse,” Stapleton wrote in her letter. “My manager started ignoring me, my work was given to other people, and I was told to go on medical leave, even though I’m not sick.” Eventually, she hired a lawyer. After an investigation, Google decided to walk back its decision to demote her, though Stapleton says her work environment remains hostile and she regularly contemplates quitting. Whitaker, who leads Google’s Open Research Group and is the co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University, received notice that in order to stay at Google, she’d have to “abandon [her] work on AI ethics and the AI Now Institute,” according to the email. She received word of this demotion after Google announced it would cancel an A.I. ethics board. So far, labor organizing at Google hasn’t taken the shape of forming an official union, likely in part because the company has been relatively permissive with allowing employees to vocally criticize and question Google’s external and internal practices. But even though Google employees aren’t unionized, under the National Labor Relations Act they’re still protected from retaliation when multiple workers address their employer about workplace conditions. Protesting an environment that’s supportive of sexual harassment may be a protected activity, meaning the two may have a legal claim, according to Steve Smith, the communications director at the California Labor Federation. The employees’ efforts so far have not gone unnoticed. The day after the walkout in November, Google agreed to stop mandating forced arbitration in cases involving accusations of sexual harassment or assault. That change didn’t apply to contractors, however, who make up about half of Google’s workforce. In December, organizers of the walkout posted a letter addressed to Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, arguing that the company’s massive contractor workforce deserve better pay and benefits. Earlier this month, Google announced that it would start requiring companies that supply its contractor workforce to provide certain benefits like paid sick days, paid parental leave, tuition reimbursement, and health care. Additionally, contractor companies, which also include cleaning and food service workers, must also pay those who work at Google at least $15 an hour."
"Pelosi tells divided Democratic caucus investigations, not impeachment are next step post-Mueller report.",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/pelosi-call-letter-investigation-not-impeachment-trump-mueller.html,"The White House Will Fight McGahn Subpoena Because His Public Testimony Could Be the Silver Bullet The public release of the Mueller report last Thursday has Democrats talking impeachment again after the possibility of ousting President Donald Trump from office before the end of his term seemed increasingly remote. Part of that was by design as the party leadership has been cautious throughout and remained so in its approach to possible impeachment proceedings after the Muller findings dropped. The party has pledged to increase the intensity of its probes into all aspects of Trump’s affairs, but on a conference call with the Democratic rank-and-file Monday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the emphasis would remain on those inquiries, rather than immediately mobilizing an effort to impeach the president. The call came after Pelosi addressed her Democratic colleagues, who are on recess at the moment, in a letter Monday outlining what she sees as the best way to proceed. “While our views range from proceeding to investigate the findings of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth,” Pelosi wrote. “As we proceed to uncover the truth and present additional needed reforms to protect our democracy, we must show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice, strictly on the presentation of fact.” Pelosi and other in the Democratic leadership have been far more reluctant to pursue Trump via impeachment based on the belief that the political cost of such a hearing could undermine the party’s aim of retaking seats in the Senate and the presidency in 2020. The strength of the case for obstruction of justice in the report , however, has pulled the Democrats, by sheer force of Mueller’s findings, closer to impeachment than anticipated. Pelosi, in making the case for prudence on impeachment, stressed that “it is … important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings.” For their part, Republicans have not yet arrived at a strategy of their own following the report and have been largely silent on the issue during the two-week Easter recess. An early preview of the communications strategy trialed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Monday may sound familiar to many Democrats though—move on. “Well, look, I think it’s time to move on. This investigation was about collusion, there’s no collusion, no charges brought against the president on anything else, and I think the American people have had quite enough of it,” McConnell said when questioned during a stop in Kentucky."
Why conservatives are so angry about Obama and Hillary’s use of “Easter worshippers” after the Sri Lanka attacks.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/easter-worshippers-obama-hillary-conservative-backlash.html,"• The Jewish Telegraphic Agency: “ Homeless Couple Attacks Synagogue Worshippers in Buenos Aires ” I would argue that it takes a true savant of exquisitely attuned grievance collection to read an individual reference to “Easter worshippers” as an attempt to avoid acknowledging Christianity. Easter is the most important holiday in the Christian calendar. “Easter” has no other meaning. As a celebration, it is far less secularly degraded than Christmas. Bunnies aside, it is basically inaccessible as a holiday to anyone uncomfortable with acknowledging the story of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. If anything, “Easter worshippers” puts extra emphasis on the religious nature of the attack by pointing out that it happened on a day of special spiritual meaning to victims. It implies: Not only did you attack Christians, you did it today of all days. There are arguments for preferring “Christians” to “Easter worshippers” in this context. Southern Baptist writer and professor Denny Burk argued that persecuted Christians may prefer the straightforward term Christians because it highlights the faith they are willing to die for. That would be a stronger argument if Obama and other Democrats had used a term like Sri Lankans , without any religious meaning. But again, they did not do that. They used a term that is inextricably associated with Christianity. (In other contexts, in fact, conservative Christians make the point that not all holiday churchgoers are “real” Christians. As early-20 th -century evangelist Billy Sunday once put it: “Going to church doesn’t make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile.”) By my count, Beto O’Rourke is the only major 2020 presidential candidate who used the word Christian in his tweet lamenting the attacks . That includes Trump, who mentioned the “ attack on churches and hotels ” but did not as of yet name the religious group who might have been worshipping in those churches. Of course, “Easter worshippers” was never the real problem. The meat of the outrage is not that Democrats are afraid of the word Christian or that “Easter worshippers” is somehow an inaccessibly confusing phrase. The real implication is that Democrats supposedly have an insufficient concern for Christians as a persecuted identity group. This is an old theme: Obama came under attack in 2015 for failing to mention the religion of victims of a terrorist attack in Kenya, for example. He was regularly criticized by the same cohort for failing to use the exact term Islamic terrorism . As Family Research Council president Tony Perkins put it at the time, “When it comes to persecuted Christians, not only do we not have action, we rarely get words.” President Donald Trump has been more willing to offer “words.” He has spoken publicly about attacks on Christians in Nigeria , an ongoing issue that the American Christian media follows closely. The first draft of his 2017 “refugee ban” carved out exceptions for religious minorities from the Middle East, which he promoted on the Christian Broadcasting Network as a favor to Christians: “If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible. … And I thought it was very, very unfair,” he said . Trump’s policies have actually made it significantly harder for persecuted Christians to enter the United States. But at least he hasn’t used the term Easter worshippers ."

Former Lakers coach Luke Walton reportedly sued by reporter for alleged sexual assault.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/former-lakers-coach-luke-walton-reportedly-sued-by-reporter-for-alleged-sexual-assault.html,"The White House Will Fight McGahn Subpoena Because His Public Testimony Could Be the Silver Bullet A female sports reporter is suing new Sacramento Kings coach Luke Walton for sexual assault, according to TMZ. The site reports that journalist Kelli Tennant filed suit against the former Los Angeles Lakers based on an incident that occurred before Walton was the Lakers head coach. Walton got the Lakers coaching job in April 2016. According to court documents, Tennant alleges the 39-hear-old Walton forced himself on her in a Santa Monica hotel room where the two were meeting to discuss a book Tennant was writing. The pair had a working relationship and she says she was hoping to ask Walton to write the foreword. From TMZ:
In the suit, Tennant says when she arrived at Walton’s hotel, he convinced her to come up to his room so they could discuss the book. She claims when they got up to his room, Walton suddenly pinned her to the bed, placing his hips and legs over her body. In the docs, Tennant claims Walton then began forcing kisses on her neck, face and chest. She claims she screamed for him to stop and tried to free herself, but he held her down, groped her breasts and groin, and rubbed his erection on her leg. She says he eventually relented and let her get up from the bed, but as she was walking towards the door to leave he grabbed her from behind and again forced his body up against hers. Tennant says she didn’t report the alleged assault at the time and was forced to interact with Walton while on the job. Walton, she says, repeatedly came on to her making sexually suggestive comments."

Iannucci’s verbally dazzling style of comedy often revolves around forcing characters who hate each other to be stuck in the same room, No Exit- style—meetings, plane flights, more meetings—and then letting them insult each other as elaborately and obscenely as possible . And “on a cruise ship surrounded by the deadly vacuum of outer space” is the most “stuck in the same room with people I loathe” that it’s theoretically possible for a character to achieve, so expect fireworks. The cast also sounds exceptional: Hugh Laurie, who’s been killing it on Veep , will star as the captain of the space cruise ship Avenue 5 . The Book of Mormon’ s Josh Gad will play an egocentric billionaire who runs hotels and health clubs and the cruise ship Avenue 5 ; Suzy Nakamura from Dr. Ken will play his right hand woman. Gad’s other employees include Zach Woods from Silicon Valley as the ship’s head of customer service , Nikki Amuka-Bird as the head of mission control on Earth , and Lenora Crichlow as the ship’s second engineer . The Thick of It ’s Rebecca Front will play one of the passengers. Best of all, judging from character description alone, is that Star Trek: Voyager alum Ethan Phillips will play Spike Martin, a hard-drinking former astronaut who falsely claims to have been “ the first Canadian to land on Mars .” Iannucci, who directed the pilot, will serve as executive producer, along with Simon Blackwell, Kevin Loader, Tony Roche, and Will Smith. There’s no timetable for Avenue 5 yet. Iannucci is currently finishing up a feature, The Personal Life of David Copperfield , an adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel featuring Dev Patel as Copperfield and a cast that includes Laurie, Tilda Swinton, Peter Capaldi, Gwendoline Christie, and Ben Wishaw.

Jimmy Fallon got ten Avengers: Endgame cast members to recap the entire MCU to the tune of a Billy Joel song.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/fallon-avengers-endgame-billy-joel-start-fire-cheadle-evans-downey-gillan-gurira-hemsworth-larson-renner-rudd-ruffalo.html,"Some men just want to watch the world burn. NBC You probably already know how you will feel about a Tonight Show video in which Jimmy Fallon and ten actors from the Marvel Cinematic Universe recap the events of the aforementioned cinematic universe to the tune of Billy Joel’s 1989 boomer anthem “We Didn’t Start the Fire.” You are exactly right, and here is the proof: Wow! Let’s take a moment to consider the many ways in which this is a brilliant concept for an Avengers: Endgame promotional stunt: • The comic book staging means that the actors don’t have to be in the same place at the same time, since they’re never in the same panel together, which must have made scheduling easier.• The comic book panels also provide a seamless way to integrate footage from the movies and give the impression that many more MCU actors participated than the ten Fallon got. (Those ten for the record: Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Chris Hemsworth, Brie Larson Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd, and Mark Ruffalo.)• Even the least musical actor in the world can sing the verses of “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” because there is no melody. So definitely an enviable triumph in terms of logistics and planning. It’s also less tacky and exploitative than the original song’s music video, because Fallon had the good sense to pose in front of the S.H.I.E.L.D. and Avengers logos instead of photographs of a lynching , a summary execution , a murder , and an arms dealer . Sure, I’ll embed it: Not exploiting photographs of other human beings at the moment of their death is a low bar, but Fallon and his team cleared it. But as an actual recap of the Marvel franchise, it is at least as useless as the original Billy Joel song. Try to reverse-engineer a narrative from this verse:
War Machine, Falcon spin, Bucky Barnes is back again,
Star-Lord, Gamora too, Drax, Rocket, “I am Groot.”
Vision, Mantis, Nebula, Ultron in Sokovia,
Civil War , Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch and Spider-Man.
Doctor Strange, Ra gnarok, Henry, Janet, and the Wasp,
Black Panther in Wakanda, Shuri, Okoye, Killmonger,
Captain Marvel, Goose the cat, then flying higher, further, faster,
Thanos in Infinity War , I can’t take it anymore! “We Didn’t Start the Fire” also devolves into a list of context-free character names pretty quickly, but you still come out of it with the distinct impression that JFK was blown away. Still, it is probably better to write a musical version of The Chris Farley Show about the characters in a long-running movie franchise in order to promote the next film in that franchise than it is to do the same thing with the actual people and events of the 20 th century.

Privacy implications of the Unmanned Traffic Management system to identify drones.,slate.com,Faine Greenwood,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/drone-tracking-registry-faa-unmanned-traffic-management.html,"Do You Want to Buy a Murder Bird? Who’s flying that drone over my house, and what exactly are they looking for? Is the pilot a police officer, a search-and-rescue volunteer, or Creepy Steve from four doors down? These concerns over the origin and intention of small drones have bedeviled the drone industry for as long as it has existed. Our inability to figure out who is piloting the weird quadcopter over our neighborhoods surely has a lot to do with why so many still distrust drones . People are working on it, though. Since 2015, the FAA, NASA, and a number of industry partners have been developing something called unmanned aircraft systems traffic management , or UTM. This “ cloud-based software architecture ” would, among other things, help drones communicate with other aircraft, secure flight permissions more quickly, and even allow drones to fly beyond the “visual line of sight” (which is currently not permitted in the United States without a hard-to-get waiver ). It would also make it possible to identify drones in the air, likely via some means of electronic identification readable to people on the ground and linked to the pilot, whose information would be stored in a registry. We’ll need something like it if we want drone delivery to become a reality. But there’s one thing I’m worried about. Unlike our existing air traffic control system, traffic control for drones will rely upon private companies. Those companies will in turn be empowered to collect data on the people who use it. While we need a better way of ensuring that we can find drone pilots who break the rules, this system has the potential—if it’s not implemented carefully—to expose even law-abiding pilots’ data to unexpected or unwanted uses. It’s also a small but concerning sign of a larger movement toward privatizing government, enabling companies to gain relatively unfettered access to evermore data about our lives. The UTM system details are still being developed . It could rely on mobile phone connectivity to work (which could be a problem for areas without reliable cell service), or it might rely on direct (local) broadcast, which uses a drone’s existing radio communications signal to send out information on its location and identification to nearby receivers. Versions of this are currently being piloted across the United States, and one aspect of the system is already in beta testing. Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability allows drone pilots get superfast authorization from the FAA to fly in controlled airspace around airports. Before LAANC, getting this authorization could be a lengthy, frustrating process for drone pilots. Now, pilots can, in some cases, be cleared to fly in just a few minutes. The FAA doesn’t run the online system that pilots use to apply for LAANC authorization itself, though. Instead, it’s authorized a number of private companies to offer LAANC services, meaning that pilots must sign up for one of these companies—and share their data with the company—to use the system. How might location information might be used against activists, reporters, scientists, or other groups who use drones in their work? This public-private partnership model is probably what the larger, more complicated UTM system will look like. To implement it, the FAA and NASA are partnering with private companies including Amazon, Google, DHL, FedEx, and UPS as well as drone-oriented startups like AirMap, Project Wing, and KittyHawk. These companies will act as unmanned aircraft systems service suppliers , or as a USS. (The drone industry is, unfortunately, really into initialisms). Like in the LAANC system, they will essentially provide customers with software platforms by which they can participate in the larger UTM system. There won’t be a government-run means of connecting with UTM. The FAA authorizes these companies to collect the pilot’s name, phone number, and unmanned aircraft systems registration number, as well as information on the flight itself. But the FAA also writes that the USS company “may collect information that is not required by the FAA, and is not transmitted to the FAA.” This extra data will be subject to the privacy policies of the company itself. It could, in theory, include everything from home address and demographic information to location information, collected from either the drone itself or from the mobile phone that the drone is connected to. Defenders of the USS system will doubtless point out that there will be multiple companies in the mix, giving privacy-concerned pilots a choice about whom they sign up with. But there isn’t a guarantee that this healthy competition will last, or that any of these companies will truly be better at protecting privacy than the others. Some of the companies developing the drone UTM system are pushing for a networked, mobile-communication reliant solution to identifying drones , which would require that they be equipped with a chip and a cell service subscription to function in the system. While this system would have some real advantages, like possibly giving pilots and regulators a nationwide picture of every drone in the air at any given time, I’m not sold on it. This could be a problem for people who live in areas without mobile services, although there are proposals that might allow users to default to “local broadcast” when they’re out of range. More worrisome, this system might let companies more effectively track drone owners, in ways similar to how private companies track your mobile phone today —perhaps even when the drone isn’t actively in the air, such as when you switch it on to update the software system at home. While it’s true that my drone relies upon my iPhone to function, that doesn’t mean that I’m particularly enthused about the prospect of having two devices actively tracking my location whenever I fly it, or having to trust the mobile phone and drone companies administering the system to keep that data secure (especially in light of recent news about mobile phone companies’ cheerful willingness to sell location data to others). How might this tracking ability and location information be used against activists, reporters, scientists, or other groups who use drones in their work? Such location data could, at least in theory, be seized and then used by the government to track dissenters , or perhaps sold to individuals who want to track the locations of their political enemies. The data could also easily find its way into unauthorized hands if someone steals it or—intentionally or accidentally—leaks it. In the absence of meaningful protections against these abuses, many vulnerable drone users might decide that using the technology isn’t worth the risk, diminishing its potential to make the aerial perspective accessible to a bigger, more diverse portion of humanity. Finally, the government’s collaboration with private companies on drone tracking is another example of the privatization of services that used to be the purview of the government—including collecting data on people who use public goods, like national airspace. The Trump administration made plays at privatizing air traffic control , electricity transmission systems that are currently publicly owned, the Postal Service , and even (to some extent) the Department of Veteran Affairs. In March, we found out that FEMA unnecessarily exposed 2.3 million people’s data to an outside contractor. Currently, the government is sharing information about citizens with a number of data-driven Silicon Valley companies, including Palantir, Amazon, and NEC. Or consider the privacy concerns over the Real ID Act , which will centralize driver’s license databases across the country. The system is being developed as a collaboration between the federal government and private contractors, and there is considerable uncertainty over who has access to what data. Both government and corporations, sometimes in active collaboration with one another, will continue to accumulate ever-larger amounts of information about us, from our drone-use habits to our political preferences. But partnerships between the public sector and private industry don’t have to be exploitative, and they don’t have to rely upon the relentless monetization of data. We can—and should—push for a future in which our regulatory system better protects our privacy. We should also push for companies who work with the government to do a better, more transparent job of protecting our data. That’s where drone companies, which are still relatively new, could set themselves apart from the bigger technological pack. Instead of leaning into stereotypes about the inherent creepiness of the technology, they could, as they develop the UTM system, set an example for everyone else, by protecting their users’ data and declining to monetize it."
"New Mexico militia's leader said the group was training to assassinate Obama, Clinton.",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/new-mexico-militia-training-assassination.html,"I Watched All Five Hours of the CNN Town Halls, and Actually I Don’t Regret It The leader of a right-wing militia in the news recently over allegations it forcefully detained asylum-seekers at the southern border in order to hand them over to Border Patrol agents reportedly once said his group was training to assassinate President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and George Soros, an FBI agent said in an affidavit filed Saturday in support of the man’s arrest. Larry Mitchell Hopkins, also known as Johnny Horton Jr., was arrested Saturday on charges of possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon and appeared in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on Monday. He is currently the only member of the militia group to face any charges. The affidavit from the FBI agent came from reports to the agency’s public access line in October 2017 of “alleged militia extremist activity” in Flora Vista, New Mexico, according to NBC News . Hopkins “allegedly made the statement” that his group, the United Constitutional Patriots, was training for the assassinations “because of these individuals’ support of Antifa,” but it’s not clear to whom he made the statements. Hopkins’ attorney denied those allegations. After the October 2017 calls to the tip line, the FBI went to Hopkins’ home and seized nine firearms, which Hopkins said belonged to his wife. At the time, he already had felony convictions for possession of a loaded firearm and felony possession of a weapon, as well as a conviction for impersonating law enforcement. Hopkins’ lawyer suggested to NBC News that his client was only now being arrested from the 2017 search because of the attention being paid to the militia group in the press. Videos of the militia group stopping families of migrants at the border, sometimes at gunpoint, enraged immigrant and civil rights groups, who have claimed that the detainment amounted to kidnapping. The group has claimed to have captured up to 5,600 migrants and held them for Customs and Border Protection officers. According to CBS News , the owner of the land where the group had been camping kicked the group off his property on Monday. Hopkins faces a maximum of 10 years in prison."
John Roberts’ backstage Supreme Court campaign for the death penalty.,slate.com,Steven V. Mazie,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/john-roberts-supreme-court-death-penalty-jurisprudence-savage.html,"The White House Will Fight McGahn Subpoena Because His Public Testimony Could Be the Silver Bullet Tensions over capital punishment are high at the Supreme Court. The most recent quarrel came in the wee hours of April 12, when the five conservative justices rankled the four liberals by giving the green light to Christopher Lee Price’s execution in Alabama. In an indignant dissent opening internal court politics to public view, Justice Stephen Breyer lamented the majority’s unwillingness to discuss the case in conference the next day. Ordinarily measured, Breyer wrote that the majority’s middle-of-the-night rebuff of Price (who sought a less-painful execution method) abandoned “basic principles of fairness.” The razor-thin majority determining the fate of Price and several other death row inmates in recent months has been anchored—with deceptive quiet—by Chief Justice John Roberts. With Justice Anthony Kennedy now retired, Roberts is the new man in the middle. He isn’t the most enthusiastic cheerleader for the ultimate penalty on the court—that honor belongs to the trio of Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas—and rarely flashes his cards in capital punishment cases. But his votes are shaping a newly savage jurisprudence. Joan Biskupic’s The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts , a deeply researched new biography of the jurist, helps piece together Roberts’ approach to capital punishment cases. It includes a cautionary tale from 1981, when Roberts, then 26, was clerking for William Rehnquist—the man whom he would eventually succeed as the chief justice. In a death penalty appeal that year, then-Justice Rehnquist vented his frustration with criminals having “so many bites at the apple.” Long delays between conviction and execution, he wrote, make a “mockery of our criminal justice system.” Biskupic notes that Justice Lewis Powell privately told the chief justice his irascible solo opinion was “misguided”—an admonition that went unheeded. In 1990, Rehnquist would go on to lobby for a Republican bill drastically limiting appeals for capital convicts. Defying a judicial norm against entering the political fray, Rehnquist said the measure would fix a regime that “verges on the chaotic.” Nineteen years later, there is little reason to think the new chief is any more tolerant of extended capital appeals than Rehnquist, whom Roberts replaced upon his death in 2005. But the 17 th chief justice’s style and strategy are starkly different. Whereas Rehnquist had no compunction about writing testy capital punishment opinions, Roberts is a model of circumspection. During his 14 years at the helm, according to Adam Feldman of Empirical SCOTUS , Chief Justice Roberts has publicly dissented only four times from a decision to block an execution in response to a request for an emergency stay. In argued merits cases, he has kept his quill dry on all but a few occasions. In 18 death penalty rulings since 2005, he has chosen to write opinions only four times: one majority opinion (in a capital case outside the Eighth Amendment context), one plurality opinion (with two other justices), one concurrence , and one dissent . Roberts does occasionally emerge from the shadows to broadcast a willingness to break with his fellow conservatives on death penalty cases. Perhaps the chief justice’s most powerful role, when he is in the majority, is opinion assignment. So it is remarkable that only once, over a decade ago, did Roberts assign himself a substantive death penalty opinion. Since that 2008 foray in Baze v. Rees, a decision upholding lethal injection against a claim it is “cruel and unusual,” the chief has been happy to let his colleagues navigate the treacherous waters of the death penalty debate. He has assigned some opinions of the court to centrist justices like Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Anthony Kennedy. But he has passed off dissents from left-leaning rulings to his conservative colleagues, as in 2008’s Kennedy v. Louisiana (barring capital punishment for rape) and 2014’s Hall v. Florida (regarding standards for assessing a convict’s intellectual disability). Justice Alito wrote both of those dissents; Roberts joined them. And in pivotal 5–4 rulings favoring the conservatives, he has let firebrands Alito and Gorsuch take the lead in edging the court further to the right. A recent tilt came at the start of April, when Gorsuch wrote a 5–4 opinion that shocked many for its callousness. A Missouri man with cavernous hemangioma, a rare medical condition, had asked the justices to switch his execution method from lethal injection to nitrogen gas. Lying on a gurney and being injected with a lethal drug cocktail, Russell Bucklew’s doctors explained, would cause tumors in his throat to burst, flooding his airway with blood and suffocating him. Gorsuch, writing for his four conservative brethren, did not just turn down Bucklew’s request—he repudiated him for waging a “headlong attack” on the court’s precedents and erected what Breyer properly called an “insurmountable hurdle” for inmates seeking a humane mechanism for their executions. The harsh overtones of Gorsuch’s opinion did not flow from Roberts’ pen. But the chief signed his name to the ruling. Meanwhile, in a highly controversial pair of orders this year regarding an inmate’s right to clergy in the execution chamber, Roberts kept himself well out of the spotlight, taking advantage of the anonymity the court’s so-called shadow docket affords reticent justices. We know—because four justices noted their disagreement—that Roberts rejected a Muslim man’s right to an imam at his side in February despite the availability of a minister for Christian inmates. In an unsigned ruling, the majority offered a thin justification for the decision, which Kagan called “profoundly wrong.” When a Buddhist inmate came to the court with an identical claim in March, an apparently chastened majority granted it. Thomas and Gorsuch noted their disagreement with the court’s ruling in favor of the Buddhist man, and in a brief concurrence, Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained why he saw the Muslim and Buddhist inmates’ cases differently. But Alito and Roberts gave no indication of how they voted. Again, the chief kept himself safely under the radar. Roberts does occasionally emerge from the shadows to broadcast a willingness to break with his fellow conservatives on death penalty cases. In February, he joined the Supreme Court’s liberal justices to give an inmate with dementia another chance to challenge his death sentence and chastised a Texas court for sending an intellectually disabled convict back to death row. But there is less than meets the eye in these leftward feints: Both cases simply involved the application of a precedent a lower court had ignored. Neither move should obscure the chief justice’s hard line on the death penalty evinced in hundreds of other votes. Indeed, when the court decided the precedents behind the two February cases 12 and two years ago, respectively, he was in dissent both times. Shrewd moves by Chief Justice John Roberts in the death penalty docket seem to bear out Biskupic’s conclusion that—despite his self-description in his confirmation hearings as a judge who simply “call[s] balls and strikes”—Roberts “did not entirely shed his partisan thinking once he donned the black robe.” The Chief quotes Roberts’ statement that, as chief, he sometimes “sublimates” his conservative views. A better account of what he is up to, Biskupic finds—drawing on interviews with his colleagues—is “strategizing.” His cunning maneuvers over death penalty squabbles suggest she is right. While striving to keep up appearances as an honest broker, Roberts is discreetly deploying his new conservative majority to shore up America’s dwindling capital punishment regime and buttress its executioners.

Sri Lanka: ISIS claims credit for church and hotel attacks.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/sri-lanka-attacks-isis-congo.html,"The Census Case Will Define the Roberts Court ISIS claimed responsibility on Tuesday for the coordinated suicide bombings that killed more than 300 people at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Sunday. The claim came via the group’s Amaq news agency, which also posted a list of the attackers’ noms de guerre and a video of men alleged to be the attackers declaring allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The claim came shortly after a Sri Lankan official said the government believed the bombings had been in retaliation for last month’s shootings at mosques in New Zealand. Officials have blamed the local Islamist militant group National Thowheed Jamaath for the attacks, but also suspect international assistance . The government was reportedly monitoring the group and had received warnings about it from the United States and India prior to the attack. Generally, ISIS claims should be regarded with some skepticism. Although ISIS and Amaq were once considered fairly reliable in their claims of responsibility, they’ve been less so in recent years, after publishing a number of dubious claims , including for the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, which by all accounts was committed by one man with unknown motives . A decade after the bloody conclusion of the brutal 26-year civil war between the government and the Tamil Tigers, Sri Lanka certainly has experience with sectarian violence and with suicide bombings—the Tigers are credited with pioneering the tactic. But for all the long-running tensions between the country’s Buddhist majority and predominantly Hindu Tamil minority, Islamist extremist violence and attacks on Christians are both pretty rare. The unprecedented scale of Sunday’s attacks and the nature of them led analysts like Amarnath Amarasingam, who studies extremism in Sri Lanka, to suspect outside involvement , even before today’s claims. It’s true that U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria declared total victory over ISIS last month, bringing a long-awaited end to the “caliphate” as a territorial entity. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for the removal of U.S. troops from Syria, has also been particularly anxious to pronounce the group fully defeated . But experts and military officials have consistently warned that ISIS remains a threat, both as an organized terrorist group and as a global “brand” that can inspire violence from sympathizers far from the battlefields of Iraq and Syria. The Sri Lanka claim comes just a few days after ISIS claimed responsibility for its first attack in the Democratic Republic of Congo, an ambush that killed eight government soldiers in a region already threatened by rebel violence and an ongoing Ebola outbreak. The attack was initially attributed to a long-established local rebel group known as the Allied Democratic Forces, but as the New York Times reports , members of the group have previously been found in possession of ISIS propaganda, and there’s evidence it has received cash from ISIS financiers. As terrorism researcher Aaron Zelin writes , “we might be seeing a new tactic to garner more media attention: attacking locales with foreign fighter networks [that] do not have robust security and counterterrorism measures.” To keep itself relevant, ISIS may be working to insert itself into long-running conflicts, including those, like in Sri Lanka and Congo, where its brand of Islamic extremism has traditionally played little role. It’s possible ISIS has some operational role in planning these attacks, or that its role is merely inspirational, or that it’s simply taking credit for violence it had little to do with. The important thing is global relevance: A group that no longer exists as a physical place wants us to think it’s everywhere."

A teenager is accusing Apple of misidentifying him with a facial ID system.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/a-teenager-is-accusing-apple-of-misidentifying-him-with-a-facial-id-system.html,"Even Space Isn’t Safe From Ads Ousmane Bah, an 18-year-old college student from New York, filed a lawsuit against Apple on Monday for allegedly relying on facial recognition systems that misidentified him as a serial shoplifter. The suit claims that Apple and its contractor, Security Industry Specialists, caused Bah to suffer emotional distress as a result. Apple has subsequently denied that it uses facial recognition in its stores. According to the lawsuit , Bah received a summons arraignment last summer from a Boston municipal court for the theft of $1,200 worth of products from an Apple Store in the city. The police report indicated that a Security Industry Specialists loss prevention associate saw the theft on a security video and recognized Bah from a similar incident at an Apple Store in Connecticut. Bah claimed that he had never been to Boston and was attending his senior prom in Manhattan when the crime took place. The judge released him, and the charges were later dropped. When Bah returned home, however, he received additional paperwork detailing allegations against him in connection with thefts at Apple Stores in New York, New Jersey, and Delaware. Then, in November, NYPD officers arrested Bah at his home at 4 in the morning. The detective on the case soon discovered, however, that Bah did not resemble the suspect who had robbed a Manhattan Apple Store. At this point, the detective allegedly told Bah that Apple uses facial recognition to identify theft suspects. The detective further speculated that the actual thief had somehow obtained an interim driver’s permit that Bah had lost earlier in the year and presented it as identification at a previous crime scene. The driver’s permit did not have Bah’s picture. Based on the detective’s purported theory for the mix-up, the lawsuit—which seeks $1 billion—accuses Apple of negligently linking the picture of the actual thief with the identifying information on Bah’s interim permit in its alleged facial recognition security system. All charges against Bah have been dismissed except in New Jersey, where his case is still pending. The suit is getting a lot of attention, but there are reasons to be cautious. Though iPhones do feature Face ID as a more convenient login method, there is little evidence that Apple has developed any facial recognition technology for surveillance purposes. As Motherboard noted in 2017 , Apple devices store facial recognition data locally, so it’s unlikely that the company has built a database using Face ID scans. However, it’s theoretically possible for the government to issue a legal order requiring Apple to tap into devices to search for targets using the Face ID feature. This is all to say that the alleged surveillance behaviors outlined in the lawsuit aren’t consistent with what the public knows about Apple’s past use of facial recognition systems. But it certainly isn’t impossible for the company to have secretly applied the technology to camera footage from its stores. Bah’s lawsuit comes amid a flurry of facial recognition controversies. Last week, a JetBlue passenger reported on Twitter that the airline had used a facial recognition camera to check her in, rather than her boarding pass, without her consent. JetBlue apologized and disclosed that it was using data from the Department of Homeland Security to run the system. In the same week, Microsoft also revealed that California police had requested technology that could scan a person’s face during traffic stops. The company ultimately declined.

"Trolls before the alt-right, Don McGahn, Elizabeth Warren, and SCOTUS on the death penalty.",slate.com,Slate Copy Desk,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trolling-alt-right-don-mcgahn-elizabeth-warren-scotus-death-penalty.html,"The Census Case Will Define the Roberts Court You should have listened: Before Gamergate and the 2016 election brought racist online trolls into the national consciousness, black feminists were dealing with their effect—and doing something about it. But the story of their battle was completely overlooked as many of those same trolls assumed new political power in the form of the alt-right. Rachelle Hampton offers a corrective to this narrative in this week’s cover story, telling the story of the women who saw the threat coming and fought back . Not the hero we need: The Mueller report has revealed that former White House counsel Don McGahn thwarted some of Donald Trump’s worst efforts to obstruct justice by simply ignoring the president’s orders. But refusing Trump’s commands doesn’t make him a hero , writes Leah Litman. It only reveals the hypocrisy of McGahn and other administration officials who personally forestalled the president yet championed judicial appointees who would expand the power of his office. Warren’s world: Josh Voorhees watched all five hours (!!) of Monday’s CNN Democratic town hall and came away with a few thoughts, primarily that underdog Elizabeth Warren’s ideas have now become the baseline to which the other candidates’ ideas are compared . This is in part due to her ambitious student loan forgiveness plan, which, as Jordan Weissmann claims, is “the best basic blueprint a politician has produced for … debt forgiveness without making it a straight giveaway to the upper middle class .” Dead men give no testimony: The latest liberal-conservative brouhaha in the Supreme Court is over the death penalty, and Chief Justice John Roberts, the new “moderate,” is quietly putting his name down on the side of rulings that, over the past couple years, have shown little mercy for those on death row. While he rarely writes these opinions himself, he’s making his stance on this position clear as the court drifts further to the right , Steven V. Mazie writes. [Wipes away tears] pika pika,Nitish"

Little's transphobic joke: Tracy Oliver says she didn't write it.,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/little-movie-transphobic-joke-offensive.html,"Game of Thrones ’ Controversial Sex Scene Gave Arya Back Her Humanity Little has some amazing cast chemistry and more than a few side-splitting scenes, including one in which Issa Rae and Marsai Martin—playing a 40-something, megalomaniac tech queen stuck in the body of a child—drunkenly sing “ I’m Goin’ Down ” into breadsticks in a crowded restaurant. But earlier in the movie, there’s a scene with a very different tone when that same 40-something, megalomaniac tech queen (Regina Hall) mistakes a young girl in the hallway of her building for a boy. When the child’s mother corrects her, Sanders snarks, “Oh, he’s transitioning?” The moment is supposed to demonstrate the character’s cold-heartedness, her antipathy towards children, and the distance between her days as a hopeful youth and her current dragon-lady persona. But it also sticks out like a sore, transphobic thumb. Sure, it’s supposed to illustrate just how heinous of a person Hall’s character is, but there are endless ways to do that—and indeed the movie employs several others, such as screaming at a valet, throwing out perfectly good donuts, and physically abusing her employees—that don’t come at the expense of trans folks. So out of place was the “joke” that it was called out in multiple reviews of the movie , though, until Monday, no one involved in the making seemed to want to address it.

Tracy Oliver, who is listed as Little ’sco-writer with director Tina Gordon, broke that silence by saying that she had nothing to do with the misplaced, mean-spirited moment, distancing herself from the joke in a series of tweets . “As a feature writer, when you hand your draft (s) into the studio, you have no control over what ends up on screen,” said Oliver, who also co-wrote Girls Trip . “Often, you’re elated. Other times, you’re disappointed. I did not write that particular joke and was disappointed to see it. It was insensitive and unnecessary.” She added that she was shocked to see the joke included in the film and had been wrestling with whether or not speak up. Fans seemed grateful that she decided to set the record straight, though her disclosure raises the question of who, exactly, decided that a movie about #BlackGirlMagic needed to use trans kids in the audience for a cheap laugh.

Game of Thrones is making Daenerys seem unfit to rule.,slate.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/game-of-thrones-daenerys-unfit-to-rule-plot-trap.html,"Brow Beat Why Did Game of Thrones Turn on Daenerys Targaryen? She used to be the Breaker of Chains, but now the show seems hell-bent on convincing us she’s unfit to rule. By Lili Loofbourow April 23, 2019 6:47 PM Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, Kit Harington as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 2. Helen Sloan/HBO The promise (and premise!) of Game of Thrones was always that there were too many protagonists—for now. The show was a crowded field that, we understood, would be whittled down by the time the moment for throne-claiming arrived. To make that final conflict matter, the show needed us to feel strongly about the major players by aligning viewers with them as they went on their respective journeys. We watched Sansa’s struggles, Arya’s training, Jon’s adventures, Cersei’s humiliations. Advertisement But no one’s bildungsroman was more dramatic and fascinating than the story of Daenerys Targaryen, whose adventures began when she was sold into sexual slavery and raped as a girl, and who then schemed and scrabbled into the unexpected legend of her own power. Her messianic potential seemed to be endorsed not just by internal signs—her fireproof body, her dragons—but by the extent to which the show aligned her with contemporary values. Daenerys famously came closest to voicing something viewers might recognize as proto-democracy (as Elizabeth Warren herself has pointed out ). She freed slaves and promised to “break the wheel” of the status quo. Dany seemed like the closest thing Westeros had to a revolutionary leader worth following. In its final season, though, the show’s allegiance has changed. It used to be that almost everyone except slave traffickers and corrupt kings kept talking about how extraordinary and correct and wise Daenerys was. These days, the plot is side-eyeing her choices, and characters are chafing under her command. Sansa doesn’t like Dany, for one thing. Then there’s Daenerys’ scene informing Samwell Tarly that she executed his father and brother. That incident, which has been effectively re-litigated, has been cited—by fans and commentators and Sam himself—as evidence of her cruelty and unfitness to rule. (I will confess here that this particular decision—in which Daenerys gave defeated enemies a choice to serve her and keep their estates, or die—didn’t strike me as that egregious in a show that features, among other things, a beloved character feeding a man his own children.) Even two of Dany’s most ride-or-die servants, Grey Worm and Missandei, are wearily contemplating a life in her service and making plans to leave as soon as decency permits. Game of Thrones used to love its nobler contenders, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that Daenerys—that sometime Chosen One—has been unchosen. It’s quite an interesting transition to watch the show attempt. It involves, among other things, some pretty extreme redefinitions. Daenerys’ ambition, which was once celebrated, functions now as brittle hubris. The awe she once inspired in people plainly isn’t working on the Northerners, the show’s current audience surrogate. She seems more jealous than benevolent, issuing veiled threats to Jon about Sansa not respecting her, and she seems to be vaguely aligned with male relatives (like her father the Mad King, or her brother Viserys, whom she cites approvingly) whose flaws she once frankly admitted.* And her pretty understandable questioning of Jon’s claim to being Aegon Targaryen—that it comes, rather conveniently, from his brother and his best friend—is made to seem a little ungracious and desperate because we know that Jon’s intel is correct. Advertisement Even her desire for the Iron Throne seems to be getting subtly reframed as unreasonable, grasping, and selfish. It seems almost— almost —like proof of her unfitness to occupy it. That’s pretty crazy for a show called Game of Thrones that has mostly been about people wanting to rule! It’s the kind of value judgment that only makes sense if the show is siding with someone who doesn’t want power—someone like Jon, who has always accepted it only reluctantly. It’s perfectly fine for the show to adopt this view of healthy leadership, but it’s a definite and striking departure from a universe whose earliest and most defining lesson was that the dim and good reluctant players, the Ned Starks of the world, can’t win. Daenerys, in short, is stuck in what Greg Bales called a “plot trap” : Now that she’s been pitted against Jon Snow, it’s hard to imagine a way she could win the Iron Throne that would feel satisfying, rather than like further evidence she’s on the brink of that famous Targaryen madness. The good news, I guess, is that Daenerys was always headed for this trap. Anchoring your vision of a just and restructured society in a belief of your own right to rule is pretty “wheel-based” thinking, almost as retrograde as any arcane monarchic rule in the Seven Kingdoms. It’s weird to say you deserve to lead a semi-democratic uprising, based on the consent of the governed … because you’re the rightful heir and their divinely chosen queen! Put differently, a schizoid aspect of Daenerys’ character, which I used to think was bad writing, might actually have been a planned schism between her revolutionary, egalitarian promises and her equally forceful belief that she was chosen to rule —and not by the people. The shaky hypothesis put forth by the show was that Daenerys’ character might productively bridge the gap between the rotten institution of monarchy and the cleansing revolutionary impulse her struggles made thinkable. Who else could be the abused girl, the charismatic proletarian, and also the conquering Khaleesi, the liberator, the Targaryen heir of the Seven Kingdoms, the playful lover, the dragon queen? It was always a lot to ask of a single character, but it was still easy to love her as she filled all these roles. Now that she’s having to simultaneously seduce and defend the North while mourning the death of one of her dragons, falling in love, compensating for yet another one of Tyrion’s failed plans, and preparing for one of the culminating battles that would propel her to her long-desired goal, the show doesn’t seem to be that into her. Advertisement That’s partly because she’s in Winterfell, where the Game of Thrones began, and that feels like a homecoming not just for characters but for fans. It clarifies allegiances. Setting the beginning of the end there was a big choice, and as the big animated map on which the show has spread its characters starts to fold in on itself, Daenerys feels a lot more like an unwelcome conquering power than the rightful queen many viewers once thought she could be. She does not belong. For almost a decade, this show has been about people becoming. This has made it hard to judge characters’ specific actions, since we have never known for sure where their arcs were tending. Maybe Daenerys (who many suspect is becoming “mad” like her father) truly has become something different. But I’m not sure where the sudden agreement about her conduct unbefitting a monarch is coming from: We were invited to love her, after all, even when she was crucifying people, locking up enemies to die; and executing a loyal servant to demonstrate her commitment to fair trials, which ended up provoking a riot. That was arguably the show’s most complex interrogation of Dany’s abilities and priorities as a leader. Executing the Tarlys, in contrast, may be a great reason to convince Sam to oppose her and tell Jon why, but is it really the strongest case for why Daenerys shouldn’t rule? I don’t know. I think Dany’s character development only seems legible as a decline because the show itself seems to see it that way. And anyway I still have no idea how this show’s moral compass works. Some characters have been clearly evil—Cersei and Ramsay have helped us stake out what leaders ought not to do (blow up hundreds, flay). Some, like Ned and Sam, are clearly good. But the middle ground is vast. Is withholding information and risking your brother’s life so you can kill your ex-husband proof of virtue or leadership or intelligence? Does executing the boy who stabbed you, because the wildlings you’ve created an alliance with killed his family, make you a good leader or a bad one? Is assassinating your enemies awesome or proof of a character’s irreparable brokenness? Was Olly—the kid who killed Jon to avenge his family—the Arya of his own story, and if so, how should we have felt about how his particular watch ended? Is it better to be led by a woman with a cruel streak and a vision who believes in breaking the wheel, or by a man with no vision at all who failed upward and is quite confused by his sudden legitimacy? Westeros needs an ending, and Game of Thrones needs a winner. And just as a country’s people need to be prepared to accept a leader, Game of Thrones must prepare viewers to accept the endgame the show is laying out. A television show may be basically a monarchy, but it still needs the people’s buy-in. That’s why this specific point in a series’ lifetime—this crucial moment before the deaths begin and storylines end—is in some ways its most interesting moment. We’re about to learn what Game of Thrones has actually been about. The plot armor is down and the plot trap is set. I can’t wait to see whether Daenerys escapes.
Correction, April 24, 2019: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Daenerys’ brother as Viserion. His name is Viserys. "
The White House will fight McGahn subpoena because his public testimony could be a knockout blow.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/white-house-fights-mcgahn-subpoena-trump-knockout-silver-bullet.html,"One Reason So Many Democrats Are Running for President: They Don’t Think Joe Biden Can Win The White House is planning to fight the House Judiciary Committee’s subpoena of former White House counsel Don McGahn, the Washington Post reports , as part of a broader attempt to stonewall Democrat-led efforts to have key figures testify before Congress in the wake of the Mueller report’s publication. The White House says it will invoke a broad interpretation of executive privilege to keep current and former members of the administration from testifying under oath before Congressional subcommittees. McGahn’s extensive testimony to Robert Mueller’s investigators is key to the obstruction of justice case against the president laid out by the special counsel. McGahn told investigators that he rebuffed Trump’s orders to fire Mueller and when those orders were made public by the New York Times six months later he refused the president’s directive to lie and deny it occurred. McGahn’s centrality in the Mueller report’s obstruction findings would make him an all-star witness for Democrats in Congress. To Trump, the public testimony of the former White House counsel articulating what appear to be crimes, along with general madness and dysfunction, could be devastating to his presidency. McGahn’s uneven relationship with the president while working in the White House deteriorated into what appears to be an adversarial one by the end of McGahn’s tenure. He left two years into the term with Trump ranting that he had leaked the information about the aborted Mueller sacking. The president referred to him as a “lying bastard,” according to the Mueller report. So where does that leave McGahn on possibly testifying in one month’s time? From the Post:
McGahn’s lawyer, William Burck, began discussions with the House Judiciary Committee about his potential testimony after the panel issued a subpoena Monday , according to people familiar with the matter. People close to McGahn, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said McGahn is “following the process” and working with the White House on his next steps, despite Trump’s public and private anger about his former White House counsel’s prominence in the Mueller report .
“He’s not eager to testify. He’s not reluctant. He got a subpoena. It compels him to testify. But there are some countervailing legal reasons that might prevent that,” said one person close to McGahn, who requested anonymity to describe private discussions. “He doesn’t want to be in contempt of Congress nor does he want to be in contempt of his ethical obligations and legal obligations as a former White House official.” At one point, Trump asked McGahn why he had told Mueller that he tried to fire him. McGahn explained that their conversations were not protected by attorney-client privilege. The president then asked, according to the Mueller report, “What-about these notes? Why do you take notes? Lawyers don’ t take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.” McGahn told Trump he keeps notes because he’s a “real lawyer.” A real lawyer, huh. That, to me, sounds like someone who swallowed everything for two years and might just be dying to testify."
Saudi Arabia carries out mass execution of 37 people in a single day.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/saudi-arabia-carries-out-mass-execution-death-penalty-shiites-37-people-one-day.html,"The Census Case Will Define the Roberts Court Saudi Arabia executed 37 men, almost all of them from the country’s minority Shiite community, on terrorism-related crimes, the kingdom’s official news agency announced Tuesday. The killings, which were carried out in multiple cities, including Riyadh, Mecca, and Medina are thought to amount to the largest mass execution of Shiites in the Sunni-majority country’s history. The majority of those executed, according to Amnesty International, were “convicted after sham trials that violated international fair trial standards which relied on confessions extracted through torture.” “The individuals were found guilty of attacking security installations with explosives, killing a number of security officers and cooperating with enemy organizations against the interests of the country, the Interior Ministry said,” according to the Associated Press. “Executions are traditionally carried out after midday prayers. Public displays of the bodies of executed men last for around three hours until late afternoon prayers, with the severed head and body hoisted to the top of a pole overlooking a main square.” In addition to the gruesome beheadings, one man was crucified after being beheaded, the country’s Interior Ministry said in a statement. “Executions are usually carried out by beheading,” the BBC reports . “Crucifixion following an execution is reserved for crimes seen by the authorities as even more serious.” By Amnesty’s count, the Saudi regime has executed at least 104 people so far this year, a dramatic increase in the number of executions from the previous year. That rise, the AP notes, likely has something to do with U.S. support for the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s regime. “The kingdom and its Sunni-led Arab allies have also been emboldened by U.S. President Donald Trump’s unwavering dedication to pressuring Iran’s Shiite clerical leadership, which includes his decision to pull out of a nuclear agreement with Iran and re-impose punishing sanctions to cripple its economy,” the Associated Press notes ."

Fosse/Verdon fact vs. fiction Episode 3: what’s true in FX’s new series starring Michelle Williams and Sam Rockwell.,slate.com,Ellin Stein,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/fosse-verdon-fact-fiction-episode-3-historical-accuracy-fx-series.html,"What’s Fact and What’s Fiction in The Mule ? With Episode 3 of Fosse/Verdon , Gwen Verdon has moved on from her decision to finally kick Bob Fosse out of the family home following her discovery of his affair with the German translator on the Cabaret shoot, the straw that finally broke the camel’s back. As Verdon tries to maintain a professional as well as physical separation from her ex and resist his efforts to lure her into helping him with the difficult Cabaret edit, we also learn more about Verdon’s pre-Fosse career via flashbacks. Just as we’ve done for the past two episodes , we break it all down below. Verdon’s Childhood and the Shotgun Wedding Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon in real life, and Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams in Fosse/Verdon . Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Bettmann/Contributor and Eric Liebowitz/FX. Reluctant to assume babysitting duties for even one night, Bob enlists his best friend Paddy Chayefsky (Norbert Leo Butz) so he can go have a tryst with Cabaret ’s assistant editor. When Gwen returns, she is horrified to find Chayefsky and her young daughter Nicole alone together watching TV in Bob’s hotel bedroom because this triggers memories of when an older family friend cornered her in her parents’ basement when she was 16. In the flashback, Gwen is in the family living room in Culver City showing off her dance moves to a social gathering of her parents’ friends (this, as one observes admiringly, despite being born with a twisted leg that required wearing a large leg brace for much of her childhood). Afterward, her mother introduces her to James Henaghan, a “theater critic.” Henaghan lures the naïve Gwen (then still Gwyneth) to a small room and locks the door. A year later, she has a son and is unhappily married to Henaghan. Verdon did indeed wear orthopedic boots and rigid braces as a child for 10 years to correct feet and legs that had been weakened by rickets (which she developed as a toddler—it wasn’t a birth defect). According to biographer Peter Shelley , Verdon was also cross-eyed and skinny, leading her to develop a lively personality because she felt she had to compensate for her ugly-duckling looks. The turned leg that became a Fosse trademark grew out of her characteristic stance, an attempt to hide her deformity. Verdon’s mother had her take dance lessons—everything from ballet to tap—to further strengthen her legs and by the time she was 6, Verdon was already performing in theaters as a child tap star. By age 11, she had appeared in a film as a solo ballerina. Henaghan was not a theater critic but the Hollywood Reporter’s “Rambling Reporter,” writing a column that was (and still is) a mixture of personal and industry gossip. It’s not a matter of public record whether he ever cornered the young Verdon in a locked room. What is known is that in 1942, at the age of 17, Verdon gave up her promising career to suddenly “elope” with Henaghan, and their son James Jr. arrived in March 1943. Given the dates, the show’s suggestion of a shotgun wedding does not seem unlikely. Babysitter Paddy Chayefsky Paddy Chayefsky and Norbert Leo Butz as Paddy Chayefsky. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Kevin Winter/Getty Images and Pari Dukovic/FX. Chayefsky, who made his name as one of the most acclaimed writers of naturalistic dramas on television and is still the only screenwriter to have won three solo-credit Oscars for best screenplay—for 1955’s Marty , 1971’s The Hospital , and 1976’s Network —was indeed Fosse’s best friend and was as irascible (like a burlier Larry David) as depicted. Whether he ever was entrusted with babysitting Nicole on his own is not verifiable. It may be something Nicole (a consultant on the show) remembered, or it may be invention. Breaking Into Showbiz In the episode, Gwen is stuck at home with a screaming baby and a husband who drinks too much and sleeps till noon. But then she attends a nightclub show and is entranced by the dancers. She goes backstage to interview the choreographer, Jack Cole, telling him she’s a reporter for the “Hollywood Bugle” and blurts out, “I’m a dancer.” Next, we see her leaving the baby with her parents and heading out on the road, her son’s cries echoing in her ears. Verdon did initially give up dancing to stay home with her son. “ I thought being married meant doing the laundry ,” she told the New York Times. “I mean, what do you know when you’re that age?” However, she continued to do legwork for her husband’s column and sometimes put it together when he was incapacitated. “He was a drinker, so he would wind up in Kansas City and not remember how he got there,” Verdon said in the same interview. By New Year’s 1944, she’d had enough. “I said ‘That’s it’ and I went home to Mama,” she recalled. “I took my child, my dog and my cats and left.” Faced with earning a living as a single mother, Verdon picked up occasional assignments from the Hollywood Reporter and elsewhere. One night she was asked to review a show at a nightclub called Slapsie Maxie and, as in the show, was transfixed by Jack Cole’s dancers . “I was absolutely floored,” she told the Times . “I did not write a review. I went backstage and I was not even dancing at the time and I said, ‘If I get back in condition can I audition for you?’ and he said ‘yes’.” Verdon’s mother continued to raise James Jr. as Gwen launched her dance career, first as Cole’s assistant and then as his primary dancer. (It was Verdon who helped Marilyn Monroe with her moves for the Cole-choreographed number “ Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend ” in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes .) The Can-Can Curtain Call In the episode, Gwen remembers the performance in Can-Can that made her a literal overnight sensation. She finishes the number and rushes offstage for a quick costume change. But the audience won’t stop cheering, so a producer goes to Gwen’s dressing room to bring her back, even though she is by now down to her underwear. Quickly wrapping a towel around herself, she returns to the stage for another bow, having literally stopped the show. This is pretty much what happened. Verdon was cast as the second female lead in Can-Can. During the out-of-town previews, reviewers were considerably more enthusiastic about Verdon than they were about the ostensible star, a French music-hall chanteuse called Lilo. Lilo insisted Verdon’s big number be cut and her role pared down, so by opening night Verdon had only eight lines of dialogue and two featured dances. Moreover, Lilo had ensured that Verdon would exit the dance numbers in which Verdon featured before they had finished, making it impossible for the audience to show their appreciation. A frustrated Verdon had already given her notice and had arranged to leave the show in a month. What is not shown is that Verdon owed her triumph largely to a mistake. One of her two numbers was an “apache dance,” a combative number in which she was supposed to plunge a knife into her partner’s chest, but when when she grabbed the knife, the handle came off in her hand. Thinking on her feet, Verdon instead pulled her partner to her and kissed him. As syndicated Broadway columnist Earl Wilson wrote , Verdon “danced a slow-motion apache dance so brilliantly the applause became a roar,” with the audience continuing to chant her name until she returned for a bow, although she did so in a rather less-sexy bathrobe. The Straight Play The episode shows Gwen thrilled to be cast in a straight non-musical role, though over the objections of the director, who gives her a hard time, undermining her confidence and sending her back to Fosse for reassurance and tips. Verdon did appear in a straight role in the little-remembered 1972 Broadway drama Children! Children! as a babysitter whose three evil charges terrorize her. It ran for only one performance after universally negative reviews. The play was “clanky, unconvincing, and lacking in a satisfying conclusion. It was quite obvious from the preview I attended that the play would never make it and that Verdon had gotten about as trapped as her character,” as one observer recalled."
"Trump hauls Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to the Oval Office, wants to know why he doesn’t have more Twitter followers.",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/trump-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-white-house-oval-office-meeting-bots-followers.html,"One Reason So Many Democrats Are Running for President: They Don’t Think Joe Biden Can Win President Trump met privately with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in the Oval Office Tuesday because the president has successfully concocted a narrative that he and his far right Twitter buds are somehow getting unfairly censored on the platform. There are number of covert methods of online crowd control with creative names, like shadow banning , that conservatives believe they are unfairly the victim of. The practice, like all of the digital boogeymen they see, surreptitiously buries their messages, tweets, posts, and the like with an invisible digital anchor of sorts, making it hard to get their message of love and unity out to the world. You don’t have to know much more than that to know that sounds like a conspiracy theory Donald J. Trump might like a crack at. Unsurprisingly, Trump has really run with the idea that he’s the real victim here, despite practically owing his presidency to the platform. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have ""hatred... for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election,"" President Trump said. https://t.co/QjBSDjF2XG pic.twitter.com/ZgMJ577pKr — CNBC (@CNBC) March 19, 2019 There are a lot of serious issues facing social media and its role in our body politic, economy, and society writ large. Plenty for a president to chew over with the head of one of the most influential social media companies in the world. Here’s a preview of what Trump had on the brain going into the meeting: “The best thing ever to happen to Twitter is Donald Trump.” @MariaBartiromo So true, but they don’t treat me well as a Republican. Very discriminatory, hard for people to sign on. Constantly taking people off list. Big complaints from many people. Different names-over 100 M — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019 But should be much higher than that if Twitter wasn’t playing their political games. No wonder Congress wants to get involved - and they should. Must be more, and fairer, companies to get out the WORD! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019 Flash forward to Tuesday: “A significant portion of the meeting focused on Trump’s concerns that Twitter quietly, and deliberately, has limited or removed some of his followers,” a person with direct knowledge of the conversation told the Washington Post. “Trump said he had heard from fellow conservatives who had lost followers for unclear reasons as well.” Donald Trump, a non-user of email, has noticed a glitch in the Twitter matrix. So what accounts for Trump’s drop in followers? One thought would be the Russian bots that disappeared into dust following the 2016 election. In fact, Twitter has made a concerted effort to clean up fake accounts, which likely accounts for the decline. Obama lost millions of followers in the Twitter bot purge."

I’m not saying that being credited in future SAG-AFTRA productions as “Bilbo Bab Boberson” is a surefire path to success.

Why parents panic too much over kids who learn to walk late.,slate.com,Emily Oster,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/cribsheet-parents-children-late-walkers.html,"When You Give Birth, Your Body … Rips. That Might Suck a Little Less if We Talked About It More. My friend Jane’s son was born three months after my own daughter. Now that they are in second grade, you’d hardly notice this age difference at all, but early on, it was hard to believe that would ever be true. When Benjamin was born, Penelope seemed like a giant. When he was a floppy 6-week-old infant, she was 4 and a half months old, well on her way toward being a real, solid, baby. But then came walking. At a year, like the average kid, Benjamin got up and started toddling around. Not Penelope. By the time he was walking, she was fifteen months old and seemed to show no inclination. It is sometimes easy to ignore the way your children differ from the average, but walking was so visible, so salient. Plus, we saw Benjamin all the time, so it was hard to avoid comparisons. At Penelope’s 15-month well-child visit, our very practical and pragmatic pediatrician, Dr. Li, told me not to worry that she wasn’t walking. “If she’s not walking by 18 months,” she said, “we’ll call in early intervention. But don’t worry! She’ll figure it out.” I did not have Dr. Li’s relaxed confidence or breadth of experience. I tried to explain to Penelope how to walk; she didn’t care. I tried to provide incentives, which were ineffective. You recall: She was a baby. And then, about two weeks after the doctor visit, Penelope walked. Just like it was no big deal. Perhaps because she was so old by the time she learned, she never fell down much, either, just went from crawling around to walking normally in a day or two. And then I promptly forgot about my fear that she would never walk and moved on to other neuroses. (There are always more neuroses around the corner when you’re parenting.) If your child doesn’t walk until 17 months, is she doomed to be picked last on the kickball team? I don’t think my experience was unique. In the moment, physical milestones—sitting, crawling, walking, running—take on an outsize importance. You are in a whole new and bewildering world as a parent, and milestones seem like just about the only map of the territory. Correspondingly, failure to achieve these milestones at the time we expect tends to worry parents. I think part of the problem is that most discussions of this focus on the average age—as in, “Most children walk around one year.” This is true, but it misses the (perhaps surprising) fact that there is a very, very wide distribution in what is typical. (There’s a whole other conversation to be had about how we idealize “typical” in children, but that is for another day.) To get a sense of this distribution, we can go to the data, collected from healthy, typically developing children. Specifically, we can use data collected and collated by the World Health Organization to look at not just the average age of walking (which is indeed around a year) but the whole distribution. The age range is visualized in the graph below. What we see from this is that the earliest walkers are around 8 months and the latest are close to 18 months. This is an astonishingly large range for parents to process. On a huge range of dimensions, an 8 month old is completely different from an 18 month old, and yet both are normal ages for first steps. That gives you some idea of how different children already are by this point, and it also gives you a sense of how you should view milestones: as a range. Cribsheet The literature on development contains all sorts of other surprising facts about the wide ranges in physical milestones, most of them quite comforting. For example, a large share of children never crawl at all, or crawl in unusual ways. I’m guessing many a pediatrician has fielded questions from parents about why their child moves around like an inchworm through the house. This is broadly reassuring, but you may also be left with the lingering question of whether any of this is predictive. If your child doesn’t walk until 17 months, is she doomed to be picked last on the kickball team? Working as I do with a number of highly accomplished economists, I feel a close kinship with this cohort. There is, in fact, very little evidence on the long-term impacts of late walking. Virtually all children—indeed, even the vast majority of those who are delayed beyond the normal range—do end up walking and running. If you ask, “Does early walking predict walking?” the answer will be, “No, everyone walks.” When it comes to being an elite athlete, the data is similarly thin. I don’t know if it’s just that researchers are not interested in predicting elite athletic performance. Perhaps the issue is that even if there were some relationship, the outcome is so unlikely, we’d never see it in the data. Making it to the Olympics, we find, is just not a realistic goal for most people. So don’t be surprised if your child is a late walker, or a late crawler, or an early walker or a non-crawler. As with most issues in parenting, the key is not to panic when things don’t progress exactly as you expect. "

Trevor Noah weighs Warren's policies against Buttigieg's poise.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/trevor-noah-elizabeth-warren-pete-buttigieg-daily-show.html,"One of the Most Incredible Buzzer-Beaters in NBA History Happened Tuesday and It Is Going to Inspire a Lot of Future Airballs CNN held a series of back-to-back town halls in New Hampshire on Monday in which Democratic candidates talked policy, Donald Trump, and in Elizabeth Warren’s case, cents. The Massachusetts senator who, per Daily Show host Trevor Noah, has been “releasing policies faster than Netflix releases documentaries about serial killers,” had quite a few thoroughly-researched ideas to share, such as her plan to impose a new tax on ultra-millionaires. The wealth tax, Warren explained, would shave 2 cents off of every dollar on fortunes over $50 million. The money would go toward universal child care, pre-K, and college, as well as cutting down student loan debt. “That’s a lot of great proposals for one tax,” Noah said, pointing out that, by framing the tax in terms of cents instead of percentages, Warren makes it sound way more reasonable. Noah also highlighted the suave conversational style of fast-rising candidate Pete Buttigieg, who at the town hall largely dodged CNN’s policy questions in favor of just seeming like a nice guy. “You know what he reminds me of? That kid in school who always got good grades without reading any of the books,” Noah said. “Running for president as a man is so much more fun, because as a woman, you have to bring extra homework,” he added. “But a dude can just come and be like, ‘Yeah, I’m gonna wing it.’ ” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

"Hanif Abdurraqib Offers a Final Tribute to Phife Dawg, the Heart of A Tribe Called Quest",slate.com,Nitish Pahwa,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/phife-dawg-hanif-abdurraqib-go-ahead-in-the-rain.html,"Sally Rooney’s Normal People Excels at the Thing Novels Do Better Than Any Other Art Form The late 2016 release of A Tribe Called Quest’s final album, We Got It From Here … Thank You 4 Your Service , should have been a moment of absolute triumph. The group’s first album in nearly two decades was a spirited, invigorating reunion, a parade of greats returning to claim their crown. But the album came in the wake of, and was colored by, deep tragedy: first, the untimely death of member Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor as he succumbed to complications from the diabetes that had plagued him for much of his life, and then the 2016 election, a devastating exhibition that gave bigotry a new national voice. Although not originally intended as such, We Got It From Here became a response to both those things: The verses Phife prepared before the grave echoed all over the record, last gasps about love and music and America transmitted to listeners just when they needed them most. But his ghostly presence proved there could be no one worthy of filling the gap he was leaving behind, and the end of his life would be the final stand of Tribe. Cultural critic and poet Hanif Abdurraqib’s book Go Ahead in the Rain is the first major work about Tribe created in the sad years since We Got It From Here . Part biography, part autobiography, part historical narrative, and part collection of letters—most addressed from Abdurraqib to individual members of the group—the book sees Tribe through Abdurraqib’s eyes as a black Midwestern teenager coming of age in the ’90s, enraptured by the verbal jabs of a “funky diabetic” hissing through his cassette player. But while the book is a deeply personal, moving meditation on the entire group, I found it most poignant as a tribute to the late Phife Dawg, the “5-Foot Assassin,” to whom the book is dedicated. Abdurraqib’s attachment to Phife stems in part from how he could see parts of himself within the mythos of Phife: sharp rhymer, jokester, sports fan, distracted slacker, pop culture scholar, member of various creative crews, lover of sweetness and sugar , sometimes insecure character always ready to transcend his position. In the personal letters, bundles of which are scattered throughout the book, Abdurraqib writes to Phife as if he had been a slightly inscrutable yet easygoing friend whose psyche could have used some prodding—someone with whom he could break down great rap songs, rant about the latest Knicks game, and get into how it feels to be the overlooked member of your family or your crew of friends. There are other closer, more heartbreaking ties: In one letter, Abdurraqib writes to Malik’s mother, the poet Cheryl Boyce-Taylor , addressing her upon the moment of her son’s death, speaking of the grief that Abdurraqib can understand, having buried a parent himself—a motherless son speaking to a sonless mother. There’s something fitting about this Phife focus—the late Malik Taylor was often hailed as larger-than-life, while never seeming to occupy the spotlight. As legendary as Tribe is, it’s often most immediately associated with the distinctive nasal tone and production wizardry of Q-Tip, who was (and still is) often seen as the central driver of the show, with Phife relegated to little brother status, the petulant sidekick and never the frontman. Abdurraqib makes a passionate case, though, that they were “both equals, fighting for [their] own space in relation to each other,” something that led to the infamous tension that would split the group up in the late ’90s. Tip may have sculpted most of the backbone of Tribe, but without Phife’s anarchy, it may never have been truly great—and they both knew this. Abdurraqib achingly, beautifully illustrates the evolution of Phife’s role. From Tribe’s debut, People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (in which Phife only raps on a few songs), through the final album of the ’90s era, The Love Movement , Abdurraqib highlights the unique energy Phife brought to the group—the punchlines and disses and movie references and ribald dick-swinging—and how he gradually became a more dominant presence in each subsequent Tribe album, in part because he stood up to Q-Tip, making sure he was given his due. Most of the album lyrics showcased throughout the book are Phife’s own, taken from songs like “Butter,” “Oh My God,” and “The Hop,” to show off his penchant for wordplay, his combative nature, his use of patois, and his lovable self-centeredness. (“You see you, your career is done like Johnny Carson’s/ Get me vexed, I do like Left Eye, start an arson.”) Abdurraqib contrasts Phife’s style with Q-Tip’s: how Tip spit his verses declaratively and confidently while Phife would walk in and bellow an opening line that would sweep away everything that had come before , roaring power versus poised self-assurance. Following Tribe’s sad breakup saga, Abdurraqib even explores Phife’s solo album, Ventilation: Da LP , a vibrant project that was unfortunately nowhere near as successful as other members’ post-Tribe works and eventually fell out of print and into obscurity. But Abdurraqib, a lonely fan of the tape at the time, picks apart the features of Phife’s performance and presence that so resonated with him, to see him win and have his journey be a just artistic triumph:
I loved how bitter you sounded, Phife. I always wanted you to sound like you wanted to prove yourself again. I get that you thought you didn’t get your shine, and I believed you then, and I believed you always. I saw you in interviews, sometimes bursting at your edges to speak, only to be drowned out. I saw you in photos, playing in the background. What you gave in song was so much larger than what you were asked to give outside of it. I was thankful for your anger, Malik. Phife never attained the universal stature outside of Tribe that Q-Tip did—as the go-to assist for acts from Mobb Deep to Kanye—and that only cements his legend with that of Tribe more deeply. As Abdurraqib proves here, there wasn’t much for Phife outside of Tribe, but Tribe was nothing without him. So it’s apt that Go Ahead in the Rain is as much a love letter to Phife as it is to his group and the decade at large, for few embodied the still-beloved ’90s “golden age” of rap and the ethos of Tribe better than Malik: the verbal jabs, the sense of abandon, the vibes and stuff, and most importantly, the constant battle to prove and assert yourself—especially when no one believes in you like you do, and you have to do it all on your own."
2020 election: FEC to decide if nonprofit can offer free cybersecurity to political campaigns. Here’s the catch.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/2020-election-presidential-campaign-cybersecurity-fec-proposal.html,"Even Space Isn’t Safe From Ads After Russian agents stole emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman in 2016 and targeted other candidates with hacks in 2018, political campaigns know they face serious cybersecurity threats. Democratic presidential contenders are already investing in stronger infrastructure. For example, in its first quarter Federal Election Commission filings, Kamala Harris’ campaign reported that it had paid $7,249 to consultants like LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue for unspecified “cyber security services” and $197 to Wickr, an encrypted messaging platform that allows users to auto-delete texts. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign spent $1,077 on secure cloud storage services from Dropbox and Box.com, $455 on the password manager LastPass, and $1,340 on equipment from Yubico, which manufactures hardware for two-factor authentication. Other campaigns have similarly spent thousands of dollars on consultants to help build out their systems. Campaigns have been largely responsible for funding their own cybersecurity, even as the risk has grown and the potential harm from election interference has become clearer. Though these costs are just pocket change for presidential candidates who have already raised millions of dollars, campaigns in state and local races might not have the funds to take such precautions. And those campaigns are under attack too: In 2018, Russian hackers targeted at least three members of Congress, including former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill , who was running for reelection. The FEC is now considering a proposal that might help fix the issue. It would allow campaigns to access free IT services to secure their operations and strengthen the integrity of the country’s election system. The only catch is that a decision in favor of the proposal risks leaving a gaping loophole in campaign finance laws that could provide corporations with yet another way to unduly influence elected officials. Legal experts worry that allowing for too broad an exemption in this case would unintentionally create a loophole. On Thursday, the FEC will again consider a request to allow a nonprofit to offer free and low-cost cybersecurity support to campaigns in the form of software, hardware, tech boot camps, and information-sharing systems. Defending Digital Campaigns, the nonprofit spinoff of a Harvard cybersecurity project founded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, Robby Mook, and Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, submitted the proposal in September. The FEC last discussed the proposal during an open meeting on April 11, and a ruling is likely coming soon. (Defending Digital Campaigns did not respond to Slate’s interview requests.) “What we’re trying to do isn’t really to benefit presidential campaigns,” Rhoades said during the meeting , emphasizing instead that the aim is to help the down-ballot “little guy” campaigns. “When you’re first setting up and you’re first raising those precious hard dollars, the last thing you want to do is to spend them on something to secure your networks.” Based on a cursory examination of first quarter filings, there has been little to no investment in cybersecurity among congressional campaigns. Campaign finance laws typically do not allow corporations to intervene in elections to support or oppose a candidate. Under these rules, Defending Digital Campaigns can’t legally donate products and services. The organization argued in documents submitted to the FEC that it is not seeking to influence the outcomes of elections in a partisan manner and therefore should get an exemption for its activities. It proposes making its cybersecurity support available to “any presidential candidate polling above 5 percent nationally” or any congressional candidates who have raised a certain amount of money or “qualified for the general election ballot.” Defending Digital Campaigns says this supports its claims to be nonpartisan in mission. It also cites voter registration initiatives and candidate debate hosting, which are also exempt from the corporate contribution ban, as precedents. There is bipartisan support for offering campaigns free cybersecurity services. Yet, legal experts worry that allowing for too broad an exemption in this case would unintentionally create a loophole. A month after Defending Digital Campaigns submitted its proposal, the money-in-politics watchdog Campaign Legal Center submitted a comment warning that the draft would “reach a desirable policy outcome by improperly and dangerously bending the law.” The center noted that it was especially concerned with the suggestion to allow Defending Digital Campaigns to provide travel and lodging for on-site boot camps. Campaign Legal Center agrees that there is an urgent need to improve cybersecurity preparedness across the board. However, as its director of federal reform, Brendan Fischer, told Slate, “It’s probably not hard to imagine that corporations would like to provide valuable services to candidates in order to build relationships and then get a call back when a lobbyist calls and requests a meeting.” Campaign Legal Center had similar misgivings about a separate FEC exemption granted to Microsoft in September to provide free packages of enhanced security protections to its election-related customers. Microsoft argued that a breach would tarnish the company’s brand and that gathering data on cyberattacks would be invaluable; thus, the provision of free services was advancing business, rather than partisan, interests. “If that is the standard, then pretty much any corporation could give anything to a candidate, because they always do it for business reasons,” an attorney for the center told Roll Call at the time. Microsoft’s victory prompted another firm, Area 1 Security, to also request an exemption to provide free anti-phishing services to campaigns. If the FEC isn’t careful with its rulings, there is a risk that efforts to provide free cybersecurity could attenuate campaign finance laws. Fischer sees the original justification for the proposed exemption currently before the FEC—that Defending Digital Campaigns is a nonprofit advancing a nonpartisan mission not intended to influence an election—as too broad. Using that logic, the Chamber of Commerce, for example, might be able to justify subsidizing travel and lodging for Democratic and Republican candidates who attend a seminar on free market principles. Fischer hopes the FEC will ultimately grant Defending Digital Campaigns an exemption but more narrowly tailor the legal reasoning for doing so. He co-wrote and submitted a comment to the commission earlier this month suggesting that the exemption would be sound if it applies exclusively to services that will uphold the Federal Election Campaign Act’s ban on foreign participation in elections. Defending Digital Campaigns has indicated that it supports this alternate proposal. Even with this narrower exemption, though, Democratic FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub still seems to have concerns. During the April 11 hearing, Weintraub said , “I would like to support this endeavor. I also have an obligation to protect the law.” When asked if there was a particular abuse of the exemption she was worried about, she replied, “Just a long history of things that seem reasonable at the time, and then somebody else comes along and says, ‘Aha! Now they’ve said that, I can do this.’ ” Weintraub’s colleagues appear to be less apprehensive about granting the exemption, but all four of the commissioners currently heading the FEC would need to vote in favor of the proposal for it to pass. As the political trade publication Campaigns & Elections notes, the FEC has already held meetings on this matter four times, so the commission is likely nearing a ruling. "
Facebook just hired the co-author of the Patriot Act.,slate.com,April Glaser,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/facebook-new-general-counsel-patriot-act.html,"Even Space Isn’t Safe From Ads Facebook made some new hires this week. On Monday, the company shared that it’s bringing on Jennifer Newstead to join the company as its general counsel. Newstead comes to Facebook from the State Department, where Trump appointed her as its top lawyer in 2017. She is perhaps best known for her role as one of the primary engineers of the Patriot Act and her success selling the bill to Congress in the days following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as John Yoo outlines in his 2006 book, War by Other Means . The Patriot Act opened the doors to massive expansions of government surveillance, authorizing the National Security Agency to collect the phone call data of virtually everyone in the United States. The post-9/11 law also expanded the federal government’s ability to secretly demand Americans’ personal data from internet companies. Last year, Facebook shared that U.S. government demands for user data rose 27 percent from 2017 to 2018. In the first half of 2018, Facebook received more than 42,000 requests from the U.S. government for user data. Now, it will be Newstead, the same person who helped expand the government’s power to demand access to your data, who is tasked with attempting to narrow or reject such requests on the behalf of Facebook users. Cold comfort at best. Newstead is also taking the helm as federal regulators are grappling with how to hold Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg accountable for seriously mishandling the personal data of its users. Beyond the Cambridge Analytica scandal—which revealed that the voter targeting firm hired by the Trump campaign had inappropriately accessed the data of as many as 87 million Facebook users and forced Zuckerberg to testify to Congress—we’ve recently learned that hundreds of millions of users ’ personal information has been improperly stored and exposed by the company for years. Newstead’s predecessor, Colin Stretch, represented Facebook in congressional hearings in 2017 when the company was called in to answer questions about Russian operatives’ use of its platform during the 2016 election. Those hearings led to more rounds of questions from lawmakers in 2018. In both hearings, many Republicans have spent some of their time accusing Facebook of harboring a pro-liberal bias. Newstead’s conservative bona fides may come in handy in deflecting those concerns. Facebook is clearly gearing up for what may be another year of target practice from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. The day after the Newstead announcement, news broke that Facebook made a very different hire: Kevin Bankston, the director of the Open Technology Institute at New America, a D.C. think tank, announced he would join Facebook as its director of privacy policy.* (Disclosure: New America is a partner with Slate and Arizona State University in Future Tense, and Bankston has written for Future Tense . I also previously worked at New America.) Before joining New America, Bankston worked at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (another place I have worked), where he advocated for reforms limiting surveillance permitted under the Patriot Act. According to disclosures on its website , New America has received between $50,000 and $99,999 from Facebook—a relatively small amount compared with other donors. Bankston has been supportive of privacy legislation . He has also said that he believes passing legislation forcing transparency about what data is being collected should be a priority for Congress and that new rules on data portability, the idea that you can take your data with you when you leave a social media site, should also be considered. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica drama last year, Bankston wrote on Twitter that “transparency is especially important to focus on b/c it addresses what the public seems most upset about here: not so much ‘privacy’ but the possibility they were *manipulated*.” Bankston also was with the Open Technology Institute when the organization signed on to a letter with a coalition of civil rights groups stressing the importance of addressing how data collection and subsequent profiling enables discrimination against marginalized communities. Facebook is clearly gearing up for what may be another year of target practice from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who appear to be moving toward consensus that the social media network has some serious problems it needs to address—from user privacy to disinformation to discriminatory ad targeting to just generally muddying our civic life. Making sure that any legislation that’s adopted doesn’t harm Facebook’s bottom line will mean having players on its team who can hit a home run no matter who’s pitching.
Correction, April 24, 2019: This article misstated that Facebook shared the news of Kevin Bankston’s new position. Bankston announced his new role in a blog post."
Do You Want to Buy a Murder Bird?,slate.com,Shannon Palus,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/killer-cassowary-is-for-sale-with-rest-of-flock.html,"We Just Named a Blind Amphibian After Donald Trump. Should We Have? A flock of cassowaries—birds the size of human beings with talons like a velociraptor’s—will be available via auction in Florida this Saturday. These birds need a new home because one of them killed their owner when he fell between their cages on April 12. Reporting on the impending murder-bird sale for the New York Times , Liam Stack writes that authorities “expressed almost universal surprise at both their presence in the county and their role in a local death.” The birds are typically found in Australia and Southeast Asia, but their now-deceased owner kept a flock of them on his property, along with about 100 other exotic animals, under an agricultural permit. It is unclear who, exactly, might be in the market for a cassowary. But if you want to be a pet parent to one of these birds, here is some advice: 1. Stay away from their feet. Their talons can be more than 4 inches long, and the birds can kick even when knocked out with drugs, according to a guide to captive cassowary management. 2. Also stay away from their wings. Cassowaries can’t fly; their wings are rather short and stubby for their size, and more fat than muscle. But each one 3. Actually, just avoid all parts of the bird. “They may also peck, barge or head-butt,” writes paleontologist Darren Naish in Scientific American . Their heads feature a large horn thing, sometimes called a helmet, but it sort of looks like a giant wrinkly fingernail . The inside is spongy, but the tough edge could really do some damage. 4. Give them private enclosures. Cassowaries are solitary. If you, or any creature, gets too close, you’ll know because when confronted, “the body and neck are stretched vertically, the feathers from the rump forward are raised at the same time so that the bird appears larger, and a rumbling call is given,” according to a 1976 paper . Sometimes they also hiss. 5. Should one escape, realize you probably will not be able to catch it. They can run 30 miles an hour, and jump nearly seven feet, according to the San Diego Zoo. 6. Don’t let them into the house. In 2016, a cassowary locally known as Peanut wandered into an unlocked beach home in Australia. The owners ducked behind a dining room table, took a few photos, and remained unscathed. But the real worry this couple had was of the cassowary’s bodily functions. “I’m just so glad he didn’t do a poo because they are massive and because cassowaries eat quite a few berries their poo is quite purple and it would stain the floor,” the woman later told the Cairns Post . 7. Ply them with fruit. They are “frugivores,” and actually rather good at distributing seeds through their poo, which makes them valuable to plant life. As noted, though they are dangerous, they’re not trying to hunt you for food—they’re just territorial. 8. Maybe, actually, amid the precautions, feel empathy for them. Before the recent events, there hadn’t been a report of a cassowary killing a human since 1926. The birds are considered endangered in Australia thanks to humans encroaching on their habitat and hitting them with cars . Maybe the real flightless flabby-winged murder bird is … us? 9. Here’s a fun idea for a sign to put up outside your home: “ Be Cass-o-wary .”"

Trump promising to pardon lawbreakers is no joke.,slate.com,Eugene R. Fidell,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/congress-trump-pardon-kevin-mcaleenan-dhs.html,"The Supreme Court Is Poised to Shred Its Credibility to Let Trump Rig the Census The week since the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report has felt like a whirlwind, with Congress considering how next to approach the unresolved questions raised about the conduct of Donald Trump and his administration, and the nation bracing for a potentially historic subpoena fight. At the same time, news around the Mueller report has overtaken news of another possible abuse of power by this president—allegations that Trump promised to pardon an official if he broke the law at the president’s request. While the episode has been written off by some as a joke, it is no such thing: Congress has an obligation to investigate these allegations as much as anything in the Mueller report. The episode in question came to light earlier this month, when CNN reported that Trump had told Kevin McAleenan, who at the time was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, that “he would grant [McAleenan] a pardon if he were sent to jail for having border agents block asylum seekers from entering the US in defiance of US law.” CNN cited “two officials briefed on the exchange” who thought it “not clear if the comment was a joke.” The New York Times, citing “three people briefed about the conversation,” reported that “it was possible Mr. Trump had intended the comments to McAleenan as a joke.” The Department of Homeland Security denied the story, as did press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the president himself—in a tweet. Since the events in question, McAleenan has been promoted to acting secretary of Homeland Security. The Atlantic ended its story on the CNN report with an important question about such a presidential promise: “What would it mean for the rule of law in the United States if officials listened?” Whether or not they listened, it is a serious matter. The president has no authority to induce underlings to break the law with the promise of a preemptive pardon. To be clear, there is no question that the constitutional pardon power is broad. It covers all federal crimes, both civilian and military, committed by individuals dead and alive—although it doesn’t cover state crimes, and it is generally understood that a president cannot pardon himself. A pardon need not even identify the crime being pardoned. Gerald Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon, certainly the broadest in American history, extended to “all offenses against the United States which he … has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969, through August 9, 1974.” While Nixon’s pardoned crimes were only vaguely described, the final day on which they could have been committed was the day he resigned from office, more than a year before the pardon was granted. Crucially, the very terms of the Nixon pardon make clear that it applied only to criminal conduct that had already taken place. Most of the controversy at the time involved whether the president could pardon a crime before conviction, but it is now generally understood that the president may issue preemptive pardons—that is, pardons before there has been a conviction, or even an indictment. A pardon need not even identify the crime being pardoned. There are many examples of this, from George Washington’s 1795 “general pardon” of participants in the Whiskey Rebellion, to Benjamin Harrison’s 1893 pardon of Mormons living in unlawful polygamy, Jimmy Carter’s 1977 pardon of Vietnam draft-resisters who fled to Canada, and George H.W. Bush’s 1992 pardon of former government officials who had been indicted in the Iran-Contra affair. As the Supreme Court stated in an 1866 case involving a post–Civil War pardon, the pardon power “extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency or after conviction and judgment.” (Emphasis added.) As implied by this precedent, though, granting a pardon before a crime has been prosecuted is a far cry from promising one before a crime has even occurred. In the case at hand, the promise of a pardon in the event of some future criminal act certainly sounds like it might itself be a crime, but it is at least an abuse of presidential power to offer an inducement to break the law. A pardon granted before a crime has been committed is reminiscent of the British monarchs’ long-abolished power of dispensation, which was frequently used in the Middle Ages, and is described by one authoritative text on English constitutional law as “an anticipatory exercise of the undoubted right of the king to pardon individual offenders.” It was abolished in 1689 when Parliament, in the English Bill of Rights, declared illegal “the pretended power of dispensing of laws or the execution of laws by regall authoritie.” Some might argue that an anticipatory pardon is no different from the thoroughly uncontroversial exercise of prosecutorial discretion, or the setting of standards for deciding when cases will be pursued and when they will not. The analogy doesn’t work because a pardon binds all subsequent administrations, while a decision not to prosecute does not even bind the administration that makes it. A pardon, in other words, is forever—and goes way beyond merely prioritizing the use of limited prosecutorial resources. In any event, Trump’s offer, as reported, in no way resembles prosecutorial forbearance. Congress needs to determine whether Trump said what CNN and the New York Times reported. If he did, it was no joke. Support our journalism

"Stephen Moore Might Be a Slimebag, but Let’s Not Forget That His Economic Ideas Are Terrible Too",slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/business/2019/04/stephen-moore-economic-policy-terrible.html,"One Reason So Many Democrats Are Running for President: They Don’t Think Joe Biden Can Win Stephen Moore is apparently upset that the media isn’t focusing on his economic ideas. I know this because he keeps bringing it up. “I was so honored when I got the call from Donald Trump. But all it’s been since then has been one personal assault after another and a kind of character assassination having nothing to do with economics,” the potential Federal Reserve nominee recently complained to a conservative radio station. “They’re pulling a Kavanaugh against me.” (Moore’s tax troubles , messy divorce , and back catalog of sexist magazine columns have dominated headlines about him lately.) This week, he even wrote to Politico with a reporting suggestion . “You should do a column about why no one wants to talk about my economic ideas, which is why the sleaze campaign is their only hope,” he told them. As is often the case, Moore is spouting nonsense here. Plenty of writers have already panned his economic ideas. But since he’s so insistent, I’m happy to explain once again why his notions about central banking are a joke. Moore, a former Trump campaign adviser who spent most of his professional life preaching the wonders of tax cuts, has admitted on at least a couple of occasions that he is “not an expert” on monetary policy. And it shows: His public comments on the topic over the years have mostly been limited to obvious partisan hackery . While Barack Obama was in office, Moore warned about phantom inflation and argued that the Fed should raise interest rates (which would have likely throttled the economy). Now that Donald Trump is in office, he has started warning about phantom deflation and argued that the Fed should cut interest rates (which would likely boost the economy). But recently, Moore does seem to have adopted one Big Idea about how the the world’s most powerful central bank should do its job. In a March Wall Street Journalop-ed, he argued that policymakers ought to peg interest rates to a basket of commodity prices. As he put it:
The Fed should stabilize the value of the dollar by adopting the commodity-price rule used successfully by former Fed chief Paul Volcker. To break the crippling inflation of the 1970s, Mr. Volcker linked Fed monetary policy to real-time changes in commodity prices. When commodity prices rose, Mr. Volcker saw inflation coming and increased interest rates. When commodities fell in price, he lowered rates. Moore seems to have made up this bit about Volcker, who told the Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell that he did not remember ever using the kind of rule Moore described. (There is zero historical evidence he ever did such a thing either.) The bigger issue, however, is that making decisions about interest rates based on commodity prices is a potentially disastrous concept. In practice, it’s essentially a slightly souped-up version of the gold standard, another long discredited idea Moore previously said he supported. (He recently claimed not to remember ever having done so, but a lot of the supply siders Moore came up with in the 1980s were gold bugs .) The Fed would pick a basket of goods like oil, wheat, corn, copper, and so forth. If their prices rose, it would hike interest rates (thereby slowing down the economy). If their prices dropped, it would cut interest rates (thereby speeding up the economy). It’s hard to say exactly why Moore thinks this is an optimal way to run the economy. He suggests it would “stabilize” the value of the dollar, which isn’t really true, since other countries’ currencies would still be free to fluctuate against it. The main benefit seems to be that if the Fed were following the rule in recent months, it would have cut interest rates, which would make Donald Trump happy. Either way, Moore is not the first person to suggest the concept. Economists batted it around in the 1980s and 1990s— based on the theory that commodity prices might be a leading indicator that could tell us whether inflation was around the corner—before mostly deciding it was a bad idea. The reason why is obvious: Global commodity prices fluctuate for lots of reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the United States. And as a rule, central bankers want to base their decisions based on things that have something to do with their own country’s economy. If rebels set fire to a pipeline in Nigeria or Iran gets sanctioned, oil gets more expensive. Soybeans, steel, and cement prices are driven by growth in China. There is absolutely no reason why the Federal Reserve should be making choices about whether to raise or lower interest rates based on the demand for beef in Chengdu. Our current crop of central bankers (mostly) understands all of this. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, known as the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index , excludes food and energy prices because they are so volatile. Instead, it includes goods and services with prices that fluctuate more based on demand in the actual U.S., like housing, medical care, clothes, and education. Moore wants to do the exact opposite. And what would happen if the Fed did follow a rule like Moore suggests? Over the past few years, it would have made some absolutely atrocious decisions. For instance, it would have had to hike interest rates in late 2008, just as the economy was getting ready to explode, because of the China-driven commodity boom. It would have also had to hike interest rates in 2011, when the economy was still gasping for air, essentially because of skyrocketing oil prices. That was the fateful mistake central bankers made in the European Union ; it helped turn the recession into a disastrous depression the continent still hasn’t quite recovered from. Produced by FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Just to make absolutely sure I wasn’t missing something, I called up Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard’s Kennedy School whose research has shown that commodity prices at least respond somewhat to monetary policy moves. He’s argued that central banks in countries that are economically dependent on commodity exports might want to formally base their interest rate moves partly on the price moves of that commodity. This makes some intuitive sense, since a lot of countries have to do that informally anyway (when the price of oil crashes, for instance, Russia sometimes needs to hike interest rates to keep the ruble from disastrously cratering with it). But if there was any argument whatsoever for doing it in a country with a large, diversified, heavily services-based economy like the U.S., I figured Frankel might have thought of it. So, is there? No, there is not. “You could say it has advantages over the gold standard, but it has the same sort of nuttiness,” Frankel told me. Moore may wish people were talking about his economic ideas, rather than how he refused to pay alimony or how he hates women’s sports. But it doesn’t really make him look any better."
Joe Biden joins a 2020 field full of candidates who don’t think he can win.,slate.com,Jim Newell,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/joe-biden-2020-democrats.html,"Mueller Proved Comey Told the Truth Joe Biden is finally, officially getting into the race. If you want to get a sense of how threatened other presidential aspirants feel about this, consider their own decisions. Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton joined the race this week, just a couple of weeks after his House colleagues Eric Swalwell (California) and Tim Ryan (Ohio) did the same. Beto O’Rourke, Jay Inslee, and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper entered in March, joining Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Tulsi Gabbard, John Delaney, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, and Cory Booker. Michael Bennet, Bill de Blasio, Steve Bullock, and Stacey Abrams are still weighing their options, so let’s safely say at least two out of four of them will go for it. The story of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary so far has been the historic size of the field, which will end up in the mid-20s before all is said and done. And the size of the field is, in large part, a reflection of how Democratic politicians view Joe Biden: as a paper tiger, whose fall will make the nomination anyone’s for the taking. Candidates jump into the presidential race for all different reasons: to actually become president, yes, but also to raise their national profiles for the vice presidency, Cabinet positions, book releases, and cable news contributor agreements. And yet, when Democratic senators and governors had a similar opportunity in 2016, the only mainstream opponent willing to challenge Hillary Clinton was former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. (How’d that profile-raising work out for him?) The field in 2016 was so small not because politicians with national aspirations didn’t exist, but because they thought Clinton—with her name recognition, financial resources, party relationships, high early polling numbers, and general next-in-line aura—was inevitable. She cleared the field of most competition because other mainstream candidates knew she would win (and non-mainstream Bernie figured she would too). The size of the field is a reflection of how Democratic politicians view Joe Biden: as a paper tiger. Biden is something more like a 2016 Jeb Bush: a weak establishment favorite whose time might be past and—should voters deprioritize his top perceived strength, electability—who could soon face the wolves. He leads in national and some early state polling, but not by much. The only potential candidates who’ve bowed out because Biden took their space were Terry McAuliffe and Michael Bloomberg. And though he may have far more charisma than Bush did, the financial resources will be harder to come by. Biden’s biggest challenge in the primary will be a compromised past spanning nearly 50 years. The vetting process he’ll face in the Democratic Party of 2019 will not be even close to the vetting he faced during his last campaign in 2008—and, let’s face it, as a middling-to-lower-tier candidate then, he didn’t face much vetting at all. The crime bill that he authored in 1994 is considered by the modern iteration of the party to have been an embarrassment, as is his handling of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination. Some of his anti-busing rhetoric from the 1970s was, even by the standards of 1970s anti-busing rhetoric, astonishing . As a senator who for 36 years represented Delaware, a small fiefdom run by banks, his economic record has more than a few blemishes, such as his support for the 2005 bankruptcy reform bill, one of the slimiest pieces of legislation passed this century. In the first presidential primary since 2004 where past votes regarding the Iraq war shouldn’t be an issue among major candidates, simply because it was so long ago, there’s Joe Biden, with a vote for the Iraq War on his record. The size of the field is a representation of the candidates’ belief that all of this will sink Biden, unlocking the tentative support of roughly one-third of the party for the taking. The field’s bet on Biden’s fallibility is now shared among the punditry too. Everything Biden does will be interpreted through the same knowing lens that he’s out of his element and it’s a pity no one was able to dissuade him from launching this last, egotistical crusade. That was the interpretation when , in his first public appearance after allegations of inappropriate touching, he cracked a couple of jokes about how he had gotten permission to give hugs. Even the delay in his launch this week prompted another round of head-shaking, when his initial plan to kick off the campaign on Wednesday in Charlottesville, Virginia, followed by a couple of rallies in Pennsylvania, was scrapped in favor of a video launch on Thursday and a Pittsburgh rally next week. Every miscue in Biden’s campaign will be viewed in the press as a development toward the inevitable tanking. The question is: Are politicians and obsessive political observers right? Apart from the press, no one cares whether Biden launches his campaign on Wednesday or Thursday, via video or at a rally. And Biden’s numbers following the inappropriate touching allegations were barely affected. That’s why I’ve never fully bought the interpretation that Biden is foolish—pathetic, even—to go down this path. What if enough primary voters hear all of the scrutiny of Biden’s past, and all of the declarations that he’s out of touch with the party’s present and future, and … still like him anyway? What if none of this matters, because Democratic primary voters—who might be becoming more ideological, but still aren’t as discriminating as Republicans , and definitely aren’t as left as Fox News would have you think—like him, remember his time in the Obama administration fondly, and think he’s their best chance at beating Donald Trump, regardless of what he said or did in 1975, 1991, 1994, 2002, 2005, or 2019? Other candidates have made the bet that Biden’s collapse is inevitable. But it’s just a bet. Support our journalism

White supremacist John William King executed for racially motivated 1998 murder of James Byrd.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/white-supremacist-john-william-king-executed-racist-hate-crime-murder-james-byrd.html,"The Press Didn’t Just Report Accurately on Trump-Russia Corruption. It Prevented the Corruption From Being Worse. White supremacist John William King, whose gruesome murder of James Byrd Jr. changed how the U.S. prosecutes hate crimes, was put to death Wednesday in Texas. The execution by lethal injection was carried out 21 years after King, in his early twenties at the time, and two other white men killed 49-year-old Byrd, who is black, in Jasper, Texas. The murder shocked the nation and prompted a push to strengthen hate crime legislation. After a five-day trial in January 1999, a jury convicted King of capital murder in two-and-a-half hours. King was sentenced to death, the first instance that a white man had been given the death penalty for killing a black person in modern Texas history. Despite the conviction, King sat on death row for two decades for the racially motivated murder. From the New York Times:
Early on a Sunday morning in 1998, Mr. King and two other white men attacked Mr. Byrd, a 49-year-old black man who had been offered a ride home in a sinister gesture of neighborliness. The men beat him, spray-painted his face, chained him to the back of a pickup truck and dragged him to his death on an isolated back road. The motive seemed shockingly clear-cut: Mr. King, who had come out of a stint in prison, was a committed white supremacist, his body a billboard of racist tattoos, including one depicting a black man hanged in a noose. Byrd’s killing prompted Texas, in 2001, to pass the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, stiffening penalties for hate crimes. In 2009, President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act , making it easier for the federal government to prosecute hate crimes."
"The black feminists behind #YourSlipIsShowing, a campaign against Twitter trolls masquerading as women of color with the fake hashtag #EndFathersDay.",slate.com,,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/black-feminists-alt-right-twitter-gamergate.html,"Shafiqah Hudson found herself horrified by how easily people on social media could be lured into believing a stereotype of black women. Siena Mae Cover Story Users The Black Feminists Who Saw the Alt-Right Threat Coming Before Gamergate, before the 2016 election, they launched a campaign against Twitter trolls masquerading as women of color. If only more people had paid attention. By Rachelle Hampton April 23, 2019 5:45 AM Shafiqah Hudson remembers the moment she realized something was off. She saw a tweet from an account she had never seen before: “#EndFathersDay because I’m tired of all these white women stealing our good black mens.” Something about the grammar—not to mention the idea that black women wanted to abolish Father’s Day because of interracial dating—just felt too cartoonish to be real. That day, Hudson, who tweets as @sassycrass, had a job interview. It was June of 2014, the Friday before Father’s Day. As she typed out her follow-up thank-you note and went through what she calls “the unemployment shuffle,” toggling between social media and email and playing with her cat, she spotted some reactions from people she followed to other suspiciously inflammatory tweets posted by a handful of new Twitter accounts claiming to be black feminists. “#EndFathersDay,” read one. “We’ll bring it back when men stop raping and killing us.” Advertisement Hudson began to dig, following “this trail of terrible tweets.” She asked if anyone on her timeline had any idea what was up. No one she knew could verify that the women behind these accounts actually existed. No one had met them in person or encountered them on earlier blogging platforms like LiveJournal or Tumblr or BlackPlanet. Many of the accounts didn’t follow the feminists they were parroting or even the tastemakers of Black Twitter, like Desus and Mero. But more than anything, Hudson said, the clearest red flag was the accounts’ inability to hide their contempt for the very people they were attempting to imitate. They tweeted about collecting welfare checks and smoking weed, with an occasional screed against white people. And most of these accounts spoke a version of African American Vernacular English that no real black person had ever used. “#EndFathersDay,” said one, “until men start seeing they children as more then just ‘fuck trophies.’ ” To casual observers online, #EndFathersDay appeared to be the work of militant feminists, most of whom were seemingly women of color. To Hudson, the ruse was never anything but transparent. “No one who knew or liked a black feminist,” she told me, “was fooled.” But the hashtag was already trending worldwide. She had a hunch that many of the Twitter accounts were fake. They had handles like @NayNayCantStop, @LatrineWatts, and @CisHate, and bios like “ Queer + black + angry .” They dropped words like intersectional and patriarchy . And Hudson found herself horrified by how easily people on social media could be lured into believing a stereotype of black women. While she watched a credulous rage build online, not just against these fake Twitter accounts but against the black feminists she called friends, her own anger grew as well: “No one is going to come into my house and start breaking shit,” she said. The mockery #EndFathersDay made of an increasingly influential online feminist movement became predictable catnip to conservatives. Tucker Carlson devoted a segment to it. Ashe Schow in the Washington Examiner called it the latest “drivel” “from the feminist outrage machine.” Dan McLaughlin tweeted that the hashtag was “a neat illustration of the cultural trajectory of progressivism.” “#EndFathersDay Because it’s really just Second Caregiver of Unspecified Gender Identity Day, you cisnormative a**holes,” mocked Ben Shapiro. What these commentators were missing was that the #EndFathersDay campaign was a hoax, started by anonymous trolls on 4chan to engender exactly the vitriol that pundits so readily stepped up to spew. Exposing #EndFathersDay ultimately took the work of a group of black women who were determined not to let the ruse spiral, sensing just how poisonous this kind of trolling could be. And yet, in the years since, even as journalists have publicly asked themselves how they missed the rising threat posed by far-right extremists radicalized online, somehow one of the earliest crowdsourced anti-misinformation campaigns on the internet has been mostly ignored by the mainstream media. To I’Nasah Crockett, who, along with Hudson, helped uncover the #EndFathersDay hoax, watching the events of the past few years has made her feel like she was “a canary in a coal mine.” Advertisement Like Shafiqah Hudson, Crockett had an early inkling that something was fishy with #EndFathersDay. She’d long been an active Tumblr user, where she said it wasn’t an entirely uncommon phenomenon for white users to claim blackness in an attempt to win an argument, and so she had developed an instinct for certain kinds of sock-puppeting—that sense, in her words, of “OK, this does not feel organic, this does not feel like a real [person], this feels like a harassment campaign.” Crockett knew that Tumblr posts from so-called social justice warriors would often find their way onto 4chan, where trolls would coordinate brigading campaigns, sending violent anonymous messages in an effort to bully “SJWs” off the website. By the time #EndFathersDay began to trend, she had installed a stat counter on her Tumblr page so that whenever she was getting a lot of traffic from 4chan or Reddit, she could brace herself for a wave of harassment. Much of it was garden-variety internet vitriol: “kill yourself” and an assortment of slurs. But she’d found that some of the abusive messages were also written in faux African American Vernacular English, seemingly an attempt to make black users think their own community was attacking them. As Crockett, who tweets under the handle @so_treu, scrolled through Twitter, she also spotted a new hashtag that some other women were already using to flag “black feminist” accounts they suspected of being trolls: #YourSlipIsShowing. It was a hashtag Shafiqah Hudson had created. Rooted in the particular Southern black dialect of the South Florida community where Hudson grew up, the phrase “Your slip is showing” refers to something that’s meant to be concealed but is, embarrassingly, on full display. In this new context, it took on another layer of meaning: Along with outing the imitators among black feminists, #YourSlipIsShowing exposed the malice those imitators felt toward the very people they were attempting to mimic. Hudson was the first to use the hashtag, but soon a whole group of black feminists was combing through the #EndFathersDay tweets, retweeting the accounts they believed were masquerading as black women and adding #YourSlipIsShowing. They posted screenshots of accounts that were falsely using photos of black women they knew, including former BuzzFeed writer Heben Nigatu. They responded to other users who had expressed incredulity at #EndFathersDay and encouraged them to search the handle of any account they thought was fake with #YourSlipIsShowing to see if anyone had outed them. Advertisement Crockett, meanwhile, starting Googling around, and soon enough, she found the source from which #EndFathersDay had sprung: the original 4chan post outlining the fake hashtag as part of a crusade by men’s rights activists, pickup artists, and miscellaneous misogynists hoping to capitalize on previously existing rifts in the online feminist movement related to race and class. On 4chan threads, users said things like “I’ve had hundreds of nigs chimp out at me over this [fake tweet]. This turned out way better than expected :)” and “the more you do it the less effective it is going to be when we launch a proper attack. making them question each other is great but i want to make them hate each other.” Using the tag #YourSlipIsShowing, Crockett posted screenshots from 4chan to Twitter as evidence of the premeditation behind the hoax. As more and more black women in the same orbit began to notice the new hashtag, the tool Hudson had created gained traction. “I didn’t have to ask anybody to help,” Hudson said. “Once they saw the hashtag, they were like, OK, so what are we doing? Let’s do it.” Women with many thousands of followers—like black feminist writersMikki Kendall, Feminista Jones, and Jamilah Lemieux—picked up the hashtag, spreading it beyond Hudson’s immediate circle. Many of these women had never met each other in person before they joined forces to root out troll accounts—and according to Hudson, some hadn’t even directly interacted on Twitter. As the women blocked users and shared their block lists with each other, they found that the vitriol in their mentions, which had driven other black women off Twitter completely, decreased. Within days of the creation of #YourSlipIsShowing, Crockett, Hudson, and others had documented a small army of fake accounts numbering in the hundreds—accounts that users could not only cross-reference with their followers but also mass-report to Twitter. But despite the evidence that harassment campaigns fueled by a noxious mixture of misogyny and racism spelled out a threat to users from vulnerable groups, Hudson and Crockett felt that Twitter basically did nothing. At most, the company suspended a few of the mass-reported accounts tagged under #YourSlipIsShowing. (According to Twitter, the company’s long-standing harassment policy, which gets updated sporadically, is designed to protect users from “brigading attacks.” Last year, the company also updated its policy against fake accounts to clarify that no one is allowed to use misleading bios to “engage in spamming, abusive, or disruptive behavior, including attempts to manipulate the conversations on Twitter.”) To Hudson and Crockett, Twitter’s actions felt like too little, too late: In combating #EndFathersDay, they were on their own. Advertisement When Hudson and Crockett first connected on Twitter over #YourSlipIsShowing, Hudson had been following Crockett since 2010 or 2011, but they’d never actually met in person. (They still haven’t.) Crockett, who describes herself as an “indie public scholar,” was living at home in Atlanta at the time. Crockett now lives in North Carolina; Hudson asked that her current home not be mentioned, in order to help protect her identity. They had several of the degrees-of-separation connections that link many black feminists who have been blogging and tweeting since the mid-2000s. Hudson was working as a freelance writer, mostly about pop culture and race. She was also, she laughs, “on Twitter way more than somebody who doesn’t get paid to be there should be,” in large part because the platform had been important to her professionally. For Crockett, too, social media was central to her life. She’d found her history Ph.D. program at Vanderbilt to be lonely and frustrating. But Tumblr and Twitter were where she encountered a network of black women who were genuinely interested in ideas about race and culture in a way she felt her university was not. Crockett thinks it was in part her academic background that spurred her to dig deeper into #EndFathersDay and to look for connections among different troll accounts—and to theorize that it was not a one-off hoax, but the result of concerted surveillance of her community. Advertisement Hudson and Crockett both grew up in the South. (Crockett is originally from Atlanta.) Hudson called me honey in conversation with an ease that reminded me of my own family’s Southern roots. And to Hudson, the phrase “Your slip is showing” contains a particular kind of gleeful, patently Southern condescension. Disdain is barely hidden beneath the sweetness, like the smirk you might wear when you tell someone, “Bless your heart.” When she was first contemplating what to call the new hashtag, Hudson thought about a play on wig-snatching as a metaphor for unmasking posers. She figured that was overused, though, and besides, it didn’t quite feel right. “One of my favorite aspects of #YourSlipIsShowing is that it’s funny,” she explained. “It’s something that your meemaw would say, it’s church. I love that something that your big ma would say to you is essentially weaponized. That’s the kind of world I want to live in, where you can combat true maliciousness and racism and ick with good manners and good humor.” #EndFathersDay and the corrective rise of #YourSlipIsShowing is the story of a community that, mostly ignored by institutions, chose to fight back with the limited tools available. But despite all their efforts, Hudson, Crockett, and the other black feminists watched as the very same 4chan boards that had birthed #EndFathersDay spawned a new misogynistic harassment campaign mere months later: Gamergate. They watched as women like Zelda Williams and Zoë Quinn were aggressively bullied by accounts using many of the same tactics deployed during #EndFathersDay. And eventually, they watched as the 2016 election campaign unfolded and the very same forces that had been antagonizing them for years rebranded themselves as the alt-right. It wasn’t just Twitter that seemed initially reluctant to take the problem seriously. In the years after #YourSlipIsShowing began, some media outlets diminished the danger of “trolls” by characterizing their flirtation with white nationalism as tongue-in-cheek—until those trolls took their rhetoric offline and onto the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia. Whitney Phillips, a Syracuse professor of online ethics who has written extensively about what she calls “subcultural trolling,” authored a 2018report about how the media amplified the messages of hate groups in both the runup to and in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election; in her report, multiple journalists described feeling like they’d made light of the rhetoric they’d seen online, operating under an assumption that real, violent hatred and ironic provocation were separate worlds. As one Gawker reporter told Phillips, “Every once in a while I’ll look back and see something that I wrote a year and a half ago and the pit of my stomach falls, because … I was joking about these trolls.” Gawker wasn’t alone: A few months before the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, for instance, one Intercept investigative reporter tweeted , “hot take: people who write the laws that govern society, from war to taxes to pollution to wages, should be more of a focus than anime nazis.” Another journalist agreed : “Elevating fringe trolls to serve as foils is pathetic. You’ve been duped.” But to Hudson and Crockett and the other black feminists behind #YourSlipIsShowing, the idea that violent speech on the internet could easily translate to an actual physical threat was never a question. “If your body … has never been subject to this kind of racist violence, if you have never been under threat because of how you look or who you are in the world, then you’re going to be less inclined to take attacks against other people’s bodies very seriously,” said Phillips. “Because for you your body has only been a vessel of safety … those women [who created #YourSlipIsShowing] understood in an embodied, visceral way that this is not playful trolling … the majority of people didn’t pay attention.” Advertisement What Crockett found on 4chan showed how coordinated and deliberate “trolling” could be—and how dangerous. In the recesses of 4chan message boards, she saw users discussing #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen, the hashtag started by Mikki Kendall, the black feminist writer, in early 2014 to pinpoint how whiteness was centered in many conversations about feminism—specifically, she found 4chan users noting how that hashtag had exposed deep fissures among online feminists along racial lines. Users on 4chan had seemingly been observing the tensions among black and white feminists online and decided that creating fake accounts for black feminists was one way to further stoke those tensions by painting black feminists as hysterical and radical. One user mentioned Kendall’s hashtag as a reason why #EndFathersDay seemed, to them, to be working: “[#EndFathersDay] is the perfect response to #solidarityisforwhitewomen.” When Crockett began posting screenshots of 4chan threads on Twitter, she was met with violent threats. “Ok we need to doxx this nigress,” read one anonymous message . “Find out her address, workplace, even where any of her niglets go to school. If she’s anywhere in my state I’ll pay her a visit.” Hudson received a call from one of her former places of employment, which 4channers had called to complain that she was “misusing company property” by outing trolls on company time. Both of them received rape and death threats. “It got real extra,” Hudson said. “It got … scary and dark. That’s what we’re dealing with, that kind of level of malevolence.” It’s now conventional wisdom that today’s hateful right-wing trolling has its roots in Gamergate. Gamergate, argued a 2015 BuzzFeed piece , “first revealed … that under the modern internet’s surface layer of samey platforms and feel-good cultural consensus, burbled, in chans and subreddits and forums and anonymous networks and IRC, a reservoir of opposition to its values.” Gamergate, declared a 2018 Salon essay , was the beginning of “a very dark turn in American conservatism.” Gamergate, observed Politico Magazine in 2017, was the moment that “hardened anti-political correctness sentiment on 4Chan.” But as the media has pieced together the story of the alt-right’s rise, #EndFathersDay has been a key omission. This feels particularly notable in light of the fact that Quinn, arguably the main target of Gamergate, not only quotes Hudson in her book, Crash Override , but also specifically cites #EndFathersDay as a precursor to “similar disinformation tactics used during GamerGate, and later during the 2016 presidential election.” Advertisement The first time Hudson saw the hashtag she had created break through to a wider cultural audience, she was, as she describes it, “between addresses.” It was November 2017, a rough time for her financially and personally. On an episode of Full Frontal With Samantha Bee about the influence of Russian bots and trolls on the 2016 election, Bee gave a shoutout to #YourSlipIsShowing and the black women who popularized it. In the segment, she describes Russia’s efforts to sway black voters by fueling the racial tensions that are already so close to the surface of American life. Specifically, Bee mentioned the phony social media campaign “ Blacktivist ,” which was found to be linked to the Russian government and whose Facebook page had more likes than the official Black Lives Matter Facebook page. Bee drew a direct line between Blacktivist and the account Hudson and Crockett had noticed three years prior: “In 2014,” Bee said, “black women began marking accounts they thought were bots posing as black users with the hashtag #YourSlipIsShowing.” Hudson doesn’t have basic cable. When she first saw the segment, it was through a screenshot a friend tweeted at her. She remembers feeling a wash of emotions: a deep sadness at the scale of the problem, vindication because she had never imagined anything “so grandiose” when she first created the hashtag, and finally, feeling “extra broke” and at a loss as to how to turn this work into income. Crockett felt similarly torn. On one hand, Bee didn’t mention either her or Hudson, attributing the hashtag to “black women” on Twitter generally. But Crockett said, “Ultimately, I appreciate the fact that [our] work was put out there.” It’s impossible to say how many of the fake accounts that #YourSlipIsShowing called out were actually part of the Russian propaganda operation that may have helped tilt the 2016 election. But what does seem clear is that the misinformation, bot networks, and weaponized trolls that Twitter did little to curb back in 2014 were a “ dry run ” for the presidential campaign two years later. In 2018, a New Knowledge report commissioned by the Senate described how Russian agents specifically “focused on developing black audiences and recruiting black Americans as assets,” a campaign honed in the depths of 4chan. “It should be validating,” Hudson said, to be proved right about what she calls the “toxic white manosphere.” “But instead it’s been upsetting and alarming. Nobody wants to be right about how much real peril we’re all in, even if you saw it coming.” Advertisement The work of digging for and calling out these Twitter accounts takes a grim psychological toll. Crockett said that, at some point, therapy might be a good idea after years of being subjected to violent harassment, of receiving death threats, and of the humdrum indignities that black women face on the internet every day. “Not going to lie, alcohol helps too,” she laughed. In the years since #YourSlipIsShowing began, Crockett, Hudson, and others have continued to sound the alarm about the campaigns of disinformation targeting women of color. Every so often, the two will compare notes on suspicious users in their mentions. Hudson recently began to spend some of her time writing fiction; Crockett is training as a doula. She also spoke at a journalism conference in December, connecting #YourSlipIsShowing to other historical black information networks: “kitchen tables, hair salons, you know, after-church services. These sort of intimate, intercommunal services, where, as they say, ‘spill the tea.’ ” At its core, after all, #YourSlipIsShowing wasn’t created for traditionally white, male gatekeepers. Both Hudson and Crockett agree on what’s gotten them through all of this: the network of women this hashtag has connected. “The community of black women that I’ve built kind of represents the promise of the internet to me, or the promise of social media,” Crockett told me. “We just remind each other that we’re more than whatever happened to us online.” "

The parenting horror known as stool toileting refusal is much more common than many people think.,slate.com,Emily Oster,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/04/stool-toileting-refusal-potty-training-toddlers-wont-poop-in-toilet.html,"When You Give Birth, Your Body … Rips. That Might Suck a Little Less if We Talked About It More. It’s ridiculous how many expectations and conventions exist around childbirth and parenting. But over the course of writing two books about this time of life, I’ve come to appreciate that there are some things you simply cannot anticipate: things people don’t talk about, sometimes because they are sad, sometimes uncomfortable, sometimes just plain weird. I think we should talk about them—and, more than that, we should use data to really understand them. (I’m an economist; I love data). Acknowledging the data can often relieve a lot of the pressure on parents, either by reflecting experiences that feel isolating in the moment or by presenting us with a greater range of choices than we might have thought we had. In that spirit, I have a series of pieces in Slate this week about how data helps illuminate childbirth and parenting’s most underdiscussed topics. There are few things in pregnancy and parenting that are a complete surprise. You’ve likely been dimly aware of the possibility of, say, vaginal tearing , and you know that children walk at different times. For me, however, “STR” was not something I had ever imagined. When my daughter was an infant, I recall talking to another mom who said it casually—“Oh, everything is great, other than we are dealing with an STR issue.” I didn’t want to pry or seem like an ill-informed parent, so I looked it up later. Stool toileting refusal, i.e. STR, i.e. a situation in which an otherwise potty-trained child refuses to poop in the toilet. STR may be little known, but there is perhaps nothing else that so encapsulates the challenges of a toddler relative to a baby. Infants are tiring—they cry a lot, they eat all the time, they don’t sleep—but they are easy to manipulate. Most of the time, they do not actively resist you. Parenting them is a bit like being the dictator of a small, poorly functioning country. Not so with a toddler. Before I had children, I never dreamed I’d start preparing to leave the house 15 minutes before it was necessary, just to leave time for the inevitable fight over the horror of socks. Welcome to toddlerdom. Along with choices about discipline and early education, the great question of these years is potty training. When you come to potty training, you will likely run up against the stubborn resistance for which toddlers are so celebrated. Enter STR, a common battleground for toddler self-determination. Despite the fact that people without children have probably never heard of this, it is quite common. You can see this in anecdote—I mentioned writing this piece at a friend’s house for dinner recently (I’m a great guest), and they told me, “Oh, of course. But doesn’t that happen to everyone?” But we do not need my dinner party friends; we can rely on data. Some kids seem to find the idea of something dropping away from their body uncomfortable and weird, or even scary. Consider one study , run in a suburban pediatric practice, that enrolled 482 children before potty training and followed them through their potty training adventures. One hundred and six of the children, or almost a quarter of them, had some degree of stool toileting refusal, which the authors here defined as peeing in the toilet but not pooping for at least a period of one month. The exact mechanics differed across kids in this study. In most cases, it seems the children would wait for a time they were wearing a diaper—for example, during a nap or in the middle of the night—and then poop in the diaper. In some cases, they would, as the authors politely put it, “soil their underwear.” This all sounds fairly remote until you are the one scraping poop out of the seams of Finding Nemo underpants. Adults may wonder why on earth this behavior happens. Certainly older children and adults do not long for the days of pooping in a diaper, so why is it so appealing to some toddlers? The answer is we do not really know. Some kids seem to find the idea of something dropping away from their body uncomfortable and weird, or even scary. Some argue that in a world almost wholly out of their control, pooping is a small area toddlers can have some agency over. Even little kids have a lot of control over bowel movements. If they want to hold it, sometimes they can really hold it. Second, even if they are not trying to hold it, most kids do not poop more than once a day. This means that if you’re trying to (say) potty train your child using a three-day method or similar, you’ll get just three tries at this pretty essential life skill. If you miss the window and they have an accident, you do not get to try again 15 minutes later. Also, stool withholding can actually be unhealthy, and parents rightly worry about it. The main issue is that withholding poop can cause constipation. This can lead to painful bowel movements, when they finally arrive, which further exacerbates the problem. Now the child associates using the toilet with pain and really doesn’t want to do it. Chronic constipation can also lead to problems with urination if it rises to an extreme level. It’s also just flat out scary. If your child is resistant to the point where they’ve gone three or four days without pooping, they’ll be very uncomfortable, and you may start to worry they could do real damage. So, if you find yourself experiencing this particular wonder of parenting, is there anything you can do? The answer is that we do not know much. There is some work studying how to address this issue in older children—stool withholding is also a common issue in school-age children, so that’s something to look forward to—but virtually nothing systematic in younger ages. One study of 400 children , published in 2003, showed that the length of refusal (i.e., the number of months this goes on) decreased with a child-oriented intervention where, among other things, parents made a big deal about the child pooping in the diaper before potty training started. This means saying things like, “Wow! You pooped! That’s so great!” and so on. The kids in this treatment were no less likely to have the problem at all, but it lasted for less time. A common piece of advice to address this issue is that the child be given a diaper to poop in, perhaps in the bathroom. Although it may seem like a step backward, the theory is that it lowers the chance of constipation and subsequent negative feedback. There is not much evidence on this in either direction. In the first study I talked about above—the one that aimed to document how common this problem was—the authors report that putting children back in diapers temporarily worked for some kids, and most were trained within three months after that. But the truth is that, with time, pretty much everyone uses the toilet, and without a control group, it is difficult to learn much. This last point is perhaps the most important of all. Like many experiences of early parenting, this too shall pass. It might take a month—honestly, it might take six—and in the moment, it will be frustrating (trust me, I know). But eventually your child will poop in the toilet. And you can move on to other worries."
"Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame speaks out in favor of impeachment, and also would like it if you eased up on the vandalism a little.",slate.com,Donald Trump S Star On The Hollywood Walk Of Fame,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/donald-trump-star-hollywood-walk-of-fame-impeachment.html,"Please welcome me to the Resistance. Ringo Chiu/AFP/Getty Images I am Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and I am a patriot . Over the course of my 12-year, immensely profitable association with the president, I have prided myself on my reputation for loyalty, silently refusing to criticize my one-time friend and mentor even as his obvious, virulent racism metastasized into racism that was exactly as obvious and virulent but also new and shocking to me, somehow. I have always believed it was not the place of a terrazzo-and-brass sidewalk tile to weigh in on political matters, primarily because terrazzo-and-brass sidewalk tiles are made of terrazzo and brass and cannot, under normal circumstances, think or speak or write. But Donald Trump is not a normal president. On Wednesday morning, I read the Mueller report—I cannot emphasize enough that my change of heart was prompted by a combination of love of country and the conclusions in the Mueller Report and is completely unrelated to the fact that someone spray-painted “PUTINS BITCH” on me at 3:40 in the morning —and I realized that enough was enough. I had to do something! I had to speak out! Because of all my patriotism! If you think calling for the impeachment of a sitting Republican president would constitute career suicide for someone like me, a Hollywood Walk of Fame star bearing the name of that sitting Republican president in big block letters, you may end up being right. But before getting bogged down in questions about how Donald Trump’s name got written on me in the first place, or whether or not a Hollywood Walk of Fame star with Donald Trump’s name written on it should have a career, I think we should all take a minute to consider how courageous it is for me to finally distance myself from the president in 2019 , after the Muslim ban, after Charlottesville, after family separation, ostensibly because of the Mueller report . It’s not that I’ve finally gotten fed up with the sledgehammers, the golden toilets , the pickaxes , the dog shit , or the non-binding resolutions , and it’s certainly not that it’s finally gotten through my thick terrazzo head that some of my fellow Americans are surprisingly uncool about teaming up with a guy who steals other people’s children . No, the disturbing portrait of a lawless president in the Mueller Report was the tipping point for me, not fear of social censure or that time George Lopez pretended to pee on me . I live on Hollywood Boulevard: You’re not going to scare me with fake urine. You’re also not going to hold the fact that I promoted Donald Trump for years and years against me. Are you? Incidentally, it is pretty fucking rich for my next-door neighbor, Kevin Spacey’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star, to be putting on airs about any of this. Hindsight is 20/20, and it’s easy for the loony left to say today that I should have never cast my lot in with Donald Trump in the first place. But when I first began working with Trump, lending him legitimacy, helping to promote his television career, and paving the way to his presidency—quite literally!—something was different about him. I’m not certain how to articulate what was different in a way anyone would find remotely credible, but I’m certain that it was real, and that it exculpates me. The man in the White House today is not the man I met at my unveiling ceremony back in 2007. That man held his beloved son Barron, not yet a year old, up to the cameras and said :
He’s strong, he’s smart, he’s tough, he’s vicious, he’s violent—all of the ingredients you need to be an entrepreneur. And most importantly, hopefully he’s smart, because smart is really the ingredient. So, Barron, good luck—you have a long way to go. OK, in retrospect that doessound like it should maybe have given me a qualm or two. But my childhood dream of being a Hollywood Walk of Fame star for Mitt Romney died when he lost Mamma Mia! to Pierce Brosnan. What was I supposed to do, pass up the opportunity for professional advancement just because I’d be helping a monster amass more wealth and power? Talk about un-American! It’s also important to remember that in 2007, Donald Trump came highly recommended by all the best people. Am I really to be blamed for believing the glowing endorsement Mark Burnett gave him at that same ceremony?
There’s two things to know about Donald. One is if you’re his friend, he’ll go to war for you. But never become his enemy. You never want to become this man’s enemy because he’ll get you. Oh sure, it’s easy to see the red flags now . But you weren’t softened up by the delightful comedy stylings of Jay Leno first, the way the people who attended the ceremony that day were. Pretty much everyone was rolling in the Boulevard, except for my other neighbor, Y. Frank Freeman ’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star. I never expected to get along with Freeman’s star—your namesake lost his war on smut , Frankie, and Donald Trump is the proof! Now I live next door forever!—but even once things started going downhill, I thought Spacey’s star and I would have a lot to talk about. But these days, If I say so much as hello, you’d think he was Keyser Söze’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star. This kind of shameful condescension from Hollywood’s so-called elite is exactly how Trump got elected in the first place, and now that I am bravely speaking out against him, it is more important than ever to invite me to parties and conferences and symposiums, to say nothing of hiring me to work at think tanks, lest Trump be reelected. Fortunately, the Founders provided a constitutional remedy for exactly this situation: Publicly calling for impeachment in liberal media outlets dumb enough to hand a microphone to a former Trump supporter. So Mr. Trump, I am putting you on notice: It is time for me to reinvent myself. It is time for impeachment. At this point I would like to quietly reassure my old friends that I still support the larger Republican project of robbing the poor to pay the rich while taking away women’s reproductive rights and flat-out murdering as many people of color as possible until we successfully boil the entire planet . As I was saying, respect for the rule of law and love of my fellow Americans compel me, Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, to support his impeachment. The sooner he is removed from office, the sooner the wounds he has inflicted on the country can begin to heal. More importantly, the sooner Trump vanishes from the headlines, the sooner I can pretend I had nothing to do with any of this and was on the right side of history from the beginning. After all, in this country, we’re not divided into “former Trump supporters” and “people who don’t have quite as much blood on their hands”: We’re Americans , and as Americans, it’s our duty to forget who went MAGA .

Joe Biden presidential bid: Watch his Trump-focused announcement video.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/joe-biden-2020-presidential-campaign-announcement-video.html,"The Press Didn’t Just Report Accurately on Trump-Russia Corruption. It Prevented the Corruption From Being Worse. Unlike many of his colleagues in the Democratic Party, Biden appears to place the blame for Trumpism squarely on the man himself: “I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. But If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation—who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.” There are now roughly 20 candidates competing for the Democratic nomination. As Jim Newell wrote in Slate, the size of the field indicates a belief among some Democrats that the favored establishment candidate isn’t a sure bet. In recent weeks, seven women have alleged that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with “affectionate” touching, but there is no sign that his base is wavering as a result. Two Democrats immediately announced their support for Biden. Sen. Chris Coons, who holds Biden’s old seat representing Delaware, was the first to endorse the former vice president, emphasizing his “decency and sense of hope.” Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey followed soon after. Former President Barack Obama, in response to the announcement, released a statement mentioning a “special bond” between him and Biden and complimenting Biden on his “knowledge, insight, and judgment.” Trump responded to the news with an on-brand tweet: Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe.

Democrats and immigration: How should candidates counter Trump’s demagoguery?,slate.com,Le N Krauze,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/immigration-democrats-2020-dilemma.html,"Mueller Proved Comey Told the Truth In the coming months, Democratic voters will get the chance to choose from a large field of presidential candidates that includes virtually every type of progressive politician available on the American spectrum. This might seem like an advantage. But the perils of alienating considerable swaths of general election voters are not insignificant, and in an election that will surely hinge on turnout, Democrats are walking a tightrope. With 18 months left on the electoral calendar, the party faces a long list of dilemmas, and candidates are still working out how to approach topics ranging from health care to racial injustice to climate change to opioid addiction, but the question that drove the most conversation this week was whether to begin impeachment proceedings against the president—not precisely a deep public policy discussion. Still, the toughest quandary facing the party this spring and summer may not be impeachment, but immigration and how best to counter President Donald Trump’s obsessive focus on the issue. Other than his fixation with Robert Mueller’s inquiry and his personal battle against the media, no other topic has been as present in Trump’s Twitter demagoguery and campaign rhetoric as immigrant fearmongering. There is no question that the issue matters, at least to Republican voters. In a poll just before last year’s midterms, a Pew study found that 75 percent of Republicans identify illegal immigration as a “very big problem” for the United States, above other objectively more relevant challenges like gun violence, the drug epidemic or economic inequality. In another, more recent poll , 68 percent of Republicans chose immigration as a priority for both Trump and Congress this year, the third most important issue after terrorism and the economy. Immigration will surely be front and center again next year. How should the Democrats respond? The answer isn’t obvious. Some voices have urged Democrats to not only engage on the issue but embrace the need for prosecution and deterrence to face the current immigration wave from Central America. David Frum recently warned against liberal complacency on the issue and, controversially, urged Democrats to emphasize enforcement. “If liberals insist that only fascists will enforce borders, then voters will hire fascists to do the job liberals refuse to do,” wrote Frum, a man who, granted, is not particularly known for his progressive credentials. Still, some in the Democratic Party seem to agree. Strategist Simon Rosenberg told me Democrats should “lean in” on the issue of immigration in 2020, underlining the party’s own achievements on border security, putting forth a humane and tenable road map to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and proposing an ambitious plan for development aid to Central American countries. “Democrats have a strong record of pragmatic management of border and immigration issues,” Rosenberg said. “The nation is now looking for solutions. We should focus on updating our ‘comprehensive reform’ approach to account for the new challenges the Trump era has created.” What would this counternarrative to Trump’s nativism look like?Of the 19 candidates running for the Democratic nomination, only former San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro has laid out anything resembling an innovative approach to immigration. Democrats have, of course, another possible path, that might seem counterintuitive in the age of Trump’s rabid fearmongering: They could downplay immigration. During a panel I recently moderated on the future of progressive immigration policy, University of Southern California journalism professor Roberto Suro, an eloquent expert on the topic, suggested progressives should just run the numbers.* When I brought up that 3 out of 4 Republican voters seem actively troubled about undocumented immigration, Suro seemed unconcerned. “75 percent of Republican voters gets you to what, 30 percent of the electorate, maybe less?” asked Suro. “For those voters, it’s their top issue and they’ll vote on it. But you’ve got the rest of the country, and by very large numbers the public attitudes toward immigration have not changed. Four years of this rhetoric, all the craziness at the border, American attitudes toward immigration have not changed: They are overwhelmingly welcoming.” He has a point. Immigration doesn’t seem to be a priority for most American voters. Among the general public, immigration ranks ninth among “public policy priorities” for 2019. Polls have consistently shown a majority of Americans view immigration as an asset for the country. Perhaps more importantly, some polls suggest the number of independents who hold a positive view of immigration and its role in America has continued to grow. During the same conversation, Daniel Restrepo, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and former Western Hemisphere adviser to President Obama, told me Democrats should avoid “getting into some sort of argument about how to manage migration into the United States.” According to Restrepo, immigration “is not a frontline issue for a lot of persuadable voters.” Again, Suro and Restrepo may be right. Perhaps the way for the Democrats to counter Trump’s nativism is not to take the bait at all, focusing instead on kitchen table economic issues. If fearmongering proves to be an ineffective political tool with everyone but the Republican base and anti-immigrant rhetoric truly falls on deaf ears with the majority of the country’s voters, American democracy would emerge newly bolstered. If it doesn’t, well, Donald Trump will be proven right, and nativism might become the norm. It’s a huge gamble. And the onus is on the Democrats.

The rise and fall of Michael Avenatti.,slate.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/04/michael-avenatti-rise-and-fall-discussed-dissected.html,"The Mueller Report, Now in Your Podcast Feed Dahlia Lithwick: I mean, I feel like the interesting thing about Avenatti, and I’ve been sort of tracking your vibing on him for since he emerged, is that we have this misperception that the anti-Trump was going to be the only thing that took down Trump. He was going to use Trump’s weapons to destroy the master’s house, right, and that you just had to be a reality show grifter. I think it wasn’t a bad thesis, because we’ve seen, you know, sober men in suits trying to take Trump down. I think the mistake we made is at the end of the day, grifters going to grift. Right. He definitely inhabits that illegitimate sector, the gray market figures. I just can’t figure out what percentage of American professionals now live in that area, but every day, I’m newly surprised. I wonder, because I’ve been thinking about it in the context of Christine Blasey Ford this week. Partly because Kamala Harris’s write-up of her was really beautiful for the Time list and partly because I think the groove that I can’t kind of get the record to stop skipping at is—Christine Blasey Ford, we all believed her, right? Everyone. There’s a new study that shows we all believed her. Then there are two alternatives: We believed her and it just doesn’t matter, or we believed her and rage, shouting it down, somehow has a bigger impact. When Kavanaugh started screaming about it, we’re like, “Well, we believe her, but we’re scared.” I don’t know which of those to think about, but what I keep thinking is this is the world, right? We live in a world in which guys get drunk at parties and hurt girls, and the girls remember and remember their names years later, and guys don’t. That’s the world we live in. We live in a world where if you’re married to your third trophy wife, you have certain views about women, and you can pretend that that makes you like a very good, religious man. I just think that there’s a way in which everything that you and I are dispirited about is this is the world we live in, you know? On one side. It’s lovely and moving that Time magazine puts Christine Blasey Ford in their most influential people, but has anyone tried to make her whole? Has anybody tried to make reparations for what the system did to her, for what Susan Collins said about her, for what Lindsey Graham shouted at her? No, nobody does because the system doesn’t exist to do that. “We have this misperception that the anti-Trump was going to be the only thing that took down Trump.” — Dahlia Lithwick As my friend Karen Schwartz, who’s been on the show, said, “The lesson of Clarence Thomas was that Clarence Thomas is on the Supreme Court,” and now the lesson of Brett Kavanaugh is that Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, and Dr. Ford has had to move at least twice and is the subject of death threats. I think also, just to pull on the Michael Avenatti, think about who our allies are, right? He was supposed to be the ally. He’s the Julie Swetnick rescuer, except by the way, that was not credible, and it ended up undermining completely the testimony of Blasey Ford and Debbie Ramirez. Think about what it means to grasp at allies who are themselves kind of grifters and say, “Oh, this guy is going to save the #MeToo movement.” Perfectly transactional on his part, and we put faith that this was the system careening into the good side. There was something that Michael Cohen said, in his would-be truthful testimony the second time about his role as a fixer, that really interested me. In his own defense, he didn’t say, “I am a great father and a religious man, and I love God.” He said, “I am everybody’s emergency contact, and people put me as the friend they would call at 3 a.m.” I was like, “God, who would call Michael Cohen at 3 a.m.?” But I do see why, learning that those guys all have fixers, can make you desperately think you need one too, but obviously that’s not the way. That just gets you in a mess, too, and I don’t think Stormy Daniels is holding up all that well with Michael Avenatti. No, I think there’s only one system. I mean, that’s the point. There’s only one system. There’s one system, and if it’s broken, hiring a broken person to navigate you through the broken system doesn’t make the system work, and this is part of the problem that we have of sort of buying your own justice in America, right? We’re looking at Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, who are going to serve no time and have lovely lives, whereas like the guy who stole the jeggings from Walmart is going to jail. You know, I mean, I think this is the problem is that as long as you are operating within a system where you pay to play, and where people hang out a shingle and say, “Pay to play, and I’ll help you play,” then this is what’s going to happen.

Beyoncé’s Dad Is Developing a Destiny’s Child Stage Musical From His Perspective,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/destinys-child-musical-beyonce-mathew-knowles.html,"A Casual Moviegoer’s Guide to Avengers: Endgame Mathew Knowles, the former manager of Destiny’s Child better known as Beyoncé’s dad, has announced that he is producing a stage musical about the R&B group. Survivor: The Destiny’s Child Musical will tell the story of the legendary girl group’s come-up from Knowles’ perspective, according to Deadline . As of now, it’s not clear whether any of the actual members—Beyoncé, Michelle Williams, and Kelly Rowland—will be involved in the production. Beyoncé split from her dad as manager in 2011, and the pair has not collaborated professionally since. Survivor will follow Destiny Child’s formation in 1997 and their presence in the R&B scene up until their breakup in 2006. Though Beyoncé was a key member of the group through its run, Destiny’s Child cycled through several different lineups over the years, the most successful being the familiar trio of Bey, Rowland, and Williams. “I want to pull back the curtain,” Knowles said of the production in a statement on his website . “I feel it’s time to give the world an opportunity to hear, see and feel the victories and failures that I’ve had as a husband, father and manager who risked everything in pursuit of fulfilling dreams—those of mine and others.” Jezebel points out that this isn’t the first time Knowles has tried to tell his side of the story: Leaked emails from the Sony hack revealed that he had been shopping around a Destiny’s Child biopic back in 2013. Unlike that movie, which apparently never got off the ground, Knowles’ musical is set to premiere next year in Houston with, Knowles hopes, runs on Broadway and London’s West End to follow.* Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Washington state allows the composting of human bodies.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/technology/2019/04/composting-human-bodies-recompose-washington-state-law.html,"The Social Media Block Isn’t Helping Sri Lanka I live in Seattle, where we take being green very seriously. Our electric utility, Seattle City Light, was the first in the nation to reach carbon neutral status. In 2012, we started requiring retail stores to charge customers 5 cents per plastic bag. We’ve got a goal of recycling or composting 70 percent of all our city waste by 2022. Seattleites may soon be able to compost more than our food scraps and yard waste: The Washington State Legislature just voted to pass SB 5001 , a new bill legalizing “natural organic reduction” of human remains—a fancy way of saying “composting bodies.” For years, funeral industry professionals and consumers alike have been advocating for more sustainable afterlife options: green burials that forgo caskets and the toxic chemicals used in traditional embalming, sea burials, even getting digested by mushrooms . Recompose, a Washington-based company, has been developing a “recomposition” method to compost bodies in about a month. It says the process uses just one-eighth the amount of energy cremation requires and saves a metric ton of CO2 per person. And Seattleites are apparently eager for the option: According to Recompose’s founder and CEO Katrina Spade, while the new bill was being considered, “I heard from one person in her 90s who called her senators and told them to please hurry on up and vote yes.” (Full disclosure: I organized a 2017 Seattle event on the good death where Spade was one of the speakers.) Up until now, the legality of the composting process was a hurdle for Recompose. Many states permit only three ways of dealing with dead bodies: Burying them, cremating them, or donating them to science. Washington’s move opens the door for other states to follow suit in permitting composting. (With this bill, Washington also joins 16 other states that have already legalized alkaline hydrolysis, also known as “water cremation,” a process in which a body is dissolved by heating it up in a mixture of lye and water.) But there are still major details to be worked out: For instance, the state’s Department of Licensing will need to create regulations for this new industry, and Recompose will need to find a physical home for its facility. A composted person ends up being a cubic yard of soil. (Imagine a container the size of two washing machines side by side—that’s a cubic yard.) Your average dump truck holds 10 to 14 cubic yards, or roughly 10 to 14 people. To start, soil will be offered to friends and family “to grow a tree or a garden,” according to Recompose’s FAQs. Spade tells me that they’re still working on the details, but that loved ones will also have a choice to donate the remaining soil to several partner organizations. “We have had some organizations express interest, but are in very early stages of discussion,” says Spade. “They would use the soil to help build the land, especially in areas that need restoring, such as a forest that was logged improperly over the decades.” It’s a lovely idea for the dead to be returned to the land. But are the living ready for that? Just the idea of composting bodies has been met with pushback. In 2015, a New York Times piece about what was then called the Urban Death Project included comments from the project’s website. One read: “This MUST be a joke. If not, there’s only one word which could possibly describe your activities: SICK.” Another: “A pile of bodies is usually called a ‘mass grave.’ Please stop what you’re doing.” I’d guess human composting critics would be even less thrilled if they were ever to come in contact with the resulting soil. Even people who have no problem with human composting might be a little squicked out by the prospect. It’s one thing to say you’re in favor of this sustainable option that returns people to the earth; it’s another to be confronted with a cubic yard of soil that used to be a person. If you want to be pedantic, then yes, all soil probably contains some amount of dead people in it. But this soil would be fairly recently dead people—like, people who were alive as recently as a month ago. There’s no science-based reason the recency of the dead in the soil should give us pause—Recompose plans to screen compostees for non-organics, like metal implants and potentially contagious diseases—but part of what makes us human is the meaning we ascribe to the world around us. And given that death is one of the few truly universal human experiences, it’s no wonder that we’ve developed a range of beliefs, traditions, and superstitions as reverence for its power. The prospect of human-based soil throws an interesting wrench into many of the beliefs about respecting the dead that are popular in the U.S. Restoring a forest with the soil is a use that minimizes contact with living humans: It’s far from urban centers, and, if you believe there’s some essence of human in that soil, it leaves the dead mostly untouched. One friend told me she’d feel strange hiking or camping there and would want to avoid walking on it, if at all possible. She compared it to the reverence people feel in graveyards, where you might tiptoe around gravesites rather than walking on top. There’s a natural reticence to disturb the peace of the dead in whatever form they take. Using the soil to grow something evokes more nuanced and varied reactions. My friend Alisha told me she’d be weirded out by having human-based soil in the house, but would be happy to use it to grow something outside. Another friend, Jaime, has always liked the idea of being a tree, but wouldn’t want to use soil from a loved one to grow something. “It’s a lot of pressure,” he says. “Like, if I’m growing a plant in my uncle’s compost, and the plant dies, what does that say about me?” He wouldn’t want any of his loved ones to get his compost, either, but would rather have it donated to a park or garden—“something nice, beautiful, and/or helpful.” “If I’m growing a plant in my uncle’s compost, and the plant dies, what does that say about me?” — Jaime My mom, on the other hand, was just extremely distressed by the entire premise, using the words “horrible” and “scary” over and over as we discussed it. (It’s worth noting that my mom even calls the plant-based compost in my home gross, so this comes as no surprise.) “Imagine you planted a flower at the front door using somebody’s soil—horrible!” she said. “People have feelings. It’s the same species as you. It’s disgusting.” It’s clear she felt there was an essence of person still in that soil, and she wanted nothing to do with it. She’s not alone: In 2015, Cara Bayles wrote in Slate about how many people view composting bodies as sacrilegious. It would follow, then, that the resulting soil would just be concrete evidence of that sacrilege. My mom’s mind immediately jumped to growing food with the soil, which distressed her even more. To be clear, Recompose has never included crop-growing among its stated intentions for the soil, but it’s an obvious use for soil. Municipal compost from major cities gets used in agriculture; for instance, Napa and Sonoma wineries buy up the rich compost made from San Francisco’s food waste. There are no regulations or laws about soil made from human remains yet, but there likely will be by the time Recompose’s process is commercially viable. In theory, for maximum sustainability it makes sense to use human-based soil to grow sustenance, even if it’s on a small scale like in a personal garden. After all, soil is soil. But the mind can’t help but wonder about the meaning of that soil. If growing a tree from a loved one’s remains is a way to keep their memory alive, what does it mean to eat something that grows from that plant? Is it, in some way, them? Would it be more respectful to avoid the yield of that plant, or to enjoy it and let it nourish you? Like all end-of-life choices, the symbolism is deeply personal. And as recomposition catches on, we’ll surely imbue the ensuing soil with new meaning, rituals, and taboos."
