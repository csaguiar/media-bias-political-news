Free The Students. Sink The Colleges,thefederalist.com,Daniel Oliver,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/free-students-sink-colleges/,"By Daniel Oliver May 7, 2019
Senator Elizabeth “Feathers” Warren has called for forgiving student loans, a proposal first made here back in 2014. But Warren would eliminate only $50,000 of student debt, and only for students whose income was less than $100,000, approximately 42 million people.
Of course, being Sen. Warren, she has also proposed that the government cover all tuition at all two-year and four-year colleges, and—well it goes on and on, essentially socializing the cost of everything, probably including toothpaste, chewing gum, and wampum belts.
The cost of the debt-forgiveness part of her proposal is said to be $640 billion. (Total student debt is estimated at $1.56 trillion.)
Just because Warren has latched onto the idea doesn’t make it kooky—though we are right to suspect anything that the first faculty member of color at Harvard Law School says.
Donald Trump should steal this idea, feathers and all, for the 2020 campaign.
Part Two of the original proposal (at, to repeat, here ) was that the federal government would pay for the loan cancellations by eliminating most of its grants to higher education institutions. Today total federal support of education is about $102.5 billion a year.
People who are skeptical of Part Two need to understand something about “higher” education: for most people it is worthless, as education. Completely worthless . And actually, worse than worthless because it corals young people into institutions for two or four of their most formative years where they learn absolutely nothing ! And wind up in debt up to their keisters.
In his book, The Case Against Education , Bryan Caplan makes, inter alia, two important points. The first is that students learn nothing: “Barely half of American adults,” he writes, “know the Earth goes around the sun.” Read that again, slowly, and contemplate the usefulness of a college education.
We should not be surprised. Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa in their book, Academically Adrift , agree with Caplan (“American education is characterized by limited or no learning for a large proportion of students”) and suggest why. “On average, [students] report spending only 12 hours per week studying.” Arum and Roksa also tell us that “fifty percent of the students in our sample reported that they had not taken a single course during the prior semester that required more than twenty pages of writing, and one third had not taken one that required even forty pages of reading per week.”
Bryan Caplan’s second point is that education is all about credentialing. “The labor market doesn’t pay you for the useless subjects you master;” he writes, “it pays you for the preexisting traits you reveal by mastering them.”
The education racket is all about the “sheepskin” effect. Graduates of the twelfth grade in high school earn more than graduates of only the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades combined . In college the sheepskin effect is even more pronounced: graduates earn more than twice as much as students who complete only one, two, or three years combined !
One theory—only a congressman could believe it—is that the teachers or professors save all the really important information for the last year. Horse feathers!
If college is all about credentialing, why not find another way to credential the nation’s young people? Why not make tasks available that would allow Johnny to show that he has the grit to stick with a difficult job?
Why not create service opportunities for young people to engage in, in addition to military service? They could work at senior citizen institutions, hospitals, high schools, or any number of other charitable institutions that serve the public. The work could be demanding: show up on time; learn specific skills; take responsibility. “Undergraduates in Service to America—USA all the way.” William F. Buckley Jr. wrote a whole book about it in 1990 called Gratitude .
Service would not be mandatory, of course—no indentured servitude. It would simply be an opportunity for young people to show what four years of college shows prospective employers now: that the “student” has the fortitude to persevere.
The feds could even “subsidize” part of the program by not taxing the income of people under the age of twenty-two in such a program.
Young people with good jobs and without huge loans could move out of their parents’ basements (or teepees), get married, have children, and lead normal, productive lives—the way Americans used to.
If a few big corporations started accepting as evidence of maturity and perseverance a work substitute for a sheepskin, the change could happen like a California wildfire.
By stopping support to higher education, the federal government could pay for the debt cancellation in less than a decade—much, much less if the government forgave only the first $10,000 of debt, which would eliminated the debt of about a third of borrowers.
But note that a key part of the proposal is stopping payments to the nation’s colleges. Those institutions, bloated with high-paid administrators, diversity deans, and grievance counselors, are the fever swamps of the Left, inculcating young people in big government, socialist, and often anti-American nostrums. Stopping that is worth twice the price.
This is a win-win-win proposition for Republicans: Get the students to vote Republican; save a generation or several generations of young people from wasting four important years in colleges where they will learn almost nothing; and defund the Left’s higher ed propaganda machine.

CNN Contributor Insanely Claims Unborn Babies Aren't Human,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/pro-abortion-cnn-contributor-insanely-claims-unborn-babies-arent-even-human/,"May 7, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
On CNN’s “Primetime with Chris Cuomo” on Monday night, a segment on the legality of state-level fetal heartbeat bills quickly spiraled into a chaotic debate about whether unborn children should be considered human beings. CNN contributor and erstwhile New York City Democratic politician Christine Quinn said, “When a woman is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her.”
When guest Rick Santorum asked CNN Host Chris Cuomo if he disagreed “that at the moment of conception that a child is human and alive?” Cumono replied that means it’s “viable.” When Santorum asked, “Is it biologically a human life?” Quinn shouted, “No!”
Cuomo and Quinn teamed up in pushing back on Santorum as he articulated what science tells us about unborn humans. At every stage of human life — as an embryo, a fetus, or after five weeks of age when his or her heartbeat can be detected by an ultrasound — an unborn child has his or her own unique DNA.
He or she has a unique genetic code, blood type, sex, and race, all which can differ from his or her mother and father’s. This unique individual is developed inside a women’s body, but is not part of a women’s body, and cannot be regulated as the mother’s property, Santorum argued.
“Her body is always her property,” Cuomo said, missing the point entirely.
“When a women is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her. It is part of her body,” Quinn said. “This is about a women having full agency and control of her body…and making decisions about what is part of her body with medical professionals.”
The right to abortion is just that — the right to kill unborn humans. But pro-abortionists like Quinn and Cuomo find it easier to argue that they are fighting for “reproductive rights” (even though pro-lifers are not objecting to any woman’s right to reproduce) or that fetuses are not humans but “clumps of cells.” Just as with slave owners and eugenicists before them, it’s easier for pro-abortionists to advocate for murder after they’ve dehumanized the lives they want to end.

How Overemphasizing Individualism Made Liberalism Morally Bankrupt,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/overemphasizing-individualism-made-liberalism-morally-bankrupt/,"By Nathanael Blake May 8, 2019
Only liberals can save liberalism. They do not seem up to the task, and their failure leaves liberalism languishing in decadence.
Political liberalism — broadly understood in terms of representative government, individual rights, and personal autonomy — should be an easy sell in an era of prosperity, technological marvels, and comparative peace, especially after the totalitarian horrors of the last century. But, from the ballot box to academia, liberals are struggling to respond to rivals and critics who contend that liberalism has not lived up to its promises.
For example, consider writer Gabriel Schoenfeld’s recent essay in The American Interest attacking critics of liberalism, particularly Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen and his book “ Why Liberalism Failed .” Schoenfeld makes two significant critiques of Deneen and his fellow travelers. The first is that their condemnations of modern liberalism do not account for historical context—today has flaws, but yesterday did, too, often worse. The second is that Deneen and his allies do not offer reasonable alternatives to liberalism; they tend to either dodge the question or else indulge in flights of fancy, such as theories of Catholic integralism .
These criticisms have some merit, and Schoenfeld avoids conflating technological progress with moral progress, making his one of the better responses to Deneen. He also deserves credit for recognizing the illiberalism of many on the left, including President Obama’s efforts to force nuns to fund and facilitate the distribution of birth control and the obsession with compelling nonconformist, devoutly religious wedding vendors to celebrate same-sex marriage ceremonies.
But Schoenfeld does not address the fundamental failures of modern liberalism because he believes there are none. He believes that although everything may not be awesome yet, overall life is better than it used to be. He is right that many current complainers are ignorant of the past and its problems, but he falls into the opposite error and seems oblivious to the worst evils of modern liberalism. What in today’s liberalism might compare with the atrocities of earlier eras? In his view: nothing. Our Age Embraces Atrocities, Too
He thus ignores the tens of millions dismembered in utero to secure the personal sexual autonomy that today’s liberalism cherishes above all else. Abortion is a veiled brutality that enables the modern liberal way of life. It gives the lie to Schoenfeld’s conclusion that “even if a gap persists between our ideals and practices, in any fair appraisal it has narrowed significantly from 100 or 200 years ago.”
In modern liberal regimes, the mother who marvels at an ultrasound revealing the movements of her child in the eighth week of pregnancy also has an absolute sovereign right to order that child’s death. But Schoenfeld declares ours to be “the most humane socio-political order ever to grace the face of the earth.” If human persons in utero have moral worth, then these paeans to liberalism’s moral progress are sung from the hymnbooks of Hell.
Just as a liberalism that endorsed slavery could not endure, so too a degenerate liberalism that embraces abortion deserves to be consigned to the ash heap of history. Abortion illuminates this moral blind spot in modern liberalism, but the problem extends throughout liberal theorizing about family and community, which has denigrated and dissolved familial and community bonds since at least John Locke. The Problem with Children and Family
Children and family have always been a problem for liberal political theory, which is centered on autonomous adults. Children are not born free and rational, but dependent and irrational, and liberal political theory has long struggled to address human development and dependence.
In particular, the developing human person’s specific dependence on the mother is an insoluble problem for modern liberalism. Human life in the womb can only exist and develop by imposing upon the mother’s body, regardless of her consent. Modern liberalism will not accept this loss of bodily autonomy (even if it usually arises as a natural and predictable result of consensual sex) and has chosen to secure the mother’s rights under the liberal regime by negating the child’s right to life.
Liberalism cannot keep all of its promises. Thus, a political philosophy that began by claiming to defend rights and liberty for all ends, has started denying the rights of the most vulnerable, in an ironic twist. As a political theory for rational, autonomous adults, liberalism has no place for the dependent and disabled, against whom Western liberal nations are engaged in a quiet genocide .
The failure to adequately address human dependence and vulnerability has left liberalism in a moral morass. Liberal apologists on both the left and the right may not care. Many of them even approve. GOP elites, for instance, are more socially liberal than the rank-and-file, hence their constant efforts to marginalize social conservatives. But they should not be mystified that those who value nascent human life doubt that today’s abortion-dependent liberalism is “the most humane socio-political order ever to grace the face of the earth.”
Liberalism’s disdain for the dependent is the inevitable product of its contempt for all constraints on adult autonomy. Liberalism sees the ties of family, community, and church as bonds to be overcome (often by state intervention) in the cause of autonomous individualism. In practice, as well as in philosophy, it has become decadent because it scorned obligations to its progeny and dissolved the sources from which it could be renewed.
This civilizational exhaustion is exemplified by the liberal West facing demographic disaster. In a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity, many people refuse to have children. Decadence is evident throughout the cultural and political elites of Western liberal nations. Examples of ineptitude, arrogance, insularity, and self-indulgence abound, and they are increasingly illiberal in their efforts to defend a desiccated and exhausted liberalism. Populists Sense the Decadence of Liberalism
The populist backlash throughout the West is a symptom of this decadence, not its cause. Although populists often lack the theoretical acumen of a scholar like Deneen or the moral clarity of pro-life activists, they sense the decadence permeating the liberal order. They see it in the dissolution of national, as well as familial, bonds. It is evident in the casual acceptance, even celebration, of the destruction of local economies and communities in the service of globalization.
This is why criticism of the follies and rough edges of populist leaders rarely dissuade their supporters. If the status quo and those perpetuating it are unacceptable, then many traits of the alternatives may be forgiven. Emphasizing President Trump’s many flaws will not persuade those who are convinced of the general decadence of our political and cultural order.
Although there are sycophants, fools, and hacks who, for example, burble about how “godly” Trump is, many who acknowledge the president’s sins still have come to support him as the best available option . This support is reinforced every time that those with platforms and power refuse to hold themselves and their class accountable, and instead berate ordinary voters who have little political power or cultural cache. It is amusing to watch politicians and pundits who are veterans of a hundred moral compromises declare themselves the last principled men in Washington.
Scolding and shaming populist outbursts against the liberal order will not save liberalism. Scholarly critics of liberalism will not be lectured into submission. Liberalism will survive and prosper only if liberals are able to address the critiques of philosophers and the concerns of populists.
There may be hope for revitalized liberalism. There are strands of liberal theory and practice that can be rewoven to account for human dependence and the non-voluntary ties at the heart of human existence. But this cultural and political renewal will only arise if liberalism’s current defenders take its critics seriously and (harder still) repent of their wrongs. If they try to hold their positions and defend decadent liberalism, they will either lose or, worse still, become illiberal and despotic in their victory.

Mueller's 10 Most Egregious Missteps During Anti-Trump Russia Probe,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/robert-muellers-10-egregious-missteps-anti-trump-russia-investigation/,"By Margot Cleveland May 8, 2019
The release of the special counsel’s report in April exposed several significant missteps Robert Mueller made over the last two years. Last week’s testimony by Attorney General William Barr before the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmed these blunders and bared additional concerns with Mueller’s handling of the probe into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and President Trump’s supposed collusion and obstruction of justice.
Here are ten. 1. Mueller Spent $30 Million But Didn’t Do His Job
The special counsel probe reportedly cost more than $30 million, yet Mueller failed to do his job. Federal regulations expressly provide that at the conclusion of the special counsel’s work he must “provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.”
But in Volume 2 of the special counsel report, which addressed whether Trump obstructed justice, Mueller “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment” of whether “to initiate or decline a prosecution.” Instead, Mueller passed the prosecutorial buck and spent some 200 pages sliming Trump.
During an earlier press conference, Barr stressed that Mueller had flouted his prosecutorial responsibilities by rendering a non-decision: “The very prosecutorial function and all our powers as prosecutors, including the power to convene grand juries and compulsory process that’s involved there, is for one purpose only. It’s to determine yes or no, was alleged conduct criminal or not criminal. That is our responsibility and that’s why we have the tools we have. And we don’t go through this process just to collect information and throw it out to the public.”
Barr reiterated this point during last week’s hearing, again stressing that the special counsel “was appointed to carry out the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Department.” The attorney general noted that both he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were “surprised” when they first learned Mueller would not make a decision about obstruction, and he called it “irresponsible” to release Mueller’s report without providing such a decision.
The attorney general continued: “The function of the Department of Justice in this arena is to determine whether or not there has been criminal conduct. It’s a binary decision. Is there enough evidence to show a crime and do we believe a crime has been committed? We don’t conduct criminal investigations just to collect information and put it out to the public. We do so to make a decision.” 2. Mueller’s Non-Decision Rationale Was Incomprehensible
Not only did Mueller violate the controlling special counsel regulation by issuing a non-decision decision, he couldn’t coherently explain his rationale for doing so. During the recent hearing, Barr made this point in responding to Sen. Chuck Grassley’s question of whether Barr agreed with Mueller’s reasons for not deciding on obstruction of justice.
“I’m not really sure of his reasoning,” Barr replied. “I really could not recapitulate his analysis.”
Later, when Sen. John Kennedy asked the attorney general to explain again why Mueller said he couldn’t make up his mind on obstruction, Barr repeated, “I really couldn’t recapitulate it.”
“It was unclear to us when we first discussed it on March 5—the deputy was with me—and we didn’t really get a clear understanding of the reasoning,” Barr told the Judiciary Committee. And even after reading the final special counsel report, Barr noted, he still wasn’t “sure exactly what the full line of reasoning is” for not rendering a prosecutorial decision. 3. Mueller Continued to Investigate Obstruction Knowing No Prosecutorial Decision Would Be Forthcoming
During the Judiciary Committee hearing, Barr added a third criticism of Mueller’s non-decision decision, testifying: “The other thing that was confusing to me was that the investigation carried out for a while as additional episodes were looked into, episodes involving the president. So my question is or was ‘Why were those investigated if at the end of the day you weren’t going to reach a decision on them?’”
Barr reiterated this point in a later exchange with Grassley, stating that if Mueller “felt that he should not go down the path of making a traditional prosecutive decision, then he should have investigated. That was the time to pull up.”
But he didn’t. Instead, Mueller continued the investigation through the midterm elections and crafted a 200-page screed painting Trump’s conduct as consistent with criminal obstruction of justice. 4. Mueller Applied the Wrong Standard
Barr highlighted another Mueller mistake in an exchange with Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Blumenthal began it by quoting Mueller’s claim that “if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” The Democrat senator then confronted Barr with his decision to “in effect clear [] the president on both so-called collusion and obstruction of justice.”
Barr’s counter was devastating, both to Blumenthal and Mueller: “The difference is I used the proper standard,” he retorted. Barr went on to explain that Mueller’s statement “is actually a very strange statement.”
“The report says that they could not be sure they could clearly say that [Trump] did not violate the law,” Barr continued, before stressing, “as you know that’s not the standard, we use in the criminal justice system.” Rather, “it’s presumed that someone is innocent, and the government has to prove that they clearly violated the law. We’re not in the business of exoneration, not in the business of proving they’d didn’t violate the law—I found that whole passage very bizarre.”
Sen. Thom Tillis later returned to this point, first noting that the special counsel concluded it could not exonerate the president on obstruction. “When is a special counsel in the business of exonerating a subject on an investigation?” Tillis queried Barr. “They are not,” the attorney general replied. 5. Mueller Got Obstruction Law Wrong Too
One of the problems with Mueller’s approach to the question of obstruction of justice, Barr explained during the hearing, was the special counsel “trying to determine the subjective intent of a facially lawful act.” That approach “permits a lot of selectivity on the part of the prosecutors, and it’s been shot down in a number of other contexts.”
While Barr did not further expand during the hearing on Mueller’s misinterpretation of the law, he had previously destroyed the idea that Trump’s conduct could constitute criminal obstruction of justice. 6. Mueller Sent His Boss a ‘Snitty’ Letter
Mueller submitted his special counsel report to Barr on March 22, but that report could not be made public until necessary redactions were made. Pending the redactions, Barr released a letter on March 24, announcing Mueller’s conclusion: no collusion, and no decision on obstruction of justice.
Mueller didn’t like the way Barr’s letter was playing in the press, so he sent a letter on March 27, complaining to his boss that Barr’s March 24 letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions,” and asking Barr to release the executive summaries of the special counsel report. ‘Bob, what is with the letter? Why don’t you just pick up the phone and call me if there is an issue?’
The public did not learn of Mueller’s March 27 letter until the day before Barr hit the Hill to discuss the special counsel’s findings, when the Washington Post published a leaked copy of Mueller’s letter. The timing proved politically expedient: Mueller’s criticism of Barr dominated the news cycle in the lead up to the hearing, and Democrats hammered Barr throughout the hearing for his supposed misrepresentation of the special counsel’s report.
While this tactic may have pleased some partisans, Barr’s response resonated with the open-minded. When asked his reaction to the letter, Barr testified that he called Mueller, “I said, ‘Bob, what is with the letter? Why don’t you just pick up the phone and call me if there is an issue?’” The attorney general added that “the letter is a bit snitty and it was probably written by one of his staff people.”
On the merit of Mueller’s complaint, Barr explained during the hearing that he asked the special counsel if “he was suggesting that the March 24th letter was inaccurate and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate and that the press was reading too much into it.”
In short, Mueller wanted Barr to counter the media’s coverage by issuing the executive summaries from the special counsel report. But Barr told Mueller he “was not interested in putting out summaries and wasn’t going to put out the report piecemeal.” “I wanted to get the whole report out,” Barr explained, which he did on April 18.
In a head-to-head contest, Barr came off the bigger man, with the leak of Mueller’s letter harming the special counsel’s reputation much more than that of the attorney general.
Further, while sending a snitty letter to the attorney general was a dumb move, even dumber was putting pen to paper to complain that Barr’s letter announcing the conclusion of the special counsel “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the report. This complaint was a tacit acknowledgement that the special counsel’s 200-page discussion of obstruction of justice served solely to show one thing: orange man bad. 7. Mueller Made Some Horrendous Staffing Choices
The letter incident proved yet another problem with Mueller’s handling of the probe: his horrendous staffing choices. That Mueller would pick a team of “professionals” who would think it wise to draft the snitty letter, then convince Mueller to send it to his boss—or lacked the good sense to counsel against the move—speaks poorly of the man charged with investigating the president. 8. Mueller Could Have Previewed Barr’s Letter But Didn’t
While Mueller had no problem criticizing Barr’s March 24 letter after the fact, the special counsel demurred when Barr sought his input before he released the letter to Congress and the American people.
“I offered Bob Mueller the opportunity to review that letter before it went out, and he declined,” Barr explained in his opening statement. It takes some chutzpah to refuse to review a letter before it is dispatched, only to criticize it after the fact! 9. Mueller’s Team Was Responsible for Report Delay
In his March 27 complaint letter to Barr, Mueller bemoaned the media’s narrative and asked Barr to release the executive summaries of the special counsel report while the attorney general went through the necessary redaction process. As noted above, Barr refused because he wanted to get the full report out as soon as possible, which he did on April 18. Mueller delayed the report release much beyond what would have been needed had he just done his job.
However, had Mueller done his job, the special counsel report could have been issued much earlier, thereby truncating the media spin of which Mueller complained. Barr made this point in his opening statement to the Judiciary Committee, explaining that when he met with Mueller in early March “I reiterated to Special Counsel Mueller that in order to have the shortest possible time before I was in a position to release the report, I asked that they identify 6E materials,” which are grand jury materials that statute prohibits from release.
Barr had asked that Mueller identity the 6E material “so we could redact the material and prepare the report for public release as quickly as we could.” But as Barr explained to the committee, “Unfortunately it did not come in that form . . . so there was necessarily going to be a gap between the receipt of the report and getting the full report out publicly.”
By failing to identify the grand jury material in the special counsel report—as his boss had requested—Mueller delayed the report release much beyond what would have been needed had he just done his job. “The problem we had,” as Barr explained, was “we could not identify the 6E material when the report came over. We needed the help of Mueller’s team.” 10. Mueller Didn’t Investigate (Or Report On) All Russian Interference
Mueller’s final misstep was the step not taken. Even though he was charged with investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, Mueller’s report omitted any discussion of whether the Kremlin fed dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation about Donald Trump. As I wrote on Monday:
Not once in the 448-page tome does Mueller mention an investigation into whether Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election by feeding dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation.
But Mueller also did not charge Steele with lying to the FBI, or refer a criminal case against Steele to federal prosecutors, as he did when the special counsel uncovered evidence of criminal misconduct unrelated to the 2016 election. Given Mueller’s conclusion that no one connected to the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election, one of those two scenarios must be true—either Russia fed Steele disinformation or Steele lied to the FBI about his Russian sources.
These ten missteps make clear that Mueller wasn’t the right man for the job. But Barr is. Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Chris Cuomo Says Pro-Life More About 'Faith And Feeling Than Fact',thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/apple-banana-chris-cuomo-says-pro-life-movement-faith-feeling-fact/,"May 8, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
Chris Cuomo is an “anchor” at CNN. On Tuesday, with all the casualness of a lunch order he revealed a significant personal bias about one of today’s most contentious political issues.
Defending his performance in this absurd Monday segment with Christine Quinn, Cuomo fired off a tweet worth bookmarking. Although conservatives had been circulating the Quinn clip critically for hours, the critique to which he was responding actually came from the left. Disingenuous? No. There is certainly a need to explain the medical realities of the procedures and the risks to women of losing access to care but this is about politics mostly – and the pro- life position is more about faith and feeling than fact. But I pursue both avenues https://t.co/iTO2VQZwhh
— Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) May 7, 2019
And there it is: “the pro-life position is more about faith and feeling than fact.” That’s obviously fine as the banal dorm room musings of a college freshman. As a prime-time news anchor’s stated position on abortion, it’s bananas ( horrible pun intended ).
The beauty of Twitter is that its immediacy tempts journalists like Cuomo into exposing these biases. If he insists on covering abortion, I’d rather know about his misguided condescension for the pro-life movement than wonder about it. Indeed, tweets like these help us understand why segments like the one that precipitated this debate happen the first place. It’s also perfectly fine for journalists to share their personal opinions—when they identify as opinion journalists.
Cuomo does not. His title at CNN is “anchor.” His bio on the network’s website reads, “Chris Cuomo anchors CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time, a 9pm nightly news program where Cuomo tests power with newsmakers and politicians from both sides of the aisle, and reports on the latest breaking news from Washington and around the world.”
He is not Rachel Maddow; he is not Sean Hannity. In fact, he openly distinguishes himself from both of them. “Maddow’s a professor, Hannity’s a preacher. … I was built for the battle,” he recently told The Hollywood Reporter. “You are rarely hearing my opinion on television,” Cuomo asserted to Rolling Stone last year, lamenting that “Politics was easier to cover when people weren’t so blatantly abusive of facts.”
Whatever your position, abortion, of course, is no minor issue. It’s one of the most important policy questions to both parties. Now we know an “anchor” at the “Facts First” network is completely biased against one side.
If you’re one of CNN’s few remaining viewers , remember Cuomo’s take on abortion next time he covers it. The conversation will probably make a lot more sense. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky ."

Everything Seth Meyers Said About Ilhan Omar Is Wrong,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/everything-seth-meyers-said-about-ilhan-omar-is-wrong/,"By David Harsanyi May 8, 2019
During Meghan McCain’s appearance on Seth Meyers’“Late Night” this week, the two got into a bit of an argument over the former’s criticism of Rep. Ilhan Omar’s anti-Semitism.
“I do think it’s fairly dangerous and you brought it up after Congresswoman Omar had some death threats against her,” Meyers lectured McCain, who held her own in the back and forth. “Do you think, you know, she has obviously now stated that she needs to be more careful with her language, don’t you think other people who talk about her need to be more thoughtful as well? Or do you stand by those comments of tying her to this, her rhetoric to this synagogue shooting?”
The first part of this rhetorical question is setting up a destructive standard to undermine debate. For one thing, a public figure—an elected official, no less—has no dispensation from criticism merely because some nut sends her a death threat. Nor is there any indulgence for being a Muslim woman or black women or white middle-aged man, or anyone else. Omar is a 37-year-old educated woman who was elected to the U.S. Congress, not a middle schooler playacting in the Model U.N.
McCain condemned Omar’s words. She didn’t concoct a smear.
For another, we know Meyers’s standard is a transparent tactic to chill speech because of its selective deployment. Progressives didn’t stop arguing that Republicans were really just a bunch of fascists trying steal health care from the poor minority babies after a leftist shooter tried to assassinate the entire Republican leadership on a softball field in Alexandria, Virginia. Neither did Meyers, nor anyone else, stop perpetuating the fantastical notion that Trump conspired with Russia to steal the election just because the president receives death threats every day.
“Trump is a Traitor,” the shooter, James Hodgkinson, wrote on Facebook before the shooting. “Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.” This sounds like any number of Twitter feeds from liberal columnists. No one feels the slightest bit inhibited.
Furthermore, Omar never really apologized. And even if she did, so what? Would Meyers care if Steve King was really, really sorry for his previous statements, or would he care more about the congressman’s policy positions?
Sure, Democratic House leadership pressured Omar to put together the words “unequivocally” and “apologize,” but those words were a precursor to a textbook “I’m-sorry-you-were-offended” non-apology. Listening to Omar and her defenders, you might be under the impression that her allegedly unintentional use of “tropes,” not the ugly ideas that gird her worldview, was what triggered many American Jews.
If you doubt this is true, listen to her own explanation. When Qatari mouthpiece Mehdi Hasan asked her if she had apologized for being either knowingly or unknowingly anti-Semitic, Omar responded: “Absolutely not. I apologized for the way that my words made people feel.”
Omar’s words make me feel like we have a congresswoman who peddles policy ideas that will get Jews killed. Her words make me feel like I’m listening to the kind of ideas about America that had long been relegated to college campuses.
Meyers also asked a misleading rhetorical question about whether people could be “critical” of Israel without being called anti-Semitic. Virtually every member of the Barack Obama administration was critical of Israel. Tons of people are critical of Israel all the time. Omar wasn’t merely critical of Israel—and by critical of Israel, it is true that she doesn’t believe it should exist—but she smeared American Jews as seditious activists.
So I’m sorry, but your condolences over the synagogue shooting in Poway, California, don’t really hold sway when the next week you defend terrorists who fire more than 700 rockets into Israel, killing at least four people for no other reason than that they were Jews.
Yet it’s not just the Jews. And it’s not merely that Omar dismissed the al-Qaida mass murderers as “some people” who “did something.” (Meyers claims that her comments were taken out of context, which is true. They are worse in context .) It’s not only that she referred to the dozen dead U.S. soldiers and 73 wounded in the Battle of Mogadishu as participants in the “worst terrorist attack in Somalia history” and the murderer of thousands (false). It’s not that Omar blames the United States rather than authoritarianism and socialism for the devastation in Venezuela. It’s all these things. Omar dislikes America and liberalism for the same reasons she dislikes Israel.
“I’m just someone who cares about the fact that there’s someone out there who is in a minority, who has had death threats against her, and I think that we should all use the same language,” Myers said. “You’re asking her to be careful about her language, and I would ask everyone to be careful about theirs.”
What makes people think Omar isn’t careful? Maybe she’s just being honest about what she thinks of Jews. And why should her critics have trepidation about calling her out? Democrats, including nearly every presidential candidate, have defended her. They have celebrated her. They have appeared on magazine covers with her. The idea that McCain put her in danger, as Meyers suggested , is just a way to try and shut people up."
"Ladies, Stop Trying to Have Sex Like Men",thefederalist.com,Suzanne Venker,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/ladies-stop-trying-to-have-sex-like-men/,"May 9, 2019 By Suzanne Venker
In her book “Unprotected,” former campus psychiatrist Dr. Miriam Grossman introduces readers to Olivia, a college student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) who had been valedictorian of her high school class and was planning to go to medical school. After she arrived on campus, Olivia had a short-term relationship with a young man. When it ended, she had bouts of bingeing and vomiting and ended up at the campus health center, where she met Dr. Grossman.
It turns out Olivia had had her first sexual experience with the young man, and she told Grossman she couldn’t stop thinking about him. She especially couldn’t handle seeing him in class. “Why,” Olivia asked her, “do they tell you how to protect your body from herpes and pregnancy, but they don’t tell you what it does to your heart?”
Kerry Cohen, author of the memoir “Loose Girl,” can relate. In her book, Cohen examines her promiscuous past, which included sleeping with almost 40 boys and men. “Loose Girl” analyzes in great detail all of the emotions that accompanied Cohen’s sexual experiences. She reviewed the reasons why she had sex, why she chose the boys and men she did, how she felt leading up to each encounter, how she felt afterward, and what she expected to happen compared to what actually did happen. At the end of the day, what Cohen wanted was for guys to like her. “I let these men inside me, wanting to make me matter to them.”
It’s difficult to imagine the young man Olivia slept with having bouts of bingeing and vomiting and winding up at the campus health center as a result of his time with Olivia, just as it’s difficult to imagine a young man authoring a book like Cohen’s. The average guy who engages in commitment-free sex doesn’t ruminate over who he had sex with or why he did it—he knows why he did it.
Nor will he typically have sex with a woman because he wants her to like him. Many men have sex for no other reason than it’s available. “For a man, this might be a peasant trip down memory lane, counting up one’s conquests,” wrote Cohen. “But for a girl, it’s a whole other story.” A whole other story indeed.
Where did the idea that women could and should have indiscriminate sex with men originate? And when? The perfect storm for this still relatively new behavior was the sexual revolution, which proudly promoted commitment-free sex, and the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the pill—both of which occurred in the 1960s.
Prior to that time, there was both a spoken and an unspoken narrative about sex: that it is meant for marriage—or, at the very least, for a committed adult relationship. It’s true people didn’t always agree on the marriage point, but they agreed that commitment was crucial. The idea that a person would go to bed with someone she just met or didn’t know well was absurd (and taboo as well).
No more. With a magic pill that would change literally everything, and the “free sex” mentality that swept the nation, a new idea was born: women can be just like men. With pregnancy off the table, women could be free to sow their wild oats, too. Problem is, most women don’t want to. And those who do quickly learn that their bodies won’t cooperate.
Indeed, contraception may prevent pregnancy, but it can’t do a thing about female nature. It can’t make a woman a man’s sexual “equal.” Yet we operate under the delusion that it does. From college campuses to our nation’s boardrooms, women try to pursue sex the way men often do: no commitment necessary. And they’re getting burned.
I wrote an article to this effect recently entitled “ Why one-night stands don’t work for women .” It was not an argument for why one-night stands are “fine” for men but not for women. I don’t believe anyone should engage in casual sex. I agree 100 percent with Jordan Peterson’s assessment, whom I quoted at the end of my article:
People treat sex like it’s casual. It’s not. Sex is unbelievably complicated. It’s dangerous. It involves emotions. It involves pregnancy. It involves illness. It involves betrayal. It reaches right down into the roots of someone. You don’t play with something like that casually. Well, you can, but you’ll pay for it.
Peterson made this observation during one of his countless interviews, and it was unfortunately quickly forgotten. I believe it to be a truism that should be repeated over and over again, for it has never before been acknowledged by anyone in power. Instead, the assumption is that when it comes to sex, the birth control pill—in effect—turned women into men.
It didn’t. In a qualitative exploration of college hookups, the authors of the journal article “The Casualties of Casual Sex,” concluded (among other things) that women’s response to casual sex is very different from men’s:
The dominant notion of regret for females to center around shame and self-blame for engaging in sexual behaviors in the context of a hookup. Not knowing their partner and the lack of further contact with the partner seemed to compound their regrets and anger at themselves. The dominant notion of regret for males [emphasis mine] centered on disappointment over a bad choice of hookup partner. One female participant expressed this view: ‘During a hookup, females feel special, desirable, pretty; men feel hot and in control. Afterwards, females wonder if he’s going to call, what it means, did she do the right thing. Males feel nothing. Males don’t care, just as long as they get laid.
So many women today learn the hard way what their mothers or grandmothers have always known: sex for women is not the same as sex for men. Most men can have sex with a woman to whom they are not emotionally attached and not lose sleep over it. That is not the case for most women. Even the most sexually liberal woman is surprised to learn she cannot detach the way men can. She might appear indifferent toward casual sex, but her own reaction will often surprise her.
Take Alissa, 20, who has had six one-night stands and, within the past year, two different sex partners. When asked whether she thought she should be emotionally involved with someone before having sex with a guy, her contradictory views speak volumes:
No, sex is not that big of a deal. When you first have sex, it is a big deal, but once you’ve lost your virginity, it gradually becomes less important to be in love with the guy. The more you have sex, the less of a big deal it becomes … I get attached to guys I have sex with very easily because I’m very emotional; I think this is natural for all girls. If the guy is really a jerk, though, and I have nothing in common with him, then it’s a lot easier not to get emotionally involved than if I like the guy. Once I sleep with a guy, I feel that there is a bond between the two of us because we’ve shared our bodies and left ourselves vulnerable to each other. I think of the guy as being mine in a way, even though I know we don’t have a relationship.
Jessica, 21, has had six different sex partners within the past year and characterizes herself as strong feminist who “doesn’t need men in any way.” In speaking with Jessica, she gave the impression she found casual sex acceptable. But elsewhere in the interview, she admits she doesn’t engage in casual sex often because she doesn’t want to get hurt.
When I first go to bed with a guy, I wonder whether sex was all he was after and how he’ll treat me in the morning. If I like the guy, I worry about whether he cares about me; otherwise, I don’t care what he thinks. I’m not especially bothered by a one-night stand. I think of it as opening up; if it’s only for one night, that’s okay … I have to have control of myself. I can’t get so wrapped up in [my boyfriend] that I forget about myself.
That women tend to become attached after sex isn’t just limited to college women. In one of the sexual assault claims against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, lawyers unearthed emails between Weinstein and his accuser that confirmed the relationship was consensual. The most significant exchange was this one: “I love you, always do,” the woman wrote after the alleged attack. “But I hate feeling like a booty call.” Her message was followed up with a smiling-face emoji.
With uncommitted sex, women are playing a game they can’t win. Feeling “used,” or like a “booty call,” is the most common experience of women who engage in casual sex, or “hookups,” whether they’re teenagers or grown women. That just isn’t the case for most men.
It is true more women than ever are engaging in commitment-free sex—Lord knows they’re trying!—but this behavior does not in any way alter the unique sexual psychologies of women and men. In other words, women can try to act like men all they want. But the results will be drastically different for most of them.

Colorado Students Walk Out Of School Shooting Vigil After It Turns Political,thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/colorado-students-walk-out-of-school-shooting-vigil-after-it-turns-political/,"May 9, 2019 By Mollie Hemingway
Colorado students walked out of an event billed as a vigil for Kendrick Castillo, an 18-year-old killed in a shooting at his school on Tuesday, when prominent speakers attempted to turn it into a rally for gun control. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) and Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colorado) each took a turn calling for gun control at the Douglas County event before students streamed out in protest.
Two students at STEM Highlands Ranch , a K-12 charter school focused on science, technology, engineering, and math, shot nine students , one fatally. The accused students, who were arrested, are an adult male and a juvenile female who identifies as male. The accused male had written anti-Christian social media messages. He drove a car with a pentagram spray-painted on the hood, as well as other graffiti:
In response to the shooting, a public vigil was announced at another local public high school: Highlands Ranch High School. It was sponsored by the gun control groups Brady’s Team Enough and March for Our Lives and featured Democratic politicians who seek limits on Second Amendment gun rights, but was billed instead as an event to remember and honor Castillo and other victims. As the politicians called for gun control, students left in protest over the politicization of the deaths and injuries.
Bennet, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president and is pictured in the tweet below, said , “We live in a great country, but we need to fix these broken gun laws.” Students from the #STEMshooting in Colorado stormed out of a rally organized by gun-control advocates Wednesday night after growing angry about the politicization of their trauma. pic.twitter.com/uCLEqt89VY

Students then returned to the gymnasium, taking over the event, complaining about adults politicizing what they hoped would be a remembrance of their friend Castillo, a young man with an interest in robotics who had heroically rushed a shooter. Students also gave Bennet a piece of their mind, telling him to focus on “ mental health ” issues. Students from Highlands Ranch HS hosted a community vigil in support of STEM students. A group of STEM students and other walked out of the event after a few voiced concerns about not being listed as speakers for the vigil program. #9News pic.twitter.com/3kA7bbnjAS

Following a terrible school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last year, CNN hosted an anti-gun rally that whitewashed Sheriff Scott Israel’s fatal errors, blamed Second Amendment supporter Dana Loesch as a culprit , allowed Sen. Marco Rubio to be equated to the school shooter, and lifted up Democratic politicians such as Ted Deutsch as heroes. Mollie Ziegler Hemingway is a senior editor at The Federalist.

Not Getting Your First-Choice Gay Wedding Cake Is Nothing Like Getting The Measles,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/not-getting-first-choice-gay-wedding-cake-nothing-like-getting-measles/,"By Nathanael Blake May 9, 2019
Cake is rarely a matter of life or death, although British comedian Eddie Izzard once suggested that the Church of England is so squishy that an Anglican Inquisition would offer a choice between cake or death . This bit of absurdist humor was recently one-upped by The New York Times, which published a rambling column by Margaret Renkl that concluded: “It’s time to stop giving believers a pass just because their beliefs happen to run counter to the laws of the nation they live in. Human lives may depend on it.”
Among these hazards of religious liberty are bakers whose “religious convictions prevent [them] from baking a wedding cake for a gay couple.” Other dangers include school prayer and employers offering workers health insurance that does not cover some contraceptives. Also, measles.
One of these things is not like the others. Not Getting Your First-Choice Cake Isn’t Life-Threatening
Measles can be a life-threatening disease. Not getting a custom ceremonial pastry from one’s first-choice bakery is less so, as is listening to school prayer and buying birth control for oneself. Furthermore, although there are religious communities that oppose vaccination to varying degrees (Renkl singles out “ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities”), the movement against vaccines has been driven by bad science and fearmongering frauds like disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield, not by religious doctrine.
So why is the Times publishing pieces conflating life-threatening diseases with difficulties in decorative cake acquisition? If Renkl and her editors are concerned about religious exemptions to measles vaccinations, they could have written and published an article focused on that and saved the cake wars and school-prayer fights for another time. Rather, they mostly seem to care about measles outbreaks as a means to attack religious liberty claims by conservative Christians.
Their theory seems to be that allowing any religious liberty claims opens the door to spurious and dangerous claims of religious liberty. But this is a non sequitur. There are well-established legal doctrines that do not allow religious liberty claims to be an unquestioned “get out of jail free” card.
However, this jurisprudence does put the burden of proof on the government when it seeks to restrict the free exercise of religion. That the government may have a compelling interest in restricting religious liberty with regard to vaccinations for potentially deadly diseases does not mean that the government also has a compelling interest in forcing people to produce customized ceremonial pastries.
This should be obvious, but Renkl seems to reject all religious liberty claims that might hinder government action. If arbitrary power is the goal, all limiting factors on government authority are rejected as a matter of principle. This inverts the American principle that the government bears the burden of proof when it seeks restrictions on fundamental liberties, and it will not be confined to squashing religious liberty claims. The Never-ending Desire for Government Control
Leftists want to control pretty much everything. They desire a world in which the government controls education and health care and regulates commerce. Nothing is too inconsequential for them to dictate, so they believe the federal government must tell employers what contraceptive coverage to include in health insurance plans. The government must require bakers and other wedding vendors to create custom products for ceremonies they abhor.
Thus, despite all of their talk about multiculturalism, progressivism is incompatible with pluralism. The more government regulates, the less opportunity there is for diverse communities and ways of life to develop and flourish. As government expands, the space for belief and action that do not comport with government opinion shrinks. Pluralism requires the government to back off and leave room for diverse communities, beliefs, and ways of life, intervening only when necessary.
This genuine pluralism would not resolve all difficult questions, but it would restrict conflict to them, instead of bringing the force of government down on a few recalcitrant crafters of wedding accessories and foodstuffs. It would not casually use the coercive force of government.
Renkl probably does not consider herself a violent person, but she is an enthusiast for an expanding system of state violence. Behind every government rule and regulation is the barrel of a gun. This is often cloaked, but those who ignore or defy the government long enough will find men with guns (and a willingness to use them) coming for them. Sometimes the cloak is barely there—many of the laws being deployed against nonconformist wedding vendors include jail time among the penalties.
Government edicts always have an “or else” to ensure compliance. Little old white liberal ladies do not personally enforce the laws they lobby for, but someone does and even minor interactions with law enforcement can turn deadly. A writer for The New York Times should remember the death of Eric Garner, killed by the police arresting him for allegedly selling single cigarettes. In an egregious case in Maryland, cops working security murdered a man with Down syndrome over a movie theater ticket.
This is the system of state-sanctioned violence Renkl will rely on in to punish religious nonconformists in disputes over ceremonial pastries. Cake or death, indeed. Nathanael Blake is a Senior Contributor at The Federalist. He has a PhD in political theory. He lives in Missouri. Photo"
Why Anita Hill’s Grudge Against Joe Biden Could Be His Achilles’ Heel,thefederalist.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/anita-hills-grudge-against-joe-biden-could-be-his-achilles-heel/,"By Jonathan S. Tobin May 9, 2019
The rollout of Joe Biden’s third presidential campaign went about as well as he could have hoped. Despite his lackluster performances in the campaign debut video and some of his first speeches since declaring his candidacy, Biden raised impressive amounts of money and saw his already strong poll numbers go up once he entered the ranks of the already swollen Democratic presidential field.
With the current RealClearPolitics average of polls showing him with a 39 to 15.5 percent lead over Bernie Sanders and with the rest of the field only in single digits, Biden deserves the title of early Democratic frontrunner. Unfortunately for him, Biden has a problem named Anita Hill.
Biden carries an enormous amount of political baggage after almost a half-century in Washington politics. His opposition to forced busing for desegregation in the 1970s is heresy in today’s intersectional Democratic Party, where identity politics is the coin of the realm. His championing of the 1994 crime bill that is credited with massively increasing the number of African-Americans who have been incarcerated is just as much of a problem for the same reason.
But unlike those issues, Biden’s Anita Hill problem is embodied in a person rather than a talking point. Since, as Hill recently told The New York Times, she has not been mollified by his recent expression of “regret” (but not an apology) for his conduct toward her in 1991 when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, that could create the kind of obstacle that might be enough to outweigh electability in the eyes of a critical mass of Democratic primary voters.
The Biden lead is built on three elements. One is his near-universal name recognition after eight years as vice president and 36 years in the Senate. The other is his reputation as President Barack Obama’s loyal foot soldier, a real asset in a party where the 44th president is still political royalty. Last and perhaps most important is the belief that he is the most electable Democrat running, something members of the anti-Trump “resistance” value perhaps even more than ideology. Can Biden Beat Trump?
To Democrats, including many who count themselves as staunch liberals, beating Trump and making the bad dream of 2016 finally go away is all they care about.
Seen in the light of their desperate desire to oust Trump, nominating a woman, a minority, or a gay man who better represents the beliefs of the party base doesn’t seem so important. If Biden can manage to spend the next year campaigning in a manner that will give Democrats the impression that he can stand up to Trump and avoid sounding like the “crazy old Joe” stereotype that the president will pound away at (such as his recent statement in which he said “Margaret Thatcher” rather than “Theresa May” when referring to the current British prime minister), then he might coast to the nomination despite the competition.
Many Democratic voters came of age long after the epic and divisive battles over busing and aren’t likely to judge Biden too harshly because of what he said during the Nixon, Ford, or Carter administrations. The same is largely true for the crime bill that was passed a quarter-century ago.
Those issues also have less power because Biden is not running as a moderate Democrat but as one who is very interested in portraying himself as just as much of a supporter of radical causes like the Green New Deal and a vast expansion of federal entitlements. Although it dates back to events that took place nearly 28 years ago, his Anita Hill problem poses a much greater danger to his prospects. When Me Too and Anita Hill Join Forces
That is partly due to the enormous importance of the Me Too movement that began to dominate conversations about sexual harassment and assault in late 2017. It was lost on no one that the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last fall was something of a rerun of the circus surrounding the Thomas hearings Biden presided over. The treatment of Hill must now be viewed as a contemporary concern rather than one rooted primarily in history, as is the case with Biden’s other past stands.
Hill also looms as a threat to his candidacy because Biden is too afraid of the left to defend himself. Although the notion of his cruelty to Hill is now part of the liberal catechism, the truth is that Biden doesn’t owe her any regrets, let alone an apology.
Biden didn’t merely vote against Thomas. The justice and his defenders rightly held Biden responsible for the circus atmosphere in which Democrats brought forward a last-minute accusation to derail his confirmation.
Thomas was looking directly at Biden when he famously said that he was being subjected to “a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” in which unsubstantiated “sleaze” was being publicly hurled at him. Thomas’s impassioned defense of his character and reputation convinced the majority of Americans at the time, and that convinced the Senate to narrowly confirm him.
But over time, as Thomas maintained a dignified silence about his ordeal, his detractors in popular culture and the media seized control of the narrative. In that retelling, the judge’s guilt was assumed. That’s how Hill acquired the reputation as a secular saint who had been sacrificed by men like Biden on the altar of male privilege.
Although the collective memory of the hearings is now one in which Hill was scorned and disbelieved, the senators did not treat Hill discourteously. They did question her closely about her charges; they asked for details. They probed for inconsistencies and asked reasonable questions about her dealings with Thomas and how and why she had stepped forward to accuse him.
That was enough to raise doubts about her testimony in the minds of the public as well as the admittedly, all-male committee. Moreover, as the late senator Arlen Specter (who was Hill’s most persistent questioner on the committee) noted later in his memoirs, Biden admitted to him that he believed Hill was lying. Is Biden to Blame for Hill’s Poor Showing?
The idea that Biden should have conducted the hearings differently only makes sense if those accused of sexual misconduct must be assumed to be guilty until proven innocent. Biden’s committee didn’t prevent Hill from making explicit and detailed accusations about what she said Thomas had said and done. And the accusation that he denied her right to bring in corroborating witnesses is another myth that collapses upon closer examination . But in the Me Too era, asking an accuser to substantiate or corroborate her allegations is considered to be a form of unconscionable abuse.
That’s why, when Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward to accuse Kavanaugh of teenage misbehavior that could neither be conclusively proved nor disproved, none of the Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee dared pose a single question to her. Even their designated counsel refrained from doing anything more than gently asking about details with nary a question about any inconsistencies or discrepancies in her story.
The reckoning for a culture in which sexual harassment and even assault was not treated as serious crimes was long overdue when the Me Too movement emerged. But the idea that those who make such accusations should not be challenged or that the accused has no right to defend themselves against what they allege to be false charges are parodies of American justice.
The problem for Biden is not just the way the public now views the Thomas hearings, but also the fact that Hill seems to be still burning with resentment at him. Hill is a living, breathing symbol of Me Too who could, if she chooses, act as a personal scourge of Biden that could be greatly destructive of his presidential hopes.
Should Hill be willing to keep speaking out about Biden’s alleged offenses, it will be a far more telling blow than any references to the Thomas hearings, either direct or oblique, from the other Democratic challengers. As her New York Times interview indicated, Hill intends to judge Biden’s performance in the upcoming campaign. That leaves open the possibility that she may choose to personally intervene to make further demands upon Biden, to claim that his responses are unsatisfactory or to give a boost to one of his competitors that could demolish his lead.
In a very real sense, Anita Hill holds Biden’s presidential future in her hands. Jonathan S. Tobin is editor in chief of JNS.org and a contributing writer for National Review. Follow him on Twitter . Photo"
"Stumping In NYC, Dan Crenshaw Says AOC Knows ‘How To Be Famous’",thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/stumping-nyc-dan-crenshaw-says-aoc-knows-famous/,"By David Marcus May 9, 2019
Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw was in Brooklyn and Staten Island last week, stumping for Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis in her bid to win New York’s 11th congressional district. Even though we are well more than a year away from the 2020 election, the visit from the Texas congressman may hold some clues about how House Republicans plan to reverse their 2018 losses and perhaps even take back the chamber.
Three things at work here deserve some notice. First is Crenshaw himself, who has emerged as leading young voice in the GOP. Second is Malliotakis, a prototype of a young, diverse, female candidate in a swing suburbanish district. Finally, looming in the background are Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the far-left socialist wing of the House Democratic caucus.
Through a combination of charisma, social media savvy, and a turn on “Saturday Night Live,” Crenshaw has become a big voice in the Republican Party whom we can expect to see stumping for candidates all over the country. Malliotakis told me in an interview, “He’s a rising star in the party. A Navy SEAL war hero and congressman. He’s unique.”
I asked Crenshaw about his newfound fame and how he plans to use that opportunity, and while he told me he doesn’t plan to be involved in many primaries, in some cases like Malliotakis’s he sees a “clear-cut opportunity to support somebody and get them out [of the primary] quickly and unscathed.” It is clear that he sees a role for himself in helping to prime the pump for GOP victories and will be not just an asset to candidates, but someone thinking about a broader strategy that can win.
Malliotakis appears to be exactly the kind of candidate that Republicans need to compete in the districts, like NY11, that they lost in 2018. Crenshaw emphasized that, “We need more young smart, experienced women in the GOP to get out our message.” Malliotakis, who took on Bill de Blasio in the 2017 New York mayor’s race, fits that bill to a T.
Her brand of politics is focused on good government, urging that “Government should be utilizing tax dollars properly and putting resources where they should be, keep us safe, make sure the public school system is a good one, focus on infrastructure, roads, and transit.” Her approach is more about making government work for the people and less about the government being the problem.
But while both Crenshaw and Malliotakis want to focus on what Republicans can achieve if they take back the House, especially with a Trump economy going like gangbusters, there is an unavoidable and indelible force to fight against in front of them too. Ocasio-Cortez, whose district is a mere three miles from NY11, and her cadre of committed socialists will be an important and obvious target for all GOP candidates looking to recapture purple districts. This is something Democratic leadership understands too, and it explains their flailing and failing efforts to tamp the radical flames.
For Malliotakis this is personal. Her family had to flee Cuba after the Communist revolution there, all except her grandfather who stayed behind to try to protect gas stations and a home that he owned from state seizure. Her mother never saw her father again. “Socialism is Communism lite,” Malliotakis told me. She went on to say that people who have experienced it take a very different and dimmer view of it than people who have only learned about it in a classroom.
On paper, Malliotakis’ opponent is Rep. Max Rose, a war veteran and a Democrat desperate to cast himself as a moderate. But in some sense the real opponent is AOC and far-left New Progressives. In that fight, Malliotakis presents a convex mirror image of Ocasio-Cortez, and is a candidate who cannot be brushed off with quips about race or sex.
When I asked Crenshaw about Ocasio-Cortez, he was a bit more demure when I suggested he was the GOP’s version. “We operate on very different wavelengths,” he told me, but went on to say, “we utilize social media, we try to connect with voters in a way that’s not only about politics. Letting people into your lives.” He discussed how he and his team are meticulous in how they approach social media and branding in general.
In a moment that felt almost like admiration Crenshaw said, “AOC understands how to be famous. It’s got to be natural. It’s genuine.” That is, of course, something that Crenshaw has in his back pocket, too. It is very easy to see why candidates like Malliotakis want him in their districts and why the national Republican Party will want to put him front and center.
After either party gains huge victories in the House there is generally a correction. Some of those close wins go back the other way, especially in a presidential election cycle. Rose won NY11 by a comfortable margin against a fairly lackluster opponent in 2018, but Malliotakis is anything but lackluster.
If the GOP can field candidates like her, in districts like that, and let Crenshaw be a leading figure and voice, they may have something. And based on Crenshaw already stumping for 2020, it seems like they know it.

Dear Wives: Publicly Criticizing Your Husband Makes You Look Horrible,thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/dear-wives-publicly-criticizing-husband-makes-look-horrible/,"By Melissa Langsam Braunstein May 9, 2019
As a 22-year-old, I didn’t know who I would end up dating or marrying, but I felt sure there would be no fellow writer, especially not a fiction writer. There was something intrinsically off-putting about the thought of getting close to someone who might use my life and quirks to tell my story their way. And what if things soured? I assumed I really wouldn’t like what I read.
So I can only imagine what it’s like to read about yourself in a non-fictional account, particularly when your spouse is putting you on blast in a major national newspaper. If this were a one-time thing, I might shake my head. But after reading the latest installment in the “my husband disappoints me” genre in The New York Times last weekend — this one penned by a clinical psychologist — I’d say we have a trend. And America, we need to talk.
Darcy Lockman, whose editors sneeringly titled her opinion article, “What ‘Good’ Dads Get Away With,” opens by telling us, “When my husband and I became parents a decade ago, we were not prepared for the ways in which sexism was about to express itself in our relationship.” She proceeds to describe her husband’s cluelessness and lack of engagement, as well as their disagreement about whether she frequently noted his (perceived) failings.
As I read this, I suspected I was supposed to identify with the writer and cackle about what a jerk her husband is. Yet my sympathies were with him. How did he feel reading about himself in The Times and having countless people read this unflattering account? Did his wife bother to run a draft of this article by him before publication? And would there be more unfortunate details in his wife’s forthcoming book, entitled “All the Rage: Mothers, Fathers, and the Myth of Equal Partnership?”
I know the answers to none of those questions. However, I do know that if someone wants me to change the way I’m doing something, the most effective strategy is to speak directly to me. Not starting from the assumption that I’m doing things a certain way to be annoying, or that I’m driven by malice, laziness, or sexism. Not attacking me, and definitely not savaging me in front of a crowd.
I presume this describes most people, including most men. So, why are a growing number of women publicly criticizing their husbands ?
Women have probably vented about marital frustrations since men and women started pairing off. Yet it’s one thing to confide in a trusted friend or relative who knows both players and supports the continued existence of the marriage. It’s an entirely different kettle of fish to gripe publicly or commit those complaints to print, where they can be read by friends, relatives, colleagues, and endless strangers.
It’s hard to pinpoint when this trend erupted, although looking at the widely admired Michelle Obama might be a worthwhile starting point. In 2007, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote about wincing “when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal.” In Michelle’s words, “‘For some reason this guy still can’t manage to put the butter up when he makes toast, secure the bread so that it doesn’t get stale, and his 5-year-old is still better at making the bed than he is.’” Oh, and Barack didn’t put his dirty socks in the laundry.
Now, I shared Michelle’s distaste for the messianic tone some of her husband’s supporters used when discussing him. I still don’t know that I would have said the above about him. But we were all able to evaluate Barack Obama on his own. We knew both halves of the couple (from a distance), and the American people had an independent relationship with each spouse.
That can’t be said about most other men in America. Most husbands are not public figures, nor are their wives. When one half of a couple takes to print and chides the other for personal failings, it’s like being asked to play back-up in a stranger’s marital squabble. One or both parties may be justified in their dissatisfaction with the status quo, but the public can’t judge fairly, because we typically hear only one side.
Nor should we necessarily hear both sides. These disagreements are inherently about private matters. The question is whether it’s appropriate to take a spouse to task publicly. The spouse doing the writing may find the experience cathartic and delight in the subsequent online affirmation, but does the silent spouse ever appreciate facing a digital mob?
Did Victoria Bissell Brown ’s “husband of 50 years” appreciate her “30 minutes of from-the-gut yelling” when she decided she “hate[d] all men and wish[ed] all men were dead” last October? Was it even better to relive when all of America read about it in The Washington Post ?
When Gemma Hartley wrote in Harper’s Bazaar about her husband’s messing up her Mother’s Day gift, because he cleaned their bathroom himself rather than hiring a maid service, she earned a book deal. But did her husband gain anything from the world’s hearing his wife’s exasperated internal monologue?
Now, I get it. The clean bathroom wasn’t really the gift in Hartley’s mind; she wanted her husband to vet and manage such a company’s visit (and is fortunate they can afford that). I also understand full well how unpleasant it can be to do housework. But let’s note that we’re not the first generation to notice that. Comedic actress Carol Channing had a whole spoken ode to sharing housework on “Free to Be You and Me” almost 50 years ago.
There is wisdom is dividing household chores, because it is largely a parade of drudgery. And in homes where wives do the lion’s share of these unglamorous but highly necessary tasks, sage husbands will appreciate and acknowledge that effort year-round, but perhaps especially this Mother’s Day weekend.
By contrast, there is no obvious wisdom in publicly shaming your husband. What does that win you at home? What does that do to your marriage?
One of the best bits of advice I ever read was in a parenting book: “What’s obvious to you is obvious to you.” In other words, ladies, if you’re unhappy with your situation, speak to your husband about it. He loves you and cares about your happiness. You’re more likely to resolve whatever’s troubling you if you’re clear about what you’d like to change. But please, for the sake of your marriage and any children, do it privately.

Why College Professors And Administrators Are A Greater Threat Than Crazy Students,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/college-professors-administrators-greater-threat-crazy-students/,"By Sumantra Maitra May 9, 2019
Tom Nichols writes in The Atlantic about how student totalitarianism is destroying campuses and higher education in the West. The idea is so obvious that it barely needs mentioning. The Western higher education system has been in a death spiral for at least a decade now, and it is only recently that non-conservative academic elites seem to have noticed.
What apparently broke the camel’s back was some activists’ attempt to replace University of the Arts professor Camille Paglia, a well-known genderqueer feminist, with a queer professor who is non-Caucasian. Nichols writes, “this is the kind of demand that sounds like it could have come out of China during the Cultural Revolution—if Maoists had been as obsessed with race and sexuality as they were with class.”
He blames it on student mobs, and writes that this “is not activism so much as it is preening would-be totalitarianism. If college is to become something more than a collection of trade schools on one end and a group of overpriced coffeehouses on the other, Americans have to think about how we got here and how to restore some sanity to the crucial enterprise of higher education.”
His suggestion to solve this is for faculty and administrators to “recognize a shameless dereliction of duty” and to “pull students back from the precipice of moral purity and work with them to acquire the skills and values that not only imbue tolerance, but provide for the rational discussion of opposing, and even hateful, views.”
I hesitate to accuse Nichols of being half right. I also teach at a university and therefore observe the rot from within. It is increasingly a fashion to harrumph against the students for everything. It gives older academics and public intellectuals a moral glow without them having to face the real and uncomfortable beast.
It is not the students who are the cause. It is a certain section of professors, academics, and departments that act as Soviet political commissars within campuses. Put simply, this all is an intra-academic war, where students are simply pawns in a greater power play.
Let’s test a simple hypothesis, shall we, as the “Death of Expertise” professor would surely agree to: How many of the recent publicized illiberal campus incidents were instigated organically by the students, and how many were instigated by academics? Consider the recent evidence.
The “decolonize” movements in Cambridge , Oxford , and Yale are led by ideologues posing as professors . Another group of university professors came together to cancel a play that was critical of intersectionality, identity politics, and Black Lives Matter, arguing that it was done for the emotional well-being of their students.
Likewise, an essay in Heritage by a Boise State University professor questioning gender studies was shut down by the university officials after an outcry that the article “represented the root of genocide.” In Cambridge, a decolonize movement was started by a group of activist students inspired by “support” from the Marxist, post-colonial academic Priyamvada Gopal, who was also the mastermind behind the plot to stop the colonial legacy project at Oxford .
The violent protests against Charles Murray at Middlebury College was fueled by academics who wrote open letters against inviting him. Most of these academics are of course, needless to mention, not from Murray’s field of studies, and therefore not qualified to judge his work.
In Berkeley, a section of academics wrote an open letter against Milo Yiannopoulis calling for no-platforming him. Twelve out of 13 academics who signed the original letter were from critical theory, gender studies, and post-modernist/Marxist backgrounds. At Yale University, a movement against teaching Shakespeare in English courses was spearheaded by postmodernist academics . Everyone of course remembers Melissa Click .
All this took me just an hour to Google. If someone pays me a grant to investigate, I am fairly certain I can find, behind every single case of student activism, the hands of activist professors.
The latest and ongoing travesty is the mobbing and firing of Dr. Noah Carl from Cambridge University, once again after an open letter by, well, academics. As Claire Lehmann, the editor of Quillette , wrote in an editorial about the incident, “To judge the quality of Dr Noah Carl’s work authoritatively, one would have to be an expert in at least one of the following fields: psychology, intelligence research (a sub-field of psychology), and/or economics. The campaign against him began with an ‘open letter’ that was signed by hundreds of academics, but they did not have expertise in these areas. (For the most part, they had qualifications in fields like anthropology, gender studies and critical race studies).”
She added, “The administrators at St Edmund’s College who determined that Dr Noah Carl should be fired did not have qualifications in these areas, either. The Master of St. Edmunds is a former banker, and the administrator who led the investigation that decided Dr Carl is guilty of ‘poor scholarship’ is a veterinary scientist.”
There’s a certain complacency among a section of intellectuals who still mentally live in the heady days of the early ‘90s. They appear to think that the biggest threat to the Western way of life is a couple of privileged middle-class brats wearing balaclavas and pretending to be Trotsky.
They are not. They are exactly what it looks like: middle-class brats who are so privileged that they seek cheap thrills and a purpose in life, while breaking glass windows of closed apparel shops and waving a rainbow flag with Che Guevara’s face on it, the irony completely lost on them.
They have never seen an actual street fight. Most of them have never even faced any actual physical hardship in any way comparable to what their forefathers faced, and are live-action role players of the worst kind, because they have also never faced a concerted kick back, from either their parents, or university faculties, or increasingly impotent law enforcement officials. At the first sign of real violent backlash, these kids will simply flock back to their parents’ basements.
No, the real threat is activist and academic departments, the children of the 1960s revolution who are now in charge, who have realized since the 1990s that the hope for an actual social revolution within the West lies through the long march through the Institutions . Churning out activist students to act as pawns and flooding media and academia with them is a much smarter way to change society from within.
But to accept this would require addressing the bigger, uncomfortable question: What to do with these activist departments that are openly trying to take over academia, and be the arbiters of morality and intellectual debates? It would require brutal policy answers, instead of empty harrumphing. These are answers that I suspect Nichols and his kind might not like to ponder. It’s much easier to blame a bunch of gullible students and feel mighty happy about it. Sumantra Maitra is a doctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham, UK, and a writer for The Federalist.

5 Things We Learned From Amy Klobuchar’s Town Hall On Fox,thefederalist.com,Kyle Sammin,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/5-things-learned-amy-klobuchars-town-hall-fox/,"By Kyle Sammin May 9, 2019
On Wednesday night, Amy Klobuchar became the second Democratic presidential candidate to appear in a Fox News Town hall event, following Bernie Sanders’s appearance last month .
Sanders has always marched to the beat of his own drummer, but Klobuchar’s appearance on the network marks the first break in the boycott by establishment Democrats. It’s a smart strategy for a candidate who has struggled to make her voice heard amid the growing horde of candidates for the Democratic nomination in 2020.
Here’s what we learned. 1. Heartland Amy
The senior senator from Minnesota, Klobuchar is a Midwesterner and her focus on that region came up again and again in the town hall. The event was in Milwaukee, so this tactic went over well with the Midwestern crowd, but it also addresses a problem Democrats have been puzzling over since 2016.
The vaunted “blue wall” of the Electoral College ran from New England to Pennsylvania and through the upper Midwest, plus the Pacific Coast. However attached the Democratic Party got to the neoliberal consensus the Clintons practiced, they thought they could never lose that blue wall.
They were trading on a legacy put in place by Franklin Roosevelt, in which they were the party of the worker, the miner, the famer. Indeed, the Minnesota branch of the Democratic Party still calls itself the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, a relic of the fusion politics of those days.
But FDR has not been on the ticket since 1944, and Donald Trump made a hash of the Democrats’ claim to be the workingman’s party—a claim that has had increasingly less evidence to support it over the past few decades. Hillary Clinton’s loss of Ohio, Michigan, and above all Wisconsin signaled how deep the Midwest’s disillusionment with national Democrats has gotten.
Klobuchar sees, rightly, that a Republican Party that gets the votes of the South, the Plains, and the Midwest is almost impossible to defeat. As a Midwesterner, one of the few in the race, she sees herself as the best spokesperson for the region.
How does that play out in policy terms? That’s where it gets a little fuzzy. She talks about prosperity being shared unequally, a common complaint of Trump voters. The idea that much of our economic success is being accumulated on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley is one that resounds with a lot of Americans. Klobuchar nodded at that sentiment, but offered nothing different from the Clinton campaign in actually addressing it. 2. Moderate or Progressive?
One audience question from a grad student and podcaster probed Klobuchar’s progressive bona fides. There are now nearly two dozen Democratic candidates, each leapfrogging the others for the title of Wokest of the Woke.
Klobuchar stands somewhat outside the pack. From a state that almost went for Trump in 2016, she has never had the political leeway to be a liberal firebrand, even if she were so inclined. Yet the Democratic primary electorate expects Full Socialism at all times.
Klobuchar tries to square the circle by calling herself “a proven progressive.” It’s quite similar to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 promise to be “a progressive president who gets results,” and for the same reasons.
Klobuchar is a realist. She knows that even with the supermajorities the Democrats had in the first two years of the Obama administration, not every socialist dream could come true. America, even when it swings left, has a conservative temperament. We don’t like utopian schemes.
As someone from a swing state, Klobuchar knows that. Most of the more openly progressive candidates know it, too; they’re just morally flexible enough to play along with the radical’s make-believe. 3. The Victim Game
Klobuchar does not like to play the victim game. An audience member asked if early coverage of her campaign was sexist, and she brushed aside the idea pretty quickly. That alone makes her stand out among politicians.
Taking offense, being the victim, and whining about life’s vicissitudes are the bread and butter of the modern pol, no less on the right than the left. It may have begun among the Democrats, but Republicans also now love to cry outrage whenever anyone slights them or treats them unfairly.
Klobuchar has no real need to appear tough—if anything, the rumors of her treatment of her office staff make her look too tough—but not indulging in self-pity over news coverage was a welcome change. 4. Bomb Iran
The only foreign policy question of the night involved the current movement of a carrier group to the Persian Gulf in response to Iranian nuclear provocations. World affairs have not been Klobuchar’s focus in the Senate, but she acquitted herself well. Her answer to Bret Baier’s question—what we she do about Iran if she were president right now—was Clintonian.
First saying that she never would have left the Iran Deal, as Trump did, she acknowledged that it had flaws, without specifying what those flaws were. She then said that Iran must never be allowed a nuclear weapon, mentioning the threat to global peace and to Israel specifically, a contrast with progressives’ increasing distaste for the Jewish state.
But she also said that war must be avoided. Her answer was more about style of foreign policy than substance, but style has a substance all its own. It was a decent, if vague, response to a question that has stymied many people before her. 5. Some Things Are Different On Fox
Fox is known as a conservative network, but the questions from the crowd contained their share of softballs. An audience member asked Klobuchar a question about the rights of women “pursuing reproductive health-care services” and how Klobuchar would increase access to such rights.
The questioner, whom the network identified as “student” but whom could also have been identified just as truthfully as “former intern to two Democratic Congresswomen,” elicited a response from Klobuchar along much the same lines, a lengthy dialogue on these mysterious services that never once called them by name.
Martha MacCallum’s follow-up question shattered the illusion, asking Klobuchar how she could endorse unlimited access to abortion when 80 percent of Americans think third-trimester abortions should be banned. Klobuchar handled it well: her answer was assuredly pro-abortion, but she did not get tripped up by having to actually name the thing she supports. She also dared to say what used to be common parlance in the Democratic Party: that we should reduce the number of abortions (although not by banning it or restricting it in any way.)
It’s a minor difference from the other networks, but an important one. On MSNBC or CNN, the audience plants, the anchors, and the candidate would all have been on the same page about social issues like abortion. Not only would Klobuchar have not been challenged on her position, she likely wouldn’t have even had to say the word.
For Democratic candidates from deep blue states, having to defend themselves on this and other hot-button issues is unknown. Their biggest fights are to win the Democratic nomination, with the general election being just a walkover.
Klobuchar has had to defend her views to the voters before, and seemed comfortable with the process. The other Democratic candidates would be wise to follow her over to Fox for an hour to sharpen their skills. If not, they might well get an unpleasant surprise in the general election.

Parents Who Lost A Child Need A Day Of Remembrance Like Mother’s And Father’s Day,thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/parents-lost-child-need-day-remembrance-like-mothers-fathers-day/,"By Helen Raleigh May 9, 2019
Mother’s Day is right around the corner, and the Father’s Day isn’t too far behind. These are great holidays for our society to celebrate parenthood, and for children to show their appreciation for their parents. Yet these holidays can be extremely difficult times for angel parents—parents who have lost their children.
Angel parents won’t be woken up by kisses planted on their faces by their children. They won’t receive a handmade card with big hearts and words like, “I love you, Mommy,” or “Happy Father’s Day, Daddy.” There won’t be a breakfast in bed and flowers delivered to the door. All the things parents with living children take for granted aren’t an option for these angel parents. These holidays serve as especially painful reminders to angel parents of the tremendous loss they endure.
One mom tells me that she wants to find a place to hide from the rest of the world on Mother’s Day. She doesn’t want to be triggered, nor does she want to feel like an unwelcome intrusion to a world in a celebratory mood. She finds acquaintances sometimes avoid her on these special occasions, too, probably because they don’t know what to say.
Since child loss affects many American parents, maybe we should have a special day for them—a national day for angel parents. Having such a day will help break the cultural stigma to talk about losing a child, increase societal understanding of grief and how to address it better, and maybe even help us strive to find ways to reduce certain type of losses. Help Break the Cultural Stigma
Parents lose children for a variety of reasons: pregnancy losses, infant deaths, traffic accidents, drug overdoses, suicides, and more. Such losses happen more often than most people realize. For example, 24,000 infants die in stillbirths in the United States every year. That is equivalent to a school bus full of babies lost every day. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that the United States lost 10,812 young people aged 15 to 19 in 2016. The top three leading causes of adolescent death are accidents, suicide, and homicide.
Whatever the cause of death, the loss of a child violates the natural order we understand—that we should be buried by our children, not the other way around. American culture is so obsessed with looking, feeling, and acting like a young person that the death of someone young is unthinkable.
We are generally uncomfortable talking about it or even going out of our way to avoid talking about it. We often don’t know what to say to parents who lost a child. Yet unwillingness to talk about it doesn’t make the loss disappear. Silence on this subject not only leaves many parents ill-prepared when such tragedy happens. It also leaves their support network struggling with how to help.
Most angel parents I speak to say they want to talk about the children they lost as long as anyone is willing to listen. Talking is healing and talking is one of the few options left for these parents to keep their children’s memories alive.
Having a national Angel Parents’ Day will help breakdown the social stigma surrounding talking about the death of a child. It’s a way for the rest of society to let angel parents know we recognize your loss. You are not alone, and we are here to listen. Our Society Can Get Better at Handling Grief
Our culture has a limited understanding of grief and has done a poor job of addressing it thus far. We live in a fast-paced internet age. Everyone has a short attention span.
For people who haven’t experienced the loss of a loved one yet, it’s easy to think losing a loved one is a momentary thing. After you lose someone, people around you may come to visit you, bring food and flowers, or send cards in the first weeks. They assume you will be sad for a while—maybe a few months or a few years. But sooner or later, you are expected to move on.
But there is no “moving on” from a loss, especially when you lose a child. Like all parents, angel parents had planned and envisioned a future with their child being the most important part of it. Now that their child is gone, such loss leaves a big hole in the parent’s future. Every day and every possible moment, the angel parent is walking into this new future, a broken one. How could they move on?
One angel dad who lost his infant daughter 20 years ago recently told me that he and his wife have been visiting his daughter’s grave on her birthday and putting up a special Christmas tree for her at home for 20 years. He expects they will continue doing these things to keep their daughter’s memory alive for as long as they live. When he uttered her daughter’s name to me, he broke down in tears. After 20 years, he’s learned to manage his pain, but the pain never goes away.
A short poem by W.S. Mervin describes how angel parents feel: “Your absence has gone through me like thread through a needle. Everything I do is stitched with its color.”
Having a national Angel Parents’ Day will give us a chance to better understand bereavement after loss. Knowing the pain of losing a child never goes away may enable us to become better family members, friends, or neighbors to those angel parents we know, love, and cherish.
For example, one of many angel parents’ biggest worries is that their children would be forgotten. So please make sure you ask an angel parent the birthday of their beloved child. Every year on that special day, contact the angel parent (can be as simple as a text message) and let him or her know you remember his or her angel and are thinking and praying for them. Something as simple as that could mean the world to an angel parent. Reduce Preventable Deaths
Having a national Angel Parents’ Day will raise the awareness of many different causes of losing children. With awareness, even though we won’t eliminate all causes, some causes of death are preventable or at least the number of deaths can be reduced.
One of the leading causes of infant deaths is stillbirth, but about a quarter of stillbirths are preventable . A study shows the stillbirth risk doubles when a pregnant woman sleeps on her back during the third trimester. Another study shows that monitoring a baby’s movement during pregnancy may help save babies from stillbirth too.
Many countries including Australia and the United Kingdom have public awareness campaigns to educate women about the right sleeping positions, and how to monitor their babies’ movement, which goes beyond counting kicks. While these countries have made tremendous progress in cutting their stillbirth rates, the stillbirth rate in the United States has budged very little.
The Star Legacy Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization focusing on stillbirth prevention, provides a free informational brochure on monitoring a baby’s movement during pregnancy. Anyone can either download it from its website or order copies for free. One thing we can do to reduce stillbirth in America is to spread the word so that every pregnant American woman has a copy of the brochure and learns about the danger of sleeping her back and the importance of monitoring her baby’s movement during their pregnancy. Such knowledge may prevent some stillbirths and save lives.
Losing a child is one of the most painful, life-changing experiences for many Americans. They have endured the pain in silence and searched for answers. Having a national Angel Parents’ Day would help break the cultural stigma, raise awareness, and hopefully identify some ways to reduce certain causes of child deaths so fewer families will have to suffer.

The 10 Tunes On This Playlist Will Make Your Mother’s Day Sing,thefederalist.com,Barry Lenser,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/10-songs-for-mothers-day-from-bruce-springsteen-to-dolly-parton/,"May 9, 2019 By Barry Lenser
When making a Mother’s Day mix, it can be tempting to prioritize sentiment over quality, as if any old song will suffice as long as it imparts the right feelings about mama. It doesn’t have to be that way.
Below you’ll find a playlist that combines conventional Mother’s Day tunes with others that might not tug at the heartstrings but are still germane to the topic. The selections range from uplifting to heavy, poignant to oblique. Most importantly, all are good-to-great songs, in my opinion.
Happy Mother’s Day! ‘Coat of Many Colors,’ Dolly Parton (1971)
Dolly Parton’s beloved “Coat of Many Colors” is one of those songs so irresistibly sweet and touching that it makes you want to hug the next person you see, call your parents to apologize for anything and everything, and say a prayer of thanksgiving for life’s countless blessings. We the people can’t agree on much these days, but at least we can agree on Dolly. ‘Sylvia’s Mother,’ Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show (1971)
Written by Shel Silverstein, “Sylvia’s Mother” is a solid brick of weepy, over-the-top, melodramatic cheese, but I defy you not to feel something when the song’s booming chorus hits your ears. “Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her!” sings that impenetrable wall of voices. Sometimes schmaltz can simply overwhelm you into happy submission. ‘Mama Couldn’t Be Persuaded,’ Warren Zevon (1976)
If you’re familiar with Warren Zevon’s family background (especially as recounted in the bruising oral history “I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead” ), you know it probably would’ve been best had “mama” not married “that gamblin’ man.” But then Zevon never would’ve existed and we wouldn’t have this funny, spirited, and absurdly catchy little rock tune to enjoy again and again. ‘Mother,’ Pink Floyd (1979)
“Mother” hopefully does not resonate with you on a personal level. Hopefully, your mom didn’t wrap you in zealous overprotection or promise that she would “always find out where you’ve been.” Almost every one of David Gilmour’s lines here as “mother” to Roger Waters’ “Pink” character is unsettling. His soaring guitar solo, on the other hand, is pure catharsis. ‘Night Comes On,’ Leonard Cohen (1984)
Nothing says, “Let’s celebrate moms!” like a mystical and meditative Leonard Cohen song, right? Joking aside, “Night Comes On” provides a welcome contrast to “Mother,” as it features a maternal figure who, from beyond the grave, encourages her son to “go back to the world” rather than heed the call of isolation (or worse). In Cohen’s own words , “the mother represents an authentic sense of protection, the life that strengthens.” ‘Promise to Try,’ Madonna (1989)
“Promise to Try” is a reminder that even someone as iconic and world-conquering as Madonna is still just flesh and blood. On this lovely ballad, the Queen of Pop goes to a very vulnerable place as she confronts the anguish of losing her mother to cancer more than two decades prior.
It’s a moving song, due in part to the vocal performance. All of the pomp and circumstance that often surrounds Madonna can easily distract from what a marvelous singer she is. ‘Lemon,’ U2 (1993)
On the one hand, “Lemon” is a gleaming disco ball of a song with odd detours and a louche falsetto from Bono. On the other, it’s a deeply personal reflection on “memory and loss.”
When Bono sings, “She wore lemon,” he’s referring to a Super 8 video of his mother dancing at a wedding while wearing a yellow dress. She’s right there in front of him but permanently beyond his reach (she died in the ‘70s).
Herein lies the brilliance of U2’s large-scale reinvention in the ‘90s: the trappings were thrillingly different, even ironic, but the emotions were still straight from the heart. ‘For Martha,’ The Smashing Pumpkins (1998)
It’s not at all surprising that Billy Corgan would make an epic rock song out of a eulogy for his mother. “For Martha” starts off small, intimate, and piano-based, before swelling and later blasting sky-high on the back of a big, buzzing guitar solo.
By the time the song’s eight-plus minutes are through, it feels like real healing has occurred. Say what you want about Corgan, but the guy can vividly convey emotion both as a singer and a guitarist. ‘The Wish,’ Bruce Springsteen (1998)
How many songs by “the Boss” can accurately be described as “adorable”? “The Wish” qualifies resoundingly. In fact, it’s one of the most heartwarming “mom tributes” in pop music history (on top of being just a fantastic song).
Among several moments I could highlight, the best is when Bruce says that, instead of flowers, a phone call, or any other predictable gesture of affection, he’s going to find “a little rock ‘n’ roll bar” and take his mom out dancing . It’s almost too precious for words. ‘Hey Mama,’ Kanye West (2005)
“Hey Mama” is the old Kanye in all of his joyous, soulful, resplendent glory. Just watch when he debuted the song on “Oprah” with Donda, his mother, in attendance. Or watch when he sang it as a duet with her in this home video . The song and the performances overflow with deeply-felt affection and sincerity.
It’s obvious that Donda was Kanye’s foundation. When she passed away in 2007, it was a shattering experience for him. Some even point to it as the event that eventually spawned the new Kanye, the one who is a frequent target these days of online haters and cancel-culture commissars.
But let’s set aside all the controversy for a moment and focus on the best aspect of 2019 Ye: he’s a devout husband and a doting father of three (going on four). I have to think his mother would be exceedingly proud. Barry Lenser lives and works in the Upper Midwest. He loves the Lord, his family, and the Packers."
Paper: Professor Bias May Deflate Conservative College Students’ Grades,thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/working-paper-professor-bias-may-deflate-conservative-college-students-grades/,"By Joy Pullmann May 9, 2019
Conservative students enter college with higher SAT scores and GPAs than liberal students, but by the fourth year of college have lower GPAs than liberal peers, which may be a consequence of institutional bias, finds a new working paper from the University of Arkansas.
Self-identified conservative students saw the biggest grade dip when studying in the humanities and social sciences, none when studying in professional fields, and an extra grade advantage when studying in hard-science fields. The bias was more pronounced at higher-ranked colleges and universities.
“Notwithstanding the GPA advantages held by conservative students in high school, students who support banning racist/sexist speech, and who endorse dissent as critical to the political process (positions typically associated with liberalism) enjoy a relative advantage over their peers,” the paper finds.
The authors controlled for students’ family income, SAT scores, and demographics, and repeatedly caution that the GPA effect is comparatively small, although statistically significant, and may have explanations other than professor bias. For example, since other social science has found conservatives tend to follow rules better and score lower on spontaneity and creativity, perhaps those characteristics make them a poorer fit for college or humanities programs.
Statistical analysis on a large database often used by researchers shows that “by the fourth year of college, liberal students tend to have higher grades than conservative peers: ideological self-placement is the only variable in the model changing direction from high school to college ” (emphasis original), write paper authors Matthew Woessner of Penn State, Robert Maranto of U-Arkansas, and Amanda Thompson of the University of Georgia. The working paper from U-Arkansas’s Department of Education Reform has not yet been peer-reviewed nor published in an academic journal, but has been released to generate academic input pre-publication, it states.
The paper includes the graph below, showing that conservative students have the highest overall grades in high school, although lower writing and verbal SAT scores than liberal students. This also could reflect conservatives’ higher compliance levels, political biases in the verbal (less objective) portions of tests, neither, or both. Other research has found that high schools highly value compliance and that K-12 teachers award higher grades to more agreeable students and students more similar to them , which lowers boy’s grades compared to girls.
“Rather than political bias, conservatives might earn lower grades if colleges play to the strengths of liberal students,” the paper says. “Prior work shows that liberals more deeply value independence and the creation of original works, while conservatives more deeply value family life, community, and loyalty (Kelly-Woessner and Woessner 2009; Haidt 2012). In short, one could interpret findings here as suggesting that as institutions, high schools fit the strengths of conservatives while colleges fit the strengths of liberals.”
Or perhaps college culture tends to be anti-conservative. The paper notes later that, in the authors’ field experience, students from rich, secular, liberal families adapted better to campus life than did students from conservative, middle-class homes. It suggests that’s because “students from conservative or religious household might face difficulties in the transition to college, losing the structure and community they enjoyed in high school.”
But it also could be that campus cultures can be actively hostile to family, faith, community, and a well-ordered life. A further indication of this comes later, when the paper discusses how students who support same-sex marriage “tend to feel more valued, and believe that faculty see their potential, show concern, and take an interest in their success” when rating their college experience. Students on the opposite side of the issue tend to say the opposite. This, the paper suggests, “opens the possibility that directly or indirectly, opposition to same sex-marriage contributes to alienation among some students.”
If this is just one indicator of the well-known reality that campuses have a culturally leftist bent, it’s no wonder that conservatives would feel less comfortable and have more difficulty adapting. Since conservatives tend to have better self-organization and perform better in the academically more difficult science fields, perhaps a politically leftist culture is a major hindrance to their adjustment to college life.
If we saw these difficulties among liberal students or minorities, we’d no doubt see op-eds in major newspapers and websites about how campus climates are “chilly” and “hostile” to such young people. Don’t expect that to happen when the difficulties apply more to conservative kids.
While all kids’ GPAs dropped in college compared to high school, the conservative students’ grades dropped more than the liberal students’ did. Other research has found that high school GPAs are the best predictor of college achievement , even better than SAT and ACT scores. Conservative students’ high GPAs also dropped more dramatically for some measures of political conservatism than others, as the graph below from the paper shows.
“[H]olding all else constant, the most liberal student would enjoy a 0.16 point advantage over the most conservative student on a 7 point scale. Given our large sample size [of more than 7,000 students], this difference is statistically significant,” says the paper.
Students’ views on abortion had the strongest relationship with conservatives’ high school to college grade drop, partly because pro-life students had the highest average high school GPAs. At medium to low-prestige higher education institutions, pro-life students’ academic achievement actually increased, but at high-prestige schools their advantage was erased. The reverse happened with students who opposed free speech: they saw higher grades in college than their high school performance would have projected.
“Whereas the advantage enjoyed by pro-life students declines, the advantage of those who would ban racist/sexist speech or who value dissent grows,” the paper notes.
Another factor here is that while college professors massively more leftist than the general American population, K-12 teachers are also significantly farther left than most Americans. Fifty percent of K-12 teachers voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, compared to 29 percent voting for Donald Trump. Forty-one percent of teachers identify as Democrats, and only 27 percent as Republicans, according to a 2017 poll by the trade publication Education Week. That’s a 12-point higher percentage of Democrats among K-12 teachers than among the general American public.
By comparison, a recent study found that high-ranked liberal arts colleges employ ten self-described Democrat professors for every one Republican. So if bias unfairly deflates conservative students’ achievements in college, it probably has an effect in high school, also, especially since these biased colleges train K-12 teachers. Bias just may not affect K-12 students as much as it does college students.
This may be one reason that public schools are the top choice for only one-third of American parents , even though eight in ten of those same parents have their kids enrolled in public schools. A recent poll in Wisconsin found that two-thirds of Republican voters are worried about politics in their kids’ public schools, and it’s certain they’re not alone. The question is: Are conservative parents and GOP politicians going to do anything serious about a system stacked against their kids?

"Impeach Trump Or Go Home, Democrats",thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/impeach-trump-home-democrats/,"By David Harsanyi May 9, 2019
When House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed that the United States had been plunged into a “constitutional crisis” this week, a large swath of the media took to plying this fantasy for them.
“Ever wonder what a constitutional crisis looks like? Well, open your eyes,” CNN’s Don Lemon explained to his viewers. “The president of the United States is just blowing right through our system of checks and balances, the very thing that is supposed to keep our Congress, the judiciary, and the executive branch working, which means our country working. He is engaging in an ongoing cover-up by defying at every turn the representatives of you, the American people, the very people who are supposed to be investigating fact-finding on our behalf.”
None of this is remotely true. Our checks and balances are working exactly as they should. Congress is free to make perpetual demands for information and testimony, and threaten the White House with contempt charges and impeachment when it doesn’t get its way. The White House, in turn, is free to assert executive privilege and decline to hand over that information or give testimony.
Both the legislature and the executive branches have the option of asking the judiciary to weigh in on the matter. It’s not as if Donald Trump is blatantly ignoring the courts , as his predecessor often did. If voters disagree, they have the option of punishing elected officials by voting against them. If the legislature disagrees, it has an even more forceful solution available, and that’s impeachment.
History didn’t begin in 2016. Every modern president has asserted executive privilege. Attorneys general have been cited for contempt on much firmer grounds . Former attorney general Janet Reno was found in contempt in 1998 for refusing to turn over memos about Bill Clinton’s campaign finances.
In 2012, Eric Holder became the first U.S. attorney general in history to be held in both criminal and civil contempt after refusing to hand over memos detailing his knowledge about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’s disastrous and bloody gunrunning scheme. Nadler knows this, because he joined a Democratic Party walkout protesting the Holder vote.
Yet no Obama administration official was arrested . There were no impeachments. TV anchors didn’t unsheathe melodramatic monologues about the corrosion of law and the end of democracy.
Moreover, contra Lemon, there’s no cover-up . After accurately describing the bottom line of the Mueller report, Barr released it, and now every American can read the results of a two-year, open-ended, independent investigation that, despite its best efforts, eviscerated the panic-stricken Russia collusion conspiracies of the left and political media.
The attorney general, in fact, has given Democrats access to all but two full and seven partial lines of Volume II (the op-ed section of the report)—or, as the Department of Justice put it , more than 98 percent of the entire 448-page report. Not one Democrat as of this writing thought it important enough to review the minimally redacted version of the report. It’s one of the surest signs that this is all political spectacle.
For two-plus years, Democrats and their allies took advantage of a cooked-up conspiracy theory, and used the subsequent investigation as cover to disparage their opponents as traitors and spineless enablers—not only crowding out useful debate of the Trump presidency but fueling an emotionalist argument that confuses “attacks on democracy” with “not getting my way.” Now, they’ve merely transferred those hysterics to another manufactured drama.
The same people who never met a constitutional amendment they didn’t want to weaken or destroy will now act as if a middling procedural showdown is the next Watergate. Mainstream media stories about Nadler’s fishing expeditions have already framed Democrats as stewards of law and order, forced into impeachment by inflexible Republicans.
It will never be enough. If Trump is a criminal who flirts with treason and threatens the very existence of the Constitution, don’t Democrats have a duty to impeach the president? When Lemon asked Nadler about this, the congressman answered, “[i]t may come to that if the president keeps up with this conduct, but we’ll see.” Why wait?
The intelligence committee’s Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California) has maintained for years that he has incontrovertible evidence of the administration colluding with Russia. Pelosi has claimed on numerous occasions that Trump engaged in criminal behavior. It’s so bad, she recently argued , that the president is “self-impeachable,” whatever that means.
It’s one thing for Congress to run forever investigations, which have become the norm in Washington. It’s another to spend two years—and possibly six, if Trump wins in 2020—using congressional power to create bogus “constitutional crises” that continue to corrode genuine checks and balances.
It’s difficult to believe anyone really thinks impeachment is a good idea after an independent investigation blew up the Russiagate conspiracy. But Democrats run the House. They have the votes to get it done. According to their own rhetoric, they have duty to impeach no matter what the Senate does. An impeachment proceeding that compels Democrats to lay out their case would be far preferable to this show trial—what the Wall Street Journal editorial page dubbed “The Pseudo-Impeachment.” Let’s do it already."
Did Robert Mueller Tap Fusion GPS And Christopher Steele To Assist His Anti-Trump Investigation?,thefederalist.com,Paul Sperry,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/robert-mueller-tap-fusion-gps-christopher-steele-assist-anti-trump-investigation/,"By Paul Sperry May 9, 2019
Special Counsel Robert Mueller spent more than $732,000 on outside contractors, including private investigators and researchers, records show, but his office refuses to say who they were. While it’s not unusual for special government offices to outsource for services such as computer support, Mueller also hired contractors to compile “investigative reports” and other “information.”
The arrangement has led congressional investigators, government watchdog groups and others to speculate that the private investigators and researchers who worked for the special counsel’s office might have included Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, the private research firm that hired Steele to produce the Russia collusion dossier for the Clinton campaign.
They suspect the dossier creators may have been involved in Mueller’s operation, and even had a hand in his final report, because the special counsel sent his team to London to meet with Steele within a few months of taking over the Russia collusion investigation in 2017. Also, Mueller’s lead prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, had shared information he received from Fusion with the media.
Raising additional suspicions, Mueller’s report recycles the general allegations leveled in the dossier. And taking a page from earlier surveillance-warrant applications in the Russia investigation, it cites as supporting evidence several articles—including one by Yahoo! News—that used Steele and Fusion as sources.
Mueller even kept alive one of the dossier’s most obscene accusations—that Moscow had “compromising tapes” of Trump with Russian hookers—by slipping into a footnote an October 2016 text Trump lawyer Michael Cohen received from a “Russian businessman,” who cryptically intimated, “Stopped flow of tapes from Russia.”
Lawyers for the businessman, Giorgi Rtskhiladze (who is actually a Georgian American), are demanding a retraction of the footnote, arguing Mueller omitted the part of his text where he said he did not believe the rumor about the tapes, for which no evidence has ever surfaced.
Mueller’s reliance on the Steele dossier is raising questions because it occurred long after FBI Director James B. Comey described the dossier as “salacious and unverified.” U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the report should be renamed “The Mueller Dossier,” because he says it contains a lot of similar innuendo.
Even though Mueller failed to corroborate key allegations leveled in the dossier, Nunes said his report twists key facts to put a collusion gloss on events. He also asserted that it selectively quotes from Trump campaign emails and omits exculpatory information in ways that cast the campaign’s activities in the most sinister light.
Steele’s 17-memo dossier alleged that the Trump campaign was involved in “a well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” with the Russian government to rig the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor. It claimed this conspiracy “was managed on the Trump side by Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, who was using foreign policy adviser Carter Page and others as intermediaries.”
Specifically, the dossier accused Page of secretly meeting with Kremlin officials in July 2016 to hatch a plot to release dirt on Hillary Clinton. And it accused Manafort of being corrupted by Russian President Vladimir Putin through his puppets in the Ukraine.
Likewise, Mueller’s report focuses on Manafort and Page and whether they “committed crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.” Though the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government, the Mueller report implies there may be a kernel of truth to the dossier’s charges.
“In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School,” according to the section on him. “Page had lived and worked in Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia.”
“Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention,” Mueller’s narrative continued. “July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU [Russian intelligence] from the DNC.” “Page acknowledged that he understood that the individuals he has associated with were members of the Russian intelligence services,” the report added, implying that Page in the 2015 case (referenced above) knowingly cavorted with Russian spies, which echoes charges Steele made in his dossier.
But federal court records make it clear that Page did not know that those men were Russian agents. Mueller also left out of his report a detail RealClearInvestigations has previously reported: that Page was a cooperating witness in the case in question, helping the FBI eventually put a Russian agent behind bars in 2016.
Nor did Mueller see fit to include in his report another exculpatory detail revealed in agent Gregory Mohaghan’s complaint and reported earlier by RCI—namely, that the Russians privately referred to Page as “an idiot” who was unworthy of recruitment. Excluding such details is curious, given that the Mueller report quotes from the same FBI complaint and cites it in its footnotes. Similarly, in its section dealing with Manafort, the Mueller report echoes the dossier’s claims that the Trump campaign chairman was in cahoots with the Kremlin, even though Mueller never charged him with conspiring to collude with Russia
The special prosecutor’s report indicated that one of Manafort’s Kremlin handlers was Konstantin Kilimnik. “Manafort briefed Kilimnik on the state of the Trump Campaign and Manafort’s plan to win the election,” it said. “That briefing encompassed the Campaign’s messaging and its internal polling data. It also included discussion of ‘battleground’ states, which Manafort identified as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Minnesota.”
Except that this wouldn’t have been an unusual conversation: Kilimnik was a longtime Manafort employee who ran the Ukraine office of his lobbying firm. Footnotes in Mueller’s report show that Manafort shared campaign information to impress a former business partner, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who was suing him over financial losses. Mueller failed to tie the information exchange to Russian espionage. He also failed to mention that Deripaska is an FBI informant.
Mueller’s team worked closely with dossier author Steele, a long-retired British intelligence officer who worked for the Clinton campaign. Mueller’s investigators went to London to consult with Steele for at least two days in September 2017 while apparently using his dossier as an investigative road map and central theory to his collusion case. Steele now runs a private research and consulting firm in London, Orbis Business Intelligence.
It’s not clear if Mueller’s office paid Steele, but recently released FBI records show the bureau previously made a number of payments to him, and at one point during the 2016 campaign offered him $50,000 to continue his dossier research. Steele was also paid through the Clinton campaign, earning $168,000 for his work on the dossier.
Expenditure statements show that the Special Counsel’s Office outsourced “investigative reports” and “information” to third-party contractors during Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian “collusion” during the 2016 presidential election. Over the past few months, Mueller’s office has rejected several formal requests from RealClearInvestigations for contract details, including who was hired and how much they were paid.
Washington-based Judicial Watch suspects Mueller’s office may have farmed out work to the private Washington research firm Fusion GPS or its subcontractor Steele, both of whom were paid by the Clinton camp during the 2016 presidential election. Several law enforcement and Hill sources who spoke with RCI also believe Steele and Fusion GPS were deputized in the investigation.
The government watchdog group has requested that the Justice Department turn over the contracting records, along with all budget requests Mueller submitted to the attorney general during his nearly two-year investigation. It’s also requested all communications between the Special Counsel’s Office and the private contractors it used. A Judicial Watch spokesman said its Freedom of Information Act request is pending.
Special counsel spokesman Peter Carr declined comment when asked specifically if Mueller’s team hired or collaborated with Fusion GPS or any of its subcontractors. Mueller took over the FBI’s Russia probe in May 2017, whereupon he hired many of the agents who handled Steele and pored over his dossier.
For the first reporting period ending Sept. 30, 2017, and covering just four months, the Special Counsel’s Office reported paying $867 to unnamed contractors for “investigative reports/information,” along with $3,554 in “miscellaneous” payments to contractors. In the next reporting period ending March 31, 2018, the office stopped breaking out investigative reports and information as a separate line item, lumping such contractual services under the category “Other,” which accounted for a total of $10,812, or more than 4% of the total spending on outside contracts.
For the six months ending Sept. 30, 2018—the latest reporting period for which there is data—Mueller’s office showed a total of $310,732 in payments to outside contractors. For the first time, it did not break out such expenses into subcategories, though it noted that the lion’s share of the $310,000 was spent on “IT services.”
Mueller concluded his investigation and delivered his final report in March. The next expenditure report, for the period October 2018-March 2019, will cover contract work directly tied to compiling the report. Asked if the contracting details were classified, Carr demurred. If the information is not deemed classified, it must be made public, Judicial Watch maintains.
Republican critics on the Hill say Mueller’s written narrative was slanted to give the impression there still might be something to the dossier’s most salacious allegations, even though Mueller found no evidence corroborating them or establishing that Trump or his campaign coordinated or cooperated with Russian meddling in the election.
“Whoever wrote the report leaves you with the idea there’s still something to all the allegations of collusion that were first promoted by the dossier,” said a witness who was interviewed by Mueller’s investigators late in the probe and is referenced in the report.
In a section on Donald Trump Jr., moreover, the report gives the misimpression that the president’s oldest son was collaborating with WikiLeaks on the release of the Clinton campaign emails. “Donald Trump Jr. had direct electronic communications with WikiLeaks during the campaign period,” it stated.
In fact, Trump got an unsolicited message through his Twitter account from WikiLeaks. He described the outreach as “weird” in an email to senior Trump campaign staff at the time. Other contemporaneous messages make it clear he had no advance knowledge about any Clinton emails released by WikiLeaks.
The FBI first began receiving memos from Steele’s dossier in early July 2016 and used the documents as the foundation for its October 2016 application for a warrant to wiretap the private communications of Page. These milestones are missing from the Mueller report’s chronology of events. In fact, neither Steele nor his dossier is mentioned by name anywhere in the first half of the report dealing with collusion, though their allegations are hashed out.
Some Mueller critics are focused on the role played by his top prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton supporter with longstanding ties to Steele and Fusion GPS.
“Weissman had a lot to do with the way the report was written,” said author Jerome Corsi, who, as a friend of Trump confidant Roger Stone, was targeted by Mueller. “That’s why it’s basically a political document.” Corsi said he spent more than 40 hours with Mueller’s prosecutors and investigators, who grilled him about possible ties to WikiLeaks but never charged him with a crime.
Formerly a top Justice Department official under Obama, Weissmann not only donated to Clinton’s presidential campaign but also attended her election-night party in New York City in November 2016. Three months earlier, he was briefed on Steele’s dossier and other dirt provided by the Clinton contractor and paid FBI informant.
In early 2017, Weissmann helped advance the Russia collusion narrative by personally sharing Steele’s and Fusion’s dirt on Trump and his advisers with Washington reporters. In an April 2017 meeting he arranged at his office, Weissmann gave guidance to four Associated Press reporters who were investigating Manafort, according to internal FBI documents.
Among other things, they discussed rumors that Manafort used “some of the money from shell companies to buy expensive suits.” A month later, Weissmann became the lead prosecutor handling the Manafort case for Mueller. His February 2018 indictment of Manafort highlights, among other things, the Trump adviser’s taste for expensive suits. Attempts to reach Weissmann for comment were unsuccessful.
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said there are signs Mueller may have hired “researchers” like Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, who worked with Steele on the dossier, along with Edward Baumgartner and Nellie Ohr, who have worked for Fusion GPS, which originally hired Steele in June 2016 after contracting with the Clinton campaign.
“I ran into Glenn at the 2017 Aspen Security [Forum], and I distinctly remember him leaning in and claiming he was working for the government,” said one associate, who wished to remain anonymous. Congressional investigators say Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, has been feeding Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate investigative tips regarding Trump and his associates, including Manafort. In 2017, for instance, he urged Democrats specifically to look into the bank records of Deutsche Bank, which has financed some of Trump’s businesses, because he suspected some of the funding may have been laundered through Russia.
Around the time Simpson began coordinating with Democratic investigators looking into Trump’s bank records, Mueller subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for financial records for Manafort and other individuals affiliated with Trump. Simpson did not return calls and emails seeking comment.
Founded by the journalist-turned-opposition researcher, Fusion has rehired Steele to continue his anti-Trump work with millions of dollars in left-wing funding from The Democracy Integrity Project, a Washington-based nonprofit started in 2017 by former FBI analyst Daniel Jones, who also worked for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
In March 2017, Jones met with FBI agents to provide them data he collected from IT specialists he hired to analyze web traffic between servers maintained by the Trump Organization and a Russian bank mentioned in the dossier. The traffic turned out to be innocuous marketing emails, or spam.

"No One Likes You, Eric Swalwell ~ Full Magazine",thefederalist.com,,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/no-one-likes-you-eric-swalwell/,"May 9, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
When 2018 midterm voters were polled on the issues most important to them, the Russia investigation ranked dead last. That might explain why Democratic presidential candidate Eric Swalwell, who has branded himself as the “Guns and Russia” candidate, is polling at 0 percent among all 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
In fact, a majority of polls don’t even include Swalwell in the top 17 candidates. In an April CNN poll, 66 percent of respondents had never heard of him. Despite the dismal numbers, Swalwell has clung to his two favorite issues.
The 38-year-old often leverages his position on the House Intelligence Committee to make frequent cable news appearances discussing Russia and the Mueller report. On CBS’s “Face The Nation” this Sunday, Swalwell said impeachment “may be the only road to save the country.” On Wednesday, the Democratic congressman from California was widely mocked after comparing the Mueller report to the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and Pearl Harbor on Twitter. Remember that time Pearl Harbor was bombed and FDR called the Emperor of Japan? Or the time the Twin Towers were struck and Bush ringed Osama Bin Laden? No? I don’t either. So why’d @realDonaldTrump call Putin after the Mueller Report was released? #CommanderInCheat
— Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) May 8, 2019
But his real passion issue remains gun-grabbing. In a San Francisco Chronicle essay laying out his reasons for running for president, Swalwell’s number-one reason was that the single greatest threat to young Americans’ lives is gun violence. At a time in which child mortality rates have dropped by half over the last two decades, this claim is just categorically untrue.
At a Wednesday night vigil for a student who died in a Colorado school shooting, angry students stormed out after politicians speaking at the event began calling for gun control instead of honoring their late classmate. One student told The Daily Wire they were angry when the event became “highly politicized.”
Nevertheless, Swalwell continues to pen op-eds calling for $15 million gun buybacks, banning “military-style semiautomatic assault weapons,” and jailing people who resist giving up their weapons. At the height of his passion, he has even threatened to nuke his own gun-owning constituents should they not surrender their firearms to the government. And it would be a short war my friend. The government has nukes. Too many of them. But they’re legit. I’m sure if we talked we could find common ground to protect our families and communities.
— Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) November 16, 2018
Even if Swalwell were to adjust his unpopular campaign platform, as a straight, white, cisgender, male, his intersectionality score is working against him in the diverse Democratic field. His solution? Not to step aside and make room for a woman president, but to vow to select a woman as his vice president. SPOILER ALERT: I'm a white man.
I know where I can't speak to someone else's experience and I pledge to:1️⃣ Pass the mic

Perhaps the biggest hurdle Swalwell’s campaign faces is not what he is — a white man who hates guns and Russia — but what he isn’t. Swalwell is not a business owner, a veteran, a community organizer, or anything remotely interesting. He is essentially a professional politician who smoothly transitioned from college frat boy interning on Capitol Hill to running for city council and eventually the U.S. House of Representatives.
In an attempt to find something interesting about his background, a campaign video exhausts the fact that his parents are both Republicans. After his official candidacy announcement, Swalwell was widely mocked for his bland slogan, “Let’s go big, be bold, and do good!” Even Democratic strategist Donna Brazile noted his milquetoast presence.

"No, Shakespeare Was Not A Jewish Woman, He Was Just A Genius",thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/no-shakespeare-not-jewish-woman-just-genius/,"By David Marcus May 13, 2019
I take a very dim view of conspiracy theories alleging that William Shakespeare didn’t write his own plays. I have been reading and studying the Bard for nearly 30 years, and I have yet to find compelling evidence that he isn’t exactly who we think he is.
Historically, this idea has been based in the notion that nobody of such base birth as Shakespeare could have been erudite enough to pen the most insightful English ever written. I’ve never found this to be a compelling argument. This week, there is a new and novel one.
In an article for The Atlantic, Elizabeth Winkler argues that a Jewish woman might have written Shakespeare’s plays. It’s not really much more crazy-sounding than most of the conspiracy theories, but it is much more of the current moment. In fact, I give Winkler credit for wondering if she is gendering Elizabeth England in modern terms. It seems clear that she is. The woman Winkler believes could have written Shakespeare’s plays is a well-known figure of the time.
Emilia Bassono was a woman about town in Elizabethan London: smart, well-educated, and possibly of Jewish descent. Some Shakespeare scholars believe she is the mysterious dark-haired woman mentioned in the sonnets. It is attractive by contemporary feminist standards to believe that maybe she was the genius behind the work we call Shakespeare’s. Although it leaves me unconvinced of its major thesis, the article is well worth reading, and whether she wrote or collaborated with Shakespeare or not, Bassono is a fascinating person.
One question Winkler brings up is worth exploring a bit: How did Shakespeare write women characters so effectively and honestly at a time when this was exceedingly rare? In today’s intersectional age, it’s easy to see why some would jump to the conclusion that a woman must have written these parts, but there is a simpler explanation. Shakespeare wrote better women characters than his contemporaries because he wrote better characters of every kind than did his contemporaries. Women, kings, soldiers, Jews, Moors, fairies, and a fountain of other characters flowed from his pen, all revealing a new style and substance in English writing.
How did Shakespeare do this? How was he able to create all of these characters with humor and speech so much more naturalistic than came from the other writers of the time? As is usually the case with the Bard, the clues are in the plays themselves. In their 1913 book, “The Facts About Shakespeare,” William Allen Neilson and Ashley Horace Thorndike provide a very useful chart regarding the use of meter and rhyme in the plays. This chart reveals a sea change in how Shakespeare considered and used language throughout his career.
“Love’s Labour’s Lost,” one of Shakespeare’s early comedies, contains 2,789 total lines, of which 1,028 are pentameter rhymes — that is to generally say, lines with ten syllables and five strong stresses that rhyme. By the end of his career, in “The Tempest,” there are 2,068 lines, of which a mere two are pentameter rhymes. In “The Winters Tale,” also written late in his career, there are no pentameter rhymes.
What Shakespeare did throughout his career was move away from the strict use of meter that had dominated the world of Middle English plays. In doing so, he created characters that sounded far more like actual human beings.
There were good reasons for the use of iambic pentameter and rhyme, not the least of which was helping actors to memorize their lines, just as we use metered rhymes to remember things. But to write in such a way, an author must sacrifice what he thinks a character might actually say in order to fit the small confines allowed by the prose style. As in the great ancient epic poems, this leads to characters that feel more like archetypes than like actual people.
But how do we know that Shakespeare’s move away from meter and rhyme was an effort to achieve greater naturalism? Well, he basically tells us so. In the speech to the players in “Hamlet” when the Danish prince is training his actors for the play within the play, he insists that the purpose of theater is to “Hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature.” He chides the going style of the day, where actors “saw the air” and overplay their parts. “Hamlet,” and by extension Shakespeare, was not written with that style in mind, but rather with a goal of appearing natural, real, and true.
So it should be no surprise that Shakespeare is the first to write women who sound like women, because he was the first to write people who sound like people. Ultimately this is the source of all the conspiracies, the centuries’-old mystery, and the fervent belief among some that the plays of Shakespeare were not written by Shakespeare. In retrospect, what he achieved seems almost impossible, too revolutionary to be real or the work of just one man of humble origin.
Here we must remember that although the best and most compelling evidence shows us that Shakespeare was the “author” of his plays, theater is a collaborative art form. Not only could interactions with actors help form the plays, so could conversations with writers and poets in London’s small literary circles, including Bassano. The reason that playwright is not spelled playwrite is that plays are not written; they are wrought. They are beaten out, shaped and hammered, not to exist merely in the mind of a reader, but to appear in full physical form on the stage.
In the 19th century, for some Englishman the idea that someone of low class and little formal education could have written so elegantly offended their sensibilities. Likewise for some 21st-century feminists the idea that Shakespeare could have so beautifully captured the soul and speech of women does not jibe with their belief that identity, whether it’s sex, race, or myriad others, makes us impenetrable to each other, and unable to express what lies in another’s heart.
Accusations throughout the centuries that Shakespeare did not write his plays have typically tended to tell us more about the accuser than about the identity of the playwright. Every age has its own set of biases that seek to explain the improbable nature of Shakespeare’s genius.
It is compelling to wonder at and question the authorship. It makes us feel like characters in a mysterious Umberto Eco novel, always on the verge of some great historical discovery that will change how we think about everything.
But really, it was Shakespeare himself who changed how we think about everything. It is why he still captures and confounds our imaginations. It is why he is a person that we can never quite completely fathom.

Kamala Harris: Make Americans Pay For Illegal Immigrants’ Health Care,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/kamala-harris-take-away-americans-health-insurance-make-pay-illegal-immigrants-health-care/,"By Christopher Jacobs May 13, 2019
Back in January, jaws dropped when presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) admitted at a CNN town hall that she wanted to take away the existing health arrangements of hundreds of millions of Americans. Now we know one reason why.
In another interview with CNN that aired Sunday, Harris admitted that she wants to provide taxpayer-funded health care, along with education and other benefits, to individuals unlawfully present in this country. But as even Hillary Clinton recognized, doing so wouldn’t just cost precious taxpayer dollars. It will also encourage individuals to migrate to the United States for “free” health care.
In the interview, CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Harris about language in Section 102(a) of the House and Senate single-payer bills, which would make health coverage available to all individuals present in the United States, regardless of their legal status. When questioned whether she supported granting benefits “to people who are in this country illegally,” Harris responded unequivocally that she does: “Let me just be very clear about this. I am opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access to public safety, public education or public health, period.”
Compare Harris’ response to the words of none other than Hillary Clinton. When testifying before Congress about her health-care task force’s plan in September 1993, Clinton said she opposed extending benefits to “illegal aliens,” because it would encourage additional migration to the United States:
We do not think the comprehensive health care benefits should be extended to those who are undocumented workers and illegal aliens. We do not want to do anything to encourage more illegal immigration into this country. We know now that too many people come in for medical care, as it is. We certainly don’t want them having the same benefits that American citizens are entitled to have.
Clinton may not want illegally present foreign citizens having the same benefits that American citizens would be entitled to under single payer, but Harris does.
The problems sparked by single payer would reach far beyond undocumented foreigners living in this country. To wit, both the House and Senate single-payer bills prohibit individuals from traveling “for the sole purpose of obtaining health care” from the new government-run system. But note the specific wording: It only prohibits foreign citizens from traveling for the sole purpose of receiving health care.
This extremely permissive language would give federal officials fits. So long as anyone states some other purpose—visiting the U.S. Capitol, for instance, or seeing a Broadway play—for his or her visit, the language in the bills would make it impossible to deny these foreign citizens health care funded by U.S. taxpayers.
Provisions like these would not just cost American taxpayer dollars, it would also cost the U.S. health-care system. Growth in benefit tourism would greatly increase demand for health care (as would many other provisions in a single-payer system). Because of this greater demand, American citizens would have an increasingly difficult time accessing care. Foreign residents may not like waiting for care either, but individuals from developing countries lacking access to advanced health treatments might find queues for care in this country far preferable to no care at all in their native land. Don’t Insult Americans’ Intelligence
In the same CNN interview that aired Sunday, Harris also tried, albeit unconvincingly , to “clean up” her January comments about “mov[ing] on” from private insurance. She claimed to Tapper that single-payer legislation would not fully eliminate private insurance. However, host Tapper rightly pointed out that supplemental insurance could only cover the very few services that the government-run plan would not, like cosmetic surgery.
Tapper also asked Harris about the unions that have health plans that they like now, not least because they gave up pay raises in prior years to keep rich health benefits. Harris could only concede that “it’s a legitimate concern which must be addressed.” I’m sure that those individuals facing the loss of their health coverage feel better, because Harris has officially dubbed their concern “legitimate.”
Note to Harris: Legal hair-splitting about whether single payer bars all health insurance, or just virtually all health insurance, and patronizing constituents fearful of losing their coverage, doesn’t seem like the best way to win support for a government takeover of health care. Perhaps next time she gives an interview with Tapper, she will finally have an answer for why she wants to give benefits to individuals unlawfully present, while taking coverage away from nearly 300 million Americans.

The Left And Right Should Defenestrate James Comey From Public Life,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/left-right-defenestrate-james-comey-public-life/,"By Margot Cleveland May 13, 2019
Democrats and Republicans will never agree on the validity of the outcome of the Hillary Clinton investigation. While Clinton backers believe the former secretary of state committed no crime by transmitting classified information through her personal email account, critics counter that former FBI director James Comey’s conclusion that Clinton acted “extremely careless” euphemistically described gross negligence subjecting her to criminal liability.
Likewise, the country seems perpetually divided over the question of Russian collusion. Even Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s finding that there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia failed to shake Democrats and Never Trump Republicans from their belief. Instead, Mueller’s report fueled a second fracture in American sentiments over whether Trump obstructed justice. Attorney General William Barr’s conclusion that a criminal case was not supportable did nothing to lessen the divide.
While Americans remain split over whether Clinton or Trump committed crimes, there should be a consensus on Comey’s handling of both matters. All Americans should see the former FBI director for what he was: a self-righteous, self-important, above-the-law and above-the-chain of command, morally weak egotist. He should be a public pariah.
Yet since the release of the special counsel’s report, Comey has succeeded in relaunching the resistance tour he began shortly after President Trump fired him as FBI director just more than two years ago. First Comey took to The New York Times to pontificate on the president’s prowess for eating men’s souls. Then on Thursday, CNN gifted Comey a townhall-style platform, where he further condemned the president.
Comey’s appeal to the plurality of Americans still seized with Trump derangement syndrome is understandable—the former FBI director’s anti-Trump schtick is irresistible Kool-Aid to the president’s enemies. But Comey’s behavior should not be celebrated. It should be an anathema to anyone believing in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power in our democratic republic.
Following Trump’s election, Comey briefed the president-elect on the details of the Christopher Steele dossier, knowing full well they were salacious and discredited and that the mainstream media was looking for a hook to repeat the slurs. It worked, and Comey’s briefing made the dossier mainstream.
Then, after Trump was sworn in, Comey agreed to stay on as FBI director, yet spent his time cataloguing nearly every encounter he had with the president. The condescending and unnecessary details Comey included in the entries showed his utter contempt for the president. Comey’s memos also claimed concern over various statements and requests the president made.
Yet Comey did nothing other than document his supposed concerns and complain to colleagues: He didn’t challenge the president, pass his concerns up the chain of command, or quit. Instead, Comey carried on until Trump fired him.
Following his firing, Comey leaked several of his memos to a friend in order to push the obstruction narrative to the media and prompt the appointment of a special counsel. Because this petty little man demanded vindication, the country suffered a $30 million investigation and two years of civil discord. (Comey also wrote a tell-all book which, if the man had an ounce of self-reflection, would have caused him such embarrassment, he would have retreated into a hermitage.)
Comey couldn’t even leave the matter in the hands of the special counsel. Following Mueller’s report, Comey continues to sow the seeds of the Russia conspiracy hoax, claiming he still doesn’t know whether Russia has leverage over Trump. Following Attorney General Barr’s conclusion that there is no obstruction of justice case either, Comey still refuses to accept the outcome.
Those desperate to see Trump’s downfall celebrate Comey and his tactics, but forget that not long ago Comey treated Hillary Clinton the same way, potentially costing her the presidential election. As FBI director, Comey bowed to the demands of his boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, to call the investigation of Clinton a “matter,” while mentally condemning Lynch’s request.
While Comey has no memos documenting his interactions with Lynch to leak to the press, he would later retell the episode both to Congress and the media, to justify his decision to bypass his boss and hold the July 5, 2016, press conference at which he announced the results of the investigation into Clinton.
Comey’s champions also forget that at that press conference he took it upon himself to criticize Clinton’s handling of classified information. Then, on October 28, 2016, Comey announced the re-opening of the investigation. The Department of Justice’s inspector general chastised Comey for both decisions, stating “it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to conceal his intentions from his superiors, the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, for the admitted purpose of preventing them from telling him not to make the statement, and to instruct his subordinates in the FBI to do the same.”
The IG also found that Comey “chose to deviate from the FBI’s and the Department’s established procedures and norms and instead engaged in his own subjective, ad hoc decision making.” Additionally, according to the IG, Comey “usurped the authority of the Attorney General and upset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions and the accountability principles that guide law enforcement decisions in the United States.”
That Comey turned his disdain to Trump changes nothing. Comey is playing his audience and America. He is no hero. He was a weak, smug, self-important fraud when he dragged the country through his mishandling of the Clinton investigation. And he was a weak, smug, self-important fraud when he dragged the country through two years of a special counsel investigation to seek vengeance on the president who dared to fire him.
Comey doesn’t deserve anyone’s accolades. He deserves universal ostracization. Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Coverage Of Valerie Plame’s Run For Congress Ignores Her Anti-Semitism,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/coverage-valerie-plames-run-congress-ignores-anti-semitism/,"By Warren Henry May 13, 2019
Valerie Plame, an ex-CIA officer famously outed by a State Department official in the George W. Bush administration, is running for the open seat in New Mexico’s Third Congressional District. Unsurprisingly, the establishment media coverage of her candidacy largely ignored aspects of the Plame affair that are unhelpful to the left. Big Media also largely ignored the anti-Semitic materials she promoted on Twitter, a scandal that forced her resignation from the already controversial Ploughshares Fund.
“Plamegate” was rooted in a July 2003 New York Times op-ed by Plame’s then-husband. Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former diplomat, claimed the Bush administration manipulated intelligence about Saddam Hussein’s weapons programs to justify invading Iraq, based in part on a 2002 mission he took to Niger to investigate the alleged sale of “yellowcake” uranium to Saddam.
Shortly thereafter, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage leaked to columnist Bob Novak that Valerie had suggested Joe be selected for the mission. The apparent motive for the leak was to establish Joe’s report “was regarded by the CIA as less than definitive, and it [was] doubtful” top officials ever saw it. Novak claimed he was never informed Valerie had covert status at the time.
Attaining media martyr status after being outed, Valerie testified before the House that she did not suggest Joe for the mission and no nepotism was involved. A bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report found not only that Valerie specifically recommended Joe, but his report bolstered the intelligence about uranium sales for most intelligence analysts. The same report found the CIA did not inform the administration about its doubts about the reliability of that intelligence.
However, this information was not known until after the launch of a special counsel investigation into the matter. The circumstances of that probe now seem like a pattern . Attorney General John Ashcroft was recused from the case over his ties to White House officials. The probe was left to his deputy, James Comey, who appointed his longtime friend (and current lawyer) Patrick Fitzgerald to investigate.
Fitzgerald never charged Armitage for the Plame leak, ostensibly from lack of evidence that he knew Plame had covert status. Instead, he obtained convictions for obstruction and false statements by a juicier political target, Lewis “Scooter” Libby, who was Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff.
Reporter Judith Miller , a key witness at Libby’s trial, alleges Fitzgerald deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence that would have made a guilty verdict unlikely. Others accuse Fitzgerald of squeezing Libby in hopes of obtaining evidence against Cheney or top Bush adviser Karl Rove. (Libby has since been pardoned. The Wilsons sued Cheney, Rove, Libby, and others—but not Armitage—alleging a conspiracy; the case was dismissed after proceedings in which even the Obama administration agreed the Wilsons had no business in federal court.)
The Plame affair may be seen as part of the foundation for the distrust some on the right now harbor for “deep state” bureaucrats undermining the executive branch and special counsel investigations that wind up focused on secondary issues. Plame’s legacy on this score, however, is not the whole of her disturbing record.
After exploiting her story in a book and movie, Plame joined the board of the Ploughshares Fund, an anti-nuclear nonprofit group. Ploughshares had already stirred controversy by funding the “ echo chamber ” organized by President Obama’s aide Ben Rhodes to push a nuclear deal with Iran. These efforts included $100,000 to NPR in an apparent pay-to-play scandal, as well as $500,000 to J Street , which assisted the White House in pressuring Jewish groups to support the pact .
While on the Ploughshares board, Plame used her Twitter account to promote an article by another former CIA officer titled “America’s Jews Are Driving America’s Wars.” When decent people objected, she did not apologize, but responded that retweets are not an endorsement, although it was not a retweet.
Plame added: “very provocative, but thoughtful. Many neocon hawks ARE Jewish . . . Read the entire article and try, just for a moment, to put aside your biases and think clearly.” The “thoughtful” article at issue asserted that Jews “own the media,” Jews should wear labels while on national television, and their beliefs are as dangerous as “a bottle of rat poison.”
Plame later claimed she “messed up” and only “skimmed” the article before sharing it. Her claim was laughable. She previously urged people to read the whole article. Plame also had a history of sharing articles from the same source, including one claiming “ Israeli-occupied Congress confronts the White House .” Plame further shared a 9/11 conspiracy theory involving “dancing Israelis.”
Her so-called apology continues to maintain she acted carelessly. And she is still spouting that line, most recently on NBC:
For a former covert officer, Plame is not very good at cover stories.
As a result of this Twitter post and the aftermath, she resigned from Ploughshares in September 2017. After all, critics had already charged that the Iran deal’s “echo chamber”—with its insinuations about the power of pro-Israel lobbyists and dual loyalty—carried a stink of anti-Semitism from Obama on down .
Now, the establishment media coverage of Plame’s announced candidacy ignores the bigoted stink that lingers on her. The New York Times omitted any mention of her anti-Semitism or the details of Plamegate. The reporter defended her story as a short, 400-word announcement, though one which reprints part of Plame’s press release on health care.
The Times recently acknowledged, however weakly, its continuing insensitivity to anti-Semitism . But apparently yet another anti-Semite is running for Congress and it’s not “all of the news that’s fit to print” so long as the anti-Semite is a Democrat (see also: Ilhan Omar ).
The Times was not the only offender. As noted by (((AG))) on Twitter, the Washington Post ran an Associated Press story that ignores Plame’s support for anti-Semitism; the Daily Beast similarly ignored it. So did The Hill and Roll Call . At least CNN mentioned it in one sentence, though it mentioned only the one article and credulously repeated Plame’s claim she had skimmed it.
Anti-Semitism has been a long-running scandal within the United Kingdom’s Labour Party, particularly regarding its current leader, Jeremy Corbyn. The scandal has been long-running because party members and the media spent years arguing over whether Corbyn was an anti-Semite, no matter how many incidents piled up in public. America’s establishment media should strive to do better, or our currently ugly politics will only get uglier. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois."

The Early ‘90s Called Joe Biden. They Want Their Foreign Policy Back,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/early-90s-called-joe-biden-want-foreign-policy-back/,"By Sumantra Maitra May 13, 2019
In a recent rally, the septuagenarian former vice president flashed his pearly set and declared, to the utter confusion of foreign policy analysts across the Euro-Atlantic, that China is no threat to the West: “ China is going to eat our lunch ? Come on, man.”
Beijing is the world’s second-largest economy, and increasingly isolated due to its revanchism in the Asia Pacific. It is confronting Australia, India, and Japan simultaneously, challenging the U.S. Navy and British Royal Navy every day. It’s returning to Maoist totalitarianism and Chinese civilizational exceptionalism, the leader of artificial intelligence and genetics research, with advanced space warfare capabilities and highly advanced stealth and hypersonic warfare capabilities.
China is a chronic thief of intellectual property, a great power extensively buying lands (and governments) across the world, a manufacturing giant in a trade war, and a great power engaged in espionage, cyber warfare, and naval buildup. Yet, according to the front-runner of the Democratic presidential field, it is no threat to the United States and the West.
Biden is obviously wrong about China. In fact, Biden is wrong about a lot of things. Like Johnny English, it is his job to know nothing, be wrong, and goof around. He has a glowing smile, 1950s social mannerisms, righteous rage at social justice issues to update himself for the kids, and is catastrophically wrong about every single foreign policy position possible.
Let’s start with the biggest position that would come back to haunt him as president. I was a rookie reporter covering the U.S. vice presidential candidates’ debate when I saw the difference between a quietly earnest if wonkish Paul Ryan, and a smug, condescending Biden, with a media fully disposed in the latter’s favor. It was Biden who dismissed whether Russia was a revanchist power .
While one can argue about how much Russia was a “threat” per se, no one would deny that Russia is and will be an adversarial power, and something Biden’s administration not only didn’t perceive, but when informed, dismissed mockingly.
But that is not all. Biden is stuck in time, as the world changed around him. For example, Tucker Carlson writes in his book, “Ship of Fools,” “In the fall of 2002, a total of seventy-seven senators voted in favor of the Iraq War resolution. This included the majority of Democrats, and 100 percent of the party’s rising stars. Two future presidential candidates who voted for the war, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, also happened to be future secretaries of state. The future vice president, Joe Biden, voted for it…”
He also notes that, during Vietnam evacuation, “Senator Joe Biden of Delaware agreed; he introduced legislation to curb the arrival of Vietnamese immigrants, accusing the Ford administration of not being honest about how many refugees would be arriving.” Vietnamese immigrants, needless to say, are one of the most successful and assimilated groups in the United States, but that’s beyond the point.
The point is Biden never thought independently about what might be good or bad, but said the things the Democratic base wanted to hear. In 2002, Iraq War support was simply good politics, even though now no one talks about it.
Biden also argued for a renewed troop surge in Afghanistan, a conflict that has long transformed from a war to an imperial law and order mission, similar to what the British did in the 1890s, against Afghan rebels in North West Frontier Province. Funnily enough, when the most consequential decision of the Obama administration came, such as the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden, Biden argued against it . Obama, of course, took the advice of his generals instead.
To Biden’s credit, like a broken clock he was right about foreign policy twice. During one of the most catastrophic foreign policy decision in modern Western history, when Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, and Susan Rice were arguing for toppling Muammar Gaddafi, which turned Libya into a slave trading hub and mass migration springboard, Biden apparently argued against it . He was also apparently overruled and then went on to fully support the Obama intervention, even when he despised Clinton , according to his aides.
Likewise, he was the first one to publicly state that there are no good Syrian rebels , because all are Qatari-funded Islamists. But then he promptly backtracked, genuflected, and apologized. He should have stuck by both, because history could have proved his caution and restraint right. But he did not.
The problem for Biden is much more than that. He reminds me of the grandmother in “ Good bye, Lenin! ” who fell in coma during the Soviet years, only to wake up after the fall of the Berlin Wall in a unified Germany, yet her grandson must continue an elaborate hoax to assure her that she is still in communist Germany, so she doesn’t have another shock and suffer a stroke.
Biden, likewise, is also stuck in the heady days of early 1990s triumphalism, with an expanding North Atlantic Trade Organization, an European Union that is a prospective trade ally, and the world fit for liberal interventionism and democracy, with a hope that China would eventually be entrenched as a pillar in the liberal order.
Unfortunately, none of that came true, and China is pretty much the biggest rising great-power rival challenge to an established superpower, compared to the history of rising-power challenges , from Sparta to Athens, Carthage to Rome, the Spaniards, Napoleon and Germans twice, to the Brits. There’s an academic consensus about it, and Uncle Joe is wrong once again.
Most importantly, however, he is opposed to his own base. Recent studies suggest , that Americans overwhelmingly, distinctly support a restrained foreign policy and less liberal interventionism and democracy promotion abroad, this stance is even stronger among the Democratic base.
The findings in this survey suggest that American voters are not isolationist. Rather, voters are more accurately described as supporting ‘restrained engagement’ in international affairs—a strategy that favours diplomatic, political, and economic actions over military action when advancing U.S. interests in the world. American voters want their political leaders to make more public investments in the American people in order to compete in the world and to strike the right balance abroad after more than a decade of what they see as military overextension.
Guess who won an election promising just that?
It is a mystery that President Trump cannot transform his foreign policy instincts into electoral support, but one can blame Trump’s poor PR, lack of strict message discipline, and continuous mainstream media opposition for that. The fact remains, however, that Trump is more attuned to a non-interventionist America than his prospective rival Biden.
It is still too early to say what would happen. The primaries and the debates haven’t started yet. While one can be sympathetic to an affable grand-fatherly figure, one should be careful about someone who has repeatedly, to use a liberal catch-phrase, been on the “wrong side of history.” Sumantra Maitra is a doctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham, UK, and a writer for The Federalist.

"Bowing To The Socialists, Hoyer Says Rashida Tlaib Deserves An Apology",thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/bowing-to-the-socialists-hoyer-says-tlaib-deserves-an-apology/,"May 13, 2019 By David Marcus
This week in an interview Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D–MI) recounted how the Holocaust has a calming effect on her because she knows her Palestinian ancestors helped to create a safe haven for Jews. Two things on this; it’s weird to use the term calm to describe one’s reaction to the extermination of Jews. Run a bubble bath, light some candles, and consider how virtuous your ancestors were helping genocide victims. And that’s the other thing; they didn’t help genocide victims, they killed them and still do.
But this is just one freshman representative, right? Conservatives are blowing it out of proportion. The socialist wing of the Democratic Party is just three congresswomen. That may have been true until House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D–MD) said this of criticism over Tlaib’s comments, “If you read Rep. Tlaib’s comments, it is clear that President Trump and Congressional Republicans are taking them out of context. They must stop. And they owe her an apology.”
Here is the comment from Tlaib in question:
“There’s always kind of a calming feeling, I tell folks, when I think of the Holocaust, and the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the fact that it was my ancestors—Palestinians—who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways, have been wiped out … And, just all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and the horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time.”
As mentioned above, the use of the word “calming” is at worst deeply troubling, at best weird, but it’s not the worst part. The worst part is this absolute fiction that Palestinians deserve some praise for helping to establish the Jewish state. The Palestinians worked with the Nazis, and once Israel was founded, they dedicated themselves to its destruction. To suggest they get some credit for helping Jews after the Holocaust is a bellicose joke.
The joke is that Tlaib is using the suffering of the Palestinians since the emergence of Israel to dull her own emotional reaction to the Holocaust. There is a wink and a “see what I did there?” at work here. “Look at all that the Palestinians have done for the Jews,” goes Tlaib’s ironic jest. Best friends Israel ever had!
Tlaib goes on to say that she no longer supports a two-state solution for Israel. This is at extreme odds with the position of her party. And it is intended to create a crisis in which Jews in Israel become outnumbered and must concede the existence of a democratic Jewish state. Apparently, Steny Hoyer thinks this is all just fine.
Why the Democrats are so confounded by historically illiterate socialist freshman representatives who regularly cross the line on anti-Semitism is a bit of a mystery. They liked the initial storyline about young women of color sticking it to the Orange Meanie, but now they have become residents of socialist crazy town. For Hoyer to suggest anybody need apologize for criticizing Tlaib’s bizarre and insensitive comments is laughable. Does Hoyer believe that the Palestinians have been great friends of the Jews? Does he believe in a two-state solution? Does he feel a sense of calm about the Holocaust?
Hoyer’s call for an apology is absurd, but it shows again that House leadership has no idea how to handle these radical voices in their own party. They jump to defend assuming the attacks are in bad faith, only to find they aren’t, and that they are defending things they can’t actually defend. This will surely not be the last time this happens.

Secretary Of State Denounces Leaders ‘Eager To Delight Davos’,thefederalist.com,Mike Pompeo,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/pompeo-america-first-foreign-policy-is-inspired-by-the-founders/,"By Mike Pompeo May 13, 2019
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo gave the following remarks at the Claremont Institute’s 40th Anniversary Gala on May 11. Watch here or read the full transcript below.
Thank you. Thank you all. People talk about my job being nerve-wracking. There is nothing as nerve-wracking as that much applause before you speak. And you should know – Ryan, thank you for the kind introduction too – I was on this trip when I heard about this little dustup about the advertisement for this dinner, and it said they wouldn’t let him post because of the offensive material. I’m like, is that me? But I also know a point – with no advertisement and this crowd, you’d have needed a much bigger room.
So it is wonderful. It is great to be out with a group of people who care about America so deeply. Thank you for having me. I want to thank the Claremont Institute as well. As you said, I just got back on a trip where I had gone to Finland to talk about America’s interests in the Arctic. I made a little detour to Iraq and then back to London. Makes Southern California weather feel pretty good.
First of all, I was – you talked about this is home. I grew up at basically Harbor and McFadden. My father still lives in that house. I was there today. Yeah, it was really something. He’s lived in that house since 1961, and today they had the whole little street blocked off with California Highway Patrol and the security team, and the neighbors were all coming out like, “I know that kid.”
The Bible describes John the Baptist as “the voice of one crying in the wilderness.” And I sometimes think about the Claremont Institute that way.
I call Kansas home. It’s where I spent the bulk of my adult life outside of the military. But I had spent my childhood here, of course, when Ronald Reagan was the governor. And I have to tell you, California has changed a little bit since I left. I’m going to have to come back and help you all get it right.
It’s so important that you all know, all the people who make Claremont tick, Ryan and the team and all of those who contribute, your work goes way past California. And as Ryan said, there’s been a lot written in the Claremont Review of Books that clarify the aims and undertakings of what we’re trying to do in this administration, and the hundreds of fellows that you’ve educated over the years who are defending the first principles on the front lines. In fact, Ryan mentioned I have a senior advisor, Mary Kissel, and a speechwriter, who is sitting over here to my left. The two of them wrote this tonight, so if you don’t like it, it is on you.
It also looks like my Leo Strauss quote, Leo Strauss quote, so you’re the only ones that might laugh at that joke, so thank you.
Look, all kidding aside, your work to preserve the ideals of the American Founding is absolutely what America needs. There is literally, as I travel the world, there is nothing more distinctive about the United States than our politics, and wonderfully so. We are the truly greatest experiment in human freedom that the world has ever seen, and I, as America’s senior diplomat, benefit from that every day.
I want to do a little bit of the history, because the foreign policy of the early republic reflected the attitude of a free nation which has thrown off an imperial power, which, frankly, I just left. And look, I think there’s three words that characterize that. They would be realism, restraint, and respect, and I’ll talk about each of them just for a moment.
First, realism. The Founders were keen students of human nature and history. They saw that conflict is the normative experience for nations. Hamilton put this Federalist 34. He said, “To judge from the history of mankind, we shall be compelled to conclude that the fiery and destructive passions of war reign in the human breast with much more powerful sway than the mild and [beneficial] sentiments of peace.”
I’ll simplify: The Founders knew peace wasn’t the norm. And in response to this reality, the Founders knew the first duty of the federal government was to provide for the safety of its citizens. Madison said, “[Security] is an avowed and essential object of the American Union.” You all know that.
How about restraint? The Founders sought to protect our interests but avoid adventurism. The Barbary War, fought so soon after independence, was an effort of last resort to protect our vital commercial interests. The Monroe Doctrine – relevant even today – was a message of deterrence, not a license to grab land. “Peace and friendship,” said Jefferson, “with all mankind is our wisest policy, and I wish we may be permitted to pursue it. But the temper and folly of our enemies may not leave this in our choice.”
And finally, respect. The Founders had recently cast off the tyranny of an empire. They were not eager to subjugate others. In 1821, John Quincy Adams wrote that America “goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy.” But indeed, quite the opposite: “She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all.” And as the first nation of its kind, the world would see America as a model for self-government and liberty. And a special bond would link America to any nation that loved those things.
Let’s contrast the Founders’ ideas to the foreign policy of the late 20th and early 21st century. American leaders had drifted from realism. At the dawn of the post-Cold war era, hopes were high that enfolding the likes of China and Russia into a so-called rules-based international order would hasten their domestic evolution towards democracy. We hoped this order – comprised of institutions and agreed upon by codes of conduct – would temper their actions towards neighbors and to our country.
But we can see now 30 years on, after the end of the Cold War, that the Putin regime slays dissidents in cold blood and invades its neighbors; that the Chinese Communist Party has detained more than one million Chinese Muslims in labor camps, and it uses coercion and corruption as its primary tools of statecraft. And as I’ll talk about here in just a little bit, both countries have foreign policies intent on eroding American power. We can’t blame our leaders for their optimism, but we can blame them for having misjudged those regimes.
America too had become unrestrained, untethered from common sense. The institutions, the institutions we built to defend the free world against the Soviet menace, had drifted from their original mission set. Indeed, some of them had become directly antagonistic to our interests, while we kept silent. We bought into trade agreements that helped hollow out our own middle class. We sacrificed American competitiveness for accolades from the UN and climate activists. And we engaged in conflicts without a clear sense of mission. No more.
And to round out this trio, we had lost sight of respect – not for other nations, but for our own people and for our ideals. We cozied up to Cuba. We struck a terrible agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran that put the regime’s campaigns of terrorism and proxy wars on steroids. And many of our leaders were more eager to delight the Davos crowd than champion the principles that have made us the greatest nation that civilization has ever known.
By the way, the Claremont Institute sadly knows, I could also name a certain tech company that we spoke about earlier that’s forgotten our first principles too.
I am very confident. I am very confident that the Founders would have been perplexed by those moves. We had too much confidence in the international system and not enough confidence in our own nation. And we had too little courage to confront regimes squarely opposed to our interests and to our values.
But I bring you good news. One man said, “Enough.” And in 2016, you all sent him to the White House. President Trump’s prescription for foreign policy was very simple, right? “America First.” Now, that’s been mocked a bit. The media has spun this phrase as a dog-whistle for racists and xenophobes. But I’ve spent a fair amount of time with President Trump, in fact, virtually every single day these past two years. Yeah, sometimes so good, sometimes more challenging for all of us, yes.
But here’s what this really means. It means that like millions and millions of Americans, President Trump loves this country and wants to see it do well in the world – not at the expense of others, but to the benefit of our people, and by extension, the nations that share our values and our strategic goals. It’s really that simple. If there is a natural law of foreign policy, this is it.
And while he wishes every country enjoyed the freedoms we enjoy here, he has no aspiration to use force to spread the American model. You can see it in the administration’s record of its using force. I can prove it to you.
And so – and so importantly − he believes America is exceptional – a place and history apart from normal human experience, the ones that our Founders spoke about. President Trump believes it is right – indeed more than right – for America to unashamedly advance policy that serves our interests and reflects American ideals.
Certainly, our course of action in this administration reflects a gut-level – a gut-level – for love of country. But taking the pursuit of America’s interests up a notch is not just honorable; it’s urgent in this new era of great power competition.
On China, the President has taken action to stop China from stealing our stuff. No longer will American companies be forced to hand over their technological crown jewels as the price of doing business in China. When a deal doesn’t work for the United States, no deal shall be done.
We have bolstered our military presence in the South China Sea, and we’ve put nations on notice around the world that the sale of key infrastructure and technology companies to China threatens their national security. And we’ve strengthened the group, the entity, that screens Chinese and other foreign investments here in the United States. We are also fighting the battle to make sure that the Chinese Communist Party cannot burrow into the data of billions of internet users through companies like Huawei and ZTE. The internet of tomorrow must have buried within it Western values and must not belong to China.
This has been a real pivot to Asia.
So look, how else are we putting America First? As I – I gave a speech in Brussels. I didn’t get any of this applause. I talked – I spoke that day in Brussels about international agreements and institutions in which the United States enters, and I said that for us to continue to participate it must be with our consent and has to serve our interests and ideals. It seemed pretty straightforward.
Look, consider our stated intent to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force Treaty with Russia. I don’t watch much TV, but I have seen the media mandarins swear up and down that America was putting the world closer to nuclear war. But as the 28 NATO Allies unanimously concurred, Russia is in violation of the treaty, putting Vladimir Putin closer to an asymmetric advantage of his nuclear forces. Why would one party honor a deal when the other wouldn’t? It made no sense. We chose to abrogate the treaty but not abrogate defending the American people. I’ll put it another way: Our decision on missiles wasn’t rocket science. Yeah, that was one of your own wrote that one.
Look, we’re also working to ensure that the future of international agreements unambiguously advances American interest. Past efforts, agreements that we entered into with North Korea, only produced more North Korean nukes and American diplomatic failure. Our diplomacy with the DPRK is laser-focused on making sure that we never again have to reopen the North Korean nuclear file.
I just this past trip to Hanoi came across a major threshold. I had spent more time with Chairman Kim than even Dennis Rodman.
But I want you all to know this is serious business. We want to make sure that Americans are safe, and we are determined to get our policy with North Korea and to get our allies, Japan and South Korea, and to convince the Russians and the Chinese that this is in the world’s best interest. And our diplomatic efforts to get the entire world to engage, to see the risk for what it is, and to help us get North Korea to a brighter future, is something that our administration is profoundly proud of.
And finally, putting America First means proudly associating with nations that share our principles and are willing to defend them. It’s true; we had some earlier comments from Washington’s Farewell Address. He warned against permanent alliances, but that same speech praised connections with nations based on “policy, humanity, and interest.”
We have reaffirmed America’s historic alliance with the only free nation in the Middle East: Israel.
We are banding together with the likeminded nations like Australia, India, Japan, and South Korea to make sure that each Indo-Pacific nation can protect its sovereignty from coercion. It’s part of a greater commitment to a free and open order. You all know this: The distinctive mark of Western Civilization is the belief in the inherent worth of human beings, with the attendant respect for God-authored rights and liberties. Indeed, the Declaration says that “all men are created equal.” And we ought to help nations protect these first things – and human rights as well.
This new pride in taking America’s interests seriously is not just an American phenomenon. Countries all over the world are rediscovering their national identities, and we are supporting them. We’re asking them to do what’s best for their people as well. The wave of electoral surprises has swept from Britain to the United States and all the way to Brazil.
You’ve all heard the famous line, “What’s good for General Motors is good for the United States.” I actually think the last administration would have said, “What’s good for the world is good for the United States.” Our focus is that, “What’s good for the United States – a foreign policy animated by love of our unique way of life – is good for the world.”
And as I wrap out, I want to talk about why that is.
First, countries who share our same principles find new avenues for collaboration with us. I mentioned before I returned from an Arctic Council Ministerial, a bunch of foreign ministers from eight countries whose nations touch the Arctic’s. I made it clear America is now sharpening its focus in an area of increasing strategic importance. We want to cooperate with likeminded democracies who share our vision of the Arctic, and guard against those who don’t – nations like China and Russia. My task as America’s most senior diplomat of building alliances is hard work, but they are essential for securing the rights the Founders sought to protect.
Second, love of one’s country forces leaders to better honor the will of their own people. President Trump does that every day.
Hamilton had it right. Hamilton had the right idea. He said, “Under every form of government, rulers are only trustees for the happiness and interest of their nation.” If democratic leaders are not responsive to the jolts of patriotism which are sweeping the world, they won’t be leaders for long. Those who understand that nations are the best vehicle for securing the rights of their citizens will have a much longer shelf life.
Third – the third reason why is that I’ve always been a big believer in competition. I didn’t like it when I ran a small business. I wanted my own little monopoly. But the truth of the matter is we all know that America can compete and win against our adversaries on security and any economic issue. But even more importantly, competition forces the best ideas to rise. And among political ideas, there is none better than the American idea.
I have the enormous privilege to serve as America’s most senior diplomat, and what I want the world to see – the unsurpassed attractiveness of the American experiment – is something I market every day. I want other nations to take this same path. Our first president desired the same thing. He used words like this. He said, “The applause, the affection, and the adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.”
Look, what I’ve just outlined here is a foreign policy that returns America to old truths. We talk about this inside the State Department all the time. Let’s speak about real facts and real truth. It’s something I know that this institute, the Claremont Institute, has a deep appreciation for. President Trump has helped put the world back on track to a nation-first trajectory, and I am confident that this reawakening will last well beyond this, his presidency. As just one example you should see, look at how both parties now are on guard against the threat that China presents to America – maybe except Joe Biden. God love him.
Winston Churchill – a name very near to this, dear to this organization – said, “America is like a giant boiler. Light a fire under it, and there’s no limit to the amount of heat it can generate.” A fire was truly lit back in 2016. Bathed in its light, we have embarked on a foreign policy that takes seriously the Founders’ ideas of individual liberty and constitutional government. And because of it, American exceptionalism – and the American Founding – will remain alive and well in the 21st century.
Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless these United States of America. Mike Pompeo is the 70th United States Secretary of State. "
‘Veep’s’ Greatest Weapon Was Making No Topic Off-Limits For Jokes,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/veeps-greatest-weapon-making-no-topic-off-limits-jokes/,"May 13, 2019 By Ellie Bufkin
While much of this week’s water cooler chat will revolve around the penultimate episode of “Game of Thrones,” Sunday night marked the end of another classic HBO series. “Veep” closed out its seventh and final season with a worthy half-hour of its signature political satire. The show wrapped with a fitting epilogue, never straying from its blatant refusal to take anything seriously.
“Veep,” a show about a woman desperate to become president at any cost, was in a category of one for silver-tongued comedy writing. Each episode was a treasure of break-neck dialogue full of so much scathing wit that it would be impossible to pick up every joke in just one viewing.
Selina Meyer was not a woman concerned with values or integrity at any moment in the show’s seven-year run. Her willingness to stoop to levels lower than most people could imagine gave the show a wide berth for joke-telling.
The show’s greatest weapon was its absolute adherence to the rule that no subject was off limits for joking. In an era where comedy, including stand-up, sitcom, and film, has been neutered in the name of political correctness, “Veep” remained wholly unconcerned with who it might offend.
Showrunner David Mandel explained in a March 31 interview , “I’m a fat Jew from New York City, and I am the first to laugh if they are good jokes, a fat joke, a Holocaust joke, or anti-Semitism. If they’re great jokes [I’ll laugh],” he continued, “A great joke can help people laugh at something they maybe didn’t even want to.”
Truly, “Veep” was satire at its very best. Even in moments where viewers felt as though their political values may have been the target of the show’s joke, they would quickly realize that the other side was not being propped up either. In real life, neither Democrats nor Republicans would dare claim Meyer as an example of their party.
“Veep” star Julia Louis-Dreyfus gave the show the perfect female lead: a woman with impractical confidence, absurd vanity, and zero affection or loyalty for anyone in her life. Her near-sociopathic persona made her the queen of her terribly dysfunctional world. She didn’t care what happened to any of the people in her orbit, and therefore neither did the viewer. Comedy was free to reign in the halls of “Veep” because none of the characters were safe from ridicule.
Along with Louis-Dreyfus, the show was masterfully cast with some of the brightest, most naturally funny, deadpan actors working today. They provided a perfect blend of stoicism, vanity, and aggression that made each installment of “Veep” must-watch comedy. Conveying a true blend of rage and devotion while delivering a 100-mph comedy monologue is a skill that the entire cast mastered from the beginning.
Truly great satire doesn’t overreach to hit its sweet spot for punchlines. The best jokes are the ones that sit just on the outside of reality, making the viewer contemplate just how close Meyer’s world was to the real behind-the-scenes Washington. “Veep” was for everyone who watched an awkward presidential candidate in a brand-new apron, complete with packaging creases, attempt to cook a simple meal for his family and thought, “I wonder what they’re like when the cameras are off.”
As comedy in all forms remains in the crosshairs of the ultra-sensitive outrage culture, it seems hard to imagine another show that defied social trends the way that “Veep” did. More and more networks are hesitant to take a chance on a project that may cause offense, yielding plenty of shows that struggle to deliver even an occasional laugh. Hopefully, the dedicated fans of “Veep” will keep the door open for more fearless comedy in the future.

Rashida Tlaib’s Lies Remind Us Why Israel Must Exist,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/rashida-tlaibs-lies-remind-us-why-israel-must-exist/,"By David Harsanyi May 13, 2019
During a recent SkullDuggery Podcast on Yahoo!, Rep Rashida Tlaib dropped a few historically illiterate thoughts on the Holocaust and Israel. None of it was especially surprising to anyone who’s followed far-left or Palestinian rhetoric for any amount of time.
For Tlaib, the Holocaust was primarily a tragedy for the Palestinian people, who were unable to repel Jewish immigration and stop the formation of a Zionist state. Her words are a helpful reminder of not only why Israel exists, but also that the tragedy of the Palestinian people is neither the fault of the Jews, nor the British, nor the Holocaust.
Tlaib offers two revisionist claims: The first revolves around the contention that Palestinian Arabs were not only welcoming of the Jews, but actually sacrificed their own dignity and lives so Jews could be safe. The second contends that Jews were, or would be, safe under Palestinian rule. Here’s how she put it:
I think two weeks ago or so we celebrated, or just took a moment I think in our country to remember the Holocaust. There’s always kind of a calming feeling I tell folks when I think of the Holocaust, and the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the fact that it was my ancestors — Palestinians — who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways, have been wiped out, and some people’s passports… all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and the horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time. And I love the fact that it was my ancestors that provided that, right, in many ways. But they did it in a way that took their human dignity away and it was forced on them. And so, when I think about a one-state, I think about the fact that why can’t we do it in a better way? And I don’t want people to do it in the name of Judaism, just like I don’t want people to use Islam in that way. It has to be done in a way of values around equality and around the fact that you shouldn’t oppress others so that you can feel free and safe. Why can’t we all be free and safe together?
A charitable reading of Tlaib’s claim of being “calmed” by the Holocaust is that she believes her ancestors offered safe harbor for Jews who were running from the European slaughter. Yet any rudimentary reading of history proves the rest of her contention laughable.
The Zionist movement long predated Hitler, even if Palestinian leadership had aligned itself with the Nazis during the war. By the time the Holocaust was over, Jews had already gained enough power to defend themselves, and Arabs had already been launching pogroms, terrorism, and political attacks for decades.
Although some Arabs initially welcomed Jewish migration in the 1900s, they would become victim to Palestinian leadership—a number of Arab mayors, landowners, and others were assassinated for conspiring with Jews, just as they are today .
After the Balfour Declaration of 1917, a British government document that endorsed “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people” and pledged to “use its best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” there was immediate and violent anti-Semitic reaction.
This, despite the fact that Jewish migration had been exceptionally beneficial for the Arabs living in the area. Rarely mentioned in the Israeli-Palestinian debate, in fact, is that significant Arab migration into a largely empty land was spurred by Jewish economic development. Jews were not displacing Arabs, they were attracting them.
Not that it mattered. As the Peel Commission Report, a British paper recommending partition in 1936, noted , “the Arabs have benefited by the development of the country owing to Jewish immigration, this has had no conciliatory effect. On the contrary… with almost mathematical precision the betterment of the economic situation in Palestine meant the deterioration of the political situation.”
Even Palestinian “moderates” like Musa Alami told Zionist leader David Ben-Gurion “he would prefer the land to remain poor and desolate even for another hundred years” if the alternative was collaboration with Jews. Neither Alami nor Amin al-Husseini, the grand mufti of Jerusalem and leader of the Palestinian cause, nor the father of modern terrorism, Yasser Arafat, nor his protégé, Mahmoud Abbas, ever shared in their deprivations of their people. It was the opposite , in fact. Palestinian leaders have always enriched themselves on this conflict.
“Why can’t we all be free and safe together?” It’s a good question. Long before the Holocaust, every single major Jewish Zionistic organization, even the right-wing ones, saw the Jewish state as giving equal rights to the Arab population. As they do today. At one point, Ben-Gurion argued that a Jewish state should be a nation under the auspices of an Arab federation.
When Vladimir Jabotinsky—the great, and often smeared, Zionist leader who would lead the forerunner of Likud—drafted the first constitution for Jewish Palestine, he gave Arabs and Jews the same duties of statehood, including military and civil service. Both Hebrew and Arabic would have had the same legal standing, and “in every cabinet where the prime minister is a Jew, the vice-premiership shall be offered to an Arab and vice versa.”
This plan was rejected. Then again, every plan that didn’t end in complete subservience of Jews to the Palestinians was rejected with violence. This hasn’t changed in 80 years.
Decades before the Holocaust, the grand mufti personally engineered or incited massacres of Jews from 1920 onward. One such incident in the ancient Jewish city of Hebron saw more than 100 civilians killed by mobs, many of them students and teachers, after Husseini spread rumors about Jews taking control of the Temple Mount (which, in reality, Jews were often barred from visiting). Spreading false rumors about Jews’ intention to occupy or expel Muslims from holy sites is nothing new. Husseini did it. Arafat did it. Fatah is doing it today .
And it was because the British offered virtually no protection for Jewish communities that defense units, mostly made up of farmers, were first created. There was no choice. Far from “trying to create a safe haven for Jews,” the British regularly gave in to Arab violence.
In the 1939 White Paper , the British announced that an independent Arab state would be created within 10 years, and that Jewish immigration was to be limited for five years and then stopped completely. The policy barred sales of land to Jews in 95 percent of Palestinian territory. Even that wasn’t enough for the Arabs, who rejected the plan.
Restrictions on immigration would cost Jewish lives. Then again, the Husseinis, the leading force in Palestinian politics, showed great enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. They modeled their Palestinian youth organization on the ideas of Hitlerjugend , initially calling it “The Nazi Scouts.”
Husseini not only ramped up violence in the Middle East, he directly participated in the oppression of Jews during World War II. As a guest of Hitler, he helped recruit thousands of Muslims to join a division of the Waffen-SS, who then played an active role in the destruction of Yugoslavian Jewry. In his Berlin radio speeches during the war, Husseini preached : “Kill the Jews wherever you find them—this pleases God, history and religion.” Such words would find a safe space in any Hamas lecture.
Husseini personally, with the backing of Himmler, Eichmann, and other Nazis, intervened to stop the issuing of at least 400,000 visas to Jews trying to emigrate to British Palestine. Most of those Jews ended up in concentration camps rather than the “safe harbor” of Haifa.
In 1943, after hearing that some German allies were negotiating with the International Red Cross and others to transport thousands of Jewish children to Palestine to avoid death, he lobbied to prevent the rescue, pushing to have them sent to Poland to perish. Husseini was accused of war crimes by the Nuremberg tribunal. This hardly seems like a person offering a safe haven for Jews.
“Why can’t we all be free and safe together?” Surely we needn’t get too bogged down in explaining that the United Nations partition plan —which would have created a Jewish state and independent contiguous Arab one —was rejected by Palestinians in 1947. Or that those Palestinians, with nearly every Arab nation, then attempted to engage in a massacre of Jews only a few years after the Holocaust. Maybe Tlaib doesn’t know about this.
Since that time, Arab aggression has been responsible for forging Israel’s borders and creating “occupied” territories. Not one leader was concerned about the formation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank or Gaza from 1947-1967. Like Tlaib, most Palestinians consider the entire land occupied. Since the Six Day War, every good-faith effort made at peace with the Palestinians has ended in violence.
Peace can be had easily when Palestinian leadership stops embracing the anti-Semitic terrorism that’s rationalized and girded by historical fantasies that people like Tlaib perpetuate. Even as Palestinian leadership demands Israel open its borders to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of descendants of refugees from 70 years ago—most of whom left on their own volition—they also demand a Jewish-free West Bank. The entire argument for such a policy is based on myth.
So when Tlaib was asked how her “one-state solution” would work for Jews in reality, she responded, “that’s not up to us to decide what it looks like.” She’s right. History has already decided what it looks like. And no revisionist attempts to erase that story will change that reality."
Michigan Democrat Claims The Holocaust Was A Tragedy For…Palestinians,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/michigan-democrat-claims-holocaust-tragedy-forpalestinians/,"By Ellie Bufkin May 13, 2019
Representative Ilhan Omar has all but claimed the shameful title of “Most Controversial Member of Congress” with her many quotes disparaging Israel and Jewish Americans, but she is far from alone as a far-left politician spewing hateful rhetoric. The progressive wing of Congress has managed to open the door to rabid anti-Semitism, and that door will be very hard to close.
While being interviewed on the “ Skullduggery ” podcast on Friday, freshman Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib confirmed her profound anti-Semitism when she claimed that thinking of the Holocaust “always kind of gave her a calming feeling.”
This shocking revelation occurred while she was being interviewed primarily to discuss her proposed legislation to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump. The interview quickly turned to her often-controversial views on the Middle East.
“Skullduggery” host Daniel Klaidman pressed Tlaib, the only person in Congress to outspokenly support a one-state solution for Israel, to further explain her position. He asked her flat-out what her vision is for a one-state solution that would work for both Palestinians and Israeli Jews.
Her response lays out all the cards:
I think two weeks ago or so we celebrated, or just took a moment I think in our country to remember the Holocaust. There’s always kind of a calming feeling I tell folks when I think of the Holocaust, and the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the fact that it was my ancestors — Palestinians — who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways, have been wiped out, and some people’s passports… all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and the horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time. And I love the fact that it was my ancestors that provided that, right, in many ways. But they did it in a way that took their human dignity away and it was forced on them. And so, when I think about a one-state, I think about the fact that why can’t we do it in a better way? And I don’t want people to do it in the name of Judaism, just like I don’t want people to use Islam in that way. It has to be done in a way of values around equality and around the fact that you shouldn’t oppress others so that you can feel free and safe. Why can’t we all be free and safe together?
If her point was to paint a picture of her Palestinian ancestors making room for Jews fleeing Nazi persecutors, she has created a version of history that is entirely fictional. Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner did a wonderful job highlighting the most egregiously inaccurate claims made by Tlaib, including:
— The Jewish presence in the area currently known as Israel dates back thousands of years, and the modern migration of Jews back there pre-dated the Holocaust by many decades, starting with the migration of Jews from Yemen in 1881 .
— With the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , the British government supported the establishment of a Jewish state in the area, an idea rejected by Arabs.
— In 1937, the British Peel Commission proposed a two-state solution to Jews and Arabs, which the Arabs once again rejected because they could not accept any Jewish presence in the region.
In summary, Tlaib’s Palestinian ancestors fought back against the Jewish presence in the West Bank since long before World War II. In fact, during the war, a Palestinian leader allied himself with Adolf Hitler and the Axis powers, which resulted in many additional Jewish deaths in the Middle East.
In the interview, Klaidman, clearly taken aback by her staggering revision of history, responded by saying, “But a one-state solution with the right of return – I mean just the math suggests that Jews would become a minority in that state.”
Tlaib knows this quite well. That is part of the reasoning undergirding advocacy for a one-state “solution.” She calmly responded, “Dan, that’s not up to us to decide what it looks like.”
At this point, Klaidman needed her to at least try to save herself by asking, “The Palestinian authority itself still, at least rhetorically, supports a two-state solution. [The terrorist organization] Hamas does not. How do you distinguish your position from Hamas?”
Tlaib responded with the bugle call of all progressives who don’t have a good answer to their absurd foreign policy positions. She said, “I don’t come from a place of violence. I come from a place of love and equality and justice.” In other words, she refused to answer the question.
On Sunday night, The Washington Post published what would be their only article acknowledging Tlaib’s blatantly anti-Semitic comments from Thursday’s podcast. Unfortunately, the Post failed to report the congresswoman’s comments as troubling, instead choosing to run the story as a disparaging commentary on House Republicans who criticized Tlaib’s comments.
While quoting Tlaib’s comments in full, the Post also failed to acknowledge the staggering inaccuracy of her statements—a feat easily accomplished by any level of professional fact checking. The article focused entirely on comments made by Reps. Liz Cheney and Steve Scalise condemning Tlaib’s statement, insinuating they had both taken their colleague’s words out of context. The New York Times has nothing published that even mentions Tlaib’s interview.
In a written statement on Sunday, Tlaib’s spokesman Denzel McCampbell repeated the now-familiar refrain that criticizing anti-Semitic comments is “dangerous” for the person who made them. Cheney, who referred to Tlaib’s comments as “sickening,” was accused by McCampbell of exploiting the Holocaust to “score political points.”
This is far from Tlaib’s first foray into anti-Semitic sentiment. In addition to publicly supporting the one-state solution, she is an outspoken advocate of BDS (boycott, divestment, and sanctions) efforts against Israeli and Jewish business across the globe. BDS advocates rally for the total dissolution of Israel.
In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which represents 31 member countries including the United States, adopted a clear definition of anti-Semitism. Tlaib’s comments clearly fall within its boundaries. It says, in part, “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities…Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity.”
This chilling interview by a sitting member of Congress should spell the end of Tlaib’s career. There is no question that her values are not in line with the country she supposedly represents. Anti-Semitic behavior and beliefs such as Tlaib’s and Omar’s have no place in the United States Congress. It’s long past time for the leaders of their party to hold them fully accountable and stop the infection.

"Depraved As Ever, ‘Veep’ Went Out At Its Peak",thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/depraved-ever-veep-went-peak/,"May 13, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
Spoilers ahead.
It’s perfectly counterintuitive that “Veep” ended on a tearjerker. The finale was the show at its best, a head-spinning rush of unthinkable depravity. Final season be dashed: with those last 48 minutes, “Veep” went out at its peak.
In an era when even comedians question the value of comedy, tempering their acts to appease breathless Oberlin grads, “Veep” proved the enduring value of sharp edges. Rather than trample this legacy, the finale cemented it. For the better part of a decade, “Veep” resisted the temptation to turn its antiheroes into heroes, remaining brilliantly defiant until the bitter end. (When it’s often most difficult.)
That’s why Gary’s final moment matters. Of the precious few sympathetic characters “Veep” introduced, Gary, for all his faults, was the most important. He was the ever-present, selfless foil to Selina’s defining self-absorption. His destiny—as revealed in Sunday’s finale—illuminated that contrast poignantly. I was as shocked as anyone to find tears in my eyes at the end of “Veep,” but that’s why it was perfect. Gary’s final scene was emotional because everything else wasn’t, because his undying loyalty and selflessness stood out glaringly in the Washington of “Veep.”
In pushing the limits of human ugliness to their comical worst, more brave an endeavor today than at the show’s premiere, “Veep” was downright trenchant when it flirted with reality. That was true in the era of Obama, and it’s true in the era of Trump.
People in DC rightly say “Veep” is more accurate a depiction of the city than “House of Cards,” or “The West Wing.” They don’t just mean it gets the wardrobes right, they’re talking about the people here. If that needed explaining under the previous president, it seems much more obvious now—and it’s an effect much larger than this particular president. Both parties deserve the credit for exposing the desperation and incompetence rampant in their establishments. (You’ll note “Veep” never really chose a team, likely for this reason, a superior approach foreign to the rest of Hollywood.)
In some ways, this exposition has been healthy. Of course, it would have been a lot healthier if we could have just watched it play out on “Veep.” Then again, the best satire is the most in touch with reality, meaning one must exist in order to have the other.
Still, there are no real-life Selina Meyers. There are people who come close, but to its credit, “Veep” succeeded in making her utterly and impossibly irredeemable. Where does that leave Gary? He, too, is a cartoonish version of some Washington stereotype, the slavish bodyman more dedicated to his boss than himself.
It’s in the contrast that “Veep” made its point, pushing the characters to their outlandish extremes, occasionally brushing up against reality, giving us a seven-year break from all the pretense.

How Pretending We Can Control Our Kids’ Happiness Fuels Mom Guilt,thefederalist.com,Anna Mussmann,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/pretending-can-control-kids-happiness-fuels-mom-guilt/,"By Anna Mussmann May 13, 2019
Last weekend the internet observed Mother’s Day. Among the usual flurry of perspectives, people celebrated mothers’ power to work good in the lives of their children. That power is very real and very important, but it can easily be exalted so high it casts dark shadows. “With great power comes great responsibility,” as Uncle Ben told Spiderman, and exaggerating the power of a mom burdens her with more responsibility than she can actually fulfill.
Recently I read a vintage novel that startled me into reexamining the modern American image of motherhood. Angela Thirkell published “ High Rising ,” a frothy comedy set in an English country village, in 1933. The protagonist is presented as a loving mother. She also finds her youngest son so annoying she considers him “hateful.”
He is obsessed with toy trains and talks about them incessantly—“nothing except sleep appeared to check his valueless conversation.” He’s adorable after bedtime, but during the day she avoids him and breathes a sigh of relief each time he heads back to boarding school. She even started his boarding-school career at an earlier age than his elder brothers’ in hopes the derision of peers would cure his determination to monologue.
The book’s light tone makes the humor so different from what we would find today. We laugh about motherhood too, but we toss around the phrase “bad mom” with the self-conscious bravado of gallows humor.
In contrast, it never occurs to Thirkell’s heroine to feel guilty. She doesn’t seem familiar with the assumption that mothers should feel deeply responsible for their children’s personalities, happiness, and success. She has no drive to prove that she is a “good mom.” The author treats motherhood as if it were no different, no more fraught with social weight, than any of the other human relationships also used as fodder for humor within her book.
This contrast begs the question: why are modern American mothers assumed to be wallowing in guilt over their inadequacies? Why has motherhood joined death and religion as something that can only be joked about carefully ? There are multiple answers, but one goes much deeper than other people’s pictures on Instagram. It has to do with the fear of suffering.
We take it for granted nowadays that the pursuit of happiness is a moral duty, but we define happiness differently than did the founding fathers, who classed it alongside life and liberty. These days we think it is freedom from anything we don’t want . It is the avoidance of suffering. It is the nebulous modern virtue we call “safety.” And of course we extend our desires for happiness to our children. What mom wouldn’t?
A few weeks ago I felt the pressure myself. I hadn’t slept enough that week, and I began to question my children’s future. I’ve brought them into a world that seems uglier by the day.
A man threw a random kid off a balcony at the Mall of America because he wanted to kill someone. Twitter has turned the masses into barbarians. Pornography bedecks billboards everywhere. People go into schools with guns and shoot their peers. Global religious persecution is on the rise , and Christians are the most persecuted group in the world. What right have I to give birth to these beautiful, beloved, precious children if I cannot keep them safe?
The problem with fear of suffering, though, is that it grows like cancer. Catholic writer Thomas Merton put it aptly: “The truth that many people never understand, until it is too late, is that the more you try to avoid suffering, the more you suffer, because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you, in proportion to your fear of being hurt. The one who does most to avoid suffering is, in the end, the one who suffers most: and his suffering comes to him from things so little and so trivial that one can say that it is no longer objective at all. It is his own existence, his own being, that is at once the subject and the very source of his pain, and his very existence and consciousness is his greatest torture.”
I think for many moms, the existence of their children has also become a source of torture. Our guilt goes far deeper than it would if it were merely a response to the pressure to do all the birthing, nursing, organic feeding, tutoring, self-esteem boosting, STEM-teaching, museum-trotting stuff right. It’s existential.
We have swallowed the notion that to give birth to a child is to acquire the responsibility of giving that child happiness, and we wallow in guilt because we know how likely we are to fail. And we actually think our feelings are a fulfillment of our moral duty!
In this we are more influenced than we realize by the cultural repercussions of abortion rhetoric. Popular justifications for abortion appeal to the fear Merton describes. If women are prevented from ending their pregnancies at will, we are told, suffering will increase: the woman will suffer from loss of autonomy , the child will suffer from being unwanted or disabled, and society will suffer from the need to pick up the pieces.
There is a flip side to these beliefs. If we accept that justification for the existence of new life rests philosophically on a woman’s choice, what does that mean when she does choose to have a baby? If her child is her choice , doesn’t that turn him into an extension of her will? Doesn’t it mean she not only can attempt to mold him into the life she envisions, but that she should ?
Not only do we take on the mantle of divine responsibility, we also feel virtuous for beating ourselves up for failing to be God! The truth is, I didn’t “bring my kids into the world.” Humans can end life, but we cannot create it, as women suffering from infertility know well. We don’t have to control our children and their happiness. It is not our duty.
Thirkell’s protagonist may or may not have been a “good mom,” but she can teach us something important: motherhood is a chance to learn humility. Motherhood brings us face to face with weakness.
It can be difficult to conceive a child. It hurts to push a baby out. It is painful to watch our children become acquainted with the fallen nature of the world. We can fight all this. We can turn motherhood into pain and guilt and a false sense of responsibility. Or we can let go, and remember we are not God. Someone else is. Thank God.

Smithsonian Exhibit Offers Glimpses Into Qing Dynasty Empresses’ Private Lives,thefederalist.com,William Newton,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/smithsonan-exhibit-offers-glimpses-qing-dynasty-empresses-private-lives/,"By William Newton May 13, 2019
The Smithsonian’s current exhibition, “ Empresses of China’s Forbidden City, 1644–1912 ,” brings together a wealth of fine and decorative art, costume, and personal objects belonging to the empresses of the Qing Dynasty, the last imperial rulers of China. Most of these items have never left China before, so unless you’re planning to visit Beijing someday this is an extremely rare opportunity to see some truly remarkable survivors of a vanished culture.
Even if, like me, you’re not very knowledgeable about Chinese art, you’ll find this is an astonishing show—rich in beauty and history, extremely well-curated, and leaving the visitor wanting to learn more. In short, “Empresses” does precisely what a truly great art exhibition ought to do, yet rarely manages to achieve.
The Qing Dynasty, which overthrew the preceding Ming Dynasty in the mid-17th century to become the new rulers of China, lasted until the abdication of the Emperor Puyi in 1912. His story may be familiar to you, if you’ve seen director Bernardo Bertolucci’s Best Picture Oscar-winning film “The Last Emperor” (1987). It’s hard not to think back on the movie when you arrive at the entrance to the galleries containing the show, and remember how in the film, the child Puyi was brought through the many halls of the Forbidden City to meet the dying Empress Dowager Cixi and be named her heir. Inside the Forbidden City, from the virtual tour.
The exhibition designers have constructed a Chinese gateway at the entrance to the show, framing an enormous carved screen that sat behind the empress dowager’s throne. A life-sized portrait of the larger-than-life Cixi hangs nearby, and with her intense gaze one can immediately understand why she was such a formidable force in China and international politics for so many decades.
She may have started out in her youth as one of many court concubines, but after the death of the Xianfeng emperor over the next 40-odd years she went on to establish China’s first rail networks, forge greater trade connections with the West, and make attempts at real social and political reform, not always successfully. Empress Dowager Cixi. Katharine A. Carl (1865–1938). China, Qing dynasty, 1903.
Making one’s way from the audience chamber-like first gallery into the next rooms of the exhibition, one is introduced to Chinese imperial splendor slowly and deliberately. There are golden treasures, such as a magnificently gilded processional censor, and the dragon-topped seal of the last empress, as well as formal imperial robes, watercolors illustrating scenes from courtly life, and a fur-trimmed court hat featuring pearls and stacked phoenixes.
On the whole, the first impressions are of hauteur and remoteness, even when broken up by some of the very sentimental calligraphic poems on display, thanks in part to the formal portraiture of these empresses.
There’s a surprising connection to Old Master painting among these images, which I would never have known but for this exhibition. The artist known to the Chinese as Lang Shining was born Giuseppe Castiglione (1688-1766), a Jesuit missionary from a well-to-do family in Milan, who made his way to Beijing and never left.
Having been trained by a professional artist in Italy, he soon became a highly favored imperial court painter and architect, blending elements of Italian Baroque design with traditional Chinese art. He was not the first nor the last Jesuit to serve the Chinese imperial family in this capacity, but his work is exceptional.
The exhibition’s grand portrait of the Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang holding her prayer beads, a work attributed in part to Castiglione, was painted around 1750. However with its flattened surfaces, unusual perspective, and repeating geometric patterns, one could quite easily mistake it for being a work of the Viennese Secessionist movement 150 years later. Official imperial portrait of Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang.
Somewhat more traditional in appearance but no less dynamic is Castiglione’s magnificent painting of the Qianlong emperor riding his horse at a flying gallop accompanied by an attendant. The pair are off in pursuit of deer, and despite the incredible speed at which they are traveling, the emperor has just fired off an arrow, and is reaching backwards to grab another, even as he keeps his eyes on his quarry. The Qianlong Emperor Hunting Deer.
Proceeding through the exhibition, the relative minimalism of the upper floor is abandoned in favor of excess on the lower, while imperial yellow walls give way to ones painted a rich peacock blue. Display cabinets that held perhaps one or two objects in the first part of the show are superseded by cabinets containing multiples of beautiful things: porcelain vases, jade cups, lacquered teaware, bronze mirrors, sumptuous gowns, impossibly ornate shoes, etc. If the first part of the exhibition gives us a sense of what a diplomatic visitor might have seen when paying a visit to the imperial court, the second part gives us an idea of the court’s hidden, interior life.
One object that made a particular impression on me in this more personalized area of the show is a large, circa 1770 panel that covers an entire wall in one of the galleries. It depicts a beautiful young woman, smilingly half-hidden behind a screen, and a charming little boy engaging the viewer with a wave of his hand and an expression of childlike wonder on his face. This is the future Jiaqing emperor, accompanied by his mother the Empress Xiaoyichun, and for me the chance to see and experience this family portrait is reason enough to attend this exhibition.
In the picture, the artist created something that, if I even dare to make the comparison, must be the Qing Dynasty equivalent of “Las Meninas.” Not only is the picture a tour-de-force of trompe l’oeil painting, making it seem as if we could step into this part of the palace ourselves, but it’s almost unbelievably informal after all of the very stiff, face-on imperial portraits that we’ve seen up until this point in the exhibition. This was clearly not a piece meant to be shown to the hoi polloi, but an intimate, family moment, marking a time of innocence, beauty, and prosperity. Detail of Empress Xiaoyichun, consort of Emperor Qianlong, with the future Jiaqing emperor as a child.
As such, it heralds a series of paintings in the exhibition depicting the empresses engaged in more relaxed activities. One shows an older imperial couple playing a board game together, smiling out at us as if one has just won, and we’re being asked to laugh along.
Another shows the Empress Ci’An in her everyday blue dress, relaxing in a garden pavilion. She has put down her simple, woven bamboo fan on the table, and seems to be listening to what we have to say, or perhaps inviting us to come in out of the heat and join her for a chat. Other intimate pictures show imperial ladies at their toilette, or taking a stroll through the gardens with their children, or engaged in moments of private reading and meditation. Portrait of the Empress Dowager Ci’An.
For all the imperial splendor of things like overly embroidered boots or elaborately enameled jars shaped like ducks, I think the real joy of this exhibition doesn’t lie with the gold and jewels, the precious materials and costly accessories that these women used, beautiful as these things unquestionably are. To me, the more intimate paintings depicting everyday life within the imperial palace are the true revelation, or at least, to those like me who know very little about the Chinese imperial system.
Perhaps the greatest strength of this show is in the careful effort to display the balance between public and private. As splendid as the public aspect of their lives may have been, here we are given an opportunity to see women who, for a moment anyway, allow us to enter a private, intriguing world, which while it existed was closed to all but a select few. That is not an opportunity to miss.

"Without Action Now, Drug-Resistant Diseases May Create Pandemics",thefederalist.com,Nicole Fisher,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/drug-resistant-diseases-may-create-pandemics-without-action-now/,"By Nicole Fisher May 13, 2019
Bacteria, viruses, and parasites are growing ever more resistant to the drugs that have been developed to combat them. In fact, this resistance—known as antimicrobial resistance—has surged into a public health nightmare around the world. Annually, at least 700,000 people die from drug-resistant diseases, and that number is expected to increase to 10 million deaths per year by 2050 if nothing is done. At present, the incentives to get something done are so misaligned it’s a frightening possibility.
It hits home more often than we know. In the United States, antimicrobial resistance causes more than 2 million infections and 23,000 deaths per year —the equivalent of a Boeing 747 crashing each week. Just days ago, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York called for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to declare a state of emergency over a fast-spreading outbreak of Candida Auris, a drug-resistant fungus that has infected more than 600 New Yorkers in health centers.
The CDC says “Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest public health challenges of our time.” There is no slowdown in sight, as more and more antibiotics lose their effectiveness each year. So why aren’t more pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, medical centers, and government agencies doing something about the growing crisis? Unlike other areas of health care, why are there no races for cures, no movie-star endorsements, or cute symbols to pin on clothing about antimicrobial resistance? The answer includes an array of problems from lack of awareness, both among patients and clinicians, as well as funding and incentives to do research.
Because of this growing emergency, the United Nations created the Interagency Coordinating Group on Antimicrobial Resistance , and published a report with international agencies and experts noting that without immediate global action, the crisis of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses could lead to an economic catastrophe as bad as the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, and by 2030 could force as many as 24 million people into poverty. Antimicrobial Resistance Is a Pervasive Problem
Hospitals are a root cause of breeding antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Thus, many blame the overuse of antimicrobials and antifungals as a means of increasing resistance. But because antimicrobials vary from antibiotics to antivirals to antifungals and antimalarials, understanding what they do can be hard for any layperson or even medical professional. Additionally, the broad range of antimicrobials makes prescribing them incorrectly very easy for health providers.
Further, doctors are incentivized to use the cheapest generic drugs available within the hospital, and it is the overuse of these drugs that drives increased resistance. Newer, branded drugs cost more , are less known, and are not readily available, despite having a better chance of effectively treating a resistant infection. Therefore, it’s not easy for providers or patients to learn about the impact—or lack thereof—of those drugs currently prescribed. Add in that many antimicrobials are used on plants and animals in our global agriculture practices, and we’re exposed in ways that transverse the health care system.
Even more frightening than exposure are the major challenges associated with a lack of research and development (R&D) in pharmaceutical pipelines, since the private sector is financially disincentivized to create new antibiotics. Think about how quickly things mutate and how much it costs to keep up (in addition to normal R&D costs), and it’s easy to see why there isn’t financial motivation for large pharma companies to invest in antimicrobials.
The predicament is further exacerbated by extreme attrition in R&D, as well as big pharma exiting from the market. In fact, only six of the top 50 drug companies in the world are still developing antimicrobials. That means globally we’re left with primarily newer and smaller pharma companies in the space.
At present, it is projected that 80 percent of antimicrobial products in development are being created by small companies. Because antibiotics have a very slow commercial uptake, they typically don’t achieve meaningful revenue until just before the expiration of their patent. Rapid resistance can also result in discontinuing sales before peak revenues are achieved—which to date has meant bankruptcy for a lot of these smaller companies. Policymakers and Pharma Can Lead the Way
Clearly, the models for creating and distributing antimicrobials, and market failures that have led us to this status quo, have to change—and quickly. During the recent annual Milken Institute global conference there was growing discussion about extending drug exclusivity for drug makers.
This means that instead of the present five-year market exclusivity for with developing a new chemical, companies could get longer patents to help ensure that they can see the products recoup some of the R&D costs. This initial five-year exclusivity was a great start from the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now (GAIN) Act in 2012, which created an expedited pathway for approval of antimicrobials.
This could be a necessary step, not only so pharmaceutical researchers don’t file bankruptcy but also to give working drugs longer shelf lives. That’s because of the catch-22 in the antimicrobial world: the less a drug is administered, and to the fewest people (who most desperately need it), the more effective it will be. So here in the United States, more work like the Reinvigorating Antibiotic and Diagnostic Innovation (READI) Act needs to move forward, providing tax credits for clinical testing expenses for qualified infectious disease drugs and rapid-diagnostic tests.
But this catch-22 goes against everything in the normal drug development framework. And true creativity is not often incentivized in R&D. So the real incentives need not come from government, but from the pharma companies—big and small—and their partner organizations.
Public-private partnerships are one way to potentially offset the great risk associated with this kind of research. Medical professionals across the world also have to get better at understanding the implications of their dissemination of antimicrobials, before it’s too late.

Why ABC Made A Mistake In Canceling ‘Speechless’,thefederalist.com,Whitney Blake,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/abc-made-mistake-canceling-speechless/,"By Whitney Blake May 13, 2019
Now is the time for season finales and anxiously awaiting TV networks’ decisions of which shows are continuing, and which are getting the axe.
ABC’s “Speechless” falls into the latter category. ABC execs, you don’t know what a terrible mistake you made, and that makes me doubt you absorbed the lessons the show taught everyone.
“Speechless” is unique in so many ways. There are countless shows in the following categories: medical, legal, crime, first responder, mysteries, science fiction, comic books, reality TV, game shows, sitcoms, and then just plain weird, creepy thrillers.
You know what doesn’t fit into any of those categories? “Speechless.” For those of you not familiar with the show starring Minnie Driver and John Ross Bowie, it is about the DiMeos, whose eldest child J.J. has cerebral palsy. Cedric Yarbrough becomes J.J.’s aide and “voice,” as J.J. is non-verbal.
It is the first show I know of that features an actor, Micah Fowler, who actually has the disability or disease his character shares — a simple concept that, in the era of Me Too, #TimesUp, and all the other “hashtag” movements we’ve seen lately is somehow lost on the rest of Hollywood.
The show is a wholesome family show, a rarity in itself, and a realistic portrayal of the challenges a family faces when a member has a disability, but it is not morose or depressing. It strikes just the right balance: it adds levity and humor; it has tender, sensitive, and heartwarming moments; but it is not glamorous and does not romanticize disabilities and diseases.
It tackles serious issues like a mother navigating byzantine, bureaucratic red tape from a public school district to advocate for the care her child needs; two younger siblings feeling left out sometimes, but still wanting to have discussions about what they can do for their older brother as they all come of age; and how someone with a disability feels he is a burden to his family, no matter how supportive they are, just to name a few. Then the next scene will be about typical sibling fights, pranks, teenage crushes, or Maya, Minnie Driver’s character, in full-blown helicopter parenting mode.
“Speechless” educates the public on issues that people without disabilities have no idea about and profoundly affect people with disabilities every single day. Access into any building, like walking up a few steps and opening a door, for example, is something most able-bodied people don’t think twice about. Ditto for public restrooms, other people’s homes, restaurants, various other venues, and especially airplane travel.
The show discourages “ inspiration porn ” and exposes ableist attitudes, but in a non-sanctimonious fashion that is often light-hearted, yet thought-provoking. J.J. doesn’t want any special treatment and is furious when he wins an award for his passion, film-making, when he finds out it is in a special category for people with disabilities. He wants to win on the merits of his talent, and he’s delighted when he is recognized for his short film by a much smaller organization that had no idea he is in a wheelchair or has cerebral palsy.
The other TV series I’ve seen somehow manage to take subtle or overt political digs in every episode, as if it’s a contest to see how many hot-button issues can be crammed into one 20- or 40-minute slot. “Speechless” is not one of those shows either.
Ultimately, “Speechless” demonstrates what is truly important in all families — unconditional love and sacrifice. It documents joyous milestones, big and small, such as J.J.’s high school graduation and college acceptances, as well a family coming together during tough times and disappointments.
In the United States, the number of special-needs children is increasing , whether it be from more accurate diagnoses , advanced neonatal care, allowing premature babies to survive at a higher rate, and various other factors . “Speechless” gives a voice to all those families, and not just families dealing with cerebral palsy.
My cousin is autistic, and I have witnessed my aunt and uncle come together to do everything they can to care for and protect him — helping him express himself back when doctors did not know much about autism and told them he may never speak, which he has learned with great effort; battling all the bureaucracy with public schools; my aunt stressing over every detail and my uncle being the calming presence; and my youngest cousin including him in everything, and, in many ways, being both the oldest and youngest sibling in their family.
I have a rare neuromuscular disease diagnosed in adulthood that has become disabling, and I now use a wheelchair. I know the endless cycle of doctors’ appointments, hospital visits, tests, treatments, along with medical advocacy, phone calls to doctors’ staff, and medical records-keeping (and that’s just the tip of the iceberg).
I briefly met Fowler and his older sister Kelsey, also an actor, earlier this month at an Abilities Expo, basically a trade show for consumers with a variety of disabilities. They were both lovely, gracious, and down to earth.
Looking around the expo was a little bit heartbreaking, though. Seeing people of all ages with so many disabilities all concentrated in one convention center was a bit of a jarring experience, especially for my parents. The Abilities Expo has plenty of informative sessions and fun activities, such as adaptive sports, and it is great to see all the technological advances being made to assist people with disabilities of all kinds.
For me it is like putting lipstick on a pig. It is not fun to try out power wheelchairs, knowing I’ll get fitted for one as my disease progresses and my custom manual chair will no longer suffice. But “Speechless” validates, educates, encourages, and provides humor to a whole fan base, myself included. Among other influences, it helped me come to terms with the fact that I’m disabled.
Apparently Constance Wu, star of “Fresh Off the Boat” and the movie “Crazy Rich Asians” is not happy ABC renewed her show. She backtracked on Twitter, but everyone has the screenshots of her original tweets.
As an Asian-American and a person with a disability, I say ABC should ditch her show, renew “Speechless,” and put it in a decent time slot instead of Friday night, so it gets higher ratings. That’s on ABC, not on the show.
Unlike most sitcoms, which are mindless fluff, “Speechless” is in a class all by itself, with talented actors, writers, and directors who are making a substantial contribution to society. If ABC is not smart enough to see this, hopefully the plethora of other networks and streaming services will. #SaveSpeechless Whitney Blake is a journalist in Washington, DC.

"AOC, Bernie Sanders Want Post Office To Be A ‘Public Option’ For Banking",thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/13/aoc-bernie-sanders-want-post-office-public-option-banking/,"By Warren Henry May 13, 2019
It was probably inevitable that democratic socialists Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) would team up to co-sponsor a piece of legislation—and that it would be a bad idea. Few might have guessed that idea would be to make the U.S. Postal Service a “public option” for banking. . @RepAOC ""We should have a not-for-profit public option for basic banking services, and we should be piloting these projects through the @USPS "" #postalbanking pic.twitter.com/dobyU4hdT2

Congress already created a postal banking system in 1911, another time when socialism and populism were abroad in America. In total fairness, after the Panic of 1907, a system backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government probably looked like a less bad idea. And post offices were the outposts of the federal government before we had a truly national economy or an administrative state via the New Deal.
But then Congress created the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which in theory removed much of the rationale for postal banking. In practice, after World War II, competition from private banks, government bonds, and nonprofit credit unions rendered postal banking moribund; the system was phased out starting in 1966.
Today, the U.S. Postal Service is in dire financial straits , losing $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2018. That loss was 44 percent larger than in 2017, despite making $1 billion more in revenue. Many Americans would rate the quality of postal service on a par with their state’s department of motor vehicles, perhaps lower.
Accordingly, when Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie call for a “public option” in banking, it is useful to consider what this term meant when the left was calling for a “public option” in the context of Obamacare. That proposal was a recipe for unfair competition to eventually drive private insurers out of business. Given the history of postal banking in America and the decline of the Postal Service since, creating a “public option” for banking would likely require giving the government unfair advantages.
Moreover, less than a decade after passing Obamacare, prominent Democrats—led largely by Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie—are already calling for a single-payer health-care system. When the socialists are pushing for a “public option” again, it looks like a prelude to nationalization of the financial sector.
However, these are not the only reasons Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders came up with this harebrained idea. Rather, postal banking would be a backstop to the potential effects of their proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 15 percent . The current median credit card interest rate in 17.73 percent; for those with low credit scores, the average is about 25 percent.
As Peter Suderman observes at Reason, one likely effect of the socialists’ proposal is credit card issuers cutting off poorer people with lower credit scores, although poorer people generally understand their finances and often rely on high-interest financing for emergencies. Suderman also notes that when options like payday lending go away, pawn shops proliferate. He could have added that withdrawing access to high-rate credit products can result in higher rates of bounced checks and personal bankruptcies .
Indeed, if credit card issuers decided to continue serving poor credit risks at artificially low rates to keep the socialists happy, one likely result would be more spending by credit risks, eventually resulting in increased bankruptcies. Credit card companies are already raising rates and lowering credit limits for riskier customers in anticipation of the next economic downturn.
In contrast, the socialists may not have considered that credit card debt has been securitized as mortgage-backed securities have been, and that a wave of credit card defaults would have a ripple effect throughout the banking system and the larger economy. These synthetic products are more regulated than they were before the financial panic of 2008, but no one should want to stress-test the limits of the current system.
Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie may feel free to be this ignorant and irresponsible, given that their bill would almost certainly die in the Republican-controlled Senate. The interesting question is whether it would pass in the House.
The Democratic caucus already has internal friction between the progressives and the moderates. The latter may not be keen to support a proposal dreamed up by America’s two most prominent socialists, particularly when one is running for president.
On the other hand, the House Financial Services Committee, chaired by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), is considering a national 36 percent annual percentage rate cap aimed at payday loans. If advancing that bill means attacking an African-American entrepreneur for being racist , Democrats will do that too. Similar legislation is being considered in California .
Given the Democrats’ current leftward lurch, it is not surprising that they would attack the financial sector. It may even scare companies into filling Democratic campaign coffers, though this would be what the kids call “bad optics.”
These proposals, if they ever became law, would likely hurt the “ordinary people” Sanders says he is paternalistically hoping to “protect,” and possibly threaten the larger financial system. Then again, perhaps the philosophy here is that of Russian socialist-populist Nikolay Chernyshevsky: “the worse, the better.” Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois.

YouTube Beauty Influencer World Erupts Over Gummy Vitamins Scandal,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/14/youtube-beauty-influencer-world-erupts-over-gummy-vitamins-scandal/,"May 14, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
The 19-year-old James Charles is one of the biggest names in the world of makeup and beauty influencers. But after a fellow YouTuber and former mentor of Charles, Tati Westbrook, posted a video accusing him inappropriate sexual behavior and personal attacks against her, Charles has rapidly lost millions of followers over the past three days.
Charles started his makeup YouTube channel when he was 16, and was thrust into the national spotlight at age 17 when he became the first male brand ambassador for CoverGirl. Since then, Charles has been featured in Vogue , attended the Met Gala, collaborated with Kylie Jenner , and created his own makeup line.

A post shared by COVERGIRL (@covergirl) on Oct 11, 2016 at 7:03am PDT
He has more than 15 million followers on Instagram, and the apology video he posted on Friday has more than 35 million views and counting. Cable news shows like Rachel Maddow and Sean Hannity get around 3 million viewers on a good night, and their YouTube videos average around 200,000 views. Of course, the variance in YouTube views is due to 12- to 14-year-olds, who make up a majority of Charles’ audience.
Charles has endured his share of social media scandals over the course of his influencer career, but none like the tectonic backlash he has received over the feud with the 37-year-old Westbrook. Charles has often claimed Westbrook was the reason he got into makeup. She took him under his wing and even flew him out to do her wedding makeup.
Things first got heated last month at Coachella when Charles posted an endorsement for Sugar Bear Hair gummy vitamins, the supplements seen all over Instagram and often promoted by Kim Kardashian. Sugar Bear Hair is a direct competitor of Westbrook’s vitamin company, Halo Beauty.
Charles’ Instagram post for Sugar Bear Hair included an affiliate link to buy their melatonin product, and Westbrook quickly responded with her own Instagram post saying she had been “betrayed” by someone. Charles responded with another Instagram story apologizing to Westbrook, saying she has been like a “mother” to him, and claiming that he did not receive any money for the post.
Countless YouTube channels known as “drama accounts” stirred up rumors and speculations about their relationship until May 4, when another prominent makeup artist, Gabriel Zamora, posted a video accusing Westbrook of being “immature” and having a “transactional” relationship with Charles.
On May 10, Westbrook published her own 45-minute video sharing details of their relationship and how she and her husband helped launch Charles’ career. The video, which now has more than 36 million views, also claims Charles is “manipulative” and has sexually harassed straight men who weren’t interested in him.
Westbrook also details conversations she witnessed with Charles and his parents, including discussing sexual acts with men, and a fight with his dad in which Charles claimed every man “is a little bit gay.”
Westbrook also explained how this was more than just doing a business transaction with a competitor. She claimed that Charles has previously declined to promote her company’s supplements on his channels because of his young, impressionable audience.
Charles responded with his own video on Friday, apologizing to Westbrook and addressing the allegations she made.
“A lot of most of my career over the last two years has been about me making mistakes and trying to learn and grow from them,” Charles said. “And I haven’t always done the best job of that. I can admit that, but I have always tried … I wish I could say this is the last time that I make a mistake, but it won’t be.”
According to Cosmopolitan , a number of celebrities have unfollowed Charles, including the Kardashians, Jenners, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, and Shawn Mendes (to whom Charles has also previously apologized for making unwanted advances).
In a social media universe where sponsored posts are abounding and no longer reserved for users with the largest followings, the drama over a single gummy vitamin affiliate link seems contrived, if not silly. But considering the millions of dollars that YouTubers are earning from their videos and brand contracts, one friend betraying another for a hefty payout is gross. And if YouTube celebrities are building fanbases and salaries comparable to other members of the L.A. elite, then the Me Too exposes sweeping Hollywood should be fair game for the enormous, and growing, beauty industry too.

Rashida Tlaib Is Pushing A Terrorist Narrative About Israel,thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/14/rashida-tlaib-is-pushing-a-terrorist-narrative-about-israel/,"By John Daniel Davidson May 14, 2019
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, along with 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, have accused Republicans of taking Tlaib’s comments about the Holocaust “out of context.” The problem is, when you put Tlaib’s remarks in the proper context, they’re far worse.
The most generous possible reading of Tlaib is that, in a discussion about why she opposes a two-state solution, she was trying to credit Palestinians for providing Jews a “safe haven,” and saying she’s proud of that—not just proud, but that it gives her a “calming feeling,” because at least her Palestinian ancestors tried to help.
The problem with such a reading is that as matter of history, it’s simply untrue, even laughable, as the Washington Examiner’s Philip Klein notes in a thorough fisking and my colleague David Harsanyi argues here . (The grand mufti of Jerusalem during World War II was a Nazi collaborator, for crying out loud.)
But no one really believes Tlaib was trying to argue that Palestinians gave Jews safe haven after the Holocaust. The Democratic congresswoman from Michigan can’t be wholly ignorant of the history of the modern Middle East, and especially the role Arabs played before, during, and after the Holocaust. So far from offering Jews a safe haven, Palestinian Arabs rejected the United Nation’s partition plan in 1947, surrounded Jewish villages, cut off their food and water, and started massacring them.
Like everyone else, Tlaib knows this. She also knows she can’t give her Palestinian forebears credit for helping the Jews while also casting them as victims of Jewish predation. By trying to have it both ways, Tlaib was actually doing something more subtle and insidious than historical revisionism with these remarks: she was mixing western and terrorist narratives about the creation of Israel.
Tlaib said, “I love the fact that it was my ancestors that provided that [a safe haven for the Jews]… But they did it in a way that took their human dignity away and it was forced on them.” The idea that the Jews took the “human dignity” of Palestinians, stole “their land,” and wiped out their “existence” is of course what Palestinian leaders like Yasser Arafat and terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah have always maintained. It is the controlling narrative of their cause.
It’s why Hamas calls for the destruction of Israel under its rallying cry, “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” It’s why Hezbollah ambushes Israeli soldiers. It’s why Arafat walked away from Camp David in 2000 and launched the Second Intifada, which killed a thousand Israelis over the next three years. Unlike Omar, Tlaib Knows Exactly What She’s Saying
This isn’t the first time Tlaib has adopted the terrorist narrative about Israel. When Hamas militants in Gaza launched hundreds of rockets and mortars into Israel earlier this month, and Israel responded with airstrikes , Tlaib accused Israel of targeting “Palestinian children and families.” When will the world stop dehumanizing our Palestinian people who just want to be free? Headlines like this & framing it in this way just feeds into the continued lack of responsibility on Israel who unjustly oppress & target Palestinian children and families. #FreePalestine https://t.co/p3X3j8WtwM
— Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) May 5, 2019
Another way of putting it is that Tlaib thinks Israeli self-defense is terrorism, which has always been the justification for violence against Jews in the Middle East.
Her choice of words here isn’t accidental, just as her commentary on the Holocaust wasn’t as entirely as incoherent as it seemed (the fantastical version of history notwithstanding). The narrative that Israel is unjustly “occupying” Palestine and “oppressing” the Palestinians is commonplace on American college campuses no less than among the Justice Democrats in Congress. It’s the basis of the boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement that a number of left-wing Democrats, including Tlaib and Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, support.
One aspect of this narrative, best articulated in Columbia University historian Rashid Khalidi’s book, “Iron Cage,” is the notion that Palestinians were wrong to have accommodated Jews in the decades leading up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War—what the Palestinians call al nakba , the “catastrophe”—and that they should have fought them instead. This is what Tlaib seems to be referring to when she says the Palestinians “lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways… all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews.”
Much has been made of Omar’s anti-Semitic remarks that almost drew a formal censure from Democratic leaders in the House earlier this year. But Tlaib’s anti-Semitism is much more dangerous than Omar’s. Whereas Omar seems to be repeating left-wing shibboleths without fully understanding what she’s saying, resulting in her having to issue multiple apologies, Tlaib knows exactly what she’s saying.
That’s why she’s doubled down on her Holocaust comments instead of issuing an apology or trying to clarify what she means. In this case, a lack of clarity serves her purpose well. It allows her, no less than Democratic leaders, to deflect criticism by claiming her words are being taken “out of context” while couching her views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in an incoherent historical commentary.
But the proper context for these remarks is only too obvious, and it leads to the equally obvious conclusion that Tlaib’s views on Israel more or less align with those of Hamas and Hezbollah, groups that also oppose a two-state solution. "
Milano's Sex Strike Reinforces Conservatives' View Of The Sex Market,thefederalist.com,The Sexes,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/14/alyssa-milanos-sex-strike-reinforces-conservatives-view-sex-market/,"By Libby Emmons May 14, 2019
Alyssa Milano, an actress who has been a valiant fighter for progressive causes, has taken a decidedly conservative view with her recent demand for American women to undertake a “ sex strike. ” The idea is that women ought not to risk pregnancy until they have “legal control” over their bodies.
This has previously been a tune that only Christian conservative women have been singing, and it is somewhat ironic that Milano is taking up the banner for women to practice abstinence if they don’t want to get pregnant. It’s almost as though the ideas make common sense. Go figure.
Probably Milano wasn’t aware that the ideas she was suggesting were aligned with the conservative Christian women’s movement, or she may not have gone on the record as endorsing the view that women shouldn’t screw if they’re not up for the consequences. Sex Strikes, Modern and Ancient
Milano is not the first American celebrity in recent years to call for women to boycott sex until women’s bodies and rights are fully respected. In an interview with Marie Claire in 2017, Janelle Monáe advocated for women to go on a sex strike, saying that “people need to start respecting the vagina.”
Outside of the United States, sex strikes have been effective. But while those—like the successful strike in Aristophanes’“Lysistrata”—were in demand for peace from either ongoing war, or gang violence, neither Milano nor Monáe’s call have any definable program.
Respect for the vagina and a demand for women to have legal control over their bodies are not particularly measurable results. Body parts, in and of themselves, are not something for which respect is warranted. Does anyone respect the penis? Is that something we’re supposed to do also?
And in terms of Milano’s call for women to have legal control over their bodies, there is a distinct difference between autonomy in action and autonomy from consequences. There is no autonomy from consequences. How people behave with their bodies affects those bodies, including the potential for pregnancy.
Additionally, Milano does not live in a state with new abortion restrictions, such as Georgia and Ohio. Does she imagine that a sex strike in New York or California, where there are so many more progressive women who might heed her call, would have any great effect on the voters in other states? Same Response to Old Idea
Lysistrata, the title character in Aristophanes’ ancient comedy, undertakes a similar plan. She gathers together the women from all sides of the fighting, both Spartan and Athenian, in hopes that, through extreme measures, the women can succeed in peace where their warring menfolk have failed.
Lysistrata: Ladies, if we want to force our husbands to make peace, we must give up- [She hesitates.]
Calonice: What must we give up? Go on … If need be, we’ll lay down our lives for it.
Lysistrata: Very well then. We must give up sex. [Strong murmurs of disapproval, shaking of heads, etc…] Why are you turning away from me? Where are you going? What’s all this pursing of lips and shaking of heads mean? You’re all going pale—I can see tears! Will you do it or won’t you? Answer!
Myrrhine: I won’t do it. Better to let the war go on.
Calonice: I won’t do it either. Let the war go on … I’ll walk through the fire, or anything—but give up sex, never! Lysistrata, darling, there’s just nothing like it.
Such was the response to Milano’s call for a sex strike as a means of changing the recently passed “heartbeat law” in Georgia. She tweeted: “Our reproductive rights are being erased. Until women have legal control over our own bodies we just cannot risk pregnancy. JOIN ME by not having sex until we get bodily autonomy back. I’m calling for a #SexStrike . Pass it on.”
On that same thread, rife with pushback, she states “Be super careful. Sex is extremely dangerous for women. No matter who it’s with.” Women Want Sex, Too
The comments in response to this missive were much like those of the women of Aristophanes’ comedy, who wanted nothing more than peace, unless that meant no sex. That is, of course, the other problem with Milano’s drive for a sex strike. Many women aren’t ashamed anymore to admit that they want sex as much as men do.
The same contemporary, progressive women who are the target of Milano’s tweet are the ones who have been attempting to reverse the idea that men are the only ones interested in sex. They don’t want to be the gatekeepers of sex, but equal and willing participants. For these women to withhold it for political reasons would be an admission of the anti-feminist idea that men are after sex, and it’s up to women to be chased and to grant access based not on desire, attraction, love, or any of those things, but upon political worthiness. Weird.
In one fell swoop, Milano has embraced conservative ideas about traditional sex roles and considering the consequences of sex before engaging in it. She has also indulged in the kind of fear tactics that keep men and women in contemporary society from trusting one another, with her claim that “sex is extremely dangerous for women.” If sex is that scary, it’s no wonder Milano thinks women should avoid it. If women were to take up this sex strike, eschewing pregnancy like so many birth strikers, there would be far fewer abortions anyway.
In advocating for this revolutionary concept of women withholding sex from men in order to attain bodily autonomy, Milano has stumbled backwards into the realm of Christianity. The Christian perspective posits that the way for women to attain bodily autonomy is to not give away sex outside of marriage, to not risk pregnancy unless they have a loving partner, and to be aware of the dangers of ignoring the consequences of sexual activity outside of committed relationships.
Milano probably had a much more female-forward concept in mind, but what she doesn’t realize is that, with regard to safeguarding their sexual intentions, females have been forward for centuries.

"Seth Meyers, Useful Idiot",thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/14/seth-meyers-useful-idiot/,"May 14, 2019 By David Harsanyi
After listening to Seth Meyers run interference for Rep. Ilhan Omar last week, an exasperated Meghan McCain asked him: “Are you her publicist? Are you her press person?” Perhaps the more pertinent question is, who else do you represent?
Because on the same day Rep. Rashida Tlaib was complaining (via her 500,000-follower Twitter account) that powerful forces were “ trying to silence ” her, the freshman representative also appeared on NBC’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”
Tlaib’s presence on “Late Night” is unsurprising, as the show has become something of a safe haven for unaccomplished freshman reps with very specific opinions about a certain ethnicity. The fact that Meyers, like most of his colleagues, shills for Democrats isn’t particularly noteworthy. What is notable, however, is that the comedian provides someone like Tlaib with a giant platform to spread a despicable historical lie.
“You were talking about the tragedy of the Holocaust and the words you used was it gave you a ‘calming feeling’ because you were happy that it became a safe haven, Palestine became a safe haven for the Jewish people,” Meyers said, framing Tlaib’s comments in the most dishonest way imaginable. “Some criticized the use of ‘calming feeling.’ You have said that it was taken out of context. I want to give you a chance to provide some context.”
No, most people criticized Tlaib for repeating the myth that Palestinians, who had in reality aligned themselves with Nazis to kill Jews in Europe, worked to keep Jews in concentration camps and massacred them in pogroms, “provided” Jews a safe haven. Yet Tlaib repeated this same fiction on national television, without even the slightest pushback from our truth-seeking host.
“You know, the tragedy of the Holocaust—I mean, the reason why Israel was created was to create a safe haven for Jews around the world and there is something, in many ways, beautiful about, that my ancestors—many had died or had to give up their livelihood, their human dignity to provide a safe haven for Jews in our world. And that is something I wanted to recognize and kind of honor in some sort of way,” Tlaib said.
None of this true. Now, I assume Meyers knows as much about early Zionist history as a cucumber, but if you’re going to take on big topics you have a responsibility to bone up or your audience might be misled. It could have been interesting, for example, to learn why Tlaib thinks Americans should “honor” those who tried to kill Jews but failed. Really if you attempt to destroy a people, and you lose the ensuing war, you’re not “sacrificing” anything, you’ve merely made a bad choice.
It’s not as if Tlaib hides her disdain for a Jewish safe haven. The folks Tlaib wanted us to honor for Holocaust Remembrance Day refer to the formation of a Jewish homeland as al-Nakba, or “Day of the Catastrophe,” not “Safe Haven Day for the Jews.” Her stated political position is in opposition to a Jewish state .
Meyers’ audience might not be aware of any of this, since the host employs the popular euphemism “critical of Israel” as a stand-in for “destroy the Jewish state.”
It’s also worth noting ( and covered in more detail here ) that Palestinians didn’t have to lose their livelihoods—in fact, Jews brought with them unprecedented economic opportunity—or their dignity. That was a choice. Palestinians were offered more rights by the Zionists than any Arab ruler had ever bestowed on them, then or now.
In any event, a simpering Meyers insinuated, as he did with Omar, that these obnoxious statements are really just suffering from a contextual problems. By throwing out a softball “what did you really mean” query, Meyers intimates to his audience, who are probably largely ignorant of the broader debate, that Tlaib has been being victimized. And really, that’s what this is all about.
In his interview with McCain, Meyers lectured “The View” host on how she needed to be more “careful” about her language when criticizing a Muslim woman like Omar, who has repeated contended that American Jews are money-driven shills for a foreign power. But Tlaib, a person “calmed” by the Holocaust, needn’t be cautioned about her rhetoric, apparently? That is weird.
Instead, Meyers let Tlaib mock people who comprehend history far better than she does, without any pushback. “I got a text message from a friend who’s like, ‘Hey, next time, you know, really clarify,” she told Meyers. “Maybe talk like a fourth grader because maybe the racist idiots would understand you better.’”
Meyers isn’t alone, of course. In the past two days, The Washington Post, for example, has run four articles defending Tlaib without once being able to muster the strength to write a single line about how her central thesis is rubbish. A string of scholars have noted that Tlaib is making things up or, at best, deeply ignorant. Even CNN was forced to acknowledge that she was defending Nazi collaborators.
Meyers, on the other hand, once again acted as a PR rep. Now I just wonder if he knows that Valerie Plame is looking for a publicist."
Pompeo-Putin Meeting Highlights Reversal Of Obama’s Russia Failures,thefederalist.com,Rebeccah Heinrichs,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/14/mike-pompeos-meeting-with-putin-highlights-trumps-reversal-of-obamas-russia-failures/,"By Rebeccah Heinrichs May 14, 2019
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is meeting with Vladimir Putin today at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and the Russian Federation. The Robert Mueller investigation had a deleterious effect, not primarily on U.S.-Russian relations but on analysts’ ability to see what is plainly before their eyes. Despite the hysterical conspiracy theory that the American president was a Russian stooge, the Trump administration has pursued a policy agenda that both the Russians and Democrats have long opposed.
For instance, the United States has returned to a policy of pressuring the Islamic Republic of Iran, a Russian ally, rather than empowering it as the Obama administration and the Russian government had sought. The Trump administration rightly withdrew the United States from the Iran deal, a deal so contrary to U.S. interests the Obama administration avoided the Senate treaty process altogether, and has unleashed punishing sanctions.
Rather than remaining relatively quiet when the Iranian people protest under the weight of the oppressive regime, the Trump administration has made it clear that the United States supports the Iranian people’s desire for change—the ones hurt the worst by the regime’s cruelty towards minorities and women and the regime’s decision to eschew efforts to bolster its economy in order to fund terrorist proxies Hamas and Hezbollah, the Assad regime, and the Houthis in Yemen.
The Trump administration, unsatisfied with remaining party to the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) when the Russians have long been openly violating it, rallied the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—an alliance whose members have varied views and relationships with the Russian Bear—to call out Russia’s violations with one voice, and support the U.S. intent to stop abiding by the treaty and, absent Russia’s return to compliance, abrogate it.
Additionally, the Trump administration’s refusal to simply extend the nuclear arms control treaty New START, negotiated by the Obama administration, is wise. The treaty is problematic in several areas, so trying to secure improvements makes a great deal of sense.
The tepid U.S. response towards Russia’s aggression and continued provocations in the Black Sea region ended with President Trump’s election (although I’d like to see an even more muscular response with willing allies in the region to deter further aggression.) In December 2017 Washington approved two major arms sales to Kiev. Then in April 2018 Washington delivered much-needed anti-tank missiles.
The United States has also trained Ukrainian military units alongside Canadians, Poles, and Lithuanians. To bolster deterrence, the United States has closely cooperated with Poland including by executing the largest arms deal in Poland’s history that included the highly effective Patriot missile defense system.
The clear demonstration of alliance solidarity by selling Poland Patriots came on the heels of the United States expelling 100 Russian “diplomats” from the United States in response to the abhorrent Russian government-sponsored attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on United Kingdom soil using nerve agent Novichok.
The list goes on, from calling out Russia’s backing of the illegitimate occupation of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, to modernizing the U.S. nuclear deterrent and adapting it to beef up our deterrent against Russia aggression, to outlining the Russian threat in a report on the U.S. missile defense strategy, to supporting the Three Seas Initiative and opposing Nord Stream 2 to undercut Russia’s ability to use energy as a political weapon.
Pompeo has a tall order: make clear that the United States will continue to pursue its interests, outline areas on which the United Sates is unwilling to negotiate, and find any possible issue in which the two nations can cooperate. On this, the most important issue is China. As the United States seeks to redirect its primary focus on thwarting a rising China, it would behoove us to ensure Russia, the junior partner in the China-Russia partnership, isn’t making our efforts more challenging.
Critics will no doubt claim a display of civility in front of cameras between the two leaders is further “proof” of a soft spot for the Russians. It’s delusional. If the United States continues to unapologetically pursue its interests, even in areas Russia opposes, while creating better diplomatic ties based on a dispassionate desire to cooperate where we can and by providing better clarity of our intent, it would be a dramatic improvement for U.S. and ally security.

The Fight Over Abortion Is Now Total War,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/15/the-fight-over-abortion-is-now-total-war/,"May 15, 2019 By David Marcus
Since the day that Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, abortion has been a hot button political topic in the United States. But while it is an emotional issue that has always had inflamed rhetoric surrounding it, over the past 46 years, the abortion question has existed in a kind of stalemate or détente. Very little, including the polling numbers on how many people are pro-choice or pro-life, has changed.
On the right, given the composition of the Supreme Court during that time, and the unlikelihood of Roe being overturned, it has been mostly a fight around the edges of the issue. Pro-lifers have sought to cap abortions at early periods in pregnancy, or advocated for parental notification, but there was no clear path to actually making all abortions illegal.
On the left, secure as they also once were in Roe , the attitude for most of that time had been that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. Abortion was not something to be celebrated, but rather a sad and dire thing only to be used in extreme and necessary circumstances.
Today, none of this is true anymore. Pro-lifers for the first time feel that it is possible that the Supreme Court could overturn Roe and allow states to ban abortion, and for abortion advocates, it has been become something to celebrate, to shout, and to be considered an unfettered good.
As a result of these changes, we have seen bills from both sides in state legislatures that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. In New York, state lawmakers passed a bill that would allow for abortion up to birth, and arguably, make allowances for finishing the job if a botched abortion produces a live baby. Meanwhile, Virginia lawmakers floated a similar bill that was then defeated.
Meanwhile, in Georgia, a new law would effectively ban abortion after as little as six weeks and, in Alabama, legislation was passed this week that would basically ban abortion entirely (though it has yet to be signed by Governor Kay Ivey). The détente which has held for 50 years is gone and the fight over abortion has become a total war. What has always been a testy battle in American politics is poised to become very ugly, very fast.
Because it seemed for so long like nothing would ever really change much regarding abortion, the underlying question of whether it is the taking of a human life has been somewhat academic. By granting constitutional protection to abortion, the Court made it a moot point if abortion is murder, because it is first and foremost a right. But should that change, either under the current Court or perhaps a future Court with more Trump-appointed justices, the entire battlefield will shift and that central question will be front and center.
Pro-abortion forces have made it perfectly clear how they plan to respond to this. With flat-out denials that a fetus is a human being at all, with increasingly less restrictive abortion laws, and with campaigns that encourage this choice for women as liberating and empowering. There are no important voices on the current left or in the Democratic Party who will challenge any of this. It will be a united front dedicating to expanding abortion access and abortion itself as widely as possible.
For Republicans and other conservatives, the situation is more fraught. There are, after all, some on the right who support access to abortion, and as a political matter, many in the GOP may well be scared about how such strict measures as Alabama’s will play with suburban women voters, viewed as essential in the presidential and congressional elections of 2020.
But in order to be effective, pro-life forces must not be too tame. They must not seek middle ground with abortion advocates who have no interest in compromise. Instead, they must finally and once and for all stake their claim that abortion is the killing of a child and must be treated as such. The pro-life movement doesn’t need gimmicks and costumes; it just needs the truth, that killing babies is wrong.
It can be scary to suddenly have the opportunity to achieve something once thought impossible, and it may be that the current Court is disinclined to overturn Roe , but for the first time, it does seem possible. Saving millions of innocent lives is not some far away dream, but a tangible and real opportunity.
For the pro-life movement, now is the time to speak with a unified voice, to make it known that life is better than death, to make it known that innocent lives will be protected, and to make it clear that this is a war we are ready to fight and ready to win.

It Turns Out 'Abolish ICE' Isn't Really That Popular,thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/15/turns-abolish-ice-isnt-really-popular/,"May 15, 2019 By John Daniel Davidson
Remember the Abolish ICE movement last year? The one that so many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates rallied around? As far as Democratic activists were concerned, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that patrols and enforces immigration law in the interior of the country was a kind of jack-booted Gestapo that had to be dismantled and replaced.
Activists weren’t the only ones. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand were all early supporters of the Abolish ICE movement, and made headlines last summer with bold statements about how ICE doesn’t “reflect our values” and how we need to “start from scratch.” Sen. Bernie Sander tweeted it was time to “abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today,” which would mean “restructuring” ICE.
But it turns out not very many Democrats agree. A new AP/NORC poll found only a quarter of Democrats want to abolish ICE. That’s despite the poll also finding that 57 percent of Democrats have a negative view of the agency.
This helps explain why so few Democratic presidential hopefuls want to talk about abolishing ICE anymore. Gillibrand even claimed to Buzzfeed that she never said “abolish,” but actually last summer she did . Asked about the border and immigration this week on “The View,” Beto O’Rourke didn’t mention ICE at all, instead expressing vague sentiments about how immigrants strengthen the country. As someone living with his family in U.S.-Mexico border city El Paso, TX, @BetoORourke explains why investing in reducing violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America and honoring asylum laws are his first priorities in tackling the border crisis. https://t.co/TJd7goE6eV pic.twitter.com/7eT8yC1Fox
— The View (@TheView) May 14, 2019
Democratic activists aren’t too happy about the unpopularity of the Abolish ICE movement. One of them told a Buzzfeed reporter that “It’s a little harmful,” that top Democrats have dropped the issue. “Everybody was using it as the big hot topic or issue, but nobody is putting the model forward of what that means, or the possibilities of what that looks like.”
It’s worth remembering how popular Abolish ICE was last year among Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other left-wing Democrats. That support for the movement has dropped off so dramatically indicates that perhaps the far-left wing of the party isn’t as influential as is often assumed—at least not on immigration. "
House Petition Will Test Whether Support For Israel Is Still Bipartisan,thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/house-discharge-petition-will-test-whether-support-israel-still-bipartisan/,"May 16, 2019 By Melissa Langsam Braunstein
In late March, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told attendees at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ’s annual conference that “support for Israel in Congress remains ironclad and bipartisan.” After the troubling events of the last several months, reasonable observers might question that statement. Now, House Republicans are ready to test just how deep bipartisan support for Israel still runs.
On February 5, the Senate passed S. 1 , the Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act of 2019, by a vote of 77 to 23. That’s typically considered broad agreement for the Senate. However, given the historic bipartisan commitment to Israel, the number of senators opposed — a group that included every Senate Democrat running for president, save Amy Klobuchar — was striking. That’s especially so when you consider that 22 of the 23 nays were Democrats.
The package of four bills shouldn’t have been controversial, but in the current political climate, the Combating BDS Act of 2019 made it so. Democrats have had a growing generational divide on Israel for some time, but it has generally not had much of a legislative impact — until now. The boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement (BDS), which seeks to isolate and delegitimize Israel, has become politically complicated for Democrats.
H.R. 336 , the House’s companion bill to S. 1, has languished since Texas Rep. Michael McCaul introduced it on January 8. Pelosi has opted not to call a vote, because it would presumably divide her caucus, much as S. 1 split Senate Democrats. But bad optics shouldn’t stop a vote on a national security bill so many House members support.
With that in mind, Rep. Brian Mast of Florida introduced a discharge petition for H.R. 336 on Wednesday. This parliamentary procedure is the Republicans’ opportunity to force the majority to vote on this measure. In order to do that, though, they must first collect 218 signatures.
With strong Republican support a given, the petition is expected to need 21 Democratic supporters. Given that 27 Democrats co-sponsored similar legislation in the last Congress, and 2018 swept Democrats into typically red and purple districts, reaching that target number should be manageable. Some of those votes may need to be shaken loose with the help of constituents, though.
As of the close of business on Wednesday, Republicans had collected 161 signatures. So if you support a strong U.S.-Israel relationship and oppose economic warfare against Israel, this is an opportunity to make a difference. The House clerk has posted a petition tracker online where you can check the number of signatories and whether your member is among them.
In a statement, Rep. Lee Zeldin observed, “The American people deserve to know where each and every one of us stand and what we are willing to do about it.” He’s right. We do.
Let’s see members go on the record, not only with this discharge petition, but also with H.R. 336 itself. Americans should know where Congress stands on our relationship with our nation’s closest Middle Eastern ally, as well as whether Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are really the only two members of the House who support BDS.
As Sen. Marco Rubio, who is the main sponsor of the Senate bill, remarked, “If Speaker Pelosi is serious about supporting Israel and strengthening U.S. security in the Middle East, she should bring this important, bipartisan bill to the floor immediately.” Call your member of Congress.

Is Iran Hysteria The New Russia Hysteria?,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/iran-hysteria-new-russia-hysteria/,"By Warren Henry May 16, 2019
Were the establishment media to be believed, President Trump is spoiling for a shooting war with Iran. In articles mostly targeting fiercely mustachioed National Security Adviser John Bolton, The New York Times , CNN , NBC , The New Yorker , The Guardian , and even USA Today are running hot takes contending we are marching to the brink.
A closer look suggests the story so far is much less about Trump war-mongering and more about media fear-mongering. With Special Counsel Robert Mueller putting to rest years of media speculation that Trump was a Russian asset, it is as if Trump’s opponents need a new reason why he should frighten voters.
At the generally neoconservative Commentary magazine, Noah Rothman set forth the case that the war drums are not beating at the White House. In response, Jonathan Chait wrote a column headlined “ Conservative Columnist Urges War With Iran Over 2 Percent Oil Price Hike ,” even though Rothman wrote military action “would be counterproductive to the [Trump] strategy they are currently pursuing, which consists of imposing broad economic sanctions on Iran to harden grassroots resistance to the regime in the hopes of catalyzing a revolution.” It seems as though the antiwar left will not take “no war” for an answer.
Rothman’s column highlights the reporting of an outlet with no love for Trump, The New York Times :
Officials said the new deployments were part of the original request made last weekend by the military’s Central Command after the Trump administration said new intelligence showed that Iran was mobilizing proxy groups in Iraq and Syria to attack American forces. As a result, the Pentagon sent B-52 bombers this week to Al Udeid air base in Qatar, and the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier passed through the Suez Canal on its way to the Persian Gulf.
The new steps are meant to be measured and limited, in part because a new intelligence analysis by American and allied spy services has concluded that the Iranian government, declining in popularity amid economic woes, is trying to provoke the United States into a military overreaction to cement its hold on power, according to American and allied intelligence officials. The American intelligence community has not yet done a broader official assessment that would incorporate views from multiple agencies.
Iranian mullahs clinging to power by playing the nationalist card with America as the enemy is an old story, not a new one. Even the movement of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln—which was on a scheduled deployment— appears to have been previously planned .
The administration is war-planning for a worst-case scenario, as prudent governments do. But President Trump was quick to dismiss claims that he was gearing up for war as “ fake news ,” a position consistent with his generally non-interventionist leanings.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration is “not going to do a military exercise inside Iran” to expedite a regime change. Both Pompeo and Bolton have said the United States does not seek war with Iran, but will respond if our interests are attacked, which is pretty standard American foreign policy. Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan may be even less inclined to military action at this time.
Instead, the administration has relied on sanctions against Iran and hopes long-running internal protests will eventually topple the regime. This approach has been similar to the administration’s position regarding Venezuela.
The differences are that Iran has been more provocative and our allies have been less supportive , despite Iran openly abandoning its nuclear deal . That lack of support may reinforce Trump’s opinion that our alliances favor our allies more than ourselves, but it also is likely to reinforce Trump’s instincts against military intervention.
The effort to portray Trump as itching for armed conflict with Iran echoes the left’s claim that he backs a right-wing coup in Venezuela, when he (and many other governments) support the constitutionally legitimate socialist opposition to the current authoritarian regime run by Nicolas Maduro and backed by Russia, Cuba, and narcotics profits.
Ironically, the administration’s Venezuela policy is among the latest in its opposition to Russia , contradicting the years-long media narrative that someday there would be proof Trump shared a bed with Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale . Trump’s critics have been left to complain his policies toward Russia have been undercut by his kind words for Vladimir Putin. Mixed messages may be a legitimate concern, but Putin likely cares far more about actions over words.
A skeptic might wonder whether Trump’s reflexive opponents, having spent years assuming Trump was a Russian asset and working backwards, now assume Trump wants to start wars and look for any evidence in support of their theory. This assumption is dangerous, because the bigger risk is not of immediate war with Iran, but escalation that stumbles into a war. If mixed messaging in foreign policy is a concern, so is the tendency of Trump’s critics inside and outside the media to create public confusion over the administration’s intent regarding Iran.
A skeptic also might wonder whether the collapse of the Russian collusion story is causing Trump’s opponents to look for a new way to frighten voters on foreign policy, particularly if the economy remains strong. At the very least, covering an imagined war with Iran is a convenient distraction from covering stories more favorable to Trump and less favorable to those who suggested he was a Manchurian Candidate.
Convincing voters that Trump, who generally ran against the foreign interventions of the Bush and Obama administrations, is looking to drop in on Tehran like Major Kong astride a bomb in “Dr. Strangelove” may have difficulty making the sale. Absent serious provocation from Iran or Venezuela, Trump is unlikely to pursue a war of choice.
Moreover, given decades of the Iranian theocracy condemning the United States as the Great Satan, and years of Maduro starving the people of Venezuela, it seems unlikely the average voter is going to side with the defenders of Iran and Maduro over Trump.

Gen X Is The Best Mess Ever,thefederalist.com,Neal Pollack,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/gen-x-best-mess-ever/,"May 16, 2019 By Neal Pollack
Like most members of Generation X, I was born between 1965 and 1980. I gestated in the belly of a woman and the remainder of my DNA was created by a male sperm. But I don’t let that define me. When, in 1992, Time magazine declared, “Here they are now, the little bastards,” I announced in the Sexy Vampires AOL chatroom I’d created that I no longer identified as Generation X. I still don’t. But also, I do.
Gen X grew up with parents who were always getting divorced, and with siblings who were always drunk. When we came home from school, the house was empty, and so was the refrigerator. We were hungry, so we ate our neighbors’ pets.
When we weren’t watching reruns of “The Brady Bunch,” we slept in ditches and murdered one another. Everything smelled like cigarettes and Drakkar Noir and then our parents got divorced again.
Do you remember the 1990s, when we were young? We had telephones that attached to the wall and we watched garbage live music in dark rooms. There were so many cute moody boys and kick-ass girls who wouldn’t have sex with us. Wow, what a time. When Bill Clinton was president, everyone went to jail, which was lame. Sometimes magazines had fashion ads with black people in them. Oh my god, there were scrunchies.
Gen X’s work ethic, much derided over the years, was actually pretty incredible. I accomplished so much without even really trying, just because no one told me I couldn’t. I made it cool to be a hip-hop capitalist with my label Roc-A-Jew Records and helped mainstream different choices with my groundbreaking alternative lifestyle ‘zine Bitch Homo. My cable-access show “Grunge Dog Taco Truck” featured the first-ever incidence of someone urinating on Billy Corgan in public. That was great.
For a brief moment, Gen X owned the culture, like that sketch where Ben Stiller played a nihilistic camel named Winona Ryder who guest-stars on “My So-Called Life.” Movies like “Clerks” and “Slurpers” and “Shingles,” about a moody rocker played by Keanu Reeves who develops a skin disorder, truly defined us. Then we quit our jobs at the record store and moved to Portland.
But just because we spent our formative years overdosing on Prozac in our mall dorms doesn’t mean that Generation X has accomplished nothing. We founded Twitter and a nonprofit that gives the less fortunate access to Twitter.
Before we revolutionized shopping online, people only shopped offline. In politics, Beto O’Rourke was in a band where he dressed like a goat who rides a hacker skateboard. Barack Obama wasn’t our president, but he also was, because he was in the Choom Gang and was a cast member on Zoom and played “Doom” with a broom.
Gen X got married and we stayed married, even though we hated being married and published first-person essays about being sexually restless. Once we became parents, we were even more awesome, because we blogged about our babies on MySpace. We took our kids to see the guy from SoundWagon play at the grocery-store parking lot. He had a side project for kids called “Rock and Roll Rooster.” We played it over and over again even though it sucked.
Now our AARP cards have begun to arrive in the mail. This makes us nervous but it’s also okay, because there are so many amazing discounts. Despite it all, we’re happy because we have some money. Boomers will be dead soon and the millennials are starting to have hilarious health problems.
Gen X doesn’t want to be rich. We just want enough money to be able to afford to eat at the jidori hot chicken boutique pop-up at the nonprofit coffee barn in our neighborhood twice a week. When the bill comes, we want to be able to say, “It’s on me, I need the miles.” Also, we have a condo in Auckland that we need to pay off, but we’re renting it out most weeks.
In short, don’t write off Gen X just yet. We’re still here. Some of us are still queer. Entertain us.

Why I’m Endorsing Bill De Blasio For President,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/why-im-endorsing-bill-de-blasio-for-president/,"May 16, 2019 By David Marcus
I want Bill de Blasio to win the 2020 presidential election. It may sound strange that a conservative pundit at a conservative outlet would hold such a position, but hear me out. America, New York City needs you. As he announces his candidacy today, I wholeheartedly endorse Bill de Blasio for president of United States, because if he wins then he can’t be mayor of New York City anymore. Not for nothing, that’s kind of my bottom-line issue at the moment.
New York City is a fragile ecosystem. For most of my adult life from 1993 until 2013, it was managed by competent, serious men. Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg took this city, the greatest that has ever been known to man, the scourge of Boston and big brother of Philadelphia, to new and exciting heights. We were back, baby! Swing!
And then came de Blasio. It wasn’t supposed to happen. The socialist from Park Slope who summered in the ’80s at communist camps in Nicaragua was supposed to lose to Anthony Weiner, until the latter gave into the strange desires of his, well, wiener. And just like that, a socialist became mayor.
Dig this from a 2013 New York Times profile: “Bill de Blasio, then 26, went to Nicaragua to help distribute food and medicine in the middle of a war between left and right. But he returned with something else entirely: a vision of the possibilities of an unfettered leftist government.”
Unfettered leftist government pretty much sums up de Blasio’s time in office as mayor. And it is awful. We need the rest of the country to shoulder some of this nonsense and madness. I’ll give you a few examples of de Blasio’s unfettered leftist government.
One of his first signature acts as mayor was to weaken restrictions on public urination. This perhaps suggests a potential campaign slogan: “De Blasio 2020, If You Gotta Go, You Gotta Go.” The result has been a more fragrant city, around every which corner some fine fellow may be relieving himself. This is not a burden that New York City deserves to bear alone. If people are peeing with amnesty on the Bowery, so should they also on Main Street.
But there are other issues beyond micturition. De Blasio has his own Green New Deal, and it’s a doozy. Big Bill says Gotham will be “The first of any major city on the Earth to say to building owners, ‘You’ve got to clean up your act, you’ve got to retrofit, you’ve got to save energy, If you don’t do it by 2030 there will be serious fines, as high as $1 million or more for the biggest buildings.” That’ll stick it to those building owners who wouldn’t dare pass the cost along to New Yorkers trying to rent or buy apartments that already cost more than most McMansion mortgages.
Congestion pricing is another big winner. For those who don’t know, this is a plan whereby you turn half of the streets in midtown Manhattan into pedestrian plazas, add about 9 zillion miles of bike lanes, and then argue that traffic has gotten so bad that New Yorkers have to pay a toll to drive on their own streets.
While homelessness and crime inch back up, and the subways are pulled along by underfed mules, Comrade de Blasio is hard at work making sure that we can’t have plastic bags to carry our bacon, egg, and cheeses, or straws to drink our egg creams.
So, listen, I get it. I know what you are going to say; at least he is limited to New York City. Why should we, the rest of the country, take this problem off your hands? So here is my answer to that. At least as president he would face checks and balances from conservatives in the legislature and judiciary. You people would be able to fight back. In New York we have fewer Republicans on the City Council than the Knicks have playoff appearances.
And by the way, you owe us. How many of your weirdo siblings and cousins who want to be artists or “find themselves” have we taken off your hands? Do you think it’s easy for us seeing these bright-eyed, bushy-tailed kids come from the hinterland full of hope, knowing that in a few years they will be crushed and empty and broke?
America, will you please take our mayor? You’d be doing us a really big favor. Please join us in this. Please make Bill de Blasio the next president of the United States. He can do less damage there, I promise. David Marcus is the Federalist's New York Correspondent and the Artistic Director of Blue Box World, a Brooklyn based theater project.

The Trump Administration Needs To Cool It With Iran Before We Start A War,thefederalist.com,Daniel DePetris,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/trump-administration-needs-cool-iran-start-war/,"By Daniel DePetris May 16, 2019
Bilateral relations between the United States and Iran have been hostile and adversarial for decades, yet the last few weeks have taken the typically high temperature to a boiling point. If Washington fails to leave the bellicosity at the door and isn’t careful with its words and actions, we could be a single miscalculation away from a war that would be wholly unjustified and unnecessary to U.S. security.
This is not an exaggeration to be casually dismissed, but a real-world scenario of the Trump administration’s own making. Consider the events of the last few weeks.
In pursuit of a “maximum pressure” campaign, Washington has unleashed an arsenal of economic sanctions on Tehran that are aimed to bankrupt the Iranian government, collapse the Iranian economy, and force the country to come back to the table to negotiate a better nuclear deal. On April 21, the White House eliminated the last remaining oil waivers, compelling countries that purchase Iranian crude oil to either stop those imports immediately or face a cut off from the U.S. market.
This decision came roughly two weeks after President Trump designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization—the first time an arm of a foreign government has been treated as a terrorist group. Tehran retaliated by designating U.S. Central Command a terrorist organization, all but putting targets on the backs of tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed in the region.
National Security Advisor John Bolton’s late-night statement of an accelerated U.S. aircraft carrier and bomber deployment to the Persian Gulf (purportedly in response to Iranian attack planning on U.S. personnel) has only increased the tension and the chances of a miscalculation leading to war.
Tehran is in no mood for accommodation. President Hassan Rouhani’s declaration that his government will begin to breach the cap on uranium enrichment in 60 days unless it starts receiving the economic benefits it is entitled to under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is a direct result of the administration’s unilateral withdrawal from the deal.
The Iranians have escalated in other ways as well. U.S. intelligence has purportedly assessed that Tehran has ordered its proxies to attack U.S. personnel in the region in preparation for hostilities. It’s a threat Washington should take seriously given the country’s recent history; according to the administration, Iran was responsible for the deaths of more than 600 U.S. troops during the eight-year war in Iraq.
One can argue whether the JCPOA was strong enough, or whether the deal could have been structured more to Washington’s liking. The fact that enrichment and research and development provisions eventually expire clearly rattled President Trump, who has consistently called the accord the worst in history.
What one can’t argue, however, is that the Trump administration’s maximum pressure policy—when combined with the Iranian regime’s inherent mistrust of U.S. intentions—has only further deteriorated the state of relations between Washington and Tehran. The White House’s insistence on Iran’s complete and unconditional surrender on all matters of concern only reinforces the regime’s tendency to double down in the face of American demands.
Our Iran policy is being led off a cliff by two men—Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo—who have recklessly rooted for regime change in Tehran throughout their careers. As has become quite obvious over the last two decades, regime change in the Middle East is a blatantly bad idea that leads to even bigger problems, endless U.S. military and financial commitments, and more opportunity for competitors (like China) to exploit Washington’s distraction to their own geopolitical advantage.
It is not too late for Trump to step back from the brink, but a shift toward a more prudent approach will require him to stop listening to interventionist advisors who are pursuing their own agendas and appear to be content with sparking another conflict regardless of the cost.
Trump claims he is the world’s most competent negotiator with all the tools of the trade. So rather than getting suckered by his own national security advisor into launching another foolish war the American people don’t want (and one he promised on the campaign trail to avoid), Trump should negotiate. Or, in the likely event Tehran rejects his entreaties, Trump should at least authorize his administration to open lines of communication with Iran for the purpose of cooling down what could otherwise be a road to long-term conflict.
This could include establishing a dialogue between senior officials in the U.S. State Department and the Iranian Foreign Ministry, if not a direct channel between Pompeo and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, to hash out sudden disputes before they transform into crises. This isn’t unprecedented: After all, U.S. and North Korean diplomats are in discussions right now, and U.S. and Soviet officials spoke with one another regularly, even during the hottest days of the Cold War.
Some of those talks softened the ground for serious arms-control negotiations in the future, while others helped both sides gain information about the other’s intentions and enhanced understanding of each other’s positions. If we could talk with the former Soviet Union, a far larger power and geopolitical player than Iran will ever be, there is no reason we can’t follow the same play with Tehran.
Bolton and Pompeo believe the United States and Iran are unable to coexist. In their minds, the only solution to the Iranian problem is to change the regime. Both of these beliefs are dead wrong. The United States can manage Iran and even improve relations with the country with the deterrence and hard-nosed diplomacy that has proved so effective for the United States in the past.

What You Need To Know About Alabama’s New Abortion Ban,thefederalist.com,Georgi Boorman,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/need-know-alabamas-bill-ban-abortion/,"By Georgi Boorman May 16, 2019
If past media responses to abortion restrictions are any indication, you’re going to see a tremendous amount of misinformation about Alabama’s law that “bans abortion,” which the governor signed Wednesday.
You can read House Bill 314 here for yourself. It is short and easy to understand, but here is a summary of the important points that are likely to be hotly contended on social media by people who don’t know what they’re talking about. 1. The Law Defines All Humans as Persons from Conception
HB 314, or The Alabama Human Life Protection Act, defines all unborn children as persons. This differentiates it from Georgia’s LIFE Act, which would only afford legal protection to preborn babies whose heartbeat can be detected, usually around the gestational age of six weeks.
UNBORN CHILD, CHILD or PERSON. A human being, specifically including an unborn child in utero at any stage of development, regardless of viability. 2. HB 314 Defines Most Conventional Abortions as Felonies
HB 314 defines most abortions as class A felonies and attempted abortions as class C felonies.
Section 6. (a) An abortion performed in violation of this act is a Class A felony.
(b) An attempted abortion performed in violation of this act is a Class C felony. 3. Many Exceptions Apply
Despite banning most abortions from the moment of conception, many exceptions apply under which abortion would be legal, or cases in which the term abortion is defined to exclude certain types of pregnancy termination, such as ectopic pregnancies. These are standard exceptions made in almost all pro-life legislation. The only popular exception not included is the exception for rape and incest.
Here are the exemptions.
Abortions women perform on themselves . Women are specifically exempted from prosecution.
Section 5. No woman upon whom an abortion is performed or attempted to be performed shall be criminally or civilly liable.
One might object that since this statute is written as if an abortion were being performed on the woman by a third party, it must not exempt women from prosecution if they perform the abortion on themselves. However, that is not how courts have interpreted similar statutes in the past. Charges for women who shot themselves in the stomach to kill their preborn children in Florida , Georgia , and Virginia have all been overturned on this principle.
Abortion in the case of serious physical risk to the mother. Such risk is defined as “a condition that so complicates her medical condition that it necessitates the termination of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function.”
The risk must be attested to by a physician licensed in Alabama. Confirmation of “necessity” in emergency situations could be submitted up to 180 days after the abortion.
Serious mental illness. Abortion may be performed upon confirmation from a psychiatrist that the mother could engage in conduct “resulting in her death or the death of her unborn child.”
A psychiatrist exercising “reasonable judgment” must diagnose “a serious mental illness,” and find that “a termination of her pregnancy is medically necessary to avoid the conduct.” (In other words, a medical professional may kill the preborn child…in order to prevent the woman from killing her preborn child. Wrap your head around that one.)
No gestational limits are mentioned in the law with regard to any of the exceptions. However, AL Code § 26-22-3 (2013) governing abortions of viable unborn children states that, “No abortion shall be deemed authorized under this paragraph if performed on the basis of a claim or a diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which would result in her death or in substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”
This suggests abortions under the mental health exception must be done before viability as long as that regulation is determined to not be “in conflict with or antagonistic to this act.”
Termination of preborn babies with “lethal anomalies” (who will die before, during, or shortly after birth).
The term [abortion] does not include a procedure or act…to terminate the pregnancy of a woman when the unborn child has a lethal anomaly.
Removal of ectopic pregnancies.
The term does not include a procedure or act to terminate the pregnancy of a woman with an ectopic pregnancy.
Removal of a dead unborn child.
The term does not include these activities if done with the intent to… remove a dead unborn child.
Abortion as defined in HB 314 also excludes any efforts to “deliver the unborn child prematurely to avoid a serious health risk to the unborn child’s mother, or to preserve the health of her unborn child.” 4. The Law Depends on Overturning SCOTUS Precedent
HB 314 is not a nullification law, meaning the state of Alabama will adhere to any court rulings striking down the whole law or parts of it. The law states, “If this act is challenged and enjoined pending a final judicial decision, the existing statutes and regulations that regulate or recognize abortion shall remain in effect during that time.” Given the virtual inevitability that any related court ruling will follow Roe/Casey/Doe precedents, this law is highly unlikely to ever take effect.
The authors of the bill point to the “self-evident truth” that “all men are created equal,” as found in our Declaration of Independence, as evidence this law is moral and necessary. The bill was introduced, however, with the understanding that the pre-existing abortion ban in Alabama “has remained unenforceable as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and its progeny.”
While media will play up outrage and controversy over “radical” state efforts to restrict legal abortion, the truth is that neither a ban from conception or a ban at the age of detectable fetal heartbeat, or anything remotely as restrictive, will take effect under the status quo. For abortion to be restricted to any significant extent, one of three things must happen: the Supreme Court must overturn its own abortion precedent, a constitutional amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states, or states must decide to nullify the Supreme Court’s ruling and adhere to the plain meaning of the U.S. Constitution, the supreme law of the land."
CUNY College Disgraces Itself By Giving Honorary Degree To Al Sharpton,thefederalist.com,Craig Trainor,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/cuny-college-disgraces-giving-honorary-degree-al-sharpton/,"By Craig Trainor May 16, 2019
The City University of New York is a lifeline to the examined life and the middle class for generations of poor and working-class students, from Irving Kristol to Colin Powell to me. Medgar Evers College, a senior college within the City University of New York system, intends to confer an honorary degree on Al Sharpton at its June 5, 2019, commencement. Sharpton is many things; a doctor of humane letters is not one of them.
Medgar Evers was a World War II veteran who organized fellow Mississippi NAACP members to obtain the civil rights being denied to black Americans in the 1950s and ’60s. As dangerous as it was noble, he coordinated voter registration drives and boycotts of segregated businesses. Thurgood Marshall said Evers had “more courage than anybody I’ve ever ran across.” Evers gave his life for the advancement of black Americans when a Klansman shot and killed him in his driveway in Jackson, Mississippi, on June 12, 1963.
By contrast, Sharpton’s greatest achievement has been avoiding criminal prosecution. Sharpton has spent a public career enriching himself under the banner of advancing civil rights. He didn’t calm racial tensions; he inflamed them. He didn’t work for racial healing; he rubbed the wounds raw. Evers was a genuine civil rights leader; Sharpton played one on TV. Simply put, Sharpton is not a good man. He is unworthy of this honor.
The indictment against Sharpton is public record. For more than 35 years of public life, he has proven himself a charlatan and a race hustler. The evidence is irrefutable.
The Tawana Brawley hoax is representative. In 1987, the deeply troubled young girl claimed four white men had raped her, smeared dog feces on her, written racist epithets on her body, and wrapped her in a trash bag. Brawley concocted this tale, but Sharpton and two other racial bomb throwers, Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, took up her cause. These men created one of the most racially divisive episodes in modern New York history.
When Sharpton’s camp was advised that Brawley’s story was likely a fabrication, Sharpton and crew also “expressed doubts about the truthfulness of [Brawley’s] account,” but that didn’t stop “the two lawyers and Sharpton [from] making it up as they went along,” as one of Sharpton’s aides said at the time. This penchant for fiction might explain why Sharpton and friends declared that New York conspired with the Ku Klux Klan, the Mafia, and the Irish Republican Army to hamper the investigation into Brawley’s allegations.
Sharpton’s skullduggery is not limited to exploiting racial divisions. Self-dealing is another, although the two are vertically integrated. Sharpton runs an organization called the “National Action Network” (NAN). It is ostensibly a civil rights organization meant to advance “the spirit and tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.” In practice, it exists to advance “the spirit and tradition of” Sharpton’s extortion racket.
NAN pays Sharpton a “salary” of almost $250,000.00 a year. (Who knew boycotts were so lucrative?) NAN also bankrolls Sharpton’s first-class travel and recently bought the rights to his story for $531,000.00. Unconcerned with fiduciary prohibitions on self-dealing, Sharpton has used NAN’s funds as his own—NAN even paid for Sharpton’s daughter’s tuition.
NAN is a nonprofit, but nothing has been more profitable for Sharpton than its shakedown prowess. At Sharpton’s direction, NAN confronts American corporations and demands tribute. And they pay—handsomely. NAN took in $6.3 million dollars in 2017 and $5.8 million in 2016. Over the years, Fortune 500 companies from Walmart to Verizon have contributed millions to the organization.
Given that NAN operates primarily to enrich Sharpton, these contributions are not philanthropy; they are ransom. American business is buying corporate peace. Upon tendering payment, the company is safe from Sharpton’s public declarations of their racism.
Sharpton’s behavior necessitates the question: Why would Medgar Evers College honor a notorious scoundrel who has harmed race relations in the United States or expend its moral capital on a man who uses the high cause of civil rights for personal gain? The college’s decision is puzzling and maddening.
It is not too late to rectify this error in judgment. Medgar Evers College can use this episode as the proverbial teachable moment. It can revoke the resolution awarding Sharpton an honorary degree and explain to its students that the hallmark of liberal education is the ability of independent thinkers to engage in free inquiry, examine assumptions, reason critically, and change their minds when the evidence before them requires it. Otherwise, the college and the City University of New York as a whole will bring disrepute upon their legacy by honoring a fraud.

"The Best Brexit Strategy Is To Leave First, And Then Deal",thefederalist.com,Stephen C. Meyer,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/best-brexit-strategy-leave-first-deal/,"By Stephen C. Meyer May 16, 2019
Last month, the European Union’s Council of Ministers voted to allow Britain another extension in its Brexit deliberations. Despite Prime Minister Theresa May’s “success” in negotiating this extension, her Conservative Party recently experienced massive losses in local council elections with more than 1,300 Conservative councillors losing their seats.
Since then, May’s party has tanked further in opinion polls. One recent poll has only 11 percent of the electorate supporting Conservative candidates in the upcoming May 23 elections for the European Parliament. Three years after voting to leave the European Union (EU), British voters must now suffer the indignity of voting to send representatives to a body they no longer wish to represent them.
Not surprisingly, Nigel Farage’s breakaway Brexit Party has surged in polls and looks poised to deal May another electoral humiliation next week. If that occurs, she will likely have to yield to pressure from within her own party to resign. At that point, a new Conservative leader will need a better plan for extricating the United Kingdom from the EU. Theresa May’s Misfeasance
Indeed, from the beginning, May has mishandled the Brexit negotiation. She has done so by assuming that establishing a new trading relationship with the EU first required her to negotiate a separate exit deal. Consequently, the negotiation with the European Commission has focused on how much the UK would pay to leave and on the question of the Irish border.
The deal May negotiated actually leaves Britain worse off than before the Brexit vote. Not only has May agreed to an unnecessary £39 billion exit payment, but she has also accepted continued UK compliance with a swath of EU social and customs regulations, ostensibly to prevent re-establishing a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Since her deal would end British participation in the European Parliament and Council of Ministers, it would enshrine regulation without representation.
Brexiteers have instead advocated leaving the EU without a deal and continuing to trade with EU countries under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules that include modest reciprocal tariffs. They argue correctly that the UK can rely on already concluded “micro-deals” with the EU—covering visas, border checks, trucking, financial derivatives, air travel and Irish power generation—to minimize possible disruptions associated with a no-deal exit.
Even so, the UK has a better option than either May’s deal or a straight no-deal exit. Call it “leave, then deal” or “leave and deal.” Here’s how it would work. First, Affirm Brexit
The next prime minister should first affirm Britain’s decision to leave. He or she can do so either under the terms of Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union or, better yet, by abrogating the treaty altogether.
Although Clause 1 of the Treaty of the European Union affirms that member countries may decide to leave the European Union unilaterally “in accord with their own constitutional requirements,” the fine print in subsequent clauses complicates that process. In particular, Clause 2 requires the leaving nation to negotiate an exit deal with the European Council of Ministers or with whichever EU entity the council designates to represent it.
In Britain’s case, that has meant dealing with the unelected European Commission, whose sole interest has long been advancing the project of European political integration. The exit deal May negotiated with the commission reflects those priorities and May’s tepid support for a genuine Brexit that restores British Parliamentary democracy. (Since 1973 when Britain joined the European Economic Community (EEC), the EEC and the EU, its courts, and various agencies have imposed more than 20,000 laws on the British public with the British Parliament powerless to stop them.)
Nevertheless, the possibility of leaving under Article 50 will soon present itself, since yet subsequent clauses in the Treaty of the European Union allow a country to leave if the negotiation with the council or its designate fails to produce an exit deal after two years. Britain will reach that happy terminus after the expiration of the current extension on October 31st.
The next PM should inform the council well in advance of that deadline that Britain will seek no further requests for extensions and will leave with or without a deal on October 31, or sooner in the case of a decision to withdraw from the treaty. Since 1988 the United Kingdom has withdrawn from more than 50 international treaties and could, with sufficient political will, do so unilaterally now.
Either way, May’s successor should then immediately make an offer to the people of Europe through the Council of Ministers and its 27 elected heads of state. This offer should be made to them rather than the unelected and politically unresponsive European Commission.
Specifically, the new PM should propose, for a period of, say, three years, mutual residency for European Union citizens living in Britain and for British citizens living in Europe. Most importantly, he or she can also offer the council a new free trade deal but under the auspices of the WTO rather than the Luxembourg Court. May’s successor can inform the council that if it refuses the offer, Britain will allow the imposition of tariffs under WTO rules and immediately seek free trade agreements with friendly non-EU countries, including the United States. Look for Free Trade and Mutual Residency
This proposal and negotiating strategy will help resolve the Brexit crisis for several reasons.
First, making a free trade and mutual residency offer exploits the strength of Britain’s negotiating position and increases the likelihood of an EU-UK agreement. Currently, nearly 3.5 million EU citizens live in the UK, while only 1.2 million British people live in EU countries. Similarly, EU exporters sell far more goods and services to Britain than the reverse.
If the UK left the EU with no deal, EU exporters would have to pay an estimated £14 billion in tariffs per year to the UK, while UK exporters would only pay £6 billion to the EU. What’s more, if Britain leaves without a deal, under WTO rules the British government could subsidize UK exporters for their tariff expenditures from the revenue the government would receive from EU exporters. Clearly, the EU countries have far more to lose than the UK does in the event of a no-deal exit.
Second, a free trade agreement administered under WTO auspices would dissolve the thorny Irish border problem. Indeed, the EU regulations that May has accepted to prevent customs checks between the two Irelands are only necessary in the absence of a UK-EU free trade deal.
Third, since this proposed deal would free the UK from the EU Customs Union, it would allow the UK to make free trade agreements with non-EU countries. By contrast, May’s current deal leaves the UK in the Customs Union for nearly two years and requires EU approval for the UK to withdraw permanently.
Finally, this negotiating strategy circumvents the need for a new vote in Parliament over an exit deal, since the government would no longer be seeking such a deal. Indeed, since both Houses of Parliament already voted to leave the EU under Article 50, another exit vote is legally unnecessary. Once agreed, a free trade and mutual residency deal would , however, require Parliamentary approval.
Yet such a deal will prove hard to reject in Parliament. Even May’s pro-Remain Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond cites achieving “frictionless trade” with the EU as the government’s main Brexit objective. Would a Free Trade Deal Present a Problem?
Some will argue that leaving and then offering a free trade deal could be legally problematic within the UK since Parliament also recently voted to forbid a no-deal exit. But the government can render this argument irrelevant by indicating an intent to leave and then securing a deal—on trade and residency—with the Council of Ministers before the October 31 deadline to leave with or without a deal.
The government should also insist that contradictory Parliamentary mandates cannot prevent it from executing the clear will of the British people as expressed in the Brexit referendum. Making this legal argument will render the government’s threat to leave—if necessary without a deal—credible. This will signal to the council that it cannot prevent Britain from leaving by refusing to make a deal, especially one in the clear interest of the European people.
The political chaos engulfing Britain derives from a fundamental flaw in May’s Brexit negotiating strategy. By effectively conceding EU sovereignty over the UK during the period of the negotiation, May has accepted a Brexit in name only, making it impossible for her to secure passage of her deal in the British Parliament. The recent extension in the deadline she secured under Article 50 does nothing to alter the dynamics of her negotiation or end the current impasse in Parliament.
Only a radical change, of course, can now accomplish that. Yet May has shown herself disinclined to pursue any such change. Had she done so, she might have saved her premiership and prevented the coming electoral catastrophe for the Conservative Party. But if, as it seems likely, she continues with her current approach to the bitter end, her party will have no choice but to force her resignation. When it does, the “leave and deal” option provides a clear Brexit roadmap for any would-be successor. Stephen C. Meyer is a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute. "
U.S. Democrats Follow U.K. Labour Party Down The Anti-Semitism Rat Hole,thefederalist.com,Erielle Davidson,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/u-s-democrats-follow-u-k-labour-party-anti-semitism-rat-hole/,"By Erielle Davidson May 16, 2019
This past Tuesday, yet another Labour member of the United Kingdom’s Parliament resigned from the party. After 45 years, Bridget Prentice, a former member of Parliament (MP) for Lewisham East, called it quits in a letter to the acting general secretary of the Labour Party.
Prentice’s letter offered a stinging rebuke of the devolution of the Labour Party under the auspices of Jeremy Corbyn. Unsurprisingly, among Prentice’s top concerns, in addition to the party’s anti-Europe swivel, was Labour’s inability to address concerns about anti-Semitism. Prentice’s letter is a dark omen of what the future may portend for the American Democratic Party, which, similar to the Labour Party, has been reeling from accusations of anti-Semitism.
Prentice writes, “Over the past three years I have watched in horror as Jewish members have begged for support against the growth of anti-Semitism both within and out with the Party.” She criticizes Labour’s “slow, reluctant and inadequate” response to claims of anti-Semitism and the mere “slap on the wrist” that was supposed to reprimand such bigotry.
Luciana Berger was a prominent Jewish MP who left Labour earlier this year due to repeated and unpunished harassment. In reference to her departure, Prentice censures the general secretary, “For a pregnant woman MP to [be] bullied out of the party is shameful and embarrassing.” The Cult of Corbyn
Prentice accuses Corbyn of demonstrating absolutely terrible leadership. “Leaders stand to be counted. They root out the evil, they show that such racism will not be tolerated. They don’t twist and turn to find ways of keeping their supporters on board when those self-same supporters have been shown to be racist, anti-Semitic and bullies.” Prentice then points to the whitewashing of the problem via a report the party had issued, which largely downplayed instances of anti-Semitism within the party.
Prentice criticizes the “cult” of Corbyn, which won’t make room for necessary and healthy criticism: “Anyone questioning the leadership’s position is vilified; complaints sent in to the disciplinary panel like something out of a North Korean rulebook that disloyalty to the leader is a criminal offense.” She alludes to the fact that “enthusiasm” and “idealism” brought Corbyn to power but says he has failed to perform on such sentiments, ignoring the needs of his constituents in favor of “attend[ing] marches [and] show[ing] solidarity with regimes which are murdering their own people, harassing women and LGBT communities, and destroying their economies.”
Prentice finally ends by noting that the party no longer represents the larger aims of “social justice” and fairness,” having abandoned its “open and welcoming view of the world.” She concludes by stating, “This is no longer the Labour Party. You should change its name.” The U.S. Parallels Are Growing
As I have written in the past, the Corbynization of the U.K. Labour Party contains numerous parallels to the rise—and acceptance—of anti-Semitism within the American Democrat Party, which similarly has refused to take any meaningful steps to address claims of anti-Semitism within its ranks.
Just a few days ago, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D–MI) engaged in Holocaust revisionism , ignoring the fact that Palestinian Arabs brutally slaughtered Jews fleeing the Holocaust and that the leader of the Palestinian Arabs had actually collaborated with Adolph Hitler. How did Nancy Pelosi, leader of the House Democrats, respond? She demanded that those who criticized Tlaib’s venomous lies apologize.
Pelosi’s acceptance of such brutish behavior is sadly unremarkable. Prior to Tlaib’s comments, Pelosi introduced a radical imam to perform the noon prayer in Congress, an imam who has expressed a vitriolic hatred of Israel, labeling Zionists “ enemies of God ,” lauding the potential Third Intifada, and posting a video comparing Israelis to Nazis.
Advocating for the destruction of the world’s only Jewish state, home to half the world’s Jews, is not a remotely reasonable policy position. There is criticizing a nation-state’s policies, and then there is supporting genocide. The latter is the ultimate conclusion of this imam’s anti-Zionist position.
Over the past several months, we have been subjected to comments from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D–MN) accusing Americans who support Israel of having “dual loyalty”; we learned of prominent House Democrats repeatedly meeting with Jew-hating Louis Farrakhan; we watched House Democrats loudly refuse to vote for a resolution condemning anti-Semitism explicitly and singularly; we witnessed the vast majority of the tens of 2020 Democrat contenders (save four, one of whom came out against Israel) remain silent as the jihadist terrorist group Hamas hurled more than 600 rockets towards Israeli homes, targeting Jews; and now, we are told that Holocaust revisionism is acceptable—that denying the systematic murder of Jews fleeing Hitler is a reasonable activity because to say otherwise is “Islamophobic.” The Gaslighting Must End
In much the same way that Corbyn and his ilk continuously gaslight defectors, claiming that their criticisms are “ plainly untrue ” (despite nearly a dozen resignations citing all the same allegations), we as a society are facing similar pernicious denials emanating from Pelosi and her cohorts, who easily take the American public—and American Jews—for absolute imbeciles.
Prentice’s letter offers a blueprint for the possible defections that might occur in the American Democrat Party, as Democrats continue to deny the rise of anti-Semitism within their party and attempt to silence those who offer any sort of meaningful criticism.
Much like the cult of Corbyn and its perversion of the U.K. Labour Party, there is a cult of unimpeachable progressivism poisoning the American Left. The Democrat Party has demonized any objection to the cult by using a litany of “-isms” to denigrate much-needed critique. Omar (D–MN) has accused Rep. Liz Cheney (R–WI), Rep. Lee Zeldin (R–NY), and anyone else who dares to criticize her or Tlaib (D–MI) of anti-Semitism as “Islamophobic.”
This tactic is useful because it allows the leftist-dominated media to feel guiltless as they rush to protect and rationalize the actions of those accused of anti-Semitism. A glance at the Washington Post’s headlines ( here and here ) might very well make your stomach turn. Watching Seth Meyers conduct damage control for Omar might make you wonder when, if ever, we’ll reach the disgusting crescendo where popular media figures will no longer excuse anti-Semitism. The actions of those within the mainstream media subversively suggest that anti-Semitism is capable of rationalization. It is not.
The U.K. Labour Party’s slow collapse should offer warning bells to Pelosi, who has allowed the far-left to dictate the course of her party. I am not sure what level of Holocaust revisionism or Farrakhan-cavorting it might take for Democrats to realize their party is ill. I can only hope that there are Democrats who are willing to change the party from within in—and if not, are willing to leave the party itself.
As Bridget Prentice suggested in her letter, there comes a point when a party mutates so greatly that it no longer deserves its original name. Perhaps for the American Democratic Party, this is now the case. Erielle Davidson is a Senior Contributor at the Federalist and a law student at Georgetown University Law Center.

"‘Cobra Kai’ Reminds Us That Masculinity Is Good, And Boys And Girls Are Different",thefederalist.com,Casey Chalk,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/cobra-kai-reminds-us-masculinity-good-boys-girls-different/,"By Casey Chalk May 16, 2019
The role of the prophet is not only to predict what is yet to come. The prophet also reminds us of who we are, where we came from, and what is most essential. Like Isaiah, who urged the Jewish people to “remember the former things old,” the prophet grabs us by the shoulders, shakes us, and screams in our face: “Have you forgotten?”
This is the appeal of television series “Cobra Kai,” which recently debuted its second season and YouTube has already announced will be renewed for a third season. Although in some respects a continuation of the corny, 1980s nostalgia of the original “The Karate Kid,” “Cobra Kai” reminds Americans of certain cardinal truths about children that we all know deep down.
The first season of “Cobra Kai,” which aired in 2018, picks up 34 years after the original events of “The Karate Kid.” The original “karate kid,” Daniel “Danny” LaRusso, played by Ralph Macchio, is a successful car salesman in the San Fernando Valley. His old nemesis, Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), is a struggling, recently fired blue-collar handyman with a drinking habit. Neither are still practicing karate.
At his lowest, Johnny ends up in a fight with teenage thugs outside a convenience store, coming to the aid of an Ecuadorian immigrant boy, Miguel Diaz. Johnny spends a night in the slammer, but Miguel is so impressed he begs Johnny teach him how to fight. Johnny eventually agrees. He eventually re-establishes the once-infamous Cobra Kai karate dojo, training a bunch of unpopular, bullied kids from the local high school.
Cobra Kai’s resurgence raises the ire of Danny, who is reminded of the bullying he suffered at the hands of Johnny and his friends in the 1980s. Through a series of unexpected circumstances, he employs Johnny’s estranged, trouble-making son, Robby. In time, they develop a friendship, and Danny starts teaching Robby Okinawan karate, as Mr. Miyagi had to him so many years ago. In the final episode of the first season, Robby and Miguel face off in the San Fernando Valley karate championship. The second season picks up in the summer after that championship fight. Children Need Their Fathers
The first, and most important prophetic message of “Cobra Kai” is that children need their fathers. At the beginning of season one, Miguel has no father figure — his mother fled his deadbeat father in coming to the United States. Miguel’s new sensei, Johnny, obviously fills that patrimonial role, and Miguel’s admiration for Johnny only grows.
Moreover, Johnny was raised by his mother and step-father, a cruel man who mocks rather than loves his stepson. Now an old man, the stepfather throws money at Johnny out of an obligation to Johnny’s deceased mother. In one of the most powerful scenes of season one, Johnny returns all the money, declaring that it wasn’t handouts he needed, but love.
Yet Johnny was himself an absentee father to his son, Robby, who lives with his mother, a miserable women cycling through one-night stands at their apartment. Without a father figure, Robby hangs out with the wrong crowd, engages in theft, and causes trouble at school. It is only when he meets Danny LaRusso, who has pity on the boy and takes him under his wing, that Robby’s life begins to turn around.
Like Miguel with Johnny, Robby adores his sensei. This is one of the greatest ironies of the show: Johnny failed with his son Robby, but finds fatherly redemption in mentoring Miguel; Robby, meanwhile, finds the father figure he needs in his dad’s arch-nemesis.
This increasingly Gordian knot of the role of the paterfamilias is a clear message to our culture: children need their fathers. Without fathers, the likelihood children will suffer all manner of personal and socio-economic problems — mental health conditions, poverty, drug addiction — greatly increases. A large battery of contemporary sociological research supports this.
Moreover, it is not just any father-figure that a child requires (although any mature, responsible man is better than none) — kids need their biological fathers. This is why the tension caused by Robby’s rejection of his biological father for Danny LaRusso is so powerful. Boys and Girls Are Different
This leads to a second lesson: boys and girls are different. Although both Cobra Kai and Danny’s dojo, Miyagi-Do, teach both male and female students, it seems the boys, more than the girls, need what karate offers them. This is an activity that emboldens them, properly directs their testosterone, and makes them strong enough to defend themselves.
Boys need to be secure in their masculinity. Indeed, multiple male characters acquire love interests after learning karate, and impress girls with their skills. The producers of the show (who include Will Smith) appear to understand, perhaps inchoately, what George Will recently observed : “Parents who have raised sons understand that civilization’s primary task is to civilize adolescent males.”
“Cobra Kai” constantly pokes fun at an American culture that seems to have forgotten this. In one amusing vignette in season one, Johnny, an old-school masculine archetype, reminds Miguel of the differences between boys and girls. Miguel responds: “Don’t you think you’re doing a lot of genderizing?”Johnny simply tells him to be quiet.
In another scene in season two, Johnny takes a phone call from an interested student. He acknowledges that his dojo takes both boys and girls, although it’s increasingly clear the person on the other line is asking about transgender students. “Is this a prank call?” Johnny yells, and promptly hangs up. One hopes this refusal by the show’s creators to cater to aggressive gender identity politics will continue.
There are many other profitable reminders in “Cobra Kai”: that coddling children only hurts them; that strong masculinity must be tempered by humility, charity, and service; that people, even ones who have made egregious life errors, deserve a second chance. These are truths most Americans, and most parents, knew only one or two generations ago.
This is a lesson our “the future is female” world of safe spaces, alternative lifestyles, and public shaming campaigns, has largely forgotten. “Cobra Kai” succeeds precisely because it urges us to return to these basic truths about the human person and society. One only hopes the creators will, to use a common phrase of Johnny’s, “have the balls” to stick this script.

Why Right And Wrong Are Just As Objective As Science,thefederalist.com,David Weinberger,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/right-wrong-just-objective-science/,"By David Weinberger May 16, 2019
One of the most commonly held beliefs today is that reality can be objectively studied only through science, and that where science cannot empirically test what is true and false—as, for example, with morality—we cannot know truth. In other words, science is objective because it is based on facts, whereas morality is subjective because it is based on values.
This thinking is flawed. It stems from an erroneous assumption that “facts” are independent of “values”—that is, “ought” statements (which are statements of value) cannot be derived from “is” statements (which are statements of fact). But the truth is, facts and values are indivisible.
Consider, for instance, the concept of a chair. The essence of a chair is to have properties of “chairness”: to have stable legs, to stand upright, to have a seat, etc. These are facts about the nature of chairs, even though no particular chair perfectly exhibits them. For example, imagine a chair with all four of its legs, and imagine another chair with one broken leg. While the first chair may appear to be in perfect condition, upon careful inspection we would notice subtle flaws.
Say, if measured precisely we would see that the legs of the chair differ in length, if only by a fraction of a millimeter. Still, we regard it as a better chair than the broken one because it more closely resembles the essence of “chairness.”
This common-sense value judgment is as objective as the facts about the nature of chairs. To suggest otherwise is to deny that chairs have a purpose (to support you while you sit) for which there is an objective standard (“chairness”). Such denial not only defies common sense, but it renders reality unintelligible.
For example, identifying this chair as a “chair” is possible only if there is a universal standard of what it entails to be a “chair.” That standard—or “chairness”—thus pre-exists in our minds before we can identify “this” as a chair. Without it, there is simply no reference point and thus no basis for calling “this” a chair.
Likewise, communication presupposes universals as reference points between communicators. Without them—if the word “chair,” for example, does not convey a meaning universal to both communicators—language itself breaks down. That is why, as Harry Jaffa put it, “Sensation, or a judgment of the mind utilizing only the data of the sense, is insufficient to make a possible judgment of fact. Empirical knowledge, properly so called, is a synthesis of sense data with definitions, universals, in terms of which the sense data are ordered ” (emphasis added). In other words, value judgments are built into the framework of facts.
If we speak, for example, of a “good chair,” the word g ood merely implies that the chair in question fulfills the obligations of “chairness”—namely, that it supports you while you sit. Thus, the judgment “good” is inherent in the concept of a chair, so “good chair” conveys nothing more than the term “chair” itself conveys.
Now, if the chair in question does not fulfill the obligations of “chairness”—that is, if it fails to support you while you sit—we rightly regard it as a bad chair, as it does not live up to our concept of what a chair entails. Put simply, our understanding of reality presupposes that ends are built into the nature of things (i.e., that a chair is naturally ordered toward the purpose of supporting you while you sit). Because of that, value judgments are interwoven with facts (i.e., the fact that a particular chair does not support you while you sit renders it a bad chair). Indeed, facts cannot be completely severed from values without neutering our understanding of knowledge.
Yet we attempt to separate the two with regard to human beings and morality. For example, “ Live your truth ” has become the relativistic refrain of our time. Truth, we insist, is personal. But this insistence is futile. Indeed, just as the nature of a chair points toward an end (supporting you while you sit), so the nature of man also points toward an end. But what is that end? Values Aren’t As Good a Concept as The Good
Before attempting to answer that, it must be pointed out that, contrary to our modern reference to “values,” classical philosophers spoke instead of “the good.” The difference is essential to understand. The term “values” implies a subjective or “personal preference” basis of morality, but classical philosophers used the term “the good” not to mean one’s personal beliefs or tastes, but a thing fulfilling its purpose (known in philosophy as “teleology”), or acting in accordance with its nature.
For instance, “the good” of a chair is to support you while you sit; “the good” of a watch is to tell time; “the good” of an acorn is to grow into a tree; “the good” of a squirrel is to exhibit “squirrelness”—to collect acorns, to grow a tail, to climb trees, reproduce, etc. Accordingly, “the good” of a human being is to act in accordance with human nature.
What, then, is the essence of human nature? Like a chair, the essence of a human being is to have properties of “humanity.” The first and most basic properties we might think of are things like consuming nutrients, growing, and reproducing. But while these are indeed features of human nature, they cannot be the essence of it, or we would be indistinguishable from plants and animals, who also exhibit these properties.
Our next thought may be more complex properties like sensory perception and locomotion. But while these properties distinguish us from plants, animals also possess the ability to sense and to move, so these cannot be the defining aspects of human nature either, otherwise there would be no “human nature” to distinguish from “animal nature.” So what, if anything, defines the essence of “humanity”? Rationality Inclines Towards Apprehending Truth
Unlike animals, human beings possess a rational mind, the end of which is to grasp the nature of things and to understand reality. As philosopher Edward Feser explains, “Rationality—the ability to grasp forms or essences and to reason on the basis of them—has as its natural end or final cause the attainment of truth, of understanding the world around us.”
Put differently, rationality has as its purpose the pursuit of truth. Furthermore, human beings choose to act in a way animals do not. Animals are slaves to their bodily instincts, but a soldier can defy the instinct for self-preservation and sacrifice himself for the greater good, just as an athlete can defy his appetite and adhere to a diet in order to achieve physical excellence. In a word, free will enables us to choose whether to overcome our natural instincts and do what is best for us.
This point is worth reflection. Not all our innate desires are inherently good. Thus, to live according to our nature does not mean fulfilling every instinct we have, no matter how base, but rather fulfilling the ends of our instincts.
The difference is vital to understand. For example, we have a natural desire for nourishment. When we are hungry, therefore, we should eat. However, the end of our instinct for nourishment is self-preservation. Because overindulgence and undernourishment jeopardize that end, they undermine our nature. It is between these extremes—food in moderate amounts—that represents “the good.”
Likewise, we are by nature social beings. We naturally seek community, the end of which is friendship and love. Nevertheless, we are also self-interested. Too much self-focus, however, becomes narcissism, which alienates us from our social nature. To achieve “the good” we therefore must control our selfish impulses. It’s Hard to Be Good, But That Doesn’t Negate It
Of course, classical philosophers recognized that overcoming our urges is often difficult, which is why they stressed the importance of good habits, or “virtues,” to help us do so. If we are to fulfill our humanity, we must exhibit virtues like courage, wisdom, temperance, and justice. Without them, we have little hope of living in accordance with human nature.
Naturally, however, the idea of living virtuously has today been rendered all but meaningless. That is because, as Leo Strauss once explained, “the crisis of modernity reveals itself in the fact, or consists in the fact, that modern western man no longer knows what he wants—that he no longer believes that he can know what is good and bad, what is right and wrong.”
That is result of having abandoned the teleological nature of reality, including the notion that there are ends built into human nature we ought to pursue in order to live well. Until we reaffirm that idea, we are bound to a reality void of both common sense and truth. David formerly worked at a public policy institution and is currently a freelance writer.

"No One Likes You, Bill De Blasio",thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/no-one-likes-you-bill-de-blasio/,"May 16, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
Before New York Mayor Bill de Blasio even officially announced his presidential bid on Thursday, New Yorkers were already pleading for him give up his White House ambitions.
De Blasio, who has been mayor of America’s largest city since 2014, is now one of the 25 Democratic candidates seeking a presidential nomination, despite the lack of support from his own constituents. His approval rating sits at 42 percent, and an April poll found that 76 percent of New York City voters did not want de Blasio to run for president. In March, a Monmouth poll found that de Blasio was the only Democrat asked about with a negative favorability.
While one would think his socialist policies, such as universal pre-k and the New York City Green Deal, would make him popular among his progressive-leaning constituency, he is consistently mocked for blunders and disingenuous attempts to relate to the working class.
For starters, it is well known that de Blasio’s hands are stained with the blood of Staten Island Chuck , the Staten Island Zoo’s groundhog whose real name is Charlotte, after he dropped her during a 2014 Groundhog Day ceremony. She died a few days after the incident from internal injuries.
Each morning, the mayor insists on traveling from his mansion on the Upper East side with a police escort to work out at the YMCA gym in Park Slope. In April, a concerned citizen hung a flyer at the Y with the disclaimer, “By entering these premises you agree not to run for President of the United States in 2020 or in any future presidential race. You agree to focus solely on your current job here in New York City, which you are not excelling at.”
And while these complaints may seem trite, there are plenty of other more weighty accusations against de Blasio for corruption, bribery, waste, rising homelessness, and public housing scandals under his watch.
A recent New York City Department of Investigation report revealed how de Blasio violated ethics laws in raising millions of dollars to help promote his own policies, and just a few weeks ago, two of his own donors pleaded guilty to campaign finance law violations. Another de Blasio donor was convicted in January for bribing NYPD officers.
Since the rollout of his decision to run began this week, the backlash has only intensified. On Monday, in an attempt to generate media attention, de Blasio held a rally inside Trump Tower to tout his record on climate change, and to criticize the president’s own emissions. The rally quickly backfired as the mayor was drowned out by the noise of protestors who were riding the Trump Tower escalators with “Worst Mayor Ever” signs.
On Thursday morning, when MSNBC asked New Yorkers on their morning commute what they thought of the mayor’s announcement, responses were overwhelmingly dissatisfied. “Is that a joke?” one citizen asked.
Perhaps de Blasio truly believes his New York toughness gives him an edge over the other 24 candidates to defeat Trump, the incumbent New Yorker. Or maybe he’s jealous of the wave of media attention the mayor of small-town South Bend, Indiana, a city that is 1 percent the size of NYC, has received since entering the race.
“I’m running for president because it’s time we put working people first,” de Blasio said in his official 2020 announcement video. If de Blasio’s message and aptitude are failing to resonate in his own city, which is heavily made up of “working people,” then it’s hard to see the potential of it catching on anywhere else across the nation.

Abortion Advocates Are Losing. Don’t Give Them A Lifeline.,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/16/abortion-advocates-losing-dont-give-them-lifeline/,"By David Harsanyi May 16, 2019
The case for life is a moral, philosophical, scientific, and political one. The last of these, however, only has traction when the others are persuasive.
It’s true that Alabama’s new abortion law takes a philosophically consistent position in establishing the legal personhood of unborn children without exception. Abortion in cases of rape and incest are fraught with questions of personal autonomy and mental anguish, but, if you believe an unborn child is a human being deserving of protection from violence, it’s morally consistent to also believe that one tragedy shouldn’t compound another.
As a political matter, however, the Alabama bill creates a situation that allows pro-abortion advocates to concentrate their pushback on the approximately 0.5 percent of procedures rather than the 99.5 percent. In turn, pro-lifers, now accused of protecting slack-jawed incestuous child rapists, are impelled to make the most challenging arguments about the rarest cases rather than make the most convincing arguments about the most common ones.
So while debates over rape and incest exemptions shouldn’t be treated flippantly or dismissed, the Alabama law has given abortion advocates a reprieve from defending the barbaric practice of discarding thousands of viable and near-viable fetuses every year for convenience’s sake.
The law itself, as Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey noted when signing, is probably unenforceable , and will almost surely be stopped by the courts. In the worst-case scenario for pro-lifers, the law might even wind up strengthening Roe v. Wade . If your goal is to save lives, not merely make pronouncements, this seems counterproductive—especially considering the fact that abortion advocates have been on the defensive for years.
When your opponents are compelled to defend the sale of body parts of unborn children for profit—as gruesome as the situation is—you are winning the debate. When your opponents are forced to support a Virginia governor who describes , in detail, how to commit negligent homicide when a baby survives an abortion attempt, you’re looking down from the higher moral ground.
Nearly every Democratic presidential candidate defended Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, and every one of them opposed a Sen. Ben Sasse bill that offered protection to newborns who were lucky enough to survive abortion attempts. Every Democratic Party presidential hopeful—although, to be fair, there are so many I might be missing someone—also supports unlimited abortion on demand for any reason until the ninth month of pregnancy. (Ask anyone who claims this contention is false to provide you with a single restriction supported by any of these candidates.)
These are radical, anti-humanist positions that not only remind us of the eugenicist roots of the progressive movement but are also far outside the mainstream. Nearly every poll—other than those paid for by Planned Parenthood—find that Americans support bans on post-20-week abortions in large numbers. An Washington Post/ABC News poll , for example, found that 56 percent prefer restrictions after 20 weeks over 27 weeks. And though Democrats like to pretend abortion is a patriarchal effort, poll after poll shows that women are just as likely to be pro-life as men.
Abortion advocates, more importantly, are also losing to science. And technological advances are intricately connected to the efficacy of the ethical argument.
The earliest premature baby to ever survive after delivery was 410 grams, 21 weeks and four days. She’s now a healthy toddler . She won’t be the last . And she won’t be the earliest for long. The survival of every one of these children chips away at the notion that abortion is a victimless process stripped of consequences.
The fact that abortion touches two lives has always been why activists have larded up the debate with misleading euphemisms like “reproductive rights” and “women’s health care.” It’s the reason abortion advocates detest talking about fetal pain and like to use medical terminology to rhetorically anesthetize the procedure and dehumanize the unborn baby.
It’s the reason abortion advocates like Alyssa Milano demand the media stop referring to “heartbeat bills” and start calling them “fetal pole cardiac activity bills.” They know nearly every parent who’s listened to an ultrasound of a heartbeat understands what it means. And it’s also the reason abortion advocates want to talk about the 0.5 percent of tragedies, and not the central catastrophe of abortion.
Georgia’s “heartbeat bill” and the 20-week bans that have been passed elsewhere move the movement forward in ways the Alabama law does not. While incrementalism might not come naturally to conservatives, especially in this era, it’s worth remembering that, in the end, the way to win the fight is to convince Americans that abortion is morally repugnant. To that end, science and decency are on your side, whether the law is or not. David Harsanyi is a Senior Editor at The Federalist.

College Board To Juke SAT Test Scores To Reflect Student 'Privilege',thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/college-board-juke-sat-test-scores-reflect-student-privilege/,"College Board To Juke SAT Test Scores To Reflect Student ‘Privilege’ 'If I am going to make room for more of the [poor and minority] students we want to admit and I have a finite number of spaces, then someone has to suffer and that will be privileged kids on the bubble.' By Joy Pullmann May 17, 2019
Since 2015, College Board has been experimenting with new metrics on its SAT college entrance exam to evaluate students based on 15 nonacademic factors, including school and neighborhoods’ crime, income, and single-parent statistics, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
The 15 factors do not include race, College Board told WSJ, but all of these socioeconomic factors heavily overlap with race, and racial differences were the driving reason for making these SAT alterations. At Florida State University, using this dashboard boosted nonwhite enrollment 5 percent in the past year, said campus administrator John Barnhill.
He told WSJ “he expects pushback from parents whose children go to well-to-do high schools as well as guidance counselors there. ‘If I am going to make room for more of the [poor and minority] students we want to admit and I have a finite number of spaces, then someone has to suffer and that will be privileged kids on the bubble.'”
In a beta test, this new metric was reported to applicants at 50 colleges this past year as an “adversity score” that only colleges see, not students. The score is separate from students’ SAT scores and is on a scale of 1 to 100, where 50 is average and 100 is a measure of “privilege.” This fall, 150 colleges will receive these “adversity scores” with student results, and ultimately all colleges who accept the SAT will.
It’s not clear whether College Board also provides colleges a SAT score adjusted in light of the “adversity score.” But that’s another distinction without a difference, as providing the “adversity score” is meant to put a thumb on the scale of the actual SAT results. WSJ gave further details:
The College Board declined to say how it calculates the adversity score or weighs the factors that go into it. The data that informs the score comes from public records such as the U.S. Census as well as some sources proprietary to the College Board, [College Board President] Mr. Coleman said.
…Several college admissions officers said they worry the Supreme Court may disallow race-based affirmative action. If that happens, the value of the tool would rise, they said.
‘The purpose is to get to race without using race,’ said Anthony Carnevale, director of Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce. Mr. Carnevale formerly worked for the College Board…
Representatives of institutions well-known for preferencing students based on race were quoted praising this addition to SAT results, including Yale University , the University of Michigan , and New Trier High School, which notoriously held racial grievance seminars for students in 2017. Harvard University, and others, is embroiled in a discrimination lawsuit for using socioeconomic factors to reduce their Asian and Caucasian student enrollment.
Lest anyone think his or her child can avoid being ranked according to theoretical “privilege” by simply taking the ACT instead of the SAT, College Board’s system will also spit out an “adversity score” for students who have taken the ACT, Yahoo! News reported : “College administrators can also plug in a prospective student’s ACT score into the dashboard, although the score from the rival test will be converted to the equivalent SAT score.”
And ACT, which in recent years surpassed the SAT in college entrance exam market share, is developing its own system “to better judge the merit of students from under-served backgrounds,” a spokesman said. It appears the Classical Learning Test , a relatively new college entrance exam free of this fiddle-faddle and now accepted at more than 150 higher-education institutions, could not have arrived at a better moment.
Coleman, College Board’s president, joined the organization in 2012 after helping convince Bill Gates to bankroll Common Core and push the Obama administration to foist it upon the nation using a federal grant competition during the 2008-09 recession. Common Core is a nationalized system of K-12 curriculum content mandates and tests used in almost all public schools and many private schools. Coleman was a lead writer for Common Core’s English language arts mandates.
When he took the helm at College Board, Coleman immediately planned then executed a revamp of the organization’s many tests and curriculum products to better fit Common Core . His tenure has been marked by repeated controversies over College Board’s technical failures and a dramatic increase in ideological leftism , including openly leftist revisions to advanced U.S. and European history courses administered to hundreds of thousands of the nation’s brightest high school students every single year.
Taxpayers send hundreds of millions of dollars to College Board every year, for Advanced Placement curriculum and tests to PSAT and SAT tests to teacher training and exclusive contracts with states and school districts. But that kind of financial hegemony is not enough for College Board. They want to alter society, too. In 2018, Coleman told an audience of his mission at College Board, “We’ve tried to move beyond giving tests to delivering opportunity.”
What does he mean by that, exactly?
“We’ve got to admit the truth, that wealth inequality has progressed to such a degree that it isn’t fair to look at test scores alone,” Coleman told the Associated Press in April . “That you must look at them in context of the adversity students face.” Joy Pullmann is executive editor of The Federalist, mother of five children, and author of "" The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids ,"" from Encounter Books.

Government Meddling Makes Amazing Cancer Treatment Harder To Get,thefederalist.com,Ashley Herzog,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/needless-government-meddling-making-amazing-new-cancer-treatment-harder-get/,"May 17, 2019 By Ashley Herzog
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy might be the cancer cure patients have been waiting for—if only the government would get out of the way. CAR-T therapy is a novel treatment that trains the body’s immune system to attack and kill cancer cells. It could be a game-changer for cancer patients, especially those who have run out of time and options: The National Cancer Institute says it might be effective at treating some late-stage cancers.
That is, of course, unless the government decides to interfere. In February, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a National Coverage Determination (NCD) for CAR-T defining under what circumstances CAR-T treatment is available to Medicare patients. It limits CAR-T treatment to hospitals alone, forcing otherwise viable treatment centers out of the marketplace. This singular provision in CMS’s otherwise sensible proposition threatens to undermine the entire proposal.
On May 17, the federal government is expected to make the final decision on whether to restrict access to this treatment, a decision that has faced significant condemnation from Republican and Democratic members of Congress alike. At the start of May, a bipartisan group of 47 legislators urged administrators to refrain from imposing unnecessary restrictions on this miraculous cancer treatment. But, in a vain attempt to control the cost of the therapy, the regulations may move forward regardless.
CMS’s decision inadvertently eliminates competition and gives hospitals every incentive to keep their prices sky-high. CAR-T already costs an estimated $395,000 to $439,000 per treatment. With a dearth of providers caused by arbitrary government restrictions on who can offer this life-saving treatment, hospitals have the upper hand over patients, who might otherwise seek cheaper treatment at a different facility.
The hospital mandate perverts CMS’s commendable objective to cover cancer patients. While likely unintentional, it nevertheless awards hospitals both profits and exclusive treatment rights. This will no doubt exacerbate costs.
Unfortunately, CAR-T is also hitting the market at a time health care is becoming less affordable for ordinary Americans. A major new survey released on May 2 by the Los Angeles Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that the cost of health care continues to rise dramatically. Over the last 12 years, annual health insurance deductibles have nearly quadrupled.
Fewer families than ever have the extra funds to cover the cost. Four in 10 Americans say they don’t have enough money saved to meet their deductible. This is especially true for people with serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, and, yes, cancer. These Americans are most likely to have trouble paying astronomical medical bills. They report skimping on medication or forgoing other necessities—like food and clothing—to afford health care.
This is despite government interventions, like the Affordable Care Act, that promised to make health care cheaper. The government hasn’t delivered on its promises. It’s only succeeded in making things worse. Americans need free-market solutions to spiraling health care costs. Boosting competition among hospitals will improve health systems, making treatments more accessible, while prices will fall.
Policymakers must eliminate the moral hazard and perverse incentives that the hospital mandate creates. This reorients the incentive structure by allowing drug manufacturers to produce the supply to meet the demand, instead of attempting to manipulate the system.
With treatment as new as CAR-T, there are undoubtedly ways to improve and streamline procedures in order to reduce costs. The way to do that is to allow a variety of different treatment centers into the marketplace to compete against each other for patients. Reducing the government red tape is a necessary first step.
Attempts to regulate health services and control the costs of treatment always backfire, inflating the cost of health care and making the problem worse. The solution is to remove arbitrary restrictions and let the free market take its course on CAR-T therapy.
For millions of Americans suffering from cancer, CAR-T is the answer to their prayers. Let’s not place arbitrary and counterproductive restrictions on where they can seek this miracle treatment. CMS ought to rethink its decision to restrict CAR-T treatment to hospitals only. After all, if it tries to control the price of CAR-T treatments through government regulation, it will, invariably, fail. Ashley Herzog is a freelance healthcare writer for the Heartland Institute."
'Cold War' Beautifully Depicts The Personal Costs Of Communism - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/with-a-love-story-cold-war-beautifully-depicts-the-personal-costs-of-communism/,"By Inez Feltscher Stepman and Jerzy Feltscher May 17, 2019
Conservatives often struggle to portray the true cost of socialism in terms of freedom and wasted opportunity. For a generation that doesn’t remember the Cold War or the joyful celebrations when the Berlin Wall collapsed, communism’s tremendous personal cost to millions of lives is no longer obvious.
Every so often, a film comes along that shows the depth of those costs in a poignant and beautiful way. So it is with the movie “Cold War,” a masterpiece from Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski, nominated for three Academy Awards and now available to stream on Amazon (free for Prime members). The movie tells the story of a couple caught between the iron grip of Communism on their home country and their artistic ambitions, deprived of the chance to be both authentic and free.
If we forget about the setting of “Cold War”— Poland in the early 1950s, under imposed Communist rule—the movie could be merely a beautifully shot film about two artists who share a tumultuous love story. Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) is an older composer and pianist, and the director of the Mazowsze (called Mazurka in the movie), the real-life famous Polish song-and-dance ensemble that popularized folk songs in the region. Zula (Joanna Kulig) is a younger singer, a talented upstart with a troubled and abusive family past that made the Mazurka her unlikely route to artistic success.
[Spoilers follow.]
But the film doesn’t open with their romance. Instead, Pawlikowski spends the initial half hour of the movie documenting how the Mazurka painstakingly built its authentic repertoire of folk songs and dances, and how they formed the basis for its great popularity. Villagers from all around the country record their songs for Wiktor and Irena, his ethnographer and choreographer, songs later transformed for the stage by Wiktor’s talents. Their dedication to the songs of Poland becomes the basis for the ensemble’s success, and gives Zula her chance to shine as a rising star.
But under the communist regime, nothing was permitted a reprieve from ideology. The Mazurka’s success ensures that it must bend its artistic integrity to sing the diktats of the Central Committee. In a meeting with Party apparatchiks, Irena refuses to destroy the artistic merit of the Mazurka, defiantly telling the Party that the peasants of Poland do not sing songs about communist land reform.
But her outburst is in vain; Lech, the “political officer” of the ensemble, shuts down all opposition to it becoming a Party mouthpiece. A banner bearing Joseph Stalin’s face rises behind the choir, and the project is fatally compromised to its creators. Although Wiktor is initially quieter than Irena, whom we never see again after she walks out of the first corrupted performance, he understands that the Party will not allow him to keep his integrity as an artist.
But Zula, a thoroughly apolitical person, does not yet understand how the intrusion of the communist apparatus will damage her artistic endeavors. She believes she can strike a bargain with the regime: sing a song here or there about land reform, spin a few lies for political officers, and continue to enjoy her first real success as an artist and her personal life with Wiktor.
When Wiktor hatches a plan for them to escape to the West during a tour stop in Berlin (still shockingly easy in the early days before the Berlin Wall), she doesn’t appear at the appointed meeting spot and he crosses alone. Although haunted by his love for Zula, Wiktor carves out a life for himself in Paris, then the premiere destination for “exiled” artists from the Eastern Bloc, playing in a jazz club and integrating himself into the artistic circles of the city.
While she continues to star in the Mazurka, Zula also cannot forget, so she finds a way to legally cross into the West, marrying a random Italian (she excuses the betrayal with “it wasn’t a church wedding, it doesn’t count”) and using that status to legally reunite with Wiktor in Paris. For the first time, “happy ever after” becomes a possibility for the couple. Instead, their time in Paris reveals to them why separation from their Polish roots undermines their artistic authenticity.
Wiktor attempts to build Zula’s place in Parisian artistic society, and to create for them both the careers they might have had in Poland were it not for the totalitarian intrusion of the communist state. But Paris is not Warsaw, and their milieu not only changes the superficial aspects of their lives, but also what they produce as artists and how they “sell” their talents.
Wiktor embellishes Zula’s painful family past to give her a backstory to sell to the French artistic set, and attempts to turn her into a kind of expat chansoniste , arranging French poetry for her to sing. He even re-writes their signature song from the Mazurka into French for Zula to record. The culmination of his efforts is a record well-accepted by the artists of Paris, who throw the couple a party for its release.
Despite finding artistic success in the eyes of Parisians, Zula believes the record, and their lives in Paris, are inauthentic. She feels degraded by Wiktor’s marketing efforts, and decries the record as “a bastard,” tossing it in the gutter.
Despite being able to succeed as a singer on the Parisian scene, she doesn’t feel as genuine as when she starred in the Polish Mazurka. Zula still fundamentally misunderstands the truth about the totalitarian regime that Wiktor learned at the meeting with Irena and the Party. She still believes she can have a meaningful artistic career and personal independence in the land of her birth. She makes the greatest mistake of their lives and, against all expectations, decides to return to Poland.
Wiktor has no such misunderstandings about the communist regime; he knows what awaits him in Poland is the destruction of his artistic career and possibly his life. Nevertheless, he cannot live without Zula, and decides to follow her. Matthew Continetti writes that this is the central paradox of “ Cold War :”“The imperatives of private life lead Wiktor to sneak back into a land whose politics make private life impossible.”
We see him next in a labor camp for political prisoners, pianist’s hands permanently broken. It is only then that Zula understands the nature of communism, and that there is no bargain possible. She sells herself both artistically, performing the cheap ballads of whatever country the communist government wished to cultivate as an ally at the moment, and literally, marrying Lech and bearing his son, to use his government connections to get Wiktor out of the camps.
By the end of the film, any possibility of maintaining their artistic and personal integrity has been stripped from Wiktor and Zula, along with any hope for happiness together. They return to the countryside where Wiktor once gathered the folk songs for the Mazurka. There, they marry as Catholic Poles, performing their own ceremony in a bombed-out cathedral, perhaps symbolizing the hollowed-out ruins of Poland, and commit suicide.
Who knows whether Wiktor and Zula could have made it as a couple; perhaps she was too temperamental, and he too assuming. But those who read the film as a doomed love story are missing that the imposition of the communist system on their country robbed them of the chance to find out. Tied to each other and to a nation transformed beyond recognition, they were left no space for their relationship to play out as it would between two free people.
Ultimately, the cost of the socialist system is the disappearance of that individual space—the space for people to love, worship, build careers, create art and families. The cost of that kind of system cannot be measured on an economist’s balance sheet. It’s measured in tragic and unfulfilled lives like Wiktor’s and Zula’s."
What We Know About The Justice Department's Spygate Investigations,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/know-far-justice-departments-spygate-scandal-investigations/,"By Margot Cleveland May 17, 2019
Conservatives cheered the recent news that Attorney General William Barr had assigned U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the launch of the investigation into the Trump campaign. After his name hit the press, journalists covering the Spygate scandal quickly realized that Durham was the prosecutor investigating former FBI lawyer James Baker for potential illegal leaks.
During his October 3, 2018, testimony to the House judiciary and oversight committees, Baker testified about his long-time friendship with Mother Jones reporter David Corn. But when Rep. Jim Jordan asked whether he had spoken with Corn about any FBI investigations, and specifically the Steele dossier, Baker’s attorney shut down the questioning. Baker’s lawyer told the committee Baker would not discuss any conversations with reporters because Baker was still the subject of a criminal investigation into illegal leaks. When pushed on who was handling that investigation, Baker’s lawyer said, “John Durham.”
In addition to Durham’s appointment, we know that former attorney general Jeff Sessions tapped Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber more than a year ago to investigate aspects of the Russia-collusion hoax. The office of Inspector General Michael Horowitz is also conducting an internal review, focusing on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act surveillance order.
While the breadth of Huber, Durham, and Horowitz’s investigations are unknown, when Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, he provided many clues to the scope of malfeasance the DOJ is looking at—and it appears to be a wide-ranging investigation.
For instance, during the May 1 questioning, when asked about “unauthorized media contact,” Barr responded, “We have multiple criminal leak investigations under way.” With the spotlight on Durham, we now realize Baker is one of those under investigation for illegal leaking, but this testimony makes clear that others are as well.
Barr was also asked if he had “looked into the decision by the FBI into why they launched a counterintelligence investigation,” and he responded, “I am looking into it and have looked into it.” And when asked whether he had “already tasked any staff to look into whether or not spying was properly predicated,” Barr testified, “Yes, I have people in the department helping me review the activities over the summer of 2016.”
Barr added more texture to the types of questions being probed when he was asked whether Carter Page was “under surveillance while he was working with the Trump campaign.” The attorney general responded that he didn’t know. Barr also did not know whether any other Trump campaign officials were under surveillance, but told the senators that those are things he “needs to look at.” We’re “trying to reconstruct exactly what went down,” Barr explained.
The Senate Judiciary Committee’s questioning of Barr also revealed several other areas of concern to the attorney general, including “the FISA warrant process,” “the investigation and how and why it was opened,” and the “lack of professionalism in the [Clinton] email investigation”—all things Barr says needed to be looked at.
Barr also testified about other details he is looking into, including when the DOJ and the FBI knew that the Democratic Party paid for the Steele dossier. As of two weeks ago, Barr did not know the answer to that question.
Barr also did not know if the DOJ, FBI, or other agencies had engaged in investigative activities targeting the Trump campaign before July 2016. And when asked, “When did surveillance of the Trump campaign begin?” Barr replied, “The position today appears to be that it began in July, but I do not know the answer to the question.” All of these questions, Barr explained, need be investigated.
Barr, however, isn’t stopping there: According to his testimony, he is also reviewing the special counsel’s investigation to determine what the special counsel looked into. From that inquiry we will learn whether Mueller’s team buried any facts or failed to pursue leads indicating, for example , that dossier author Steele lied about his Russian source, or instead that the Kremlin fed Steele misinformation in order to interfere in the 2016 presidential election—a question on which the special counsel report was silent.
These questions are likely just a handful of those being asked by Barr and his team, all for the purpose of answering the bottom-line question plaguing Barr: “How did we get to the point here where the evidence is now that the president was falsely accused of colluding with the Russians and accused of being treasonous and accused of being a Russian agent? The evidence now is that was without a basis. Two years of [Trump’s] administration have been dominated by allegations that have been proven false.”

Only Hacks Would Call Reason Writer Robby Soave A White Supremacist,thefederalist.com,,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/hacks-call-reason-writer-robby-soave-white-supremacist/,"By Libby Emmons May 17, 2019
The question at issue for a May 15 hearing of the House Oversight Committee was white supremacy and hate crimes in the United States, and how to deal with them. Witnesses were called who had expertise in the field, either through firsthand experience, or through research.
Among them were Reason writer Robby Soave. For providing the benefit of his extensive research into white supremacy, and the alt-right, he was called a “hate crime denier” by Andy Campbell in Huffington Post. I wrote a thing about the second congressional hearing in as many months that invited a hate crime denier to sit next to victims 🙃 https://t.co/9i9LvH74QS
— Andy Campbell (@AndyBCampbell) May 15, 2019
Soave brought a perspective that was not available from any of the other witnesses called. That he was invited to share the information he’d gleaned from interviews with racists speaks highly of the committee as interested in seeing as broad a picture of the problem of white supremacy as possible.
Soave responded on Twitter to Campbell’s inaccurate hit job, showing, accurately, that Campbell had attributed quotes Soave had provided from Richard Spencer as Soave’s own views. Sharing the words of a white supremacist with a congressional committee that directly asked you to do so is not white supremacist, nor white supremacist-adjacent. It is bearing witness. This @HuffPost write-up of my testimony before Congress yesterday doesn't even exist in the same universe as what actually happened. @AndyBCampbell claims I ""denied hate and white supremacy pose a threat at all,"" but even quotes me doing the opposite. https://t.co/5DblzHtxFJ pic.twitter.com/ZsGiB1mNVc
— Robby Soave (@robbysoave) May 16, 2019
After Campbell published his article about the hearing, he took to Twitter, misclassifying Soave as “a lying dingus” and a “bad faith actor,” and falsely claiming that Suoave argued that “hate crime isn’t a problem.” Soave said nothing like that at all, and Campbell’s evidence is a quote Soave provided from Spencer, which does not at all represent Soave’s own views.
Soave published an article detailing his experience. “In my remarks,” he writes, “I tried to get across the point that the alt-right is a small fringe group, and that white nationalists are responsible for a relatively small number of murders relative to the overall violent crime rate.”
He backs this up with statistics going back to 1995, showing that while there is wider reporting of hate crimes across the country now than in the 1990s, the numbers are substantially lower than when fewer municipalities were reporting. In Soave’s view, that does not diminish the horribleness of hate crimes, but puts it into a wider context, which is why he was invited to speak.
While Campbell took to misrepresenting Soave’s role at the hearing, calling him names on Twitter, and printing parsed quotes that misrepresent his views, Soave published the entirety of his prepared remarks . Campbell was looking for a villain, and instead of digging into the facts, he cast Soave as a white supremacist, which could not be further from the truth.
Soave, author of “Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump,” was the last of a series of witnesses to deliver prepared remarks at this hearing. Those who came before had direct experience with white supremacist hate crimes and quantifying that data. Soave closed his remarks in noting that his “goal in bringing a degree of nuance to these facts and figures is not to minimize the real harm extremists have caused, but to discourage the kind of alarmism that can prompt overreaction on the part of authorities. Law enforcement should receive the resources they need to combat violence, threats, and property defacement, whether or not these crimes are motivated by hate, or impugn a specific group.”
In fact, Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, who was killed at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, noted that many crimes that could be classified and reported as hate crimes are not, because crimes are easier to prosecute without the added burden of a hate-crime designation. Proving intent of hate is a higher burden of guilt, and when guilt can be proven without it, it is more expedient to do so in order to convict a criminal.
What gets lost in Campbell’s unsubstantiated abuse of Soave is that while hate crimes, white supremacist, and domestic terrorist violence exists in the United States, the biggest component of these vile ideologies is online. Additionally, there are data problems with reporting hate crimes, as it is not a mandatory requirement for any municipality or the FBI. Given these two realities, the inability to obtain accurate reporting, and the localizing of radical individuals online, making the story about another writer’s expert testimony is a waste of words.
Many of the proposed solutions to the problem of white supremacy and hate speech had to do with limited speech online. The Anti-Defamation League’s George Selim said, “Not only do white supremacist extremists spread this propaganda through fliers and banners and events, but on the internet, on social media as well… where they are proselytizing and conspiring and are less scrutinized than many instances by the public eye. Today’s propaganda is tomorrow’s hate and violence in our communities. More can, and must, be done to counter this threat and prevent it from getting worse.”
He went on to say that government and law enforcement must “work with the tech sector to enact common sense solutions to prevent the abuse on their platforms by white supremacists and their adherents.” What does that mean? It is essential that phrases such as “a common sense approach” be fully explained when applied to something as fundamental as free speech, and limitations thereof.
Campbell’s attacks on Soave ignored the real issues presented by this important hearing. So many people at this hearing had the best intentions for the furtherance of peace and civil rights in our country, and this kind of malignant misinterpretation only hurts the cause.
Soave is not a white supremacist, and Campbell’s insistence that he is does more to prove that much of the problem resides in how hate is defined, and how liberally and inaccurately the word is tossed around, than how widespread it actually is.

Honoring U.S. Soldiers Means Never Deploying Them Unless Necessary,thefederalist.com,Randall Larsen,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/honoring-americas-soldiers-means-never-deploying-unless-necessary/,"By Randall Larsen May 17, 2019
The month of May has two special days for our men and women in uniform: Armed Forces Day, when we recognize those currently serving, and Memorial Day, when we honor America’s fallen heroes. On the third Saturday in May, some will tip their hat and say, “Thank you for your service,” and on the final Monday in May, some will attend ceremonies at local cemeteries.
There is, however, something more important we all can do this month for our men and women in uniform: pledge that we will hold our political leaders accountable to never again deploy America’s armed forces into hostile environments without adequate force levels and resources.
Operation Desert Storm is a textbook example of political leaders following this pledge, and the battle best known as Black Hawk Down is an example of our political leaders (and those who elected them) failing in this pledge. As the former chairman of the Department of Military Strategy and Operations at the National War College, I am well aware of many examples of such successes and failures, but none more top of mind than the Battle of Mogadishu in October 1993.
I spent the past 15 months working on a documentary film, “Black Hawk Down: The Untold Story.” As I began the research in January 2018, I realized that many Americans would have little knowledge of this battle that occurred a quarter of a century ago. I began the film with a brief history. The Story of Black Hawk Down
On December 4, 1992, President George H. W. Bush addressed the nation from the Oval Office. He talked about how many Somalis had already died and how international relief organizations were predicting more than 1 million deaths from starvation if aggressive action was not taken. The president told the nation that the famine was not caused by climate change or crop failures.
The problem was that Somalia was a failed nation-state, and the Somali people were being used as pawns in a civil war between rival warlords. Bush talked about “warehouses filled to the brim with food, yet people were starving less than a kilometer away because the warlords were disrupting international food shipments.” The evening newscasts were filled with photos and videos of starving children, and the vast majority of Americans were demanding action—a compassionate deployment of U. S. military forces.
The initial operation, Restore Hope, was a great success, primarily because the commander in chief followed the “Powell Doctrine” and deployed an overwhelming force. The warlords were well armed, but when faced with 28,000 U.S. Marines in armored vehicles, the thugs went into hiding. The famine ended.
Unfortunately, everything changed just a few months into the Clinton administration. President Clinton withdrew the overwhelming U.S. force, along with their armored vehicles, and left just a small contingent of U.S. soldiers in Somalia to serve as a quick reaction force for 21 other nations’ forces deployed under the U.N. flag.
The Somali warlords quickly responded. Violence returned to the streets of Mogadishu, and not only against the Somali people. On June 5, 1993, the armed militia of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid killed 24 Pakistani peacekeepers and wounded 44.
What happened next has been described in a number of reports, books, documentaries, and even an Academy Award-winning film. The most recent account, “Black Hawk Down: The Untold Story” describes the heroic actions of the soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division who fought their way into a “baited ambush” to rescue the 99 special operations troops trapped at the crash site of the first Black Hawk helicopter shot down on October 3, 1993. Gen. Mark Milley, the U.S. army chief of staff, has several appearances in this film and describes the battle as “the most ferocious urban combat since the battle of Hue during the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam.” The Battle of Mogadishu
During the Battle of Mogadishu, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and another 78 wounded. Many of the soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division rode into combat in vehicles that provided no more protection than a standard sedan, because Secretary of Defense Les Aspin had turned down the request from senior military leaders for U.S. armored vehicles. After the first rescue attempt failed to penetrate the numerous ambush sites, a second assault was made by putting U.S. soldiers in Malaysian armored personnel carriers (APCs).
The soldiers from the 2nd Battalion 14th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division (2-14) rode into combat on this second rescue attempt in vehicles that protected them from machine gun fire, but not from scores of rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) that destroyed many of the APCs. Furthermore, the Clinton administration’s decision to not provide the requested U. S. armored vehicles meant that our soldiers rode into combat in vehicles driven by Malaysian soldiers who did not speak English. As one 2-14 soldier says, “We were going into a nighttime urban battle, in a white vehicle with UN painted on the side, driven by Malaysians who did not speak our language.”
I made this film for two reasons. First, to tell the heretofore untold story of the soldiers from 2-14, and second, to remind the American public that we must learn a key lesson from this battle. When we feel the tugs on our heartstrings, and listen to the pleas from TV talking heads that U. S. military forces must be deployed to avoid a humanitarian disaster—like we are now hearing about the crisis in Venezuela—we must ask three questions: 1) Are U. S. vital national security interests at stake? 2) Do we have a clearly defined exit strategy? 3) Are we willing to deploy a military force adequate to the threat environment? Only Deploy Forces Under Very Specific Conditions
There may be occasions when a situation dictates the deployment of U.S. forces even though vital U.S. national security interests are not at stake, and even times when the requirement for rapid response may mean that a fully developed exit strategy has not yet been completed.
However, we must never again deploy forces that are not adequately equipped for the threat to our troops. If the soldiers of 2-14 had ridden into the Battle of Mogadishu in the M-1 tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles requested several months earlier, there would not have been much of a battle. This overwhelming force would have significantly limited casualties, on both sides.
On this Memorial Day weekend, there will be no better way to honor America’s fallen heroes than for all of us to remember this lesson from Mogadishu and pledge that we will never again let our compassion override our good judgment.

Trump’s Plan To Reform Legal Immigration Is Long Overdue,thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/trumps-plan-reform-legal-immigration-long-overdue/,"By John Daniel Davidson May 17, 2019
The immigration plan President Trump unveiled in a speech yesterday afternoon seems to have something in it for everyone to hate. Immigration hardliners on the right are upset it doesn’t include a reduction in overall immigration levels. Opponents on the left—who were never going to support a Trump plan, regardless of its merits—say it’s a non-starter because it doesn’t include a path to citizenship for those who illegally crossed the border as minors.
But this lack of support says more about the irreconcilable differences between left and right than it does about the virtues of the proposal itself, which are considerable.
At its most basic level, Trump’s plan aims to reshape our immigration system by prioritizing employment instead of family reunification. Other elements to the plan include bolstering border security and reforming the asylum system, but the most important proposed change is the shift to a “merit-based” system for legal immigration.
Why is that such a big deal? Because the United States, unique among developed countries, maintains a quixotic and outdated immigration system—created in 1965—in which the vast majority of immigrants are admitted through family reunification, often referred to as “chain migration,” and for good reason. If someone comes to the United States on a work visa, he can sponsor his adult parents, who in turn can sponsor their relatives, and so on. When Trump said in his speech Thursday that we’re admitting people based on “random chance,” this, along with our visa lottery system, is what he’s talking about.
Countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Japan don’t do this. They use a points-based system that prioritizes visas for certain kinds of workers. In Canada, for example, there’s no visa lottery, and the vast majority of immigrants are admitted as part of economic programs to meet skills shortages in the labor market. The Canadian points-based system includes categories like education, proficiency in English and French, age, and work experience. Same with Australia and the United Kingdom.
Trump is essentially proposing such a system for the United States. His plan envisions a “Build America visa” that incorporates parts of Sen. Tom Cotton’s 2017 RAISE Act, awarding points based on things like age, special skills, a job offer, an advanced education, and a plan to create jobs.
While the details are still scant—Trump’s announcement Thursday wasn’t accompanied by a bill or any legislative language—the administration is essentially proposing a system that looks a lot like what other peer countries have. As it is, Trump said, “We discriminate against genius, we discriminate against brilliance,” which in a sense we do. To the extent Trump wants to change that, he’s on the right track.
Of course, some on the left will characterize this, as one Vox reporter did , as “keeping the poors out,” when in reality it would merely bring U.S. immigration policy into alignment with what the rest of the developed world does. Imperfection Is Not A Good Reason to Oppose This Plan
As a practical matter, if Trump’s plan ever became policy it would likely dramatically increase immigration from Asia. More than 80 percent of those whose employment-based visas have been approved but are held up by annual caps live in China, India, and the Philippines. A majority of immigrants from Asia have bachelor’s degrees , and would therefore have a decided advantage in vying for work visas under this new system.
That said, the plan unveiled Thursday has almost no chance of becoming law. It’s effectively a 2020 campaign document, meant to define what the Trump administration—and by extension, the GOP—supports, and force Democrats to react to it. But that’s another reason immigration hawks on the right, like the Center for Immigration Studies’ Mark Krikorian, oppose it. “Formally embracing the current legal-immigration level of more than one million each year would mean that the GOP, as on so many issues before, would simply be the Democrat-lite party, wanting to go in the same direction, just more slowly,” writes Krikorian.
Another mark against the plan, at least for some conservatives, is that it doesn’t address the current border crisis, which is being driven by Central American families and minors seeking asylum after illegally crossing the southwest border. A bill unveiled Wednesday by Sen. Lindsey Graham would tackle this, requiring Central Americans to apply for asylum in their home countries, increasing the amount of time families and children can be detained, from 20 days to 100, and adding 500 judges to tackle a massive backlog of immigration cases.
Whatever the particular complaints the right might have with the administration’s proposed immigration overhaul, conservatives should at least by able to agree that the current, 1960s-era system has outlived its usefulness and that we need a modernized immigration system that puts the American economy and American interests first. That’s the direction Trump’s plan would take us, and it’s about time. John is a senior correspondent for The Federalist. Follow him on Twitter.

A Supreme Court Biography That Should Be Held In Contempt - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/a-supreme-court-biography-that-should-be-held-in-contempt/,"By Tony Daniel May 17, 2019
Joan Biskupic has delivered the book on U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts that we might expect from a CNN legal analyst and Nina Totenberg heir apparent. Nobody expects a biographer to be as smart, able, or skilled as his subject, and Biskupic doesn’t challenge that notion in the slightest with The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts .
The book begins as biography, but soon becomes a repetitive bout of liberal scolding, mostly to do with her conception of civil rights, that goes on for seemingly endless pages. Biskupic’s The Chief is mostly false generalization and faux-genial nonsense filled with cloying journalistic condescension toward Roberts and everything he believes in.
The book leads off with a longish digression on the ethnic origins and socio-economic background of Roberts’s parents and grandparents. Roberts’s father was an assistant plant manager with U.S. Steel. Biskupic delivers a bare recounting of Roberts’s childhood in Youngstown, Ohio and his teenage years in Long Beach, Indiana. She juxtaposes Roberts’ suburban upbringing with various civil rights happenings going on in the late 1950s and early ’60s.
It is neither ironic nor particularly informative to learn that the Selma March or George Wallace grandstanding on the University of Alabama campus had very little effect on a pre-teen Roberts, but we are treated to multi-page recountings of such well-known events nonetheless. Biskupic might better have spent her time and our attention on young Roberts’s nearby environs, his friendships, activities—and the development of his deep religious faith grounded in the Catholic Church. Instead, we get a lot of bewilderment that a smart boy like that didn’t grow up to become a proper liberal. ‘Mr. Everything’
We do learn that Roberts was an overachieving, nervous young man who determined his course early on (and gave himself stress-induced stomach troubles that would last until the present). At 13, he applied for a spot in newly formed Catholic boarding school La Lumiere in South Bend, Indiana, not far from his home. Biskupic reproduces his application letter, which is quite well written and convincing, and a youthful foreshadowing of Roberts’s later, justly famous advocacy of positions as an appellate court lawyer.
Roberts proceeded to blaze through his high school as he would soon do at Harvard University, where he majored in history, and then at Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the law review. Roberts had smarts to spare, but the key to his personality seems to be an ability to drive himself mercilessly to work. Biskupic points out that the chief justice essentially hasn’t varied his work routine much since getting into La Lumiere.
Roberts clerked for Second Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Henry Friendly and directly after that for Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist (who was not yet the chief when Roberts clerked for him). Roberts went on to serve in two positions in the Reagan administration, first as an assistant to Attorney General William French Smith’s chief of staff Ken Starr. He then moved to the White House General Counsel’s office under attorney Fred Fielding.
When Bill Clinton was elected, Roberts left government service and began his appellate court practice at Hogan and Hartson, which eventually made him a fortune. He returned to public service under George W. Bush a wealthy man.
Ken Starr has perhaps the most astute observation on Roberts’ personality when he states, “I think his deeply Catholic upbringing and his going to an intellectually stimulating high school are at the roots of his character. He was able at that high school [La Lumiere] to be Mr. Everything.”
“Mr. Everything” will be a good title for the eventual popular biography of Roberts that tells a more accurate story. Roberts chief flaws are the things you admit to in a job interview. “I work too hard, I guess,” or “I’m a studious introvert at heart, but I’ve learned to be extroverted when called for.” In Roberts case, these would be true.
Here, one wishes for more such personal detail rather than Biskupic’s wearisome ideologically slanted litany of recent historical events, and her disapproval of Roberts’ take on them. Here is her pronouncement on Roberts’ thoughts concerning voting rights case Shelby County v. Holder , for instance:
Roberts also asserted that the ‘effects test’ would create a right to a quota-like ‘proportional racial representation’ on city councils and all forms of government.
That contention was not true. Nor was it true that no evidence of voting rights abuse existed. Race discrimination in voting was still widely documented, particularly in southern states such as Alabama.
This is one of many instances where Biskupic calls out Roberts’ considered opinions as factually false—she simply negates them as if the chief justice were an errant school boy—in a manner that suggests she has had a dispensation of truth from on high (or, perhaps even better, from Lawrence Tribe). Here’s another:
Overall, Roberts revealed just how fundamental his objection to race-based policies was. He had long believed that the Constitution’s equal protection clause was intended to ensure that people were treated as individuals, rather than as members of a group that could be singled out for certain treatment based on skin color. This reasoning sounded logical enough, but Roberts’s view was (and is) belied by reality.
Oh, really? Or is it actually spot-on, since prima facie it obviously is? Biskupic is convinced that she not only knows better than the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, she is also in a position to give him a talking-to on the matter. The lecture doesn’t take the form of a point-by-point rebuttal but an offhand dismissal of Roberts’ beliefs as either childish or inexplicably perverse. After all, everybody who is anybody knows that white Alabamans are a bunch of racists!
In fact, here and elsewhere Biskupic imagines Alabama in particular, and the deep south generally, in terms of a newsreel image from 1962. Her characterization of the facts in Shelby County v. Holder indicates she believes she’s dealing with a downtrodden rural backwater of a county, rather than an area that has for decades contained a collection of Birmingham’s nouveau riche suburbs feeding off the city’s financial, technological, and bioengineering renaissance. Birmingham has had a black mayor since 1979, by the way—seven in all. Biskupic makes continual wild generalizations about the state, and amply demonstrates she doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
Biskupic seems to inhabit a world where only race and sex have moral weight, and free markets are not to be trusted. We get plenty on Shelby County and Citizens United . Nothing on important Second Amendment Supreme Court decisions, and mere mentions of eminent domain limitations or intellectual property rights. Kelo might as well never have been decided.
Almost needless to say, Biskupic’s isn’t living in the world where Americans have resided for the past three generations. Bull Connor and Pan Am are no longer with us, but rapid technological innovation and economic shuffling (and huge improvements for most Americans) most certainly have been the hallmark of the past 30 years. Complex Questions?
After a long section on Reagan-era doings (and the implication that President Reagan and his team were probably closet racists), we finally get back to reality, and find that Roberts, the consummate workaholic, did not get around to marrying until his mid-forties. Or, to be more charitable, he did not meet Jane Sullivan, the right woman, until then.
Unfortunately, John and Jane had trouble conceiving, so the Robertses ended up adopting (through serendipitous chance via two agencies) boy and girl newborns separated by five months. Roberts returned to public service and was appointed an appellate judge when Republicans returned to power under George W. Bush. This meant that Roberts’ years as an appellate judge on the DC Circuit were also his years as the father of toddlers.
When we get to Roberts’ Supreme Court years, Biskupic entirely abandons biography for scolding. Biskupic’s rhetorical style is grounded in the fallacy of the complex question. She presents herself as if in a constant state of amazement that the chief justice of the Supreme Court might disagree with her.
To explain this, Biskupic finds the nearest semi-relevant Roberts quote for an answer to a “how often do you beat your wife” type of question, then takes that response out of context, excoriating the justice for being either narrow-minded or perverse—or both. It is a wearying tactic for the reader who is actually interested in considering Roberts’s opinions, and seemingly the only arrow in Biskupic’s writerly quiver.
What Biskupic most takes issue with is Roberts’ interpretation of civil rights laws, particularly the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as meant by Congress to be colorblind. “Roberts believed that policies classifying students based on skin color simply had not worked over the years, and, in fact, that they had exacerbated racism,” she says.
Of course, Biskupic is quick to then point out that Roberts’ view “belies reality.” Why that might be so is more a bit more problematic to explain, so Bisklpic goes for the old standby, expert testimony. The experts, in this case, are “social scientists.”
Undergirding Brown had been evidence that black children suffered when confined to all-minority schools and that children placed in integrated schools improved academically. A large group of social scientists submitted an amicus brief to the Court in the new cases saying that evidence continued to support the finding that members of racial minorities benefited from integrated schools. They told the justices that many school districts had become resegregated.
Well, that settles it. What was Roberts thinking?
Furthermore, Biskupic seems to hold in contempt the idea that America has largely realized the aim of the act, and its provisions are nowadays mostly irrelevant to modern society. Like most of the legal academic establishment with which she identifies, she can’t let a surreal vision of the 1960s go, including a wildly overestimated view on the relative importance of lawyers during that time. The Mandate
Biskupic rightly spends considerable time on Roberts’ most controversial ruling as an individual justice, National Federation for Independent Business v. Sebelius , the Obamacare individual mandate case. Biskupic says the chief at first sided with justices Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. But Roberts was never happy with invalidating a law as passed by Congress. It was his bedrock assumption, stated time and again, that judges are supposed to be umpires, not political players. He believed the individual mandate was invalidated by the Commerce Clause in the Constitution that gives Congress the power to regulate commerce, but not the power to compel individual purchases.
But instead of throwing out Obamacare, he sought a way to save what was, for better or worse, the current law of the land as passed by a democratically elected Congress. He did not want to nullify it via what he viewed as judicial activism—in this case originating on what was perceived to be the right. To do so ran against his conservative instinct.
Roberts found his answer in the taxation authority of Congress, which had been a secondary supporting argument by Eric Holder’s Justice Department team:
President Obama had tried to avoid the term ‘tax.’ But for the legal case, administration lawyers said the individual mandate operated on a practical level as a tax. The penalty for not purchasing insurance was based on a percentage of household income and had to be recorded on annual income tax forms.
Roberts’s colleagues on each side of the issue seemed to be nonplussed by his decision to rule the Obamacare individual mandate as ultimately constitutional because it fell under Congress’s taxing power. Roberts, of course, got no credit from the left for careful thinking, and there was a great deal of speculation on the right that Robert was truckling under to Washington political culture and threats to pack the court from the Obama administration.
A third option would be to take the chief at his word and, agree or disagree, and allow that he came to his decision in good faith and after a great deal of intellectual wrangling. An Incomplete Portrait
One unintended consequence of Roberts’s decision in National Federation for Independent Business v. Sebelius is to invalidate the thesis of Biskupic’s entire book. Biskupic states time and again that Roberts is hidebound and fixed in his ways regardless of facts or circumstances, yet she remains notably silent on a Roberts decision that went the way she wanted it to.
Thus far in Roberts’ tenure as chief, it seems clear to an observer without ideological blinders that Roberts is very much an American centrist on judicial philosophy. Perhaps because he is chief justice, he has adjusted his rightward stance and is coming down about where the center of the country would come down politically. This is manifestly not the extremist position where Biskupic or the legal academy so often find themselves, and label “the center.” Biskupic’s idea of a centrist is perhaps someone like David Souter or Elena Kagan.
Moreover, viewing Roberts as a centrist explains both his infamous split-the-difference decision in the Obamacare individual mandate case, as well as his appalled dissent to the Supreme Court’s gay marriage decree in the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, where he stated that there is nothing in the Constitution about gay marriage, adding that the legislatures were already allowing the issue a national airing, and the court was only going to freeze into place animosities that would otherwise have worked themselves out in the political arena. In both cases, Roberts is working from a thought-through judicial philosophy. He may be wrong, even misguided, but he seems neither squish nor bigot.
As far as Biskupic’s incomplete portrait is concerned, perhaps the reader could fill it in by considering that the reason Roberts had held onto so many beliefs and opinions from his younger days is that, his erstwhile biographer’s claims to the contrary, those convictions turned out to be correct.

Senator Amy Klobuchar Refuses To Condemn Late-Term Abortion On 'The View',thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/senator-amy-klobuchar-refuses-condemn-late-term-abortion-view/,"May 17, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
When Senator Amy Klobuchar made a stop on “The View” Friday as part of her campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination, she joined the ranks of many other extreme pro-abortion Democratic leaders who are in favor of late-term abortion.
When co-host Meghan McCain asked Klobuchar if she was in support of late-term abortion and Virginia Governor Ralph Northam’s comments on infanticide , the senator dodged the question, only commenting that she is for women having the right to make a choice for their own bodies.
Co-host Joy Behar helped run interference for Klobuchar, shouting down McCain for bringing up a topic that is “based on a lie” and “not true.”
“I don’t think it should be that hard to say ‘I’m not for late-term abortion,” McCain said.
While the recent abortion conversation currently dominating the media focuses on “fetal heartbeat” bills and the new bill in Alabama banning almost all abortions, earlier this year, New York state legalized abortion-on-demand up until the point of birth. Governor Ralph Northam endorsed a similar bill in Virginia (the bill was defeated), as well as the idea that a fully developed child could be killed after birth. And yet, these extreme bills received a fraction of the media and celebrity attention now directed at states like Alabama and Georgia.
Three out of four Americans support abortion restrictions and believe abortions should not be legal after the first trimester, according to a recent Marist Poll. The first trimester ends after 12 weeks of gestation.
If Klobuchar has any desire to win over moderates or conservatives as she campaigns for president, refusing to condemn abortion in the second or third trimester sure isn’t a winning strategy.

Mom Reveals How Her Lefty Tribe Breeds Affection For The Alt-Right,thefederalist.com,Hans Fiene,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/mom-reveals-lefty-political-tribe-breeds-affection-alt-right/,"By Hans Fiene May 17, 2019
In a recent article for The Washingtonian , an anonymous author makes the argument that leftists, not conservatives, are the ones responsible for making the alt-right look so appealing to disgruntled young dudes.
Granted, Mommy Alt-Right doesn’t intentionally blame Woke Progressives for her teenage son Sam’s descent into alt-right rebellion. But as the author details her teenage son’s journey into (and, thankfully, out of) alt-right hell, the indictment of leftist “tolerance” goblins couldn’t be much clearer.
In order to understand why leftism helped drive this young man and many others into the clutches of evil alt-right buffoonery, let us first consider the psyche of the average pubescent male. What does a middle- or high-school boy value? What does he desire in life? What does he want from the world? Here are a few answers. A Righteous Cause
Although children begin to understand right and wrong at a much earlier age than middle school, kids often begin forming ethical systems in their adolescent years. In the occasional free moment when hormones aren’t causing them to obsess about the opposite sex, your average adolescent will often obsess over these newfound moral principles and philosophies, seeking out a cause that he believes can make him into a righteous person.
Once he’s found his cause, this adolescent will often become an overzealous, overnight disciple—firmly devoted to defending the downtrodden and upholding all that which is good and true, as defined by his movement of choice, be it intersectionality, vegetarianism, atheism, or alt-right antagonism. Nonconformist Conformity and Tribal Protection
Very often, adolescents believe that the more unique and different they are from their peers, the more valuable they are. Yet, because they still recognize that social value is not self-generated but granted to them by others, being a nonconformist puts them at risk of being socially ostracized.
To resolve this conflict, the average adolescent will often seek out a community of like-minded people who will embrace him. Such communities are often found among those who share his commitment to the aforementioned righteous cause he’s chosen—friends who will give him so much acceptance that he won’t have to conform to the social expectations of “normies” to feel accepted.
Maintaining that acceptance, however, will require the nonconformist teen to continue conforming to the expectations of his fellow nonconformists. To Irritate Adults
Adolescents like saying things that adults tell them not to say. It doesn’t particularly matter what ideology lurks behind the taboo statement, be it “capitalism is bad,” “Hitler was misunderstood,” or “regular Oreos are better than double stuff.” Whatever irritates adults, whatever makes them scream and howl and lament the state of the youths today, that’s the stuff the youths want to say.
Here are the key elements of Sam’s story: Sam was a 13-year-old kid who frequently spoke with his friends about not wanting to be conformist idiots like their classmates. One day a female classmate eavesdropped on a private conversation between Sam and a friend, misunderstood something he said as sexual in nature, then reported him for sexual harassment.
An administrator then raked Sam over the coals in front of his progressive parents, who barely came to his defense. He was then forced to write an apology to the girl, even though he’d done nothing wrong to her. Then, after having his life torn apart by the progressive dogma of “never believe men,” Sam began discovering alt-right voices on Reddit, who acknowledged his status as a victim and welcomed him into a movement despised by his peers and parents.
In other words, the alt-right became appealing to Sam because it promised to let him hit these three things adolescents love: a righteous cause, non-conformity conformity, and the ability to irritate the adults in his life. Sam Found All Three
Why was Sam attracted to the “righteous cause” of warring against feminism? It wasn’t because conservatives gave him a taste for woman-hating and he began to crave the purer form of misogyny offered by the extremists. Rather, it was because the leftist administrators at his school decided he didn’t have enough intersectionality points to merit the presumption of innocence and that demonizing an innocent kid wasn’t as important as the “believe all women” article of their creed.
Likewise, because his progressive parents couldn’t muster much more than a tepid defense of their son, progressivism left him feeling alone and helpless, so he sought refuge in the people he presumed were progressivism’s greatest enemies—the alt-right.
Who were the conformists that Sam wanted to distinguish himself from? It wasn’t a bunch of Reaganites mindlessly reciting talking points in favor of trickle-down economics. It was a bunch of lefty progressives mindlessly regurgitating intersectional talking points like “women don’t lie” that were responsible for his suffering.
Likewise, why did Sam conform to the expectations of the alt-right and further bury himself in their ugly ideology? It wasn’t because conservatives were threatening to attack him if he lost the approval of his tribe and found himself without their protection and alone again. It was because progressives were the ones flashing their teeth, waiting to devour him, at least in Sam’s mind.
Furthermore, who was providing Sam the list of forbidden words that his adolescent heart couldn’t wait to speak? It wasn’t the Republican National Committee or the Heritage Foundation. It wasn’t right-leaning teachers who vowed to fail any student who dared criticize the goodness of free markets. It was the leftists in his school who nearly expelled him for uttering something that might possibly have been one of the outlawed un-inclusive words that was added to the list of unforgivable blasphemies merely 15 seconds ago.
In summary, Sam didn’t seek out the alt-right because conservatism made it look acceptable and harmless. Rather, he sought it out because leftism backed him into a corner and the tiki-torch wielding dweebs seemed the only way to find escape and acceptance. The Left Devours Its Own
Sam is not alone in this. Leftism is not merely a political ideology; it’s an all-consuming religious system built around demonizing its opponents, denying them forgiveness, and devouring its own when the supply of infidels runs out.
It’s a faith that seeks expansion not be winning hearts, but by overtaking institutions and driving out all opposition—something this religion has accomplished quite well in recent years, especially in public schools across the country. LGBT indoctrination is rampant . Propaganda-filled textbooks abound . Bringing a Bible to school gets you reamed out by your teacher .
Leftism has ceased to be the hip, brave, rebellious movement that its adherents imagine, at least in the eyes of many adolescent boys. Rather, they’ll often see it as the ideological equivalent of wearing Abercrombie and Fitch in the late ’90s. It’s the default cause for mindless automatons. It’s useless, boring, and oppressive to anyone who runs afoul of its dogma. It needs to be mocked, defied, and defeated.
The more leftists insist on destroying the lives of anyone who opposes them, the more attractive they’ll make the alt-right seem to angry adolescent boys who want to rage against the progressive machine.
Likewise, when woke progressives try to lump mainstream conservatives in with the alt-right, we’ll all have a harder time convincing angry adolescent boys to avoid the Richard Spencers of this world. Telling kids that “the Jews control the banks” is just as offensive as “the wage gap isn’t real,” as Sam’s mom seems to believe, and they’ll (wrongly) think anti-Semitism is just as harmless as feminist talking point-skepticism.
Tell kids that they are white supremacists for questioning any of the progressive dogmas and they’ll become desensitized to the term—so desensitized, in fact, that they might not be afraid to let actual white supremacists bend their ears for an ideological sales pitch.
As with all fads, I’m sure that the league of alt-right middle schoolers will eventually disband. If so-called progressives want to make that happen sooner rather than later, it would behoove them to consider walking back their own extremism a bit. They don’t have to walk it back completely, of course. Just enough so that they don’t make a bunch of vitamin-D deficient, citronella-smelling dorkwads with evil beliefs seem cooler by comparison.

"'Wine Country' Is Just Terrible, And The Inside Jokes Might Be Why - The Federalist",thefederalist.com,,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/17/wine-country-just-terrible-inside-jokes-might/,"May 17, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
“Wine Country” is a poorly executed “Bad Moms.” It’s outright cringe-inducing from start to finish, save for a merciful flash of comedy every 20 minutes or so. Not even a bottle of cab can dull the pain. Two might be a start. (Just kidding, don’t do that.)
Watching the film is like being on the outside of an inside joke for 90-plus minutes—and not a good one, but the kind where everyone involved is in self-satisfied stitches while everyone else is just annoyed. With a cast that includes hilarious, close-knit “Saturday Night Live” alumni like Amy Poehler (who also produced and directed), Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, and Ana Gasteyer, expectations for “Wine Country” were reasonably high. They are not met.
The writing is terrible. I don’t know how else to put it. The jokes are not funny. There’s a genuinely good bit involving Fran Drescher somewhere in the middle of the film, Jason Schwartzman has his moments, and Tina Fey’s character is amusing, but for the most part, “Wine Country” doesn’t kick up many laughs, and not for lack of trying. (The recurring “Things we say now” joke is painful.) Imagine a movie made only from the bad parts of “Bridesmaids” and “Sisters,” and you pretty much have “Wine Country.”
It’s hard to say what went wrong. Paula Pell and Emily Spivey join Poehler, Rudolph, Dratch, and Gasteyer in the core cast. Spivey co-wrote the script with Liz Cackowski—both former “SNL” writers—based on a real trip the group made in celebration of Dratch’s 50th birthday. “Our characters are very close to who we are with some artistic license heightening it,” Pell told Vulture.
Maybe that’s the problem. Pell points to a scene where her character gifts the others with sex toys as one element of the actual trip that was replicated in the film. You can see how it might have been funny in person, but the humor doesn’t translate onto the screen at all. It’s like they created a movie that was funny to themselves, assuming it would be funny to everyone else (a mistake I often made on high school video projects).
Reviews for “Wine Country” have been lukewarm , which is somewhat baffling. Critics enjoyed it much more than audiences did, according to Rotten Tomatoes, where the movie’s 67 percent Tomatometer rating is much higher than its 32 percent audience score.
Maybe it was the girl-power element. Maybe some people found the emotional dynamics relatable. But as much as I love Poehler and Co., I wouldn’t have gotten more than 15 minutes into “Wine Country” if it weren’t my job. I advise skipping it altogether and watching “Dead to Me” instead.
