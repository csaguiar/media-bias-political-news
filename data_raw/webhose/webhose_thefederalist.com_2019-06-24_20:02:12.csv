Lawsuit Suggests Spying On Trump Campaign Started In Early 2016,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/28/lawsuit-suggests-spying-trump-campaign-started-early-2016/,"By Margot Cleveland May 28, 2019
Late last week, Svetlana Lokhova, a Russian-born English citizen, sued presumed Spygate frontman Stefan Halper and three media giants—the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and MSNBC—for defamation and conspiracy, alleging the defendants falsely painted her as a Russian spy and Michael Flynn paramour in order to push the Russia collusion narrative.
Lokhova’s 66-page complaint reads more like a political shock jock transcript than a legal document: “Stefan Halper is a ratf—er and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 Presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America,” her lawsuit opened. But behind the colorful language—clearly crafted for public consumption—Lokhova’s lawsuit lays out facts that suggest spying on the Trump campaign began in early 2016 and with the aid of British intelligence.
In her lawsuit, Lokhova detailed how she first met the retired general and short-lived Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn. In January 2014, while working to complete her Ph.D. at Cambridge University, her mentor Professor Christopher M. Andrew (“Andrew”), and Sir Richard Dearlove (“Dearlove”), invited Lokhova to attend a group dinner with Flynn.
Andrew and Dearlove are connected to British intelligence, with Andrew having served as the official historian to “MI5,” the counterintelligence organization in the UK, and Dearlove having spent “decades with British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), known as MI6,” and serving as its director from 1999 to 2004.
Lokhova stated the purpose of the dinner was to promote what was to become the Cambridge Security Initiative (CSI), “a group chaired by Dearlove,” which sought “to advance education in international security and intelligence issues and to help support graduate students, such as Lokhova, while they were studying at Cambridge.” Among the 20 guests attending the February 28, 2014, dinner at Cambridge was Flynn, then President Barack Obama’s director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
Following the dinner, and while in the presence of the other attendees, Lokhova spoke briefly with Flynn about her research into the founding of the Soviet intelligence service. Lokhova and Flynn later exchanged emails, which the Russian scholar stressed in her complaint were always shared with Andrew, with whom she was co-authoring a book. These events later took on a surreal significance when Trump was elected president and Obama administration officials and high-level D.C. government insiders traded leaks for the legacy media’s peddling of the Russia collusion narrative.
But in Lokhova’s case, the complicity came from the United Kingdom, when her former professor, mentor, and co-author Andrew penned a February 19, 2017, piece for the United Kingdom’s Sunday Times. “I met him three years ago,” when as director of the DIA he “visited the Cambridge intelligence seminar, of which I was a convenor,” Andrew wrote of Flynn. Then, while not naming Lokhova in his article, Andrew wove words of inuendo to launch a narrative that would soon take hold: that Lokhova was a British spy and a love interest of the married Flynn.
“The most impressive quality Flynn displayed during his visit to Cambridge was his evident pleasure in engaging with some of the seminar’s talented postgraduates. He was especially struck by one bilingual postgraduate, with dual British-Russian nationality, who showed him extraordinary documents she had found in Stalin’s private papers,” Andrew wrote. “Among them was an erotic postcard sent by Stalin, then aged 34, to a friend’s 16-year-old fiancée, Pelageya Onufrieva, in 1912 while he was on the run from the tsarist political police. The card, which the British GPO would never have allowed in the post, showed a passionate embrace between two partially clothed lovers. Stalin wrote that he was sending with it ‘not just a simple kiss, but a ho one (because there is no point kissing any other way).’”
Lokhova’s former mentor also claimed in his Sunday Times article that at the end of the Cambridge seminar, Flynn invited Lokhova “to accompany him on his next official visit to Moscow to help with simultaneous translation.” While that trip fell through, Andrew claimed “Flynn continued an – unclassified – email correspondence with her on Russian history, occasionally signing himself ‘General Misha’– Russian for “Mike.”
In her lawsuit, Lokhova unequivocally denied Andrew’s claims, maintaining that Flynn never asked her to travel with him to Russia and stressing that she is not even a translator. She also insisted that Flynn never closed an email “Misha.” But Andrew’s credentials as the former official MI5 historian for the United Kingdom and his connection to Cambridge proved enough to prompt American newspapers to repeat the tale.
Halper, whom Lokhova alleges to be not just an FBI informant, but “actually a counterintelligence operative,” told the WSJ that the Russian historian had an affair with Flynn, according to her complaint. Lokhova also alleged that Halper, along with Andrew and the WSJ, served as sources to The Guardian’s later article that claimed “Multiple sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the CIA and FBI were discussing” Flynn’s meeting with Lokhova at Cambridge, and that U.S. and U.K. officials were troubled by Flynn’s encounter with Russian-linked Lokhova.
Lokhova’s lawsuit detailed many more publications and social media threads that she claims falsely portrayed her as a Russian spy and Flynn paramour, although in addition to Halper, she only sued three media outlets. Nonetheless, that aspect of her lawsuit provides a pristine example of intelligence agencies’ exploitation of the media to push the fake Russia collusion narrative.
Lokhova’s complaint also reveals a potentially more significant detail: that in January 2016, Andrew attempted to force a connection between Lokhova and Halper.
“On January 12, 2016, Andrew emailed Lokhova, and invited her and her partner, David North (‘North’), to Andrew’s house to have dinner with Halper and his wife,” Lokhova’s complaint alleged. While Andrew “stated the purpose of the dinner was to discuss the book that Lokhova and he were authoring,” Lokhova notes that she was perplexed by the “unexpected invitation” because Halper had never previously expressed an interest in her research. In fact, as Lokhova tells it in her complaint, Halper fell asleep during her Cambridge seminar presentations and avoided any contact with her.
Lokhova declined the dinner invitation, “alleging Halper was, in her opinion, a loathsome character with whom Lokhova did not wish to share time.” Lokhova further asserted that Halper had no interest in her research but hoped “to probe her for information relating to Flynn in the hopes that his FBI handlers might find a basis upon which to file an application to conduct and spy on General Flynn.”
But the timing of the outreach to Lokhova—and Lokhova’s allegations—suggest a different possibility. In mid-January 2016, when Andrew attempted to arrange a meeting between Halper and Lokhova, Flynn’s role as an informal adviser to President Trump was not well-known: While Lokhova’s complaint alleged that “In late 2015, General Flynn informally became an adviser to the Trump presidential campaign,” the first significant reporting of Flynn’s connection to the Trump campaign came on January 31, 2016—two weeks after Halper’s attempt to cozy up to Lokhova.
On that date, after discussing the dearth of reputable advisors working with the Trump campaign, Bloomberg reported that some “experts have regular interactions with Trump, including former Defense Intelligence Agency head Gen. Michael Flynn. Flynn, who has also met with other Republican presidential candidates, told me that Trump was a ‘superb listener’ who asked ‘exceptional questions’ and was interested in detail on a wide range of world issues.”
Other reports of Flynn’s interactions with the Trump campaign followed in February, 2016, but as Lokhova’s complaint revealed, “Halper came back into the picture” earlier, in mid-January, shortly after “General Flynn informally became an adviser to the Trump presidential campaign.”
Halper had a knack for seeking out individuals connected to the Trump campaign, including Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis. And we already know that Halper’s outreach to campaign-connected individuals began before the FBI’s official launch of Crossfire Hurricane, on July 31, 2016, with Halper approaching Page in mid-July.
Lokhova’s complaint now raises the question of whether the efforts to spy on the Trump campaign date back even further, to late 2015 or early 2016, and included surveillance of Flynn and plans to use Lokhova’s acquittance with Flynn to further track the Trump campaign’s activities. If so, given that the MI5-connected Andrew sought to broker the meeting between Lokhova and Halper, what role did U.K. intelligence play in the efforts to target the Trump campaign?

Why Europe’s Shocking Right Turn Is An Opportunity For The U.S.,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/28/europes-shocking-right-turn-opportunity-united-states/,"By Sumantra Maitra May 28, 2019
“The one system that absolutely does not work and never will is ersatz democracy,” Tucker Carlson writes in his book, “Ship of Fools,” adding that, “If you tell people they’re in charge, but then act as if they’re not, you’ll infuriate them. It’s too dishonest. They’ll go crazy. Oligarchies posing as democracies will always be overthrown in the end. You can vote all you want, but voting is a charade. Your leaders don’t care what you think. Shut up and obey.”
For a while, analysts on both sides of the Atlantic after 2016 would have given anyone the idea that everything that had happened was a dream, and a rotten one at that: an aberration, a short deviation from the inevitable progressive arc of history. Brexit was treated as simpleton Brits making a mistake. Donald Trump as president was considered even worse. And most Americans had no idea what was brewing in Europe, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel disastrously carried on her country’s tradition of deciding finance, military, and demographic issues for Europe and inviting a backlash.
Well, what a backlash it has been. The latest round of European elections was a total meltdown for the managerial and technocratic center-left and center-right parties. It is hard to put in words how broken the European landscape is, but to put it simply, the center no longer exists.
In Poland , the battleground of the future direction of Europe, the national conservatives won the majority, and the hardcore nationalists also get representation in the European Parliament for the first time. The center-right liberal conservative coalition barely managed to survive, and the social liberal and the left parties are wiped off the electoral map.
In Italy , another battleground nation, Matteo Salvini’s La Lega netted an overwhelming majority. Italy had been the worst-affected by German financial strangling and mass migration from Africa. Salvini tweeted that he led the number one party in Italy, and behind him was a recognizable and highly symbolic red cap with Make America Great Again and a statue of Jesus.
In Hungary , Victor Orban won an absolute majority while vowing to stop mass migration. And in France , Emmanuel Macron’s centrist liberals got an absolute belting, in an electoral map that looked eerily like Hillary Clinton’s 2016 journey, with the cities and urban areas voting for his En Marche Party and the rest of the country going to Euro-sceptic Marine Le Pen.
Meanwhile, in the original Brexit Land, the new Brexit Party walloped the craven Conservatives and Labour both, becoming the single largest U.K. party to be represented to the European Parliament. A country in which commentators regularly remind us that everything will change if there’s another referendum showed it remains stubbornly Eurosceptic and willing to leave the EU. Almost all of England other than London and Wales voted for Leave parties, and only Scotland voted for Remain, by a thin majority.
Boris Johnson, the front-runner for the next Conservative leadership, said his party is on notice after the disastrous premiership of Theresa May for the last three years, arguably the worst in the history of the post-war United Kingdom. And in parts of Scandinavia and Germany, the hard left coalesced behind the Green parties , thereby finally shattering the carefully crafted illusion that the Greens are any different than the Cold War-era Euro-Marxists , who instead of promoting violent revolution believed in undermining society from within. This is except the Danish left, which stayed to the Social Democrats, but only after the Social Democrats moved right on stopping migration.
Interestingly, the analysis has been predictable from the liberal commentators. Wherever liberals and Greens won, they gained a victory for “the people and true democracy,” and wherever there is any shade of right, they proclaim a win for the “fascists.”
In reality, however, the only simple answer is that Europe is permanently broken. Since anyone to the right of Antonio Gramsci is considered “far-right” by the mainstream commentators, it is difficult for them to explain, without the help of any racism or xenophobia narrative, what just happened in Europe. In reality, however, patterns emerged.
For example, the right parties that won in the United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, etc. are not xenophobic, as portrayed in the media. They are not even socially conservative, much less “borderline fascist.” In the United Kingdom, both the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage and the Conservatives want to get out of the EU not because they want to isolate into a little Britain, but because they want to trade freely with the rest of the Anglosphere without EU control and to side more freely with the United States on defense issues, instead of being forced to be a part of the EU Army.
Likewise, in both France and the Netherlands, the right-wing parties are not socially conservative at all. In fact, they want to restrict mass migration from Africa and the Middle East because they want to safeguard the liberal society, LGBT rights, and the separation of church and state from groups of people considered extremely socially unorthodox.
Contrast that with the right parties in Hungary, Italy, and Poland, all of which want to transform the EU from within and, in their own words, preserve the “Christian civilization” and Judeo-Christian values of Europe. The stringent issues in these countries included the increasingly hard-left LGBT and transgender movement.
The Polish, Hungarian, and Italian right are also distinctly socially conservative and in some cases anti-free market, instead focusing on heavy subsidies for the elderly and promoting pro-natalist policies for new mothers. In the common liberal siege mentality, all these people are considered “far right” when in reality the only common theme tying these parties is their opposition to a European empire under German hegemony, and their support for national sovereignty.
As I wrote earlier , the biggest folly was to ever believe that Europe can be united without force, and the European Union, while turning into an empire, faces an existential challenge from sovereigntist and conservative forces from within. The latest election proves that national-conservatism is here to stay, and that the conservative parties that refuse to acknowledge this simple reality will be obliterated.
In fact, the desire for Westphalian nation-state sovereignty never left us. How to channel that new energy to a more constructive force across the continent, instead of pockets of sporadic resistance, remains to be seen.
However, this is the moment for the American government to channel these forces and shape Europe towards a more pro-American direction. The conservative forces within the continent are desperate for leadership against Berlin and Brussels. Washington DC should urgently take note.

Justice Clarence Thomas Blasts Abortion As A Tool Of Racist Eugenicists,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/28/justice-clarence-thomas-blasts-abortion-tool-racist-eugenicists/,"May 28, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld part of an Indiana law requiring aborted infants to be cremated or buried after an abortion. However, they sidestepped a larger ruling on abortion by deciding not to weigh in on whether a child can be aborted for their race, sex, or disability.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion , in which he addressed the pro-abortion movement’s well-known history with eugenics, and how the Court’s decision not to rule on the Indiana statute leaves an open question on whether eugenic abortions are protected by the Constitution.
The Indiana law in question, enacted in 2016 by former Governor Mike Pence, included a provision stating, “Indiana does not allow a fetus to be aborted solely because of the fetus’s race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, or diagnosis or potential diagnosis of the fetus having Down syndrome or any other disability.”
These characteristics of an infant can be known early on in a pregnancy. Blood tests can now predict a baby’s sex at seven weeks. The law is intended to prevent mothers and abortion providers from using abortion as a tool of “modern-day eugenics,” as Thomas writes.
Thomas’ argument is two-fold. First, embracing abortion for the sake of eugenics was an endorsed practice and long-held belief of early 20th century progressive leaders. Second, with the development of more accurate prenatal tests, aborting children with unwanted characteristics is a modern threat disguised as “reproductive health services.”
Indeed, 21st century progressives often engage in a revisionist history of their early 20th century counterparts’ embrace of eugenics. But Thomas recounts the lengthy history Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger had with the practice of population control. In 1921, she wrote that “the unbalance between the birth rate of the ‘unfit’ and the ‘fit’ [is] admittedly the greatest present menace to civilization” and that “the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective.”
Sanger was a featured guest of the Ku Klux Klan and a proponent of the forced sterilization program of the Nazi regime in the 1930s. She deemed the population of black Americans “degenerate and defective” and her clinics targeted black and immigrant communities like central Harlem in New York City.
Alan Guttmacher, president of Planned Parenthood in the 1960s and early 1970s who explicitly endorsed eugenic reasons for abortion, is also included in Thomas’ opinion. Guttmacher wrote that “it should be permissible to abort any pregnancy … in which there is a strong probability of an abnormal or malformed infant.”
The racist work of Planned Parenthood today is built on the foundational beliefs of their predecessors, Sanger and Guttmacher. Seventy-eight percent of Planned Parenthood clinics are located in minority communities. Blacks make up 12.1 percent of the U.S. population, but 35 percent of the country’s abortions. In his opinion, Thomas cites New York Department of Health data that states, “there are areas of New York City in which black children are more likely to be aborted than they are to be born alive—and are up to eight times more likely to be aborted than white children in the same area.”
Other modern uses of eugenics are rising around the world. In Iceland, nearly 100 percent of women who receive positive prenatal tests for Down syndrome abort their children. In the U.S. around 67 percent of women who find out their child will be born with Down syndrome opt to have an abortion, and in the United Kingdom, it’s around 90 percent.
In India and China, millions of female babies are aborted every year just because of their sex. The Invisible Girl Project estimates that 5 to 7 million sex-selective abortions are performed in India every year.
Thomas concludes that the increased use of eugenic abortions is exactly why Indiana passed a law protecting the unborn from discrimination, and exactly why the Supreme Court cannot ignore a ruling on the subject for much longer.
“Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement,” he writes. “In other contexts, the Court has been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even potentially subjected to race, sex, and disability discrimination.” Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

"No, Defining Men As Men In Federal Regulations Will Not Kill Trans People",thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/29/no-defining-men-men-federal-regulations-will-not-kill-trans-people/,"By Chad Felix Greene May 29, 2019
In a hysterical headline, even for LGBT media, Queerty breathlessly announced that President Trump’s latest proposed rule change will kill lots of trans people . Lambda Legal sounded the alarm : 🚨🚨🚨 #𝘽𝙍𝙀𝘼𝙆𝙄𝙉𝙂 : @HHSGov just dropped the final ""conscience rule"", which invites discrimination in health care settings against #LGBTQ folks, women, religious minorities & other marginalized groups. This is disastrous. #DenialOfCare
— Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) May 2, 2019
As one might expect, this is not exactly accurate. Citing The Hill , Queerty says the change “would make it easier for doctors, hospitals and insurance companies to deny care or coverage to transgender patients, as well as women who have had abortions.” The article continues:
This is why people freak out when bakers refuse same-sex couples wedding cakes. It isn’t about cake, it’s about all the other professions that could simply decide not to help LGBTQ people because it violates their religious freedoms. In this instance, it’s literally a case of life and death. If a doctor or emergency room worker can legally refuse to care for a trans person, where the h-ll are trans people supposed to get medical care, especially if they live in a small, conservative rural area with only one doctor or hospital? Let’s Check In with Reality for a Minute
The proposed change was announced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in May. On May 24, HHS announced another rule change to recognize “sex” by its biological meaning rather than the Obama-era revision that had added “gender identity.” The New York Times detailed the proposal last year: “Under the existing rule, health insurers cannot place arbitrary limits or restrictions on health services that help a person transition from one gender to another. These services may include counseling, psychotherapy, hormone therapy and a variety of surgical treatments.”
The Obama administration required health insurance companies to pay for transgender-specific services that had previously been considered elective or cosmetic. Roger Severino, the director of HHS’s Office for Civil Rights, argued in the Times, “The court held that the regulation’s coverage of gender identity and termination of pregnancy was contrary to law and exceeded statutory authority, and that the rule’s harm was felt by health care providers in states across the country.”
Essentially, religious hospitals opposed paying for and performing contraception, abortion- or abortion-related interventions, and transgender medical interventions that often involve elective sterilization. This was the case at Mercy San Juan Medical Center. Evan Minton claimed the hospital discriminated against him for refusing to perform an elective hysterectomy on him .
The Catholic hospital morally opposed elective sterilization for Minton. The patient’s transgender identity was not at issue, as they would also have refused any woman who requested the same procedure without a valid medical reason. The left insisted an elective hysterectomies for transgender individuals are medically necessary and therefore other people should be forced to provide them. To avoid these kinds of scenarios, the Trump administration adapted the law to provide more protections for religious institutions. Misleading Manipulation
Truthfully, LGBT advocates are simply manipulating the truth. By claiming anything remotely transgender-related is “health care,” they insulate themselves from relevant questioning. By arguing that the proposed revision will allow hospitals or medical staff to “deny trans people care,” they send themselves down a rabbit hole of terrifying possibilities that simply never manifest in reality.
It is preposterous to jump from a surgeon working in a Catholic hospital refusing to perform an elective hysterectomy on a perfectly healthy female body to arguing that an emergency room worker would deny life-saving care to a transgender person in a car accident. But LGBT people and media constantly conflate the two.
In the above case, the patient’s surgeon scheduled the procedure at the hospital but was informed that due to the institution’s religious nature, they could not allow her to perform the surgery there. They instead referred both the surgeon and the patient to a nearby secular hospital that was happy to offer its services. In the LGBT narrative, this was considered discrimination. Yet the notion that a transgender patient was “denied” care is simply untrue.
What LGBT people are truly arguing for is medical validation of transgender identities and exclusive access to otherwise elective procedures not normally covered by health insurance. A woman wishing to have cosmetic breast surgery pays out of pocket, but a transgender person requiring the identical service would get other people to pay for it.
The Trump administration’s rules change would not directly affect health insurance coverage for transgender-related medical options. Each insurer can still choose what to cover.
What has become a mantra of the left in recent years—that “access” requires fully covered insurance—is not accurate in practice. If transgender people are not able to obtain the services they want at a Catholic hospital, they can pursue secular hospitals that cater to their medical wishes. In the worst-possible scenario, they may be required to pay for their procedure themselves.
In contrast, no hospital in the country is going to turn them away if they have a heart attack, need blood work, or have the flu. In such cases of pressing medical need, their gender identity continues to remain irrelevant. Chad Felix Greene is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Mueller Just Proved His Entire Operation Was A Lawless Political Hit Job,thefederalist.com,Sean Davis,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/29/mueller-just-proved-his-entire-operation-was-a-political-hit-job-that-trampled-the-rule-of-law/,"By Sean Davis May 29, 2019
If there were any doubts about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s political intentions, his unprecedented press conference on Wednesday should put them all to rest. As he made abundantly clear during his doddering reading of a prepared statement that repeatedly contradicted itself, Mueller had no interest in the equal application of the rule of law. He gave the game, and his nakedly political intentions, away repeatedly throughout his statement.
“It is important that the office’s written work speak for itself,” Mueller said, referring to his office’s 448-page report. Mueller’s report was released to the public by Attorney General William Barr nearly six weeks ago. The entire report, minus limited redactions required by law, has been publicly available, pored through, and dissected. Its contents have been discussed ad nauseum in print and on television. The report has been speaking for itself since April 18, when it was released.
If it’s important for the work to speak for itself, then why did Mueller schedule a press conference in which he would speak for it weeks after it was released? The statement, given the venue in which it was provided, is self-refuting.
Let’s start with the Mueller team’s unique take on the nature of a prosecutor’s job. The standard American view of justice, affirmed and enforced by the U.S. Constitution, is that all are presumed innocent absent conviction by a jury of a specific charge of criminal wrongdoing. That is, the natural legal state of an individual in this country is innocence. It is not a state or a nature bestowed by cops or attorneys. Innocence is not granted by unelected bureaucrats or federal prosecutors.
At one point in his remarks, Mueller seemed to agree. Referring to indictments against various Russian individuals and institutions for allegedly hacking American servers during the 2016 election, Mueller said that the indictments “contain allegations and we are not commenting on the guilt or innocence of any specific defendant.”
“Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.”
Had he stopped there, he would have been correct. But then he crafted a brand new standard.
“The order appointing the special counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. We conducted that investigation and kept the office of the acting attorney general apprised of our work,” Mueller said. “After that investigation, if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”
According to Mueller and his team, charged Russians are presumed innocent. An American president, however, is presumed guilty unless and until Mueller’s team determines he is innocent. Such a standard is an obscene abomination against the rule of law, one that would never be committed by independent attorneys who place a fidelity to their oaths and impartial enforcement of the law ahead of their political motivations.
The contradictions and double standards didn’t stop there, though.
“It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge,” Mueller said, after all but stating that Trump committed a crime for which Mueller never charged him. Just as Mueller’s own words and actions at the Wednesday press conference prove that he didn’t want his team’s report to speak for itself, the report itself proves that Mueller and his team don’t believe it’s unfair to accuse somebody of something a court cannot resolve.
If they actually believed that, then the 240-page volume II of their report on their obstruction investigation of the president would never have been authored. After all, according to Mueller’s own statement, such an operation would be patently unfair. And if it’s unfair to air dirty laundry against a target who was never charged, surely it’s doubly unfair to do so in writing and on camera during a press conference whose mere existence refutes the very claims of its host.
Mueller revealed himself as little more than a clone of James Comey—the smarmy, scheming politician who replaced Mueller as the head of the FBI. Recall that it was Comey who assumed for himself powers that did not belong to him by law when he declared at a 2016 press conference no “reasonable prosecutor” would charge Hillary Clinton with criminal wrongdoing in her mishandling of classified information and unsanctioned use of a secret, private email server to evade public records laws. Just as Mueller did in his report and Wednesday press conference, Comey followed up his declaration that Hillary would not be charged with statement after statement after statement of all the awful things Hillary Clinton did.
“There is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information,” Comey said of Clinton. He excoriated her for repeatedly sending and receiving top secret information on her unsecured server which had never been authorized to process classified information. He even said it was possible, due to her “extreme” carelessness, that hostile foreign actors had penetrated her system and obtained highly classified information about U.S. national security programs.
Regardless of how you feel about Clinton, Comey’s display at that press conference was an embarrassment. He did an extreme disservice to the nation and the rule of law by unilaterally declaring himself the primary arbiter of prosecutorial decisions in the federal government when that authority belongs solely to the Department of Justice. And he did an extreme disservice to Clinton herself by dragging her through the mud in such a manner that clearing her name would be impossible.
In fact, DOJ guidelines expressly prohibit the actions of both Comey and Mueller in naming and shaming individuals who were never formally charged with any wrongdoing.
“As a series of cases makes clear, there is ordinarily ‘no legitimate governmental interest served’ by the government’s public allegation of wrongdoing by an uncharged party, and this is true ‘regardless of what criminal charges may . . . b[e] contemplated by the Assistant United States Attorney against the [third-party] for the future,'” states DOJ’s formal policy manual on the duties of federal prosecutors and principles of federal prosecutions.
Nationwide bar rules governing all practicing attorneys in the United States also explicitly prohibit Mueller’s display during Wednesday’s press conference.
“The prosecutor in a criminal case shall … refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused,” states Rule 3.8(f) of the American Bar Association’s rules of professional conduct.
Multiple federal agents and prosecutors reached out to The Federalist after Mueller’s press conference to express dismay at the former FBI director’s behavior.
“I’d have been crucified under this rule for a ‘not innocent’ comment about an uncharged party,” a former federal prosecutor told The Federalist. “I literally cannot fathom holding a press conference to say that an uncharged person was not innocent.”
“I wish these former FBI directors would learn their lessons: keep your mouths shut unless you’re referring a case for prosecution,” Jeff Danik, a retired FBI supervisor, said during a phone interview with The Federalist on Wednesday.
Mueller’s performance made it clear for all to see that what he ran for the last two years wasn’t an independent investigation pursuant to the rule of law so much as an inquisition motivated by political animus. Mueller and his team refused to charge prominent Democrats for crimes he charged against Republicans. Paul Manafort was charged with unregistered lobbying for foreign governments, while Mueller left alone long-time Democrat donor Tony Podesta and former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig.
George Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn were charged with making false statements to federal investigators, while Clinton campaign cronies Glenn Simpson and Christopher Steele’s false statements to Congress and the FBI were ignored. Trump’s nonexistent Russian connections were plumbed while a dubious Clinton campaign-funded dossier sourced directly to Russian officials was used as a prosecutorial roadmap rather than rock-solid evidence of actual campaign collusion with the Kremlin.
Mueller claimed his report spoke for itself, then put together a completely unnecessary press conference more than a month after his report’s public release, in which he not just spoke for the report, but expounded on the new legal standards he created to govern its conclusions.
These are the actions not of an impartial and independent investigator, but of a scheming political operative. None of this is any surprise to anyone who has followed Mueller’s tenure in government. As FBI director, Mueller repeatedly misused and abused the authority granted to him by Congress.
Mueller and Comey utterly bungled the federal investigation into the 2001 Anthrax attacks, resulting in a $5.8 million judgment against the government after the two men falsely accused an innocent man of being behind the attacks.
Even after the court judgment against him, Mueller was defiant.
“I do not apologize for any aspect of the investigation,” Mueller said afterward. He then doubled down and said it would be wrong to say there were any mistakes in how he handled the investigation.
Then there was Mueller’s handling as FBI director of a case in which FBI agents framed innocent men of murders the FBI knew had been committed by their own informants. One of the innocent men died in prison awaiting justice for a crime he never committed.
Then, as special counsel to investigate Russian collusion during the 2016 campaign, Mueller promptly hired partisan Democrats to run his investigation. He tapped as investigators FBI personnel who openly discussed their hatred of Trump and his voters, as well as their plans to keep him out of office.
There’s no longer any doubt about who Robert Mueller is or why he conducted himself the way he did. As abominable as his press conference was, we should in many ways be thankful that Mueller so willingly displayed for all to see his disdain for basic rules of prosecutorial conduct, his total lack of self-awareness, and his naked desire to stick it to Trump.

CNN Anchor Mocks Rape Survivor For 2nd Amendment Views,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/29/cnn-anchor-mocks-rape-survivor-2nd-amendment-views/,"May 29, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
CNN Anchor Chris Cuomo thought he had a real sick burn on Wednesday when he mocked rape survivor Kimberly Corban on Twitter for saying she protects herself and her family with a firearm.
“Only in America,” Cuomo tweeted in response to a National Rifle Association video of Corban sharing about the night she was suffocated and raped in her dorm room at age 20. Only in America https://t.co/rPfsxGU8Gh
— Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) May 29, 2019
“For the next two hours, I knew I was going to die, and there was nothing I could do,” Corban said in the video. “I’m a mother of two, and if a predator or anyone else tries to harm me or my family, they have to come through my firearm first.”
In 2016, Corban confronted President Obama during a CNN “Guns in America” town hall, saying protecting her family is a basic responsibility for a parent.
“I have been unspeakably victimized once already, and I refuse to let that happen again to myself or my kids. So why can’t your administration see that these restrictions that you’re putting to make it harder for me to own a gun, or harder for me to take that where I need to be is actually just making my kids and I less safe?” she asked.
It’s doubtful that Cuomo was sincerely remarking on the fact that only in the United States does a woman have a right to defend herself with firearms. In Cuomo’s world, it’s a shame that the United States does not have the strict gun control laws other countries do, preventing citizens from arming themselves against rapists and violent attacks.
The last time CNN injected itself into the gun debate, it did not age well. Days after the horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida, CNN hosted a town hall whitewashing the Broward County sheriff’s failings in the lead-up and aftermath of that tragedy, and turning a wild crowd against NRA Spokeswoman Dana Loesch .
Cuomo and CNN should probably stay out of covering or commenting on the Second Amendment rights that protect millions of Americans. Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour. Follow her on Twitter ."
Why Is The Info Generating Mueller;s Probe All Linked To Hillary Clinton?,thefederalist.com,H.A. Goodman,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/30/john-durham-needs-investigate-info-generated-mueller-probe-linked-hillary-clinton/,"By H.A. Goodman May 30, 2019
The Federal Bureau of Investigation had a budget approaching $10 billion during James Comey’s tenure as its director. Combined with budgets for the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, these agencies cost taxpayers around $30 billion annually.
Therefore, one would think that incriminating evidence derived from the FBI, NSA, or CIA could have linked Donald Trump to Russian hackers or Kremlin operatives, if that evidence existed. Instead, almost all the major findings used to justify investigations into Trump’s campaign are linked to Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party.
The heads of America’s top intelligence agencies used a dossier linked to Clinton’s funding , a tech firm outsourced by the Democratic National Committee, and hearsay from Alexander Downer as the basis to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants and initiate sprawling probes.
The “evidence” leading up to the Robert Mueller probe was so specious that the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence reports compiled by James Clapper and others had warranty disclaimers . President Trump was investigated based on intelligence linked to statements like “(DHS) does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained within” and “judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact.”
U.S. Attorney General William Barr hired prosecutor John Durham to investigate the origins of the Mueller probe. A key issue for Durham to resolve is why the inciting information never originated within the U.S. government. Why has the funding from Democrats, along with other blatant conflicts of interest, been ignored by Comey, Clapper, and John Brennan?
Although an estimated 70 percent of intelligence budgets go to private contractors , these private companies work with classified material and their workers hold security clearances. Fusion GPS, the firm Clinton and Democrats hired to compile the Steele dossier, did not provide the FBI classified intelligence. In fact, the Steele dossier is still unverified and anyone can read the document within the BuzzFeed article that publicized the allegations in early 2017. Crowdstrike, the third-party tech firm the DNC hired to analyze its servers (instead of the U.S. government) didn’t provide the FBI, CIA, or NSA any classified intelligence, since the DNC is a private entity that never allowed U.S. intel agencies near its servers.
Comey never used intelligence derived from U.S. sources to initiate or justify probes into Trump’s campaign. All the information Comey, Clapper, and Brennan used to justify investigating Trump was data linked to Clinton or Democrats in some manner. During a Fox News interview with Bill Hemmer , Barr explained that initiating a counterintelligence probe from the Steele dossier was “very unusual”:
HEMMER: Can you tell us about the Steele dossier and what role did it play?
BARR: Well that’s one of the questions that we’re going to have to look at, it is a very unusual situation to have opposition research like that, especially one that on its face had a number of clear mistakes and a somewhat jejune analysis. And to use that to conduct counterintelligence against an American political campaign… would be strange development.
I’m not sure what role it played but that is something we’re going to have to look at.
HEMMER: Do you smell a rat in this?
BARR: I don’t know if I’d describe it as a rat, I’d just say the answers I’m getting are not sufficient.
HEMMER: Republicans have said for months that these men — Just to follow up on that Republicans have said for months that these men: Brennan, Clapper maybe James Comey had it in for Trump. Do you think that’s true?
BARR: Again I’m not going to speculate about their motives.
Durham will no doubt investigate the intent behind these decisions, and the true reasons America’s intelligence agencies outsourced virtually all of the evidence against Trump.
At a certain point, it can’t be mere coincidence that every major figure involved in probing Trump’s campaign is linked to Hillary Clinton in some manner. Christopher Steele was “desperate” to prevent Trump from becoming president and was paid $160,000 by Democrats before he compiled his infamous dossier.
DNC lawyers met with FBI officials before a surveillance warrant was granted, raising questions as to why the FBI would meet with a political party’s counsel, yet not inform Trump his campaign was under investigation. Fusion GPS, the firm that hired Steele, was paid by money from Hillary Clinton and the DNC, funneled through a law firm , to compile the Steele dossier.
Clinton allies gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the political campaign of Andrew McCabe’s wife, yet the former FBI deputy director only recused himself from Clinton’s email probe one week before the election . Even before the FBI obtained a FISA warrant on Carter Page, Bruce Ohr of the DOJ informed FBI officials that the Steele dossier was connected to Hillary Clinton and filled with political bias . Ohr’s wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS and now her emails are linked to controversy.
Crowdstrike, the only entity to analyze the claimed DNC email hack, was outsourced and paid by the Democratic National Committee . Australian diplomat Downer informed the FBI of a conversation with George Papadopoulos, where Downer stated the Trump campaign official was given information by a Russian operative about the DNC emails. Downer isn’t mentioned in the Mueller report , was never interviewed during the Mueller probe, and is linked to the Clinton Foundation .
Along with the Crowsdtrike assessment that Russia hacked the DNC, the FBI used the Steele dossier to obtain a FISA warrant to surveille Page— without informing FISA judges the dossier was linked to funding by Hillary Clinton. Then of course, former FBI agent Peter Strzok texted “we’ll stop” Trump and wrote about an “insurance policy” that he had spoken about with McCabe.
Yet all of these conflicts of interests linked to Clinton, or intelligence linked to Democrats, failed to produce any evidence against Trump. In an article titled “ FBI couldn’t prove Trump-Russia collusion before Mueller appointment ,” John Solomon explains that Lisa Page admitted the FBI had nothing on Trump even before the Mueller probe:
‘It’s a reflection of us still not knowing,’ Page told Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) when questioned about texts she and Strzok exchanged in May 2017 as Robert Mueller was being named special counsel to take over the Russia investigation.
With that statement, Page acknowledged a momentous fact: After nine months of using some of the most awesome surveillance powers afforded to U.S. intelligence, the FBI still had not made a case connecting Trump or his campaign to Russia’s election meddling.
Page opined further, acknowledging ‘it still existed in the scope of possibility that there would be literally nothing’ to connect Trump and Russia, no matter what Mueller or the FBI did.
‘As far as May of 2017, we still couldn’t answer the question,’ she said at another point.
So why did the U.S. government investigate for two more years, only to find the same conclusion?
In the event preceding the Mueller probe, Comey leaked at least one classified memo , and possibly more, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley. Four Mueller attorneys donated around $50,000 to either Obama, Clinton, or the DNC .
Durham already prosecuted an FBI agent linked to Boston’s notorious mob boss Whitey Bulger, so he’s no stranger to rogue government officials. At the heart of the matter, regarding the origins of the Mueller probe, is why Comey and others investigated Trump with information that would never be considered evidence in normal counterintelligence probes.
While intelligence officials outsource intelligence, they also use intelligence from U.S. government to conduct investigations and prosecute criminals. In Comey’s case, the former director never relied on the U.S. intelligence community for information to investigate Trump, since as Lisa Page testified, nobody had any evidence that Trump had committed crimes, or colluded with Russia.
When Durham finds out exactly why Comey and others ignored blatant conflicts of interest to use faulty and suspect intelligence, Americans will learn the truth about the origins of the Mueller probe.

How To Make Sure Terrorists Like John Walker Lindh Don't Stay A Threat,thefederalist.com,Todd Bensman,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/30/make-sure-terrorists-like-john-walker-lindh-dont-stay-threat-release/,"By Todd Bensman May 30, 2019
The May 23 release from federal prison of John Walker Lindh, the so-called “American Taliban” captured on a smoking Afghanistan battlefield right after 9/11, put as much chill in the air as the unchaining of serial killers Ted Bundy or Charles Manson would.
His release into American society amid reports that Lindh had, during his 17-year penance behind bars in Indiana, preserved his commitment to violent Islamist jihad, raised an obvious question: What have American homeland security and law enforcement done to ensure Lindh won’t use his newfound freedom to act on his religious commitment to kill infidels?
The unfortunate answer is that America is pretty much at the mercy of released former (or formerly incarcerated, at least) terrorists. I know this from my government experience with this very issue as a homeland security intelligence practitioner in Texas , where a significant number of individuals convicted as a result of terrorism investigations served their proscribed time and were released.
Here are some takeaways from my experience: A majority of terrorism convictions after 9/11 landed prison sentences of less than 10 years, so Lindh is far from the first to be released into society—only one of the most publicly prominent. Despite years of such releases, neither the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, nor any government agency, systematically tracks or studies terrorism recidivism so that risk can be assessed and programs implemented to reduce it. Therefore, no one really knows how many have recommitted or, among those who have, what the consequences have been. Once terrorist convicts are released, neither the FBI nor the Department of Homeland Security have the legal footing to expend resources to surveil or otherwise track them without criminal predicate or probable cause. Federal parole officers are currently the only (and best-positioned) law enforcement officers to monitor for the potentially criminal behavior of released terrorist convicts often serving some years on “supervised release,” or court-ordered probation. Violations of probation terms can mean a return to prison for the convict, and even justify a fresh FBI counterterrorism investigation. However, most federal parole officers are overworked and overburdened with non-terrorist convicts and are not equipped to look at their terrorist convicts in any concerted way, even if some do out of conscience. Beyond federal parole officers, no other law enforcement agencies are informed that terrorist convicts are being released into their jurisdictions. Is Recidivism a Problem for Once-Incarcerated Terrorists?
According to one 2017 count by George Washington University, 450 people of an average age of 27 are currently incarcerated for terrorism-related crimes, serving an average of 13 years in prison. (Many people had already served their times and gained release before that count took place, so those numbers might be artificially low.)
It may well be that the recidivism risk is fairly low or moderate, but it’s hard to say. Any effort to count is hobbled by the fact that no government agency has systematically paid attention to terrorist recidivism or apparently thought much about mechanisms to monitor convicts post-release in a way that would provide meaningful intelligence in a lawful manner.
A decade after 9/11, one Naval Postgraduate School researcher attempted an “extensive” effort to assess the threat and to identify locations of released terrorist convicts. In his master’s degree thesis “Freed: Ripples of the Convicted and Released Terrorist in America,” Michael A. Brown came away with “an evidentiary black hole.” He had no choice but to conclude that “we do not know if convicted or released terrorists present a threat,” that there was no defined entity responsible for convicted and released terrorists, and that convicted terrorists are treated no differently than most convicted criminals after they are released.
It should go without saying that past behavior is not always an indicator of future behavior. Knee-jerk assumptions about an unquantified danger are not warranted. Those released who have served their legal obligations to pay for their crimes have a right to reset as productive citizens, unmolested by any unusual law enforcement pressure. Some convicted terrorists will have learned their lessons or unwound their religious zeal for the jihad behind bars.
A good number who are foreign nationals will be deported as soon as they finish their terms, so no problem for the homeland there. Others are providing considerable assistance to counterterror investigations, such as some of the Lackawanna Six . Still others, if they do recommit, might do so with money and material rather than bombs and bloodshed.
On the other hand, we know that some former terrorism prisoners recommit in other parts of the world with plenty of bombs and bloodshed—and in the United States. In 2017, a report by The Washington Institute concluded that the Bureau of Prisons fields no terrorism disengagement programs inside its facilities, meaning local communities have no idea whether they are receiving a die-hard or reformed terrorist. Do We Have Any Reliable Data?
The most studied and reliable recidivism data involving terrorist detainees involves those released from the U.S. military’s Guantanamo Bay base, often to third-country rehabilitation programs. As of 2012, at the height of President Barack Obama’s effort to empty the facility of terrorists captured abroad, about a third of the 676 former detainees did so or were suspected of “reengaging,” according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
Some convicted terrorists in the United States have recommitted and landed back in prison, even if all that is publicly known about these is purely anecdotal. For instance, Garland, Texas attacker and Islamic State sympathizer Elton Simpson was convicted in 2010 of lying to FBI agents conducting a counterterror investigation into his plans to join the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab. He was given three years’ probation and released, as we are well aware now, to go on to die in the Texas attack .
Georgia resident Abdelghani Meskini, convicted as a co-conspirator in the December 1999 Millennium Bombing plot, was released in 2005. But he was re-incarcerated in 2010 for purchasing an AK-47-style rifle after conducting research on al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki, local U.S. military installations, gun stores, and the November 2009 Fort Hood, Texas, shootings, according to court records from the second case. Thankfully, we won’t ever know how much blood he might have shed.
But we do know in the case of Seattle, Washington, resident Ali Mohammad Brown. He went on a jihad-inspired murder spree that claimed four victims across the country in 2014 and 2015, after a 2005 conviction on bank fraud charges related to a scheme to fund al-Shabab, for which he served time in federal prison. Authorities had lost track of Brown in the years since his release.
So we know recidivism is happening and can happen, especially with convicts less publicly known than Lindh, who will no doubt have eyes on him in some form. What to Do about Lingering Terrorist Threats
Since the question is raised in so public a fashion with Lindh’s release, America’s homeland security enterprise may be more open to suggestions as to how to reduce risk. Agencies should do these things right away, at least: Conduct a comprehensive government study, preferably headed by the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice, quantifying how many recidivists are in custody and how they ended up back behind bars, as well as to account for the number of released inmates who did not re-offend after five years. Require the U.S. Probation Officer corps to systematically account for terrorist convicts it supervises and establish requirements for intelligence collection above and beyond the regimen of monitoring ordinary criminals, to meet the much-different needs of FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces. Probation officers should be given access to additional resources for this effort to include the intelligence analysts of other agencies and classified data systems. One consideration is to draw on the resources of local fusion centers. Establish a mechanism to alert local community law enforcement when a terrorist convict is to be released, especially those still showing interest in violence during their last months in prison, and ensure that each remains on the U.S. terrorism watch list.
It’s almost certain that however Lindh is monitored will be ad hoc. The time has long since passed for ad hoc approaches to counterterrorism as more and more Lindhs get released into our communities.

NYC’s Racist Dept. Of Ed. Shows The Perils Of Privilege Theory,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/30/nycs-racist-dept-of-ed-shows-the-perils-of-privilege-theory/,"By David Marcus May 30, 2019
A long-awaited discrimination lawsuit against New York City’s Department of Education filed by three white employees has finally been filed, according to The New York Post. The details in the suit are deeply troubling and depict a harsh anti-white bias that comes directly from Chancellor Richard Carranza.
The three plaintiffs, Lois Herrera, Jaye Murray, and Laura Feijoo, allege they were given severe demotions and replaced by non-white employees with fewer qualifications. In the suit, their attorney David S. Perry wrote, “Under Carranza’s leadership, DOE quickly has swiftly and irrevocably silenced, sidelined and punished plaintiffs and other Caucasian female DOE employees on the basis of their race, gender and unwillingness to accept their other colleagues’ hateful stereotypes about them.”
According to the suit, the DOE has told white employees that “they had to take a step back and yield to colleagues of color,” and “recognize that values of white culture are supremacist.”
It has previously been reported that the DOE paid $750,000 to a company called Pacific Educational Group, an outfit that supposedly helps institutions fight racism. According to sources who attended Pacific’s training course, they were told that whiteness is “characterized by perfectionism, a belief in meritocracy, and the Protestant work ethic.” All apparently things the DOE should try to avoid teaching students.
The lawsuit contains more details, but the bottom line is that under Carranza, who was hand-picked by mayor and 2020 hopeful Bill de Blasio, the DOE has engaged in, dare I say, systemic racism against white employees. While this is a terrible way for the DOE to operate, it is hardly shocking, especially under de Blasio and Carranza’s leftist leadership. In fact, they are simply calling plays from the privilege theory playbook.
Originally created by academic Peggy McIntosh in the late 1980s, privilege theory was originally meant simply as a tool to understand that white people had, or have, special advantages in American society. Whatever one thinks of that proposition, over the past 30 years the role and uses of privilege theory in society and especially in education have grown a thousandfold in troubling ways.
What began as asking people to take stock of their whiteness has quickly turned into asking white people to give their voices and power to people of color. Finally, and predictably, this has now changed into forcing white people out of their positions of power just because they are white, which no matter how good one’s intentions are (or aren’t) is flat-out illegal.
Arguably worse is the chilling effect that DOE’s actions have on its employees, who rightfully feel that challenging the approach to diversity and anti-racism endorsed by the chancellor could result in repercussions, and even allegations of supporting white supremacy, words bandied about so many things these days that one can hardly avoid engaging in it, apparently.
The progressive privilege-pushers at the DOE have created a perfect syllogistic argument against anyone who opposes their racist measures. They simply argue that any such resistance is evidence of the very white supremacy they are fighting in the person resisting. So sure are they of themselves that they can brook no challenge to their awful policies.
The bravery of the three employees fighting back with the lawsuit is impressive and laudable, especially in today’s environment. There are no doubt those who will accuse them of racism. But hopefully their stance will give some courage to others in the DOE who do not share its leadership’s radical and wrongheaded views to also speak out.
Privilege theory is not entirely without value. It is useful and good to examine whether we have unearned advantages that we take for granted, be they racial, economic, or regarding any other demographic we belong to. But that is the limit of its value—introspection.
Privilege theory has no application to creating actual policy. It should not be treated as the driver of all of our diversity and anti-racism efforts. It is being asked to carry far too great at load at the expense of our children’s educations.
Hopefully, this lawsuit will correct some of the obvious excesses of the DOE’s policies, but the problem is deeper is than that. We need a real conversation in education about race, not a one-way lecture.

Health Care Can't Stay Between A Woman And Doctor If It's Socialist,thefederalist.com,Paul M. Curry,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/30/health-care-cant-stay-woman-doctor-socialist/,"May 30, 2019 By Paul M. Curry
In case anyone has missed it, Alabama seems to have taken a break from dominating college football to be the first of several states to lead a charge to overturn, or at least modify, the landmark Supreme Court abortion case Roe v. Wade . The next two years of court challenges set against the backdrop of a presidential election promise to make for tremendous political theater.
Still, the question of whether life begins at conception, heartbeat, birth, or preschool is only a small part of the even larger issue. The fact is, the loudest voices of outrage deriding the Alabama heartbeat law are the same voices that have been championing government-run health care for the past 50 years.
The irony is so thick that O’Henry may very well sue the Democratic National Committee for plagiarism. This is the ultimate paradox: How can health care be a personal, private, matter that can only be between an individual, a doctor, and—wait—the world’s largest bureaucracy?
Leaving the question of life to the pay grades where they belong, isn’t this dust-up the perfect example of the ultimate folly of the left’s dream? How can you champion the idea of personal liberty while ceding that liberty to a power that you cannot control? The government must take over health care to provide for all, but must not trample on individual liberties. Yet you cannot control how those in power will choose to rule—yes, rule .
No matter one’s feelings on abortion, it is fortunate that this issue is bubbling up at this moment. For the entire duration of the “government health care for all” debate, those in favor have either mocked the fears of those who oppose such government intrusion or dodged the question entirely.
A government that controls health care has the inherent power to control health-care decisions. Opponents of government-run health care have long argued that a government with infinite control yet finite resources will ultimately have to make choices about which procedures are covered and which are deemed unnecessary, unwarranted, or simply not financially practical. Much of the left has dismissed or ignored these concerns to date.
Now, they are forced to confront their most feared scenario—government intrusion into what they feel is a private health-care decision. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris has recently declared her ambition to end the private insurance market. Every other candidate for the Democrat nomination is in lockstep with that dream.
Should they realize their goal, end private insurance and institute government-run health care, then, necessarily, daily they will encounter challenges like the Alabama heartbeat law. How, absent dictatorship, can they guarantee that elected officials or unelected bureaucrats won’t go against their most treasured beliefs?
The Supreme Court will ultimately put to rest, at least for another generation, the abortion debate. What Democrats need to ask themselves is simple: Do they want to risk their perceived rights and liberties for a government-run health care system? A system run by government officials that will include people supportive of the Alabama heartbeat law?
They can’t have it both ways."
HBO's 'Chernobyl' Indicts Soviet Socialism. Reviews Downplay It,thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/30/hbos-chernobyl-indicts-soviet-socialism-establishment-reviews-downplay/,"By Warren Henry May 30, 2019
HBO’s “Chernobyl” mini-series, depicting the world’s worst man-made nuclear disaster, concludes Monday night. The drama, co-produced by the British network Sky, is currently the all-time top rated TV show on IMDb . But the reviews suggest many in the establishment media have not learned the show’s obvious lesson about the dangers of Soviet-style socialism.
To be sure, The Federalist and Reason published reviews highlighting the overt theme of the work. “Chernobyl” is an indictment of a socialist government that suppressed the analysis of a 1975 partial meltdown in Leningrad. That incident revealed the design flaw in their RMBK reactors that could cause them to explode.
The government’s cover-up of Leningrad led to the Chernobyl catastrophe. The ongoing suppression of the truth by the Communist Party is evident throughout the mini-series. You might not know this from reading the New York Times , which published a review comparing the drama to Soviet propaganda. Yes, really:
‘Chernobyl’ … takes what you could call a Soviet approach to telling the tale. This is incongruous, since one of the messages of the program is that Soviet approaches don’t work. But there it is: the imposition of a simple narrative on history, the twisting of events to create one-dimensional heroes and villains, the broad-brush symbolism.
It is an Orwellian charge—and an odd one, given that the review otherwise has nothing critical to say about socialism or communism. Instead, the review is a laundry list of nitpicks about the artistic license largely taken to condense the sprawling story into five hours of television.
The review’s biggest claim of inaccuracy is that the protagonist, nuclear scientist Valery Legasov, is painted as more of a heroic whistleblower than he actually was. Such criticism would underscore how effective the Soviet terror regime was in suppressing the truth, if the reviewer cared to notice.
Perhaps it is precisely the review to publish in a newspaper that ran a series whitewashing Soviet Communism for its 100th anniversary . But other establishment outlets did not do much better.
The Washington Post review mentions in passing “the corruption and dishonesty that defined Soviet life,” but later claims, with no recognition of the cognitive dissonance, that: “[t]he disaster, it turns out, was attributable to human errors, stemming from an unnecessary stress test ordered by the reactor’s bureaucrats. The series works its way to a trial that tries to pin the blame on a few key players; it is Legasov’s [fictionalized] outspokenness that indicts the entire system.”
New York magazine’s review refers to a Soviet-era joke on the way to missing the point:
‘A man asks another man on a crowded Moscow bus, ‘Are you affiliated in any way with the Communist Party leadership, the Politburo, the KGB, or any arm of government?’ ‘No,’ the man replies. ‘Good. Now please get off my foot.’ The Chernobyl disaster, it seems, was made even more of a disaster because the state was too prideful and ignorant to allow experts to say, ‘Please get off my foot.’
The idea that “Chernobyl” is really about the refusal of politicians to follow the experts, as opposed to that refusal being a lethal symptom of Soviet socialism, is a recurring feature of the reviews.
The Atlantic’s review, which manages to avoid mentioning socialism, asserts the director’s message is: “When societies undermine not only expertise but also the nature of truth itself, he seems to be saying, catastrophe inevitably follows.” The type of society—and the type of government—where that can happen is left unsaid, unless you count a parenthetical note: “(David Dencik is wonderful as Mikhail Gorbachev, who declares, in one scene, that Soviet power comes from ‘perception of our power,’ which is why it’s so necessary to keep the truth about the crisis contained.)”
Similarly, the Post’s review smugly opines about “sanctioned obfuscation — and how much easier that becomes in a country where media and scientific leadership are tightly restricted. There was a time when that sort of thing might have seemed entirely foreign to an American audience; now, it’s another resonant alarm sounding uncomfortably close.”
Time’s review gives away the game by getting too explicit in its conclusion: “This drives home the many obvious failures of Soviet authoritarianism, of course, and the ongoing threat of nuclear annihilation. At its best, however, Chernobyl demonstrates what happens when societies stop listening to science. Amid our rapidly worsening global climate crisis, it’s a critical message.”
The Chernobyl disaster was not the result of undermining expertise. It was the result of the deliberate suppression of scientific analysis by a totalitarian state with the power to terrorize people into silence.
The comparison of Chernobyl to the climate change debate is also bizarre, quite beyond the paranoid premise that America now resembles anything like the dystopian Soviet nightmare depicted in the mini-series. It is considered an article of faith that there is a “scientific consensus” about climate change. Yet in the Soviet Union, the “scientific consensus” was that a RMBK reactor literally could not explode, because dissent was silenced by those with power.
There is no shortage of studies and debate about climate change today. Prominent Democrats propose a Soviet-style planned economy to address it . And their Green New Deal eschews reliance on safe nuclear power plant designs, even though they are the most realistic way of reducing carbon emissions on the scale Democrats and so-called democratic socialists envision. So much for deferring to experts.
Fortunately, not all of the “Chernobyl” reviews whitewash the true villain of the piece, as in the surprising conclusion at the Daily Beast : “By its finale, Chernobyl has transformed from a story about plant-operator faults to one about systematic deception on the part of the stubborn, arrogant, blind and foolish Soviets, whose communist culture—demanding absolute loyalty to the Party, which is always perfect and infallible, even when facts say otherwise—compelled everyone to cover up the truth lest they be vilified as nation-besmirching traitors.”
But on balance, too many entertainment writers decided to review a story about suppressing the truth by imitating the apparatchiks. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois."
The Cultural White Walkers Have Descended,thefederalist.com,Ben Domenech,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/30/the-cultural-white-walkers-have-descended/,"By Ben Domenech May 30, 2019
It’s worth considering the important argument between Sohrab Ahmari of the New York Post and David French of National Review over the past few days. As with many stupid arguments, it started on Twitter.
Thankfully, it bloomed into something more interesting. You can get the background here , with David French advancing his typical “decency and civility” argument against the current sentiments of conservatives locked into the culture wars.
I don’t want to pick on Sohrab, but I get this sentiment quite a bit. According to some folks on Twitter, I don’t “fight.” I’m too polite for these times. I’m too much of a squish. Apparently, the lesson I learned from a better lawyer than me has been transformed into a kind of defect. A weakness.
But in the example above, what did politeness, respect, and dignity cost anyone? We prevailed in the case. We vindicated our client and achieved a just result. At the same time, we treated other human beings with dignity and respect.
[This piece prompts the typical eyerolls I have toward the always predictable French. Can someone just form the Politeness and Decency Third Party already? I get it, it’s a view, just form it and Mitt Romney can caucus with it and then the rest of the center-right coalition can nod and move on.]
But at the same time, French’s argument – concerning a case before the Kentucky Courts – doesn’t engage at all with the situation Ahmari is talking about. He is talking about a situation constrained by the rules of civility required within a court proceeding, where failing to abide by said rules can find you in contempt. He is not engaging with the culture war situation Ahmari mentioned, hot-button, toxic, and without any of the mitigating entities promised by the American court system.
When French asks, “what did politeness, respect, and dignity cost anyone?”, he sounds like a hockey coach planning to run an all-finesse team out onto the ice. Perhaps their politeness, respect, and dignity will be awarded with a honor in defeat medal. Ahmari is more interested in a form of victory, as he sees it – which could be defined as a restorationist aim, or perhaps “leave us alone, or else” – and he blames French’s mindset for much of the losing.
Read his piece at First Things .
It isn’t easy to critique the persona of someone as nice as French. Then again, it is in part that earnest and insistently polite quality of his that I find unsuitable to the depth of the present crisis facing religious conservatives. Which is why I recently quipped on Twitter that there is no “polite, David French-ian third way around the cultural civil war.” (What prompted my ire was a Facebook ad for a children’s drag queen reading hour at a public library in Sacramento.)
I added, “The only way is through”—that is to say, to fight the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils in the form of a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good.
French prefers a different Christian strategy, and his guileless public mien and strategic preferences bespeak a particular political theology (though he would never use that term), one with which I take issue. Thus, my complaint about his politeness wasn’t a wanton attack; it implicated deeper matters.
Such talk—of politics as war and enmity—is thoroughly alien to French, I think, because he believes that the institutions of a technocratic market society are neutral zones that should, in theory, accommodate both traditional Christianity and the libertine ways and paganized ideology of the other side. Even if the latter—that is, the libertine and the pagan—predominate in elite institutions, French figures, then at least the former, traditional Christians, should be granted spaces in which to practice and preach what they sincerely believe.
Well, it doesn’t work out that way, and it hasn’t been working out that way for a long time—as French well knows, since he has spent a considerable part of his career admirably and passionately advocating for Christians coercively squeezed out of the public square. In that time, he—we—have won discrete victories, but the overall balance of forces has tilted inexorably away from us, and I think that French-ian model bears some of the blame.
More here.
I had the good fortune to grow up around a great many Christian people with Frenchian sentiments. They are very good and decent, but they also had a skewed perspective on politics and culture that assumed their foes in the public square would abide by certain rules and expectations that went out the window decades before.
There is a sweet naïveté and optimism to this belief, unburdened by awareness of the cultural Hindenburg we all currently inhabit. How could the ACLU, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and Bernie Sanders take stands against the active expression of religious belief when they all endorsed RFRA themselves two decades earlier? Bill Clinton signed it! Wouldn’t the hypocrisy shame them straight into the corner? Haha, you bigoted saps, watch and learn.
It is not particularly comforting to recognize we have reached a point in America where politeness and decency is no longer the best approach to politics. Most of the political class agrees with French. They would vastly prefer a world where everyone in politics has an approach like Paul Ryan. But even as the political elite, both leaders and staff, have insisted on that approach for years where culture and policy fights are concerned, something has come along which disrupts their chiding message about a cultural defense with the ease and give of a soft-boiled egg. It embraces the happy while forgetting the warrior part. Domesticated animals are always more welcome at the garden party atmosphere of the plexiglass roundtables shot through the airwaves, where people say “I think” about the news.
Consider the possibility that the people, honorable or dishonorable alike, who forever urged politeness and good behavior are wrong. Consider the possibility that the progressive movement has embraced views that will no longer tolerate even the presence of offensive views, as they are now practically the same as violence. Consider the possibility that a lifetime New York limousine liberal, mugged by the reality of abortion and convinced of the transactionalism of Christian voters, recognized a more brutal approach, an approach which actually spells out on national television what happens in a late term abortion, could be a better cultural defense than a thousand phone-ins to the March for Life.
It would be comforting to believe David French is correct about all of this. Many, even if they believe he is wrong, will continue to personally emulate his approach, unwilling to choose a more confrontational approach. The distaste with the Molotov is understandable. But the truth is the culture has long ago passed the point of consensus where it is possible for a peaceable navigation of the conflict.
Politics today is for the rough, the confrontational, and the unapologetic. It is not comfortable unless we lie to ourselves about where it is and where it is going. Instead, American Christians inhabit the position where their foes are animated by beliefs consistent with an apocryphal quote from Frank Herbert’s Children of Dune: “When I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your principles; when I am stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that is according to my principles.”
And it could get worse: it’s possible both the perspectives of these Christian conservative thinkers are too optimistic. Social conservatives should be most concerned that both French and Ahmari are wrong about what the enemies of freedom believe possible, that the harshest voices in the American left won’t be satisfied just driving traditional American values from the oped pages or the universities or the local boards. Instead, the left may be turning into the culture war white walkers, bent on utter and total destruction of everything American Christians hold dear – including the liberty to hold beliefs at odds with the consensus of the elite – and that they will root for that belief, even when it is hidden in their hearts.

"25 Years After Jackie Kennedy's Death, Melania Leans On Her Example - The Federalist",thefederalist.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/30/leaning-on-jackie-kennedys-example-25-years-after-her-death/,"May 30, 2019 By Stephanie Green
Twenty-five years ago this month, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died at her apartment in New York. This summer she would have been 90. Even in death, she continues to permeate our culture.
She is the first lady to whom all others are compared. The endless coverage of the sartorial adventures of the Duchess of Cambridge and Amal Clooney are littered with “very Jackie” references.
People magazine has a whole issue about her unflappable elegance, inspiring millennial readers to copy Jackie-like looks from fast-fashion shops. Even Kim Kardashian (yikes) has a piece of her: Mrs. Kanye West spent a reported $375, 000 on Jackie’s Cartier watch.
This year there are two more books to add to the ceaseless canon of Jackie-philia. In “The Editor,” by Steven Rowley, the fictional protagonist comes under the tutelage of Jackie during her editing years. Carly Simon’s memoir about her friendship with Jackie is due this fall as well.
I, for one, as a good student of Jackie, will be reading them both. But the anniversary of her passing got me wondering: What would Jackie think? In this era of ugliness and over-exposure, we need her more than ever. Is there really anyone on the world stage who rises to her mantle of Ultimate Aspirational Woman?
“She’d be horrified,” her friend, the novelist Jane Stanton Hitchcock, told me last week.
Can we imagine Jackie on Twitter, doling out random musings, or on Instagram documenting her morning toilette, like so many aging celebrities do? Her aversion to publicity and attention should be viewed as a rare virtue.
The late William F. Buckley recalled how she charmingly turned down his offer to be interviewed on a program about the Sistine Chapel. “Bill, the only time I ever appeared on television was when I took the camera around the White House after the renovations. I was so awful I decided never to do it again,” she joked. (Check out the famous White House tour on YouTube. It’s hardly “awful,” but her coyness and breathy affectations are rather entertaining.)
I remember the coverage of her funeral back in 1994, and what a good lesson it was in understatement.
“She was surrounded by her friends and family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved. And she did it in her own way, and we all feel lucky for that, and now she’s in God’s hands,” her son, John F. Kennedy Jr., explained shortly after she died.
Her funeral was like her life: private, elegant, and brief. Cameras weren’t allowed, and her casket was decorated with a tasteful cross made of Lily of the Valley, her favorite flower. Her sister, Lee Radziwill, was laid to rest earlier this year in similar stylish restraint. The Bouvier girls knew how to live, and how to die.
I can see Jackie having tea with Melania Trump in 2019. I tend to think she would appreciate the clever cat and mouse game Mrs. Trump plays with the media. “Just keep them guessing, dear,” she would advise. Jackie invented the “I really don’t care, do you?” attitude long before Melania wore those words on her jacket.
Like Jackie, Melania is Sphinx-like, ultra-feminine, but solid as a rock. Don’t try crossing her. You’ll end up like Mira Ricardel and Ben Bradlee—on the curb.
Jackie, I think, would love her dedication to her son and her healthy indifference to politics. The two would also have lots of notes to compare on marriage issues, and I’ll just leave it at that.
Jackie’s legacy in the internet age would be shut up, keep it simple, get off your phones, and go to a museum, the symphony, or spend quality time with family. When you’re having a bad day, just put on your dark shades and a Mona Lisa smile.

Why Ending The Death Penalty Only Benefits The Worst Criminals - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/30/ending-death-penalty-benefits-worst-criminals/,"By Russell La Valle May 30, 2019
When she was just 12, Lisa Marie Velasquez and her younger siblings watched in horror as her pregnant mother was murdered by an ex-boyfriend. Twelve years later, Lisa was repeatedly bludgeoned with a hammer and brutally dismembered, then her remains stuffed into trash bags. A week later, Bronx police discovered two bags of Lisa’s body parts in Crotona Park. Four days after that, three more bags containing Lisa’s remains were found in Barretto Point Park in Hunts Point.
When Bronx County District Attorney Darcel Clark announced indictments for the man and woman charged with the crime, she characterized Velasquez’s murder and torture as “the ultimate degradation of a human being.” The desecration was so unspeakable that Jacqueline Perez, Lisa’s aunt, was unable to identify her niece. Horrified by the sheer enormity of the atrocity, she declared, “I want the same thing to happen to them that happened to my niece!”
Perez’s raw plea for justice was fueled by righteous anger. Her shattered heart demanded accountability in the face of a monstrous injustice. She called for an unmistakable punitive response to those responsible for such a barbaric act. It was an appeal to a fundamental principle of justice in civil society. A justice rooted in “proportionality”—that punishment should be dispensed in direct relation to the level of injury caused to others. The Importance of Proportional Punishment
Applying proportionality in evaluating and punishing unlawful conduct is at the heart of any ethical administration of justice. It reinforces our obligation to pronounce moral judgment on criminal behavior and to implement a code of penalties appropriate to the crime. The most challenging and severe application of this principle is the imposition of the death penalty.
Robert James Bidinotto was a criminologist and investigative crime reporter in the infamous Willie Horton case. As he puts it, “To abandon proportionality in sentencing is to abandon the quest for justice itself. And to deny the death penalty for premeditated murder is to deny the very principle of fitting punishments to offenses. . . . Proportionate punishment is the moral keystone of any system of justice.”
In “Why The Death Penalty is Still Necessary,” professors Edward Feser and Joseph M. Bassette agree:
We reserve the death penalty in the United States for the most heinous murders and the most brutal and conscienceless murderers. . . . To sentence killers like those to less than death would fail to do justice because the penalty . . . would be grossly disproportionate to the heinousness of the crime.
However, many, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, have a different view. Newsom has said, “The death penalty is a failed policy that wastes money and is fundamentally immoral.” Recently, Newsom put his personal beliefs into action by granting reprieves for 737 death row inmates . Newsom’s unilateral action disregarded the direct will of Californians, who in 2016 voted to retain the death penalty via Proposition 62 and to expedite executions by streamlining the costly death penalty appeals process through Proposition 66.
Sadly, in today’s charged political climate, it has become fashionable to toss around the term “immoral” to shut down meaningful debate on important issues like the death penalty. Walls are apparently now immoral. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is immoral. Incorrect pronouns are immoral. Tuition is immoral. Masculinity is immoral. School mascots are immoral. Whiteness is immoral. Are you sensing a trend?
Morality has become usurped, cheapened, and diluted by outrage mobs. Regardless of the strength or truth of any countervailing arguments, these mobs don’t hesitate to arbitrarily label anything “immoral” if it’s contrary to their ideas or ruffles their high-minded feathers. The result is a self-righteous, cynical, partisan game that reduces everything to derision and denunciation.
Proportional justice must be anchored in the principle of retribution to counteract this brand of toxic thinking. Only on this firm foundation can we avoid the irrational, mindless reprisals and revenge in reaction to crime and its adjudication.
Contrary to death penalty opponents, retribution is not that same as revenge. It is not vindictive or some blind retaliation of “an eye for an eye.” It is a measured and rational moral response to capital offenses, free from any personal animosity. The Origins of Retributive Justice
At its root, the word retribution derives from the Latin for “recompense, repayment” or to “hand back.” Originally, “that which is given in return for past good or evil.” In more modern usage it has become “evil given for evil deeds.” This definition finds its roots in virtually all religions and cultures, including the Judeo-Christian heritage that undergirds America’s founding.
Retribution “casts back” upon criminals the harm, injury, pain, and suffering they have caused. In the case of the death penalty, if we can agree that human life is our highest moral value, then murder is the greatest moral affront to civilized society. Feser and Bessette again explain:
Perhaps most importantly, in its supreme gravity it [the death penalty] promotes belief in and respect for the majesty of the moral order and for the system of human law that both derives from and supports that moral order.
Yet, even in the face of this, many still consider the death penalty “unconstitutional” and regard its application as “cruel and unusual” punishment.
In 2015, the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia reminded Americans that the death penalty is firmly rooted in the U.S. Constitution. In Glossip v. Gross , he cited the Fifth Amendment’s provision that “no person shall be held to answer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,” nor “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”
Scalia noted, “Not once in the history of the American Republic has this court ever suggested the death penalty is categorically impermissible.” He argued it was “impossible to hold unconstitutional that which the Constitution explicitly contemplates.”
As for the notion of cruel and unusual punishment, Scalia continued, “Historically, the Eighth Amendment was understood to bar only those punishments that added ‘terror, pain, or disgrace’ (Baze v. Rees) to an otherwise permissible capital sentence.” He stated that he “would not presume to tell parents whose life has been forever altered by the brutal murder of a child that life imprisonment is punishment enough.” Life in Prison Is Sometimes Not Enough
Scalia’s sentiments have been echoed by countless grieving relatives who have earnestly pleaded to know why life imprisonment is considered the worst fate for heinous criminals. This impassioned question was underscored loudly in the Willie Horton case.
After serving only ten years, Horton made a mockery of his original sentence of “life without the possibility of parole.” After being transferred to a minimum-security prison, Horton soon became eligible for work release. It was on an unsupervised weekend furlough that he committed armed robbery and assault, subsequently torturing and raping a Maryland couple for 12 hours.
Unfortunately for untold victims and their families, the Horton episode is not an isolated case. Life sentences seldom mean “for life,” or anything even close to it. Last year, Herman Bell was released from prison after serving 44 years. Along with two other members of the Black Liberation Army, Bell had been convicted of coldly planning and carrying out the assassination of two police officers in 1971.
Even more recently, Weather Underground terrorist Judith Clark won parole after only serving 38 years of a 75 years-to-life sentence for her participation in a 1981 bungled armored car heist that killed two police officers and a Brinks security guard. William Smith Jr., the dissenting vote against Clark’s release, wrote: “Release at this time would deprecate the seriousness of the offenses and undermine respect for the law. In time . . . media coverage will lessen. What will not diminish is the loss felt by the loved ones . . . the sounds of their weeping will remain.”
“What kind of justice is this?” ask victims’ loved ones. Friends and family of the victims not only remain lifetime victims themselves, but must stand by as murderers can fill their lives while incarcerated with entertainment, sports, formal education, vocational training, psychological and spiritual counseling, libraries, gardening, and a whole host of fulfilling activities.
Yet those murderers have killed may experience none of this, of course. Why should murderers get what their victims never can again? When do the families of victims get to resume their lives, put their grief aside, and attempt to recover from a loss that is unrecoverable? Who has the true life sentence? We Must Uphold Life as Our Highest Moral Value
In a time of mass shootings, terror-driven beheadings, the slaughter of innocent children, and the senseless moral depravity of gang violence and human trafficking, the death penalty has an even greater role to play in the defense of human life. In a nation claiming to value both life and the rule of law, it becomes a moral necessity.
Human life is our highest moral value. It is precisely because we cherish human life that the state must sometimes end the lives of those who have wantonly ended it. In our commitment to justice, we must make the hard, sober, moral declaration that there are some crimes that cannot be forgiven, or repaid through imprisonment of whatever length. There are certain acts for which the only appropriate punishment is the ultimate penalty—the forfeiture of one’s life.
We take no pleasure in the solemn duty of carrying out capital punishment, nor should we make apologies for a civil society requiring retributive justice. But by punishing criminals appropriately and proportionally, as befits their crimes, we can honor the Lisa Marie Velasquezes of the world.

"God Doesn't Love Abortion, And If You Say So You're Not A Real Pastor",thefederalist.com,Glenn T. Stanton,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/31/no-god-doesnt-love-abortion-say-youre-not-real-pastor/,"By Glenn T. Stanton May 31, 2019
The left has been on a frantic jag the last few weeks to get us all to remember just how wonderful and important abortion is. One of the most despicably desperate efforts was a recent New York Times editorial by a particularly infamous late-term abortionist explaining (and this is not a typo) “ Pregnancy kills. Abortion saves lives .”
Pregnancy: Very bad. Abortion: Very good. But of course, 100 percent of everyone who has ever existed does so because a pregnancy did what it naturally does and an abortion didn’t. The craziness of this editorial is a dramatic demonstration of just how paralyzed with fear these folks are about losing their cherished right to be free of children.
The Atlantic recently published a less dramatic, but equally desperate, article entitled “ A Pastor’s Case for the Morality of Abortion .” Three trigger words here are supposed to create a confused dissonance: Pastor. Morality. Abortion. A case for the morality of abortion by a pastor. We imagine The Atlantic’s headline writers envisioned so many of us concluding abortion might not be so bad if a pastor thinks it’s moral. There is no other reason for the story. It’s certainly not newsworthy.
This pastor, Jes Kast , is not well-known. She is extremely fringe and not particularly influential. She didn’t recently change her position on the issue through dramatic soul-searching. And she’s a United Church of Christ pastor, a denomination that never saw an abortion it couldn’t celebrate. She also describes herself as a femme queer lesbian who wants us to “queer this sh-t” we call our lives.
She serves on Planned Parenthood’s national Clergy Advocacy Board and talks endlessly about the need to protect “reproductive rights,” as if she’s pro-fertility. She’s not. She’s a woman who’s proudly political even in her choice of lipstick .
Every day I put my lipstick on, it is a form of protest. When Hitler took over and the war was going on women who were fighting back against the Nazi infiltration would wear red lipstick. Hitler apparently hated it when women wore red lipstick. So for me, it’s an act of protest to put red lipstick on.
This is the person The Atlantic chose to make the moral case for abortion. On top of all this, she doesn’t even make a decent case, as if there is one, much less from a Christian perspective. But let’s give her the respect of taking seriously what she says. Abortion For Any Reason Is Totally Moral
First, she is very clear that she is all-in on abortion. When asked if she perceives any instance under which abortion is immoral, she says definitively, “I don’t. I really don’t.” These are the words of a fanatic. That’s not an accusation, but a fact. She believes that snuffing out the life of a pre-born child is such an inherent good in and of itself that nothing should override it.
Not the abortion of a girl because a boy was desired, which happens by the millions around the world. How does a feminist square that? Not because one has a cruise coming up in six months. Not because the mother just wants to. These and any other reason are more weighty than the life of the child. That is pure fanaticism.
If Kast thinks the above are extremist examples, then she shouldn’t justify abortion by bringing up the rationale of the 12-year-old rape victim, which she does. It’s the reddest of herrings. Tragic as this would be, the extremely abortion-friendly Guttmacher Institute tells us that only 1 percent of women who get abortions do so because of rape and less than 0.5 percent do so because of incest.
But these make up perhaps 98 percent or so of the reasons folks give for why abortion should be legal. According to Guttmacher, 74 percent say they had their abortion because having a baby would dramatically change their lives or because they think they can’t afford a baby right now. The Jesus Who Allows Whatever I Want
So what is Kast’s theological case?
Most anyone would agree she’s quite creative with scripture. In her rationale, she quotes Jesus saying, “I have come that they might have life and have it abundantly.” It’s a wonderful statement from the savior, but you should sit down for her commentary on how this makes abortion moral.
What Jesus means here, she explains, is that “God’s plan for our lives is to actually have a meaningful life with loving contentment and satisfaction.” She continues, “Because of that—because I value life, and I believe Jesus values life—I value the choices that give us the type of life we need.” Claiming that access to abortion is a part of why Jesus came and the abundant life he offers is abhorrent and blasphemous. Has she no shame?
But she’s not done; “When people talk about, ‘Our body is a temple of God, and holy,’ I see that as, I have the right to choices over my body, and the freedom to make the decisions that are right for me.” Apparently she thinks this is compelling. That is the fullness of her case for the morality of abortion. Basically, she is giving the precise rationale for abortion that prosperity preachers give for why God wants you rich. The True Christian Story Starts in the Womb
What this pastor misses is that which is at the very center of Christianity—Christ Himself. She must know where His story starts.
The Christian story begins with God becoming fully human, not in the Christmas manger, but nine months earlier as a human zygote in the womb of a teenage girl who was not yet married. This is quite a dramatic introduction to Christianity, and it says everything about the morality of abortion for the Christian.
If God enters the world as the smallest of unborn human life, the smallest of unborn human life is very significant indeed. Christianity’s savior grew every day from that moment of his divine conception in Mary’s fallopian tubes, nestling and growing in her womb, never becoming anything more than what he was at that moment—fully God and fully man. Thus, Christianity has always taken an extremely high and unique view of the unborn, more so than any other religion or philosophy. This cannot be overstated.
Our pastor misses that this is precisely why the earliest official collection of Christian ethics and morality—found in the “ Didache , ” or “Teaching of the Apostles”—clearly states that no one “shall murder a child by abortion, nor kill them when born.” This is in the same list that prohibits adultery, fornication, stealing, murder, lying or speaking evil. (Chapter 2:2) Abortion is immoral. The First Worshippers of Christ Understood This
Our pastor also fails to appreciate who the first recorded worshipers of Jesus were, and where this all took place. It happens in a very wonderful and intimate place—another woman’s womb. Early in her pregnancy, Mary, Jesus’s mother, goes to visit Elizabeth, her close family member who is also with child. The moment Mary walks through the door of Elizabeth’s home, something remarkable happens in utero.
The child growing inside of Elizabeth, none other than Jesus’s cousin, John the Baptist, leaps with joy at the arrival of his savior. Likewise, Elizabeth reveres the one who is in Mary’s womb. The first worshipers of Jesus are a pregnant woman and her unborn son. The womb and its natural bounty are very sacred and fundamental parts of the Christian tale.
Thus, no pastor can remain faithful to the belief system he has supposedly dedicated himself to serve, teach, and proclaim, yet dismiss the inestimable value of life in the womb from the moment of conception. A life exists there because God delighted in creating and sending that wholly unique life into the world as a gift and blessing. A life that bears God’s very image and likeness.
People who contend that ending life in the womb is moral have made themselves God, telling Him they reject His gift and know best. They have denied who Christ was and became. It is to dismiss the wonder of His own history and essence. Any pastor who teaches this has denied the center of his own faith.
This pastor says she follows “this guy named Jesus who said, above all … love your neighbor as yourself.” She believes protecting so-called “reproductive freedom” and “women’s health” does this. She refuses to appreciate that the unborn is the most vulnerable of neighbors that lives right under a mother’s heart.
There is no moral, Christian case for abortion. And there’s no space in Christianity for pastors, in direct violation of the Lord’s apostles , who teach that there is. Glenn T.

Fixing Higher Education Starts With More Teaching And Less Research,thefederalist.com,Krystina Skurk,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/31/fixing-higher-education-starts-with-more-teaching-and-less-research/,"By Krystina Skurk May 31, 2019
Richard Vedder, a professor emeritus of economics at Ohio University, paints a stark picture of the modern university in his new book, Restoring the Promise: Higher Education in America .
Vedder laments the rising cost of attending college, the falling standards, increased government regulation, and a de-emphasis on teaching. Vedder is an expert at diagnosing many of the problems within the research university, although at times he offers impractical and improbable solutions. Teaching Versus Research
One of Vedder’s primary concerns is that teaching undergraduates is no longer a priority at many universities. Instead, research, athletics, and other business ventures (conference centers, hotels, hospitals, etc.) garner a large amount of administrations’ attention and university budgets.
He writes that at many universities faculty members only teach for 4-8 hours a week. At these universities, undergraduate classes are thus taught by adjunct professors or graduate students. This may save the universities money and give faculty members more time to write research grant proposals, but it is not in the best interest of students.
In the essay, “ Who Killed Homer?: The Prequel ,” Victor Davis Hanson and John Heath agree with Vedder’s assertion that teaching is growing less important to academics. In reference to applicants for offices within the Society for Classical Studies, they write, “How sad that we are to vote for those who give us the least amount of evidence that they have taught the ordinary student in any personal fashion or written anything anyone has read.”
Hanson and Heath explain that in 1992 twice as many scholars published 50 percent more material in twice as many journals than they did in 1962. Hanson writes, “No one has calculated how much capital and how many ditched classes and ignored students were invested in this new experiment in mass publication.” Vedder agrees, saying there have been more than 20,000 articles published about William Shakespeare in the past 20 years, and at some point research has diminishing returns. Accordingly, Vedder’s proposal for change here is reasonable, restore the balance between teaching and research by increasing teaching loads.
For teaching to reclaim a place of honor, incentives would have to change. Currently, professors receive prestige and recognition for researching microscopic subcategories, not for producing competent students. Vedder explains that many departments within universities are funded by research grants. Therefore, de-emphasizing research within the university would require a major institutional shift, one that no university or faculty member has any incentive to make. A Broken Financial System
Vedder argues that government student loans have contributed significantly to the rise in college prices. According to Vedder, the Bennett Hypothesis states that colleges raise their fees because they know taxpayer-backed student debt will provide the means for students to stay in school. Students never see the money they are given for college and thus have no true concept of how much debt they are going into.
Moreover, colleges are incentivized to accept all students who apply, regardless of that student’s academic record. Vedder notes that students who are underprepared for college often do not graduate. They are thus left in massive debt, but with no degree.
To discourage colleges from accepting students unlikely to succeed, Vedder recommends that colleges have “skin in the game,” by being penalized when their students default on school loans. Vedder also suggests phasing out federal funding and allowing private institutions to take over. Although radical, this is one of Vedder’s better proposals. It would turn the enterprise of student loans into a commercial affair. Students will be looked at as more of an investment rather than a piggy bank for colleges.
Vedder also argues that the growth of the university bureaucracy is unnecessary and fiscally irresponsible. He writes, “This massive administrative explosion is expensive, significantly adding to the costs of higher education.” While the private sector works hard to trim costs, colleges are not so incentivized. Vedder explains that before 1976 faculty members outnumbered college staff 2.4 to 1, but now the reverse is true.
He observes that the University of California president’s office alone has 2,000 employees. Vedder points out that not only is this bureaucratic takeover increasing the financial burden on students, it is also taking away power from faculty members. This is possibly the root of why so many universities are losing their focus on academics and instead pouring resources into athletics and other non-core activities, according to Vedder. He writes, “Administrative bloat both raises costs and diminishes academic quality.” Accreditation Is Also a Mess
In the section “Accreditation’s Nine Deadly Sins,” Vedder rightly points to the current accreditation process as one of the major issues facing higher education. Accreditation is so complex that colleges often have to spend millions in creating reports and answering queries for it. Moreover, accrediting agencies wield so much power that they can all but force a law school to spend thousands on its library or force business schools to hire more professors with doctorates.
Vedder also argues that the accreditation system is not transparent, as reports generated for it are rarely made public. Further, colleges seldom lose their accreditation, even when it is clear that they are offering a sub-par education. Vedder does not believe that accreditation reports provide useful information to consumers or to donors.
He writes, “The dominant purpose of accreditation is to inform- to provide information to potential students, their parents, those governing universities, taxpayers, donors, and even sometimes the institution itself…” However, Vedder does not believe that accrediting agencies are giving the public such information. He writes that major schools are rarely chastised or seem to make meaningful improvements.
In particular, Vedder does not like the binary nature of accreditation. He does not believe an institution should either be accredited or not, but instead should be given an accreditation score. This score would help consumers differentiate between higher-quality colleges and lower-quality colleges.
While Vedder likely agrees that the voluntary nature of accreditation needs to be restored by breaking the monopoly of the six regional accreditors, his solution to do so is unwise. Vedder argues that all six regional accrediting agencies should be consolidated into one national accrediting agency.
This is a cure worse than the disease. This kind of consolidation would give accrediting agencies more coercive power over universities, create more conflicts of interest, and lead to a greater homogeneity of ideas within the university. A better solution is to create more accrediting agencies, not less. This decentralizes power and works towards making accreditation voluntary once again.
Vedder’s overall diagnosis of the accreditation problem is correct, however. Accrediting agencies measure inputs such as the number of credentialed teachers, the number of credit hours offered, and the number of books in the library, instead of outputs like how much students are learning and how capable they are at succeeding in a career. One of Vedder’s solutions is to measure outputs by having students take a national college exit exam. The cumulative scores of these tests would be made public so consumers will know which colleges are actually teaching best.
Vedder observes that the accreditation process is a means by which the federal government has sought to centralize control over American higher education. He writes that in the 1950s accreditation was voluntary, but now because federal aid relies on accreditation, colleges can’t survive without it. The federal government now uses accreditation as a way to force colleges to comply with a large amount of regulation.
Vedder does not suggest decoupling federal financial aid and accreditation, probably because he does not believe the government should be giving financial aid. He predicts that if the government financial assistance programs ended, so would the current broken accreditation system. Break the University Monopoly
Vedder’s most radical proposal is to get rid of the university system altogether and instead allow students to take classes from many universities instead of just choosing one. In this scenario, accrediting agencies accredit classes, not whole universities or degree programs. Students could hypothetically take five classes from each of the eight Ivy League schools then apply to some sort of course aggregator and degree certifier to get their diplomas.
Perhaps Vedder is using this idea as a tool to start making higher education leaders think outside of the institutional box, or maybe he is merely trying to be the gadfly, making the system aware of its own shortcoming. Unfortunately, Vedder does not seem like the philosophical type, which means this might be a real proposal.
In that case, we should remember Edmund Burke’s chide to the French revolutionaries, “[Y]ou possessed in some parts the walls, and, in all, the foundations, of a noble and venerable castle. You might have repaired those walls; you might have built on those old foundations.” Although the university system has forgotten its roots and indulged in excess, does that mean that it should be torn down instead of repaired? Ignoring the Real Liberal Arts
Vedder’s view of education largely centers around economics. To him, getting a degree is an investment in one’s future income-making capacity. Like many in modern universities, Vedder confuses a good education’s byproduct with its end. If the purpose of education is merely to make yourself marketable, then Vedder is right: students should only major in practical subjects instead of the humanities and arts. Yet, if the purpose of a good education is to shape the human soul and mold the mind, then some of Vedder’s proposals are wanting.
He argues that a “college for all” mindset has led to credential inflation. The demand for high-skilled labor is not keeping up with the amount of college graduates. So we end up with debt-ridden graduates working at Starbucks. Vedder’s solution is to encourage students to major in “vocationally relevant areas of study” such as accounting, science, and economics, as well as encouraging others to go to vocational schools instead of a four-year university.
Vedder has spent decades working in higher education, yet his perspective is limited to the large research university. He does not seem to take seriously the liberal arts schools scattered across the nation. He repeatedly tears down and builds up the modern research university, but rarely mentions liberal arts colleges, much less as an alternative model.
This might be because, to him, education is only a cost-benefit analysis. However, in the case of education, this method does not work, as the benefits of learning are often not quantifiable. A national college exit exam might measure knowledge, but it can’t measure growth in intellectual, emotional, relational, and moral maturity – all things that the college experience can give.
In his book Liberty and Learning , Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn states, “The Founders in their political understanding point up toward the permanent, the final, and the divine, in the same way that liberal (classical liberal) education does.” Arnn argues that modern education at its worst reduces human beings to their material needs, those needs they have in common with every animal.
The liberal arts, on the other hand, teach that man is capable of rising above matter to take part in higher things. The liberal arts teach students how to be whole human beings instead of merely readers and calculators. They cultivate character and mind instead of simply fulfilling credit-hour requirements or learning a list of facts or techniques.
Hating the modern university, although almost an understandable impulse, can lead to bad reforms, ones that harm teaching and research. Vedder’s problem might be that he hates the modern research university too much. Perhaps instead of razing the system to the ground, he might look to the genuine liberal arts model as an alternative.

"Lawsuit Exposes How Media, Deep State Hatched The Russiagate Hoax",thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/31/lawsuit-exposes-media-deep-state-hatched-russiagate-hoax/,"By Margot Cleveland May 31, 2019
Reading the defamation complaint Svetlana Lokhova filed last Thursday against Stefan Halper and three media giants felt like paging through a Nicholas Sparks novel. But instead of finding a formulistic young love tragedy turned epic romance, Lokhova’s lawsuit exposed the outline the intelligence community used to spread the Russia collusion fiction. It also revealed that the United Kingdom held a prominent role in the plot development.
Other than a blip of notoriety in 2015 when she won a £3.1 million award in a harassment case against her former employer, the Russian bank Sberbank CIB, Lokhova resided in obscurity at Cambridge University. At Cambridge, Lokhova focused on completing her PhD in Soviet Intelligence Studies under the tutelage of Professor Christopher Andrew.
According to Lokhova’s complaint, all that changed on February 19, 2017, when her long-time mentor penned an article for the U.K.’s Sunday Times, painting her as a Russian spy and possible paramour-in-waiting for Michael Flynn. These are the allegedly false and defamatory claims that formed the basis for her lawsuit.
In her lawsuit, Lokhova detailed the backdrop to Andrew’s article then laid out its aftermath, before blaming not just Andrew, but FBI informant Stefan Halper and three media powerhouses with embroiling “an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 Presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America.” But in sharing her story of how the intelligence community and press sucked her into the Spygate scandal, Lokhova also laid bare the formula used to fake the Russia collusion narrative and convince the public that President Trump conspired with the Kremlin.
The isolated nature of Lokhova’s supposed involvement in the purported Russia collusion provides the perfect opportunity for outlining the formula used for more than three years to peddle the hoax. Here’s the template. Step 1: A Credentialed Individual Launches the Narrative
The first step to crafting a somewhat believable Russia collusion narrative involves the use of a credentialed individual—an expert, someone connected, someone with credibility. Andrew, the author of the Sunday Times hit piece, easily served that role.
He touted his position as the former official historian of MI5 and an organizer of the Cambridge intelligence seminar, and proceeded to explain how he had met Flynn three years prior when Flynn was serving as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was at this seminar that Flynn also crossed paths with Lokhova, whom Andrew explained was a postgraduate student at Cambridge. Step 2: Insert Factually Accurate Details
Next you need some factually accurate details. For Andrew, those consisted of background facts about Flynn, such as that he served as Obama’s director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, before the former president fired him.
Then Flynn joined the Trump team as the president’s national security adviser, Andrew explained, until Trump also fired him. Andrew’s connection to Cambridge and the British counterintelligence group MI5 could also be readily confirmed, adding to the believability of the yarn. Step 3: Wordsmith the Article for Maximum Innuendo
After laying this groundwork, it’s time for the innuendo. And Andrew excelled at innuendo. The title, “Impulsive General Misha shoots himself in the foot,” set the tone, with the foreign moniker Misha sensualizing the scene.
“General Misha,” Andrew claimed, was how Flynn signed email correspondence with Lokhova, the young Russian-born student with whom Flynn “was especially struck,” and with whom he showcased an “evidence pleasure in engaging.”
Andrew then sexualized this brief scholarly encounter by sharing that at the seminar Lokhova showed Flynn some rare Russian documents, including what Andrew described as “an erotic postcard sent by Stalin” to a 16-year-old girl. The card, Andrew explained, “showed a passionate embrace between two partially clothed lovers. Stalin wrote that he was sending with it ‘not just a simple kiss, but a ho one (because there is no point kissing any other way).’”
With the theme now clear, Andrew told readers that “At the end of the evening, Flynn invited the student to accompany him on his next official visit to Moscow,” providing “striking evidence of his spontaneity,” and demonstrating Flynn’s “instinct when he sees a new opportunity is to follow it up.” But alas, that trip was cancelled “in protest against Russian policy in Ukraine,” Andrew noted to explain why the rendezvous never occurred.
Here again you see the factually accurate details used to bolster the storyline: Russia’s March 7, 2014, incursion into Ukraine and Flynn’s assertion that the intelligence community had predicted the likely Russia intervention a week earlier, timed perfectly to Flynn’s February 28, 2014, chance encounter with Lokhova. Yet, even with the trip canceled, Lokhova and Flynn stayed in touch, Andrew stressed, while implying impropriety. Step 4: Hook to Real News Involving Russia
Intrigue alone is not newsworthy, so the next step requires hooking to a valid new story to suggest a Russian connection. Andrew hooked his tale of General Misha’s meet-up with the Russian-born Lokhova to Trump’s firing of Flynn a week earlier following revelations that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador, although telling Vice President Mike Pence that he hadn’t.
Then Andrew, in what could possibly be the non sequitur of the year, claimed Flynn’s meeting with Lokhova “provides some context for his intercepted telephone conversation with the Russian ambassador in Washington.” Step 5: Playing the Saint While Suggesting Criminal Activity
Andrew quickly pivots from that point, lest readers ponder too long: “Wait, what context?” And in doing so, Andrew puts himself on the side of the angels by castigating those who leaked details of Flynn’s call to the media.
Andrew does this so deftly that he is able to simultaneously cast aside concerns that Flynn’s call was being recorded and imply that Flynn acted criminally: “As a former intelligence chief, Flynn must have known [the call] would be routinely recorded under the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Whether or not Flynn behaved illegally, those who leaked intelligence about the call to the media clearly did so.” Step 6: Insert Trump Into the Story
The next step requires inserting Trump into the story to implicate the president in the nefarious Russian dealings, coupled with some gratuitous disparagement of the commander-in-chief to remind readers that he’s the bad guy. What better way to achieve this goal than quoting a Trump tweet?
That was Andrew’s tactic and how he closed his hit piece on Lokhova: “’The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very unAmerican!’ Trump tweeted on Wednesday. No president in US history has attacked his own intelligence community as publicly and stridently as Trump. But then no president has begun his term with such confusion over the management of national security either.” Step 7: Media Outlets Seemingly Corroborate the Hit Piece
In 635 words, Andrew laid the groundwork necessary for the media to pounce. First, journalists followed the crumbs Andrew had sprinkled throughout his article. So, when the Wall Street Journal picked up the tale the next month, it identified Lokhova as the graduate student Flynn spoke with at the seminar, and February 2014 as the relevant time period.
The WSJ then added a detail that bolstered the Russian spy theme, noting that “the 2016 Frankfurt Book Fair listing proposed books shows one by a Svetlana Lokhova called ‘The Americans,’ which was pitched as ‘A Cambridge-based Russian intelligence expert uses archive material to unearth details of Stalin’s program of sending deep cover spies into the U.S.’”
None of this, of course, verified Andrew’s claim that Flynn had invited Lokhova to Russia or supported his suggestion of an inappropriate relationship between the two. But by confirming some of the details in the story, it gave credence to all of Andrew’s claims—claims that Lokhova disputes in her lawsuit. Step 8: Quote Anonymous Sources to Root Misconduct Related to Russia
The Wall Street Journal article then moved on to the next step: using experts to establish misconduct. Here, the claimed misconduct was Flynn’s failure to disclose his interaction with Lokhova following his February 2014 meeting. “There is no record showing that Mr. Flynn reported his interaction with Ms. Lokhova to security officials in the Defense Department, said a former senior U.S. official with knowledge of the matter,” the Wall Street Journal reported.
The former official added that “as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, which is part of the Pentagon and the military’s largest intelligence organization, Mr. Flynn was expected to notify officials about any contacts with foreigners he didn’t know, particularly from an adversary nation such as Russia.” Step 9: Connect to the Russia Collusion Narrative
While the misconduct suggested in the Wall Street Journal article predated Trump’s political career and the 2016 election, the pivot came next, with a quick transition to Flynn’s current troubles and his connection to the Trump campaign. Flynn served as “a key campaign adviser to Donald Trump and became the president’s national-security adviser in January,” the article noted. Continuing, the article pushed the Russia collusion narrative:
He was forced to resign last month over revelations that he hadn’t been truthful to Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials in describing the nature of conversations Mr. Flynn had with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. last December. Several U.S. intelligence agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are conducting a wide-ranging counterintelligence probe into any contacts that Trump campaign personnel may have had with Russian officials, in the wake of intelligence agencies’ findings that the Russian government directed hackers who interfered in last year’s election by stealing emails, including from the Democratic National Committee. Russia has denied any interference in the election. It isn’t known when Mr. Flynn’s contact with Ms. Lokhova at the 2014 meeting came to the attention of U.S. intelligence or whether it is part of the current investigation.
Two weeks later, The Guardian used the story of Flynn’s meeting with Lokhova to push the Russia collusion narrative even further. After noting the backdrop of the Cambridge seminar and repeating many of the details the Sunday Times had originally reported, The Guardian took pains to paint Lokhova’s connections with Russia as suspicious.
“A historian and a leading expert on Soviet espionage, Lokhova has claimed to have unique access to previously classified Soviet-era material in Moscow,” The Guardian reported. Then quoting “Western historians,” The Guardian stressed that under Vladimir Putin access to such archives is extremely limited, with “maybe two or three military historians” allowed in, implying Lokhova held a connection to the Russian leader.
Next came The Guardian’s use of anonymous sources to legitimize the reported concerns over the Flynn-Lokhova connection. “Multiple sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,” The Guardian reported, “said the CIA and FBI were discussing this episode, along with many others, as they assessed Flynn’s suitability to serve as national security adviser.”
From there, The Guardian connected Flynn’s conduct to the president, and the Russia collusion investigation: “Flynn indicated he was willing to testify before the FBI and congressional committees about potential links between the Trump campaign and Russia in exchange for immunity.” Step 10: Repeat Narrative Until It’s Conventional Wisdom
So, within a month, the media moved from vague innuendos dangled by a U.K. intelligence insider to suggesting Flynn had questionable contacts with a Russian mole and, in exchange for immunity, was ready to reveal links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Yet, according to the complaint Lokhova filed last week, none of it was true: she was neither a Russian spy nor romantically connected to Flynn.
But no matter. If the media repeats the false narrative often enough, it becomes the conventional wisdom—it becomes the media’s truth—whether it is the press pushing the Russia collusion conspiracy with reports of the Steele’s dossier, Carter Page’s supposed spying-inducing behavior, George Papadopoulos’ purported inside knowledge of the WikiLeaks hack, the Trump Tower meeting, or stories that Trump’s team softened the Republican National Convention’s platform on Russia. The stories began with innuendo wrapped in unrelated facts, leaks from unnamed sources seemingly verified elements of the tale, and a complicit media then wove the strands into a growing Russia collusion narrative.
Unraveling that truth, though, is time consuming and requires a depth of details that few Americans care to have. Trump understands this, which is why the terms “SpyGate” and “Fake News” regularly appear in his Twitter feed: Everyone understands what he means, even if they’ve never heard of a random academic in the U.K. named Svetlana Lokhova.

"So Far, Hollywood’s Boycott Of Georgia Over Its Abortion Ban Is All Bluster",thefederalist.com,Brad Slager,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/31/far-hollywoods-boycott-georgia-abortion-ban-bluster/,"By Brad Slager May 31, 2019
In the weeks of debate leading up to the Georgia legislature voting to tighten the restrictions on obtaining an abortion, there was a significant level of outrage. Most of that came from people who do not live in Georgia.
A number of celebrities from Hollywood were in full activist mode. Dozens put their names to a petition pledging to no longer work in the state if the bill became law. An amusing part of their argument has been that their pull-out will only cause productions to select other actors.
Several of the elitist performers have said some issues are more important than the loss of money. They made this argument, oblivious that they were attempting to extort Georgia voters into doing what they wanted or lose significant entertainment dollars.
The influence of these luminaries was so profound that the legislature passed the bill, and Gov. Brian Kemp (not Stacey Abrams) signed it shortly after. So these brazen mouthpieces are now faced with having to follow up on their threats. What has become of those ardently militant celebrities today? The results have been far less than dramatic.
This became a Hollywood issue because Georgia has exploded in the past decade as a destination for film and television production. The effort to offer tax breaks and a union-free labor pool meant studios voted with their wallets and flocked to the region. Now a large number of performers who resent Southern values and despise conservative politics find themselves working in a societal nightmare. The state has been derisively dubbed “Y’all-ywood.”
The first to respond have been smaller players, with not much influence on the industry. Independent filmmakers, such as Mark Duplass and Christine Vachon, have pledged to do no work in the state, but these producers are usually involved in small-budget projects and unlikely to be felt much by Georgia residents.
In an effort to underscore the entertainers’ efforts, Variety dutifully reported on a Kristen Wiig comedy film supposedly leaving. The film “Barb And Star Go To Vista Del Mar” was said to be fleeing, but it is not entirely accurate statement from the industry paper. The film had only been announced as a Lionsgate property one month earlier. It has not begun production yet, so to say it has “pulled out” of the state is an overstatement.
The movie’s plot concerns two women who take a trip from the Midwest to Florida, and is not set in Georgia. This means it had been initially slated to film there for one purpose: budget. These types of comedies generally have modest budgets, so they likely will be hurting themselves as much, or more, than the workers in Georgia in order to live their values.
Some of the bigger names who have made bold-sounding statements find their stance crumbling under analysis. Players such as writer/director Jordan Peele, and director/producer J.J. Abrams have declared that they will donate their salaries earned on the shooting of “Lovecraft Country” to the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
While this appears to take a strong stand, they continue to work in the state. They will be supporting their cause (likely with tax-deductible donations, blunting the personal suffering) but they are still working within Peach State borders. The local industry is not going to feel a change due to their decision.
Netflix turned heads when it announced that it is contemplating future productions in Georgia as a result of the law. This is a significant difference, in that a defacto studio is making the threat, concerning a wide range of work. It does seem surprising to see a company of this size making a political declaration, but recall this is the outlet that paid millions to the Obamas to create original content for the platform. But even this is a qualified declaration.
Just like actor Jason Bateman’s position on the matter, whose show “Ozark” is a Netflix property that films in Georgia, the bold words seem more like a vague threat of things that may happen in the distant future. Although Deadline Hollywood reports that Netflix is the first studio “to take a stand” against the strict abortion law, it actually has not done so. Netflix and Bateman have said they will continue their work in the area, and wait to see if the law is upheld by the courts.
“Given the legislation has not yet been implemented, we’ll continue to film there — while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to. Should it ever come into effect, we’d rethink our entire investment in Georgia,” he said.
The law will not take effect until January 2020. Any court challenges, including the likelihood of it going to the Supreme Court, will be taking place much further in the future. This is a way to sound like you are taking a stern stand, while allowing the status quo to continue. Note how many of these firm voices are not pulling up stakes and leaving today.
It is important to these celebrities to posture about how they are making the “correct” stance against this new law. In the meantime, these brave-sounding celebrities continue enjoy Georgia’s financial benefits that help get them onto our screens.

Equality Act Would Devastate Parents' Ability To Get Trans Children Help,thefederalist.com,Nancy Pearcey,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/31/equality-act-devastate-parents-ability-get-trans-children-help/,"May 31, 2019
Linda is facing every parent’s dreaded nightmare: Her daughter has cut her out of her life.
A year ago, her 23-year-old daughter decided she was really a man, changed her name, and began testosterone treatment. One fateful day Linda found a note in her mailbox: “I will not be initiating further contact with you and ask that you respect my wish for no further contact.”
Linda was devastated. “It’s like when your child joins a cult,” she told me.
Two weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed the deceptively named Equality Act , which amends the Civil Rights Act to include “sexual orientation and gender identity” (shortened to SOGI). The bill is now in the Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claims it will bring the nation “closer to equal liberty and justice for all.”
But will it? SOGI laws already exist on the state and local levels, and their real effect is to impose a radical sexual ideology that delegitimizes parents and tears apart families. To predict the effect of the Equality Act, we need to move beyond political sloganeering and listen to the stories of real people. (All names are pseudonyms, but their stories are real.) Parents Called Bigots for Trying to Truly Help Their Kids
Transgender activists insist the only acceptable way to treat gender dysphoria is with puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery. But is it really good practice to turn children into life-long medical patients? We are talking about powerful drugs that have negative side effects and surgeries that amputate healthy body parts. And in most cases, they are not necessary: Studies show that 80 to 95 percent of children come to accept their biological sex as their hormones change during puberty.
Of course, no medical treatment can actually transform anyone into the opposite sex. Doctors tell us that “every cell has a sex,” and no treatment can change every cell in the human body.
Yet parents who raise questions about the science are denounced as “toxic.” Parents report that they cannot speak out without being attacked by friends, teachers, even their own children.
“Be prepared to be treated by your child as the enemy,” Linda said. “As parents, we face an excruciating choice: We’re told we have to affirm something we don’t think is true, to betray our own convictions—or lose our child.”
Contrary to transgender dogma, questioning an adolescent’s beliefs is not abuse. It is authentic caring. There’s a reason adolescents are not allowed to buy cigarettes or alcohol: they don’t have the capacity to realistically project future consequences. An adolescent’s prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that makes long-term judgments, is not fully developed. Teens need their parents to communicate the facts of science and guide them toward wise choices. That’s called parenting. Parents Are Kids’ Natural Protection
Transgender propaganda portrays gender-questioning people as a “vulnerable and marginalized” population who must be protected from bullying. But the climate has shifted so dramatically that, in reality, their interests now trump everyone else’s. A child who identifies as transgender is praised and celebrated in schools, in the media, and online. A study by Lisa Littman at Brown University found that 61 percent of young adults “experienced an increased popularity within their friend group when they announced a transgender-identification.”
For a socially awkward child, that acclaim can be a powerful lure. Barbara’s adolescent daughter was suicidal, had an eating disorder, started self-harming, and isolated herself for hours in her room. She had so much difficulty making friends that she switched schools three times in three years and watched YouTube videos on “How to Be Popular.”
It was by “coming out” as a boy that she finally became popular. Among young people, Barbara says, “Being gay or trans is treated as edgy and creative. You are celebrated, you get a parade.”
Anyone who does not join the parade is “mocked,” or “ridiculed and maligned,” the Brown University study found. Or, as Barbara told me, “It’s the concerned parents who are bullied.” They are pressured to accept without question their children’s self-declared identity— “to follow their lead and let them figure out who they are.”
Yet in no other area of life are parents expected to simply accede to a child’s version of reality. There is no other medical condition that a child can self-diagnose, that has no objective test, and where parents are pushed to blindly allow life-altering medications. Why Would Someone Keep Parents in the Dark?
Many parents report that their children first decided they were transgender after learning about it at school. Worse, they often found out only after the fact. One parent said , “Although the school knew our daughter was struggling with serious mental health issues, they changed her name and pronouns without our knowledge.”
Some schools even forbid teachers to tell parents which gender identity their children claim in the classroom. Another parent said , “Behind our backs the faculty and staff referred to her by her new name … The school guidance counselor was advising our daughter about half-way houses” because her parents did not agree she was a boy.
The American Journal of Bioethics published an article calling on government to legally mandate that young children “have a right to puberty-blockers” through public schools and state-funded health clinics “ even if the parents disapprove.” The message to parents is that they are little more than breeders who are required to hand their children over to schools for sexual and moral indoctrination. Therapists Refuse to Give Evidence-Based Treatment
In therapy, it is standard protocol to ask questions about possible contributors to a client’s condition. But this high-quality level of care is recast as harmful and abusive if applied to someone who thinks he or she might be transgender.
Studies show that most people with gender distress suffer additional mental health issues, such as autism, anxiety, depression, ADHD, and depression. The Brown study found that 63 percent had been diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder prior to the onset of their gender dysphoria.
Yet many therapists fast-track young people into transitioning without asking the requisite questions about their medical or mental health history. Susan’s daughter was 20 years old when she announced, “There’s something I have been wanting to tell you. I am a boy.” She visited a gender therapist who spent all of 45 minutes with her, then directed her to a clinic to get testosterone.
Susan said, “The appointment with the therapist amounted to, ‘Congratulations, you’re a boy. Here’s what you should do next.’”
In states and cities that have passed conversion therapy bans, it is actually illegal to help a child explore underlying issues related to sexual orientation or gender identity. And it will become illegal across all the states if Congress passes the misnamed Equality Act. It will be impossible for parents to find therapists who use evidence-based methods to help their children achieve a sense of psycho-physical alignment.
By adding a SOGI clause to our nation’s civil rights laws, which ban discrimination on the basis of race, the Equality Act will treat people as equivalent to racists if they dissent from the state-sanctioned sexual ideology. Parents who just want to help their children learn to live in harmony with their bodies deserve better than to be demonized as racists. Protect parents, protect children. Oppose the Equality Act.

Supreme Court Needs To Make States Stop Ignoring The 2nd Amendment - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/31/time-supreme-court-make-states-stop-ignoring-second-amendment/,"By Cody Wisniewski May 31, 2019
The most important Second Amendment case in a decade may soon be argued before the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a chorus of Democratic presidential candidates has recently called for stricter gun control. With so much at stake in N.Y. Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York , at least one question remains to be answered: Will the Supreme Court actually decide this case?
New York City has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. Current law, for instance, prohibits licensed handgun owners from transporting their handguns outside city limits. (Yes, New York City really does prohibit this.) Handgun owners are considered criminals if they merely bring a handgun to a shooting range in the next town for a round of target practice.
By subjecting NYC’s excessive regulations to constitutional scrutiny, the N.Y. Rifle case makes a good test of how far gun control advocates can go without running afoul of the lower courts. While NYC officials were comfortable with their regulation withstanding lower court scrutiny, early signs indicate they are well aware that they have gone beyond their constitutional limits—a fact the Supreme Court is not likely to miss. NYC officials already asked the Supreme Court to delay the case and are attempting to amend the law in question.
While the Supreme Court denied the request to put the case on hold, that does not mean the Supreme Court has to actually decide the case. If NYC officials successfully amend the challenged regulation, the Supreme Court could decide that there is no longer a current regulation to overturn, and therefore no need to decide the case.
But the Supreme Court must take this opportunity to weigh in on the greater constitutional issues at stake. With N.Y. Rifle & Pistol Association’s brief being filed on May 7 and amicus curiae briefs being filed on May 14, one thing is apparent: New York City is far from the only government with unconstitutional gun control laws on the books.
Petitioners and amici alike, while making a number of different arguments, reveal a consistent and concerning pattern: nearly every court in the nation has ignored Heller and McDonald . In Heller , the Supreme Court overturned D.C.’s unconstitutional handgun ban, and in McDonald , the court found Chicago’s nearly identical ban to be equally unconstitutional.
Importantly, both Heller and McDonald marked a clear transition in the Supreme Court’s approach to the Second Amendment, from a stringently limited right towards an originalist treatment that reflects the historical importance of the right.
In both of those cases, the Supreme Court recognized that the Second Amendment did not create some new right, but protected from infringement by the government a natural right that exists independent of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. In so doing, the Supreme Court looked to our nation’s history and founding, taking a deep dive into founding-era documents to examine how the Founders and Framers understood and treated the right to keep and bear arms. The court clearly laid out the method—known as the text, history, and tradition test—for lower courts to apply in all Second Amendment cases.
New Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh recognized this in his well-known dissent in Heller II (a later case reviewing D.C.’s semi-automatic rifle ban). Because of the D.C. Circuit’s treatment of the Second Amendment, then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy dissent analyzing the Supreme Court’s opinions and explaining the analysis the court should have undertaken in applying the Supreme Court’s test. The majority, however, did not follow this approach.
The D.C. Circuit is not alone. Courts across the nation have blatantly ignored the Supreme Court’s direction. Nearly every circuit across the United States has subjected the right to keep and bear arms to an “interest-balancing” approach—weighing our natural right to keep and bear arms against the government’s interest. The Supreme Court specifically rejected such an approach. The rights at issue are simply too important.
The late Justice Antonin Scalia wrote: “We know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a freestanding “interest-balancing” approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government—even the Third Branch of Government—the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon.”
This is why the Supreme Court needs to seize the opportunity before it. The lower courts have proven that they are not willing to protect our right to keep and bear arms, just like they did pre- Heller . When Heller was handed down in 2008, it effectively overruled nine different circuits.
The Supreme Court has the chance to reinforce its 11-year-old message to the lower courts: the Second Amendment is not to be weighed against governmental interests. The people have a natural right to keep and bear arms. Courts must consider that right as important as our Founders and Framers did. Until that happens, governments across our republic will continue to ignore our rights, and the lower courts will not stop them. Cody J.

William Barr Unloads On Collusion Conspiracy Theory As 'Bogus',thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/31/barr-unloads-collusion-conspiracy-theory-whole-idea-trump-cahoots-russians-bogus/,"May 31, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
In an hour-long interview with CBS News’ Jan Crawford released on Friday, Attorney General William Barr reflected on the Russia investigation, the Robert Mueller report, the personal attacks against him, and his career at the Department of Justice.
Barr laid into the abuses of power happening among top officials at the FBI, the lack of evidence found by Mueller’s investigation, and the media hypocrisy exposed by coverage of stories like the “appalling” texts between FBI agent lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
“Mueller has spent two and half years and the fact is there is no evidence of a conspiracy,” Barr said. “So it was bogus, this whole idea that the Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus.”
Barr has been critiqued for seeking to declassify documents concerning the Russia investigation. He argued that reviewing standards and procedures at the highest levels are an “important way of making sure that government power is being conscientiously and properly applied.”
When Crawford asked if he was concerned with bias among FBI investigators, Barr said the Strzok-Page texts were “very damning” and argued that there would be an outrage if the same stunts had been pulled against the Obama campaign.
“If those kinds of discussions were held, you know, when Obama first ran for office, people talking about Obama in those tones and suggesting that ‘Oh that he might be a Manchurian candidate for Islam or something like that.’ You know some wild accusations like that, and you had that kind of discussion back and forth, you don’t think we would be hearing a lot more about it?” he asked.
When Crawford asked Barr about attacks on his reputation, the attorney general gave a stoic response.
“I am at the end of my career,” Barr said. “Everyone dies and I am not, you know, I don’t believe in the Homeric idea that you know, immortality comes by, you know, having odes sung about you over the centuries, you know?”
Barr said he does not regret taking the job, but that he knew it would “only be a matter of time” before he would be attacked for “behaving responsibly and calling them as I see them.” He said, “nowadays, people don’t care about the merits and the substance.”
Barr argued for the importance of institutions like the DOJ and the FBI, but said he does not think President Trump is the one responsible for their demise.
“I think one of the ironies today is that people are saying that it’s President Trump that’s shredding our institutions. I really see no evidence of that,” he said. “The idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him and you know, really changing the norms on the grounds that ‘We have to stop this president,’ that is where the shredding of our norms and our institutions is occurring.” Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour.

Charlamagne tha God Tears Into Warren: 'Like The Original Rachel Dolezal',thefederalist.com,Liz Wolfe,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/31/charlamagne-tha-god-tears-elizabeth-warren-youre-kinda-like-original-rachel-dolezal/,"May 31, 2019 By Liz Wolfe
Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) probably expected her appearance on “The Breakfast Club,” Charlamagne tha God’s radio show, to be an easy, quick way to pander to mostly black audiences. Instead, the hosts pulled no punches, essentially doing the job the mainstream media should be doing, but isn’t. Watch @cthagod grill @ewarren on her heritage. ""When did you find out that you weren't [Native American]?""""Were there any benefits to that?""""You sound like the original Rachel Dolezal a little bit"" @breakfastclubam pic.twitter.com/GFzH8JqSqN

“I learned about my family the same way most people learned about their family … and [being Native American] it’s what I believed. But I’m not a person of color, I’m not a citizen of a tribe, and I shouldn’t have done it,” she said, referring to her weird decision back in October 2018 to release DNA results proving she had Native American ancestry six to 10 generations ago.
“What I can do is try to be a good partner.” A new word for ally! “What I want to see us do in education is get rid of the student loan debt and make an investment in the historically black colleges and universities. I want to see us in housing, hit redlining head on.”
“I see you talk about reparations as well,” a host chimed in, throwing Pandering Warren a bone. “So wait, your family told you you were Native American? Charlamagne tells me I’m Dominican, but I don’t believe him,” interjected another host.
“Yeah, you are,” added Charlamagne, who grilled Warren further. “How long did you hold on to that? Because there was some report that said you were Native American on your Texas bar license, and then said you were Native American on some documents when you were a professor at Harvard, so why you’d do that?”
“So it’s what I believed, you know, that’s, like I said, it’s what I learned from my family.”
“When did you find out that you weren’t?” Charlamagne pressed. “Well … I’m not a person of color, I’m not a citizen of a tribe, and tribal citizenship is an important distinction and not something I am,” said Warren.
“Were there any benefits to that?”
“No! Boston Globe did a full investigation, it never affected nothin’ about my family, never affected any job I ever got.” Warren channels a bit of predecessor Hillary, here, making her word choice just a bit folksy despite being an insanely well-educated person who’s been living in Massachusetts for many years.
“You’re kinda like the original Rachel Dolezal a little bit—a white woman pretending to be black,” Charlamagne shot back.
“Well, this is what I learned from my family,” Warren countered, softly.
Warren’s claims are absurd and disingenuous. Warren’s DNA test (which has been widely scrutinized, given that tribal membership is the relevant detail here, not DNA) turned back results saying she was somewhere in the range of 1/64th to 1/1024th Native American. She did, in fact, use her mostly phony Native American identity to get ahead. Her State Bar of Texas registration card from 1986 shows she listed her race as “American Indian.”
She has since apologized for her various indiscretions, but one can’t help but think her apology was insincere if she’s now claiming her truth-twisting never affected her professionally. Wouldn’t it be hard for her to know that for sure?
As Washington Post reported, back in February: “The Texas bar registration card is significant, among other reasons, because it removes any doubt that Warren directly claimed the identity. In other instances Warren has declined to say whether she or an assistant filled out forms.”
Now, perhaps it’s silly to fixate on Warren’s dishonesty and sliminess when this is one of the great uniting qualities of pretty much all politicians for all time. Still, we can’t help but be grateful to Charlamagne for coining the best new phrase of this election cycle—”the original Rachel Dolezal.” Liz Wolfe is managing editor at The Federalist, based in Austin, Texas.

A Philly Nightlife Legend Has Died. Here’s What He Meant To Us,thefederalist.com,Libemmons,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/02/a-philly-nightlife-legend-has-died-heres-what-he-meant-to-us/,"By Libby Emmons and David Marcus June 2, 2019
This week, legendary club owner and impresario David Carroll died at 81 years old. He opened his first Philly club, Artemis, in 1970. In the early 1980s he opened the Starlite Ballroom, and introduced Philly to New Wave and hardcore punk music, booking acts like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Black Flag, and the Dead Kennedys. For another 30 years, he was the notable genius of Philly nightlife. But for us he was something else: a mentor, a friend, and a guiding voice when we most needed one.
It was 1999 and we were doing our first show. We’d had the idea for a theater company for years, and we had the name way before we had any idea what we were gonna do with it. Blue Box — like the Tardis, like the color of our VHS-integrated TV when the tape finished, blue like International Klein Blue, like the Blues, like Blue Trane, like the color of our tears, and we had so many back then. We made our first show at Second Stage at The Adrienne Theater on Sansom Street. It was tumultuous, it was glorious, it was as dreadful as it was beautiful. We taped it; we never watched it. Then converted it to DVD, still unwatched.
But Carroll watched it. We showed up at his bar, Bar Noir, on 18th Street around the corner from the theater, near every day after rehearsal, then after every show. The first time we walked in, down two exterior flights into the dark basement bar, we felt transported. It was like walking into a bar in the East Village, where we’d wanted to move to after college but couldn’t, because we were priced out. We were smitten with Bar Noir, and if we may, Carroll was smitten with us.
He was a classic impresario club owner, knower of talent and scene. He spotted us that first night, and we told him how much we loved his space. We told him how it felt like there was a back door that exited onto Avenue B, that the bar had the feel of a portal into New York City. We told him about our show, and he came, brought friends, and said he loved it. When the show closed, we wanted to do more, but we’d blown all our cash on the show and had not even remotely recouped. City Paper, Philly’s weekly, called us Too Little Too Soon, because even back then, and as ever, we were ambitious beyond our skills.
Carroll offered us Bar Noir. Again, the name came first. We wanted a party name, a name like the art shows we went to, so we called it Sticky, because all good things are sticky. Carroll liked the idea of theater — specifically, 10-minute plays in his bar. Sticky was a bar play series, where the action was performed environmentally. The bar was also the set.
We were nervous. What if nobody came, how would we make it work? We had a friend who was a sound designer and could mic the actors, but the twist was that Carroll didn’t want us to charge a cover. He just wanted it to happen in front of the patrons, who might or might not listen. That’s a scary way to do theater, but he knew it would work somehow, because he always knew what would work.
That first Sticky was terrifying until the lights went up, and the actors’ voices came through the sound system. He was right: we grabbed them. After the first play, we were scrambling to get the mics switched when he came up to us smiling. “Relax,” he said, he gestured around the room. “Let it sink in, there’s no rush.” From then on the half-dozen mini intermissions in which to mix and mingle were a part of the show, almost as important as the plays.
Every space he created worked, and Bar Noir was no exception. Quite quickly it went from a chill spot to one of the hottest bars in town, often filled with celebs and sports figures, and Sticky got more popular, too. We usually had no money, of course, and he knew that, so he let us drink and eat on credit. Once the lines started going down the block on Friday nights, we’d scamper past them, past the velvet rope, and always there was Carroll with his wink and smile. The man was magic.
DJ Bobby Startup was there from the beginning. He’d been working with Carroll since 1970. When we first saw Bobby spinning the tables at the back of the room, we were floored. Bobby had spun at Revival, an all-ages club that was a weekly haunt in high school. He’d played Morrissey, The Cure, New Order, Electronic, Siouxsie, Ministry, 808 State, Prodigy, Cocteau Twins, all the hits for weirdo kids who danced instead of played sports (Libby, not Dave), who felt alienated by top 40 and lived for the alt charts. At Bar Noir, he played Brittney Spears, and we chided him for it, then blew lines of cocaine off the black marble of the washroom counter tops, danced on table tops, and shook it to “Oops I Did It Again,” then again.
As the Stickies progressed and increased in heat, we brought in an MC, local performer Jeffrey Marsh. He was a trained cabaret singer, a chanteuse in a suit vest, skirt, and heels who had by far the best legs of any of us, the best legs in the entire city. He sang whatever he wanted, and we were beyond grateful for his grace, spontaneity, and exquisite presentation.
One night, in a stroke of absolute genius, Marsh sang “Downtown,” and it felt like we were a light, a beacon shining in the futile darkness of everything, making space for all our voices, our love, and our need to create and express. It was magic, it was a night sprinkled with pixie dust, and Carroll had made it happen. He knew Marsh was a marvel, destined for greatness, and so did we. Marsh performed with us for years when we made the jump to New York, and went on to become a social media star, LGBT activist, and author.
One afternoon after work, we were walking home to our shabby little studio apartment and found two members of our theater company sitting on our front stoop. Moments later, we knew that one of the founding members, Eric Buckwalter, had taken his own life. Not knowing what else to do, the four us went to Bar Noir. Other members were already there. Carroll had cordoned off a section for us. More of us arrived. Nobody had cell phones, they just knew where to come. He held us kids in his space, soothed us, let us know our pain was real.
A few nights later there was an open-mic poetry jam with the band Clutch Cargo, regular performers at Bar Noir. We often came out to hear them play, and Dave had performed poetry with them. This night he performed a poem for Eric, who he told the crowd had recently passed. It was angry. Dave threw his sunglasses on the floor. We were theatre kids, after all.
A few minutes later, a British guy asked if he could perform. He dedicated his poem to the punk star Ian Drury, who had also recently died. Afterwards we hung out and he asked if we wanted to party at his hotel. We politely declined. We were grieving, and not up for strangers.
The next night we went back — we went back nearly every night. Carroll said, “So that was something, huh?” We looked confused. He said “You have no idea who that was, do you?” We shrugged, and he told us it was Liam Gallagher from Oasis. Dave said, “You could have told us.” Carroll laughed and said, “It’s better this way. I heard him on the radio this morning, he talked about it, he said ‘I liked this guy what threw his sunglasses.”
Carroll was right, of course. It was better. He knew it would have changed how we looked at Gallagher and ourselves. He wanted us to think of ourselves as equals. He used to say, “If you ever see a reserved sign at a table, anywhere, just sit down. It’s for you.” As we moved to New York City two years later and ran Sticky there for 13 years, we carried Carroll’s wisdom and advice with us. There would never have been a Sticky without him.
Our story is just one among hundreds, likely thousands, of the artists and troublemakers Carroll championed and helped. He made everyone feel like a star. He made magical spaces filled with life, joy, and a pulsing coolness. He made the world more fun, the night more alive. So rest in peace, friend. Somewhere up in heaven we know a new space just opened up, and it’s amazing. Libby Emmons is a writer and theater maker in New York City. Follow her @li88yinc.

HBO’s ‘Chernobyl’ Gives Voice To Ordinary Soviets’ Horror Of Socialism,thefederalist.com,Katya Sedgwick,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/03/hbos-chernobyl-gives-voice-ordinary-soviets-horror-socialism/,"By Katya Sedgwick June 3, 2019
The nuclear glow of the colorless sky in Belorussian Palissia is the most genuinely disturbing cinematography on TV right now. HBO’s “Chernobyl” mini-series is so vividly drab, I almost smell cement particles in my living room.
The Soviet small town consists entirely of concrete towers, and the government buildings sport naked grey walls decorated only with the obligatory likenesses of Lenin. The characters mention cement quite a bit, and the explosion site was eventually covered by the material to prevent further leakage of radioactive matter.
“Cement” happens to be the title of the foundational novel of socialist realism written by Fyodor Gladkov. I’m sure the creators of the miniseries are aware: they seem to have done an admirable job of going native. Homages to Native Andrei Tarkovsky
The film has the appearance of a Soviet “postcard” — or a Tarkovsky movie. When still in the USSR, the dissident director Andrei Tarkovsky had to work with inferior-quality domestic film. In his 1979 science fiction classic “Stalker” he turned technical limitations into creative advantage, using poisonous greens to conjure a haunting atmosphere.
Since “Stalker” is set in a supernatural military-guarded Zona in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion, when the Exclusion Zone was created around the reactor, Russians began talking about Tarkovsky’s film as a prophetic foretelling of the nuclear catastrophe. It is still a thing: contemporary tour guides of the Zone are called Stalkers.
Some of the reviewers objected to how the HBO series creator Craig Mazin has dramatized the events, pointing that, for instance, only two plant employees perished inside the compound immediately following the explosion, while the film shows a half a dozen meeting untimely torturous deaths. These critics are forgetting that they are watching a work of fiction, so being fake but accurate is entirely permissible. So far, the miniseries has been pretty darn accurate.
The scenes of plant workers walking, Stalker-like, into the core of the reactor are a quite literal homage to Tarkovsky. Beyond the imitation of the faulty second-world film technology, the slow, charged action is eerily reminiscent of the master’s.
Scene after scene, director Johan Renck creates the atmosphere of psychological horror: birds and helicopters falling out of the sky, invisible particles traveling through the European continent, poisoning the soil between the two Eastern Slavic capitols of Kiev and Minsk — and beyond. The Socialist Aspects Heighten the Horror
Make no mistake: the horror the viewer witnesses onscreen is the horror of socialism. Of the good socialism , mind you. Not of the Stalinist era, but of the final decades of the Soviet Union when, although the gulag had significantly shrunk in size, the country remained a suffocating mess of official lies, incompetence, and fear. By the time reactor number four has exploded on the shores of Pripyat, the new Secretary General Mikhail Gorbachev has already labeled that period zastoi , or stagnation.
None of the artistic devices Mazin and Renck employ would successfully create the atmosphere of terror were not the omnipresent KGB, and the obdurate secrecy and the never-ending power trip of the nomenklatura, so lucidly written into the script. It doesn’t matter that fewer people perished at the plant on the night of the explosion, what matters is that indifferent provincial microtyrants, in what in the United States is called “CYA mode,” again and again sent their inferiors to sure death, and the security apparatus couldn’t care less. They were more concerned with saving face.
The incompetence and deadly insistence on secrecy of those in power is contrasted with the heroism of the ordinary men the regime cannibalizes to perpetuate itself, and the precarious position of intelligentsia.
To be sure, Chernobyl’s heroes didn’t sacrifice themselves to prop up Gorbachev personally, but out of a sense of duty coupled with a soldier-like mentality. Russia (and Ukraine, and Belarus) are very much the kind of countries run on a sense of duty, and, as in the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, promises of future paychecks. Yet the regime would have immediately collapsed if not for the stoic fortitude of the everyday people. Science Is Merely a Tool of Power
The voices of intelligentsia shape the moral landscape of the series: the second episode, for instance, opens with radio broadcast of Konstantin Simonov’s Socialist Realist poem about the retreating Red Army soldiers in the first months of the Great Patriotic War, as World War Two is known there. Equating the heroism of the liquidators of Chernobyl with that of the sacrifice of their fathers and grandfathers is a terrible honor considering that the official number of the 22 million dead had established the gold standard for self-sacrifice in Russia.
The series protagonist Valery Legasov (played by Jared Harris) is the nuclear scientist summoned by Kremlin to mop up the disaster in secrecy. The first episode begins with his suicide, giving the viewer a hint that his collaboration with the regime will prove fatal. The regime has little regard for his humanity, and limited use for his expertise.
As the composite character Ulana Khomyuk (Emily Watson), also a nuclear engineer, is brazenly assured by a top Belorussian Communist Party boss, her learned opinion on the dangers of nuclear radiation is irrelevant because he, as a representative of the proletariat, knows better. His bloated qualification? A prior stint as a shoe factory director. He’s hardly a representative of proletariat, though: a position of this sort would enable him to take bribes, and make deals with the mafia.
In the West today the character of a female nuclear engineer may read like a feminist trope, but in the land of developed socialism it would merit merely a shrug. Sure, many women had engineering degrees, but engineers weren’t the ones bringing home the bacon. A position like Khomyuk’s could earn her intelligentsia bragging points, but little else.
Warehouse directors got all the respect, and apparatchiks called the shots. After decades of watching General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev struggle to put words together on national television, we knew we were ruled by somewhat sober ignoramuses.
No use banging heads against the wall trying to convince nomenklatura of anything. They had to be shamed into evacuating Pripyat. Ordinary people were helpless before the state. Like the deadly nuclear particles, its unseen forces shaped our existence. Authentic Voices of the Soviet People’s Experience
Some might protest that surely the Chernobyl disaster alone cannot be seriously taken as a critique Soviet Union or socialism in general. I have to disagree: the world’s largest nuclear accident is far more representative of the USSR than Cosa Nostra is of the United States, yet “The Godfather” is generally regarded as an exegesis of American capitalism. The heavy-handed cover-up attempts laid bare the lies of socialism as the secretary general attempted to champion openness.
The latter is a stretch, and if anything the top-down criminal mafia structure is more appropriately applied to socialism and its post-Soviet mutations. “Chernobyl,” on the other hand, effectively uses cultural appropriation to recreate the ghastly atmosphere following the nuclear accident and highlight the problems inherent in socialism.
Mazin and Renck don’t appear to be interested in twisting the story to score cheap domestic political points. I hear through their work authentic voices of the Soviet people, and their voices alone. I enjoy their humor, I know their mentality.
The horror onscreen is just a single dramatized moment of the everyday Soviet experience, the logical outcome of central planning, secrecy, and devaluation of individual life. That’s exactly how it was. I’ve never seen a better film about that period of history.
The series has received glowing reviews in Russia, getting high marks for authenticity. Sometimes it takes a foreigner to make superbly authentic art.
As far as Soviet environmental disasters go, Chernobyl was hardly the worst, but because others were hidden deep within the country’s interior, they weren’t detected by the Swedes within hours. Moreover, the nuclear accident occurred at the time the power of the state had already been weakened by Gorbachev’s nascent reforms, and the heavy-handed cover-up attempts laid bare the lies of socialism as the secretary general attempted to champion openness. (Incidentally, one of these lies, the official figure of the 28 dead, still stands.)
Gorbachev himself has credited the nuclear incident as the final nail in the USSR’s coffin. What has started as “Cement” ended in the cement sarcophagus that now covers the site of the reactor. Well, sort of: the site is still smoldering. Katya Rapoport Sedgwick is a writer from San Francisco Bay Area. She has published at The Daily Caller and Legal Insurrection."
Top 28 Moments From Bombshell Barr Interview On CBS,thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/03/top-28-moments-from-bombshell-barr-interview/,"By Mollie Hemingway June 3, 2019
Attorney General William Barr’s nearly hour-long interview with CBS News’ Jan Crawford last week was full of fascinating details about the special counsel probe, the debunked Russia collusion theory that roiled Washington for years, and Barr’s investigation into how the FBI and Department of Justice used the “bogus” theory to investigate the Trump campaign.
The interview was downplayed by the media, which is implicated in perpetuating the Russia hoax Barr is investigating, and which came in for criticism from Barr for its failure to care about violations of civil liberties. Here are the top 28 take-aways from the interview. 1. Mueller ‘Could Have Reached a Conclusion’
Crawford, whose questions revealed a command of the facts not demonstrated by many of her mainstream media peers, asked Barr about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s decision to outline 11 instances where President Trump’s frustration at falsely being accused of treason could amount to “possible obstruction” followed by a refusal to decide whether they did.
Barr explained that the Office of Legal Counsel opinion that prevents presidents from being indicted was no barrier to making a conclusion about obstruction. “Right, he could have reached a conclusion,” Barr said, noting that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that Trump had not obstructed justice.
“[W]hen he didn’t make a decision, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt it was necessary for us as the heads of the Department to reach that decision,” Barr said. “That is what the Department of Justice does, that is why we have the compulsory powers like a grand jury to force people to give us evidence so that we can determine whether a crime has committed and in order to legitimate the process we felt we had to reach a decision.” 2. DOJ Not an ‘Adjunct to Congress’
Mueller received praise from the media for, they said, subtly asking Congress to impeach the president for, apparently, his frustration with falsely being accused of being a traitor. Barr was less enamored of this idea.
“Well, I am not sure what he was suggesting but, you know, the Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crimes as an adjunct to Congress. Congress is a separate branch of government and they can, you know, they have processes, we have our processes. Ours are related to the criminal justice process. We are not an extension of Congress’s investigative powers,” he said. 3. Mueller’s Guilty Until Proven Innocent Standard ‘Not The Standard We Use’ At DOJ
Mueller’s refusal to determine whether President Trump had obstructed justice by making hiring and firing decisions or complaining about false accusations he had conspired with Russia to steal the 2016 election was one problem. The other was that Mueller flipped the standard prosecutorial approach on its head, Barr said.
“[H]e also said that he could not say that the president clearly did not violate the law, which of course is not the standard we use at the department. We have to determine whether there is clear violation of the law, and so we applied the standards we would normally apply. We analyzed the law and the facts and a group of us spent a lot of time doing that and determined that both as a matter of law, many of the instances would not amount to obstruction,” Barr said. 4. Mueller’s Obstruction Theories ‘Did Not Reflect The Views’ of DOJ
Barr said the legal analysis in the special counsel’s obstruction report “did not reflect the views of the department” and were the “views of a particular lawyer or lawyers.” He went on to explain that firing James Comey, for example, is a “facially valid exercise of core presidential authority.”
Even if you don’t accept that presidents have the right to fire incompetent employees, to show obstruction the firing would have to have the probable effect of sabotaging a proceeding and be done with corrupt intent.
“[T]he report itself points out that one of the likely motivations here was the president’s frustration with Comey saying something publicly and saying a different thing privately and refusing to correct the record. So that would not have been a corrupt intent. So for each of these episodes we thought long and hard about it, we looked at the facts and we didn’t feel the government could establish obstruction in these cases,” Barr explained. 5. Barr Doesn’t Care about ‘Hyper-Partisan’ Complaints
Asked about the criticism he’s received from the media and other partisans, Barr said, “Well, we live in a hyper-partisan age where people no longer really pay attention to the substance of what’s said but as to who says it and what side they’re on and what it’s political ramifications are. The Department of Justice is all about the law, and the facts and the substance, and I’m going to make the decisions based on the law and the facts. And I realize that’s in tension with the political climate we live in because people are more interested in getting their way politically. so I think it just goes with the territory of being the attorney general in a hyper-partisan period of time.” 6. Barr ‘Surprised’ by Mueller Not Providing Report Ready to Release
Barr explained that he wrote a four-page summary of Mueller’s 400-page report because Mueller failed to provide a report that was ready to release to the American public. In conversations in the weeks leading up to Mueller’s report delivery, Barr repeatedly requested that the grand jury information be highlighted so it could be quickly redacted by Justice Department officials.
Instead, the report included no highlighting of which portions were from grand jury information, which must be redacted by law. That meant it would be weeks before the report would be made public, at a time when former intelligence officials were making false claims about the Mueller report.
Barr said he wrote the four-page summary:
because I didn’t think the body politic would allow us to go on radio silence for four weeks. I mean, people were camped outside my house and the department and every — there was all kinds of wild speculation going on. Former senior intelligence officials who were purporting to have it, or intimating that they had inside information were suggesting that the president and his family were going to be indicted and so forth. Saying that publicly. There was all kind of wild and — Yes, and it was wild and irresponsible speculation going on which the very — Right, and talking heads and things like that, and these things affect the United States’ ability to function in the world.
We have an economy. It could affect the economy. It can affect, it can affect our foreign relations during very delicate period of time with, you know, serious adversaries in the world. So I felt that in order to buy time, in order to get the report out, I had to state the bottom line just like you’re announcing a verdict in a case. My purpose there was not to summarize every jot and tittle of the report and every, you know, angle that, that Mueller looked into. But, just state the bottom line, which I did in the four-page memo. 7. Mueller Letter Complaining About Lack of Impeachment Narrative Was ‘A Little Snitty and Staff-Driven’
Someone within the special counsel’s office leaked to The New York Times a letter complaining that Barr’s four-page summary set the media narrative differently than they would have preferred. Barr said he was surprised Mueller “didn’t pick up the phone and call me given our 30-year relationship” and that he felt “the letter was a little snitty and staff-driven.” He reiterated his preference to have the full report released so that everyone could determine “what Bob’s reasoning was.” 8. No ‘Discrepancy’ on OLC Opinion
In a press conference, and in his report, Mueller claimed to believe that an Office of Legal Counsel opinion about presidents not being able to be indicted meant that he couldn’t even analyze whether Trump’s frustration at years of false allegations that he was a traitor constituted obstruction.
Previously, Barr said Mueller had assured him that the OLC opinion had not been the reason he hadn’t determined Trump obstructed justice. The two put out a joint statement saying that there was no discrepancy between what they were saying. Barr explained that Mueller did not even analyze whether there was a crime. 9. Response to Russia Threats Troubling
If intelligence officials were “alarmed” by the Russia threats as early as April 2016, as they claimed, “Surely the response should have been more than just, you know, dangling a confidential informant in front of a peripheral player in the Trump campaign.” 10. FBI’s Wray ‘Very Supportive’ of Investigation Into Russia Probe
Barr said he and FBI Director Christopher Wray have “discussed how important it is that that not be allowed to happen and we are both very cognizant of that … he is being very supportive and we’re working together on, you know, trying to reconstruct what happened. People have to understand, you know, one of the things here is that these efforts in 2016, these counter-intelligence activities that were directed at the Trump campaign, were not done in the normal course and not through the normal procedures as a far as I can tell. And a lot of the people who were involved are no longer there.” 11. Spying Is Spying
Crawford noted that Barr has received criticism for referring to the widespread surveillance of the Trump campaign as “spying.” Barr responded, “Yeah, I mean, I guess it’s become a dirty word somehow. It hasn’t ever been for me. I think there is nothing wrong with spying, the question is always whether it is authorized by law and properly predicated and if it is, then it’s an important tool the United States has to protect the country.” 12. Words Don’t Need to Be Retired Because Trump Uses Them
“[S]ome former intelligence chiefs have said that the president has made that word somewhat pejorative, that there is spying, this is a witch hunt, this is a hoax, and so your use of that word makes it seem that you are being a loyalist,” Crawford said. Barr responded, “You know, it’s part of the craziness of the modern day that if a president uses a word, then all of a sudden it becomes off bounds. It’s a perfectly good English word, I will continue to use it.” 13. Law Enforcement and Intelligence Should Not Meddle In Elections
“And look, I think if we — we are worried about foreign influence in the campaign? We should be because the heart of our system is the peaceful transfer of power through elections and what gives the government legitimacy is that process. And if foreign elements can come in and affect it, that’s bad for the republic,” Barr said.
“But by the same token, it’s just as, it’s just as dangerous to the continuation of self-government and our republican system, republic that we not allow government power, law enforcement or intelligence power, to play a role in politics, to intrude into politics, and affect elections,” Barr said. Asked which interference is more troubling, Barr said they both are. 14. Government Officials Should Not Become a ‘Praetorian Guard’
When discussing actions taken against the Trump campaign, Barr referenced the Roman Army’s elite unit that interfered in politics, even overthrowing emperors.
“[R]epublics have fallen because of Praetorian Guard mentality, where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state. And you know, there is that tendency that they know better and that, you know, they’re there to protect as guardians of the people. That can easily translate into essentially supervening the will of the majority and getting your own way as a government official.” 15. Use of Spy Tools Against Political Campaigns a ‘Serious Red Line’
Asked if he was concerned that a Praetorian Guard mentality had set in in 2016, Barr said, “Well, I just think it has to be carefully looked at because the use of foreign intelligence capabilities and counterintelligence capabilities against an American political campaign to me is unprecedented and it’s a serious red line that’s been crossed.” 16. AG Must Protect Against Abuse of Government Power
“[O]ne of the key responsibilities of the attorney general, core responsibilities of the attorney general is to make sure that government power is not abused and that the right of Americans are not transgressed by abusive government power,” Barr said. “That’s the responsibility of the attorney general.” 17. Looking Into Process for Counterintelligence Activities Against Trump Campaign
In a sea of media complacency about the use of counterintelligence activities against the Trump campaign, Barr seeks answers.
I think it’s important to understand what basis there was for launching counterintelligence activities against a political campaign, which is the core of our … First Amendment liberties in this country. And what was the predicate for it? What was the hurdle that had to be crossed? What was the process- who had to approve it? And including the electronic surveillance, whatever electronic surveillance was done. And was everyone operating in their proper lane? … And we’re working closely with the intelligence agencies, the bureau and the agency and others to help us reconstruct what happened. And I want to see, what were the standards that were applied. What was the evidence? What were the techniques used? Who approved them? Was there a legitimate basis for it? 18. Details on Other Investigations
Barr explained that the inspector general is only looking “at a discrete area that is — that is you know, important, which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at Carter Page.” Page endured a year of heavy surveillance from the federal government, which told a secret court that he was an agent of Russia. The year of surveillance found no crimes committed by Page, who is now suing to restore his reputation.
Barr explained that he didn’t have the inspector general expand his probe to cover the other areas because of his limited powers: “He doesn’t have the power to compel testimony, he doesn’t have the power really to investigate beyond the current cast of characters at the Department of Justice. His ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the department is very limited.”
Of John Huber, the U.S. attorney who was reportedly looking at FISA abuse, Barr said he “stood back and put that on hold while the Office of Inspector General was conducting its review,” only waiting for criminal referrals. However, Barr said he’s also working on issues that “relate to Hillary Clinton” and are concluding. 19. Media Supposed to Be ‘Watchdogs’ of ‘Our Civil Liberties’
Barr said that when he joined the Central Intelligence Agency 50 years ago during the Vietnam and Civil Rights era, there was a ton of concern about investigation of domestic political activities.
[W]hen was it appropriate for intelligence agencies, the FBI too was under investigation. You know, the penetration of civil rights groups because at the time there was concerns about contacts with, you know, communist funded front groups and things like that and you know how deeply could you get into civil rights groups or anti-Vietnam war groups. A lot of these groups were in contact with foreign adversaries, they had some contact with front organizations and so forth and there were a lot of rules put in place and those rules are under the attorney general. The attorney general’s responsibility is to make sure that these powers are not used to tread upon First Amendment activity and that certainly was a big part of my formative years of dealing with those issues. The fact that today people just seem to brush aside the idea that it is okay to you know, to engage in these activities against a political campaign is stunning to me especially when the media doesn’t seem to think that it’s worth looking into. They’re supposed to be the watchdogs of, you know, our civil liberties. 20. Answers on Trump Campaign Surveillance Not ‘Satisfactory’
Barr declined to weigh in on specifics, but said, “Like many other people who are familiar with intelligence activities, I had a lot of questions about what was going on. I assumed I’d get answers when I went in and I have not gotten answers that are well satisfactory, and in fact probably have more questions, and that some of the facts that, that I’ve learned don’t hang together with the official explanations of what happened.”
Pressed to explain further, Barr said, “That’s all I really will say. Things are just not jiving.” 21. Failures Not in Rank and File But ‘Upper Echelon’
Barr had previously said that the abnormal procedures taken against the Trump campaign didn’t take place among the rank and file of the bureau, but among the upper echelon. Asked to explain, he said, “Because I think the activities were undertaken by a small group at the top which is one of the, probably one of the mistakes that has been made instead of running this as a normal bureau investigation or counterintelligence investigation. It was done by the executives at the senior level. Out of headquarters.” 22. 2016 Meddling ‘Antithetical to the Democratic System’
Barr was generous about the wrongdoing perpetrated by government actors, saying no one may have intended to undermine the republic by surveilling political opponents.
I’m not suggesting that people did what they did necessarily because of conscious, nefarious motives. Sometimes people can convince themselves that what they’re doing is in the higher interest, the better good. They don’t realize that what they’re doing is really antithetical to the democratic system that we have. They start viewing themselves as the guardians of the people that are more informed and insensitive than everybody else. They can — in their own mind, they can have those kinds of motives. And sometimes they can look at evidence and facts through a biased prism that they themselves don’t realize.
Barr did not specifically cite fired FBI director Comey, whose 2018 defense of his tenure is titled “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.” Comey was strongly criticized in an inspector general report for failing to follow departmental procedures in his handling of the Hillary Clinton case regarding mishandling classified information.
Barr said of those who justify their actions, “That something objectively as applied as a neutral principle across the board really, you know, shouldn’t be the standard used in the case but because they have a particular bias they don’t see that. So that’s why procedures and standards are important and review afterward is an important way of making sure that government power is being conscientiously and properly applied. It doesn’t necessarily mean that there are people — you know, that people have crossed lines have done so with corrupt intent or anything like that.” 23. ‘Gross Bias’ of FBI Agents ‘Appalling,’ Would Be Roundly Condemned If about Obama
Barr said of the virulently anti-Trump texts that have been previously released:
Well it’s hard to read some of the texts with and not feel that there was gross bias at work and they’re appalling…. Those were appalling. And on their face they were very damning and I think if the shoe was on the other foot we could be hearing a lot about it. If those kinds of discussions were held you know when Obama first ran for office, people talking about Obama in those tones and suggesting that ‘Oh that he might be a Manchurian candidate for Islam or something like that.’ You know some wild accusations like that and you had that kind of discussion back and forth, you don’t think we would be hearing a lot more about it? 24. Russia Collusion Conspiracy Theory Was ‘Bogus’
Crawford said Comey may say the investigation into Trump had to be closely held because it was so extraordinary. Barr said, “Well it might be legit under certain circumstances but a lot of that has to do with how good the evidence was at that point. And you know Mueller has spent two and half years and the fact is there is no evidence of a conspiracy. So it was bogus, this whole idea that the Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus.” 25. Media In No Place to ‘Wring Hands’ about Barr’s Declassification Authority
Barr said that he asked President Trump for the authority to declassify documents dealing with the Russia investigation, as well as the direction that other agencies support his efforts to investigate the probe. He said the other agencies are being supportive.
Of media concerns about the transparency, Barr said,
I’m amused by these people who make a living by disclosing classified information, including the names of intelligence operatives, wringing their hands about whether I’m going to be responsible in protecting intelligence sources and methods. I’ve been in the business, as I’ve said, for over 50 years, long before they were born and I know how to handle classified information and I believe strongly in protecting intelligence sources and methods. But at the same time if there is information that can be shared with the American people without jeopardizing intelligence sources and methods that decision should be made and because I will be involved in finding out what the story was I think I’m in the best decision to make that decision.
He said the media reaction is strange. “Normally the media would be interested in letting the sunshine in and finding out what the truth is. And usually the media doesn’t care that much about protecting intelligence sources and methods. But I do and I will.” 26. Barr Expected Criticism for Upholding Rule of Law
Crawford noted Barr’s sterling reputation before he began his second round as attorney general. He previously served in the George H.W. Bush administration. He said he expected criticism from partisans.
I realize we live in a crazy hyper-partisan period of time and I knew that it would only be a matter of time if I was behaving responsibly and calling them as I see them, that I would be attacked because nowadays people don’t care about the merits and the substance. They only care about who it helps, who benefits, whether my side benefits or the other side benefits, everything is gauged by politics. And as I say, that’s antithetical to the way the department runs, and any attorney general in this period is going to end up losing a lot of political capital, and I realize that and that is one of the reasons that I ultimately was persuaded that I should take it on because I think at my stage in life it really doesn’t make any difference. 27. ‘Everyone Dies’
Asked if he worried about his reputation, Barr said, “Yeah, but everyone dies and I am not, you know, I don’t believe in the Homeric idea that you know, immortality comes by, you know, having odes sung about you over the centuries, you know?” He added that he didn’t regret taking the job. 28. Resistance Is ‘Shredding Our Institutions’
Barr said he’d rather be back to his old life, but that he loves the Justice Department and the FBI: “I think it’s important that we not, in this period of intense partisan feeling, destroy our institutions. I think one of the ironies today is that people are saying that it’s President Trump that’s shredding our institutions. I really see no evidence of that — it is hard, and I really haven’t seen bill of particulars as to how that’s being done. From my perspective, the idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him and, you know, really changing the norms on the grounds that we have to stop this president, that is where the shredding of our norms and our institutions is occurring.” Mollie Ziegler Hemingway is a senior editor at The Federalist.

In Defense Of Lobbying,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/03/in-defense-of-lobbying/,"By David Harsanyi June 3, 2019
The media adores stories that bolster prevailing narratives about the virtuousness of “bipartisanship” and the nefariousness of money in politics. Last week, they got both when socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and conservative Ted Cruz displayed some populist synergy by promising to work on legislation that would ban former lawmakers from taking paid lobbyist positions.
With the “ambitious bipartisan effort,” these two “seemingly opposite legislators” found “common ground” in their disapproval of former members of Congress “wielding their influence in new careers as government lobbyists,” read one particularly insufferable piece.
Now, I don’t very much care for rent-seeking lobbyists, but I care even less for bipartisan attacks on the First Amendment, which have a long history of being as useless as they are unconstitutional .
Lobbying exists. And producing laws that prohibit one class of Americans from pursuing an entirely legitimate and constitutionally protected vocation merely because they’ve been in public office—despite the disreputable nature of both jobs— should be unconstitutional .
You don’t have to rake in the big bucks with the trial lawyers association to read the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”
There’s no addendum in the founding document that says except for “ bakers who refuse to design individual same-sex wedding cakes” or “ those who give money anonymously” or “fossil-fuel influence-peddlers who help provide cheap, affordable energy” or “greedy former politicians who are cashing in with the lucrative abortion lobby .”
Then again, banning former lawmakers from lobbying, whether for two years or forever, whether for pay or no pay, is little more than political posturing.
There are fewer lobbyists in DC today than there have been in the past 20 years, even though lobbying groups spend more money promoting their causes than ever. Many former politicians are functional “lobbyists” who simply don’t register as such, yet still do virtually the same job . Which is to say, if you believe bans on speech will change the dynamic of politics, you’re incredibly naïve.
It’s unsurprising that the lobbyist-politician revolving door is nearly as busy as the journalist-political operative revolving door. Working in DC is a full-time job, and lobbying firms hire people with relevant experience and contacts. Who are they supposed to hire? Former bartenders? Snarky tweeters? Idealistic pundits? You can’t outlaw Americans from gaining experience any more than you can outlaw them from staying in Washington. What you can do is vote for decent politicians, if such things exist.
Then again, those you do vote into office know well that the average American sees “lobbying” as a catch-all for all the troubles in the world. For progressives, it’s about “corporate interests” or oil companies or Koch brothers. For conservatives, it’s unions and environmentalist groups and George Soros. For everyone, “special interests” is just a euphemism for political advocacy they dislike.
For more than a century, lobbyists have been useful strawman for elected officials who want to avoid directly insulting voters and smearing their opponents as lapdogs. The most obvious recent example is the preposterous treatment the National Rifle Association (NRA) has gotten over the years. Democrats like to pretend that the Second Amendment advocacy group is holding politicians hostage rather than merely representing the positions of millions of voters that those politicians rely on, in the same way that Planned Parenthood does.
However pernicious you might find these various causes, speech that advocates for issues you dislike isn’t “corruption.” We already have laws prohibiting fraud and bribery. Sometimes lobbyists break those laws and are prosecuted. Most of the time they do not.
As hard as it may be to believe, lobbyist speech can also be beneficial. Sometimes individuals in an industry pool their resources and hire a lobbyist who makes arguments and offers expertise—biased as it surely is—that politicians aren’t aware of. The downside, upside, or cost of legislation, for example. Surely there are ignorant elected officials who harbor puerile ideas about the world that might benefit from hearing more information and debate.
And since we’re on the subject of Ocasio-Cortez, it’s worth mentioning that both she and Cruz piggybacked on the idea brought up Democratic Party presidential hopefuls—and aren’t they all?—Michael Bennet and Elizabeth Warren, who want members of Congress to ban legislators from lobbying after they leave office.
“There’s no constitutional right to get paid to peddle influence—rightly so,” the Massachusetts senator argues. Warren, who was making $430,000 as a Harvard law professor while also pulling in six figures as a consultant in anti-trust cases around the country, knows well that Americans don’t need special permission to speak. The question is should Congress be able to ban someone like Warren, should she ever leave politics, from being able to make arguments in cases that have political implications or rely on the expertise she gained as a lawmaker?
Lobbying isn’t inherently unethical. There are lobbyists for construction workers, nurses, casket makers, lawn-care providers , and numerous other industries that most voters probably find morally neutral. Yet, not one of these outfits, not even the ones with the most money or the most politicized agendas, has ever controlled your vote or the vote of your cowardly elected official.
Politicians rely on groups whose views comport with their own agendas. Banning speech won’t change that reality."
Elizabeth Warren Plays Santa Claus With ‘Free’ Gifts For Every Voter (Except Those Filthy Rich People),thefederalist.com,Susanna Hoffman,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/03/elizabeth-warren-plays-santa-claus-free-gifts-every-voter-except-filthy-rich-people/,"June 3, 2019 By Susanna Hoffman
During an interview on “The View” on Thursday, Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren embodied a lefty Santa Claus as she discussed all the “universally free” things her new tax plan supposedly guarantees.
As the audience went wild off-camera, enthused Warren explained that her new plan could make college debt poof away with her proposed wealth tax.
“Two-cent wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent, your 50-millionth and first dollar, and with that we can cancel student loan debt for about 95 percent of the people who have it,” Warren said. Her fans cheering, Warren added, “Oh, but we can do so much more…”
You can almost see the festive sleigh hovering behind Warren as she rattles off all the goodies her wealth tax can magically provide:
1) Universal tuition-free technical school, two-year college, and four-year college; 2) Taxpayer-sponsored child care for every child aged 0-5; 3) Universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old; and 4) Higher wages for every child care worker and preschool teacher,
All this how? Warren held up two fingers. “Two cents,” she said.
“The View” co-host Joy Behar asked how Warren would counteract Republicans’ assault against her by using the “‘S’ word” (socialism). Warren replied by saying that her wealth tax aligns with American values.
“They can’t pitch in 2 cents on the 50-millionth and first dollar?” Warren said. “If they could just pitch in the 2 cents, then everyone in this country has a chance to build something.”
Warren is not wrong by saying that equal opportunity is an American value. Warren’s “two cent” fix even sounds like common sense, and may have appeal to parents and students who don’t know how math or taxes work.
However, if Warren’s proposal sounds too good to be true, that’s because it is. According to a CNN article , economists who helped formulate Warren’s plan, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, calculated the wealth tax would add $2.75 trillion to government coffers in about ten years. Also in a decade, Warren’s universal college plan would cost $1.25 trillion, and her universal child care would cost $700 billion.
However, compared to an IRS report, Saez and Zucman’s numbers are grossly inaccurate. Harvard professor Lawrence H. Summers and Wharton School professor Natasha Sarin estimate that Warren’s wealth tax would only bring in about “40 percent of what Saez and Zucman estimate,” Summers and Sarin said. Hmm, guess it can’t be just taking two cents from billionaires after all.
Not only are the numbers for Warren’s universal plans unpredictable, there is also doubt whether a wealth tax could be enforced. According to an article by Chicago Booth Review , wealth is difficult to value, and therefore difficult to tax.
Larry Samuelson at Yale’s Department of Economics told CBR, “Wealth is notoriously difficult to tax. Enforcement problems are compounded by the distortions induced by legal tax evasion.” Robert Shimer, at University of Chicago’s Department of Economics, agreed, saying that a wealth tax would cause such evasions as “the wealth moving offshore, despite provisions against that.”
Warren’s plan presents another issue. It is unconstitutional to tax based on wealth (assets versus income). The 16th Amendment states that “Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes ” (emphasis added). CNN reports that this issue will most likely be taken the Supreme Court should the tax be implemented.
The numerous issues with Warren’s plan make her “two cents” sound fantastical. Warren’s sleigh is piled high with improbable proposals, and Americans deserve to hear the hard truth that Santa Claus doesn’t exist.

Conservatives Need To Stop Shooting At Each Other And Start Fighting The Left,thefederalist.com,Joshua Lawson,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/03/conservatives-need-stop-shooting-start-fighting-left/,"By Joshua Lawson June 3, 2019
In case you missed it, this past Memorial Day weekend began with a continuing back , and forth , and back again between well-respected conservatives Sohrab Ahmari and David French. The debate started on Twitter , then quickly spread to nearly every major center-right online outlet. At its core is the question of how to solve what nearly all conservatives agree is our present cultural crisis.
The central issue is this: conservatives have lost the commanding heights of culture. The media, our education systems, and even the arts used to espouse values that reinforced (or at least didn’t completely attack) America’s founding principles. Then for the last 70 years, we’ve slowly conceded.
So what do we do? I agree with Ahmari that we need to fight back. This isn’t the time for shrinking violets. The nation desperately needs to return to a pursuit of The Good, The True, and The Beautiful. But the critical question remains: how? Government Force Is Not the Answer
Of all the possible mechanisms to achieve a more virtuous society, my Federalist colleague Liz Wolfe is right that state enforcement should be at the bottom of the list. Surely one of the chief lessons of the last century of political history is that government ruins nearly everything it touches. Believing that the state can inculcate morality is wishful thinking at best and dangerous in the worst case.
Beyond that, is a society truly virtuous if it is forced into being so? The America of the Founding Era was unequivocally principled, righteous, and grounded in the Highest Good. But it was because the people were themselves virtuous, not because the government made them that way.
Any power granted to the state to enforce morality can be wielded by the radical left the moment they control the necessary levers of government. You can be assured that the left will be far more heavy-handed in dictating their warped idea of morality. French’s hypothetical of the state using this power to ban public readings of C.S. Lewis isn’t too far-fetched. Tocqueville’s Wisdom on Liberty and Religious Virtue
The other side of the coin is that most of us are incapable of “stumbling” into the Highest Good on our own. The most righteous people you know owe it to their parents, an abnormally good education, a strong religious community, or usually some measure of all three. Aristotle was of course right when he taught that both excellence and virtue are habits. They must be worked at, practiced, and reinforced by immersive cultural mores.
Back in the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in praise of early New England’s blend of liberty with religion. Tocqueville saw that religion was essential to liberty and vice versa. Liberty and religion are not opposites. In fact, they need each other. Tocqueville wrote that they “move in harmony” and “offer mutual support.” It was not a binary choice then. It isn’t a binary choice now. Tocqueville observed:
Religion sees in civil liberty a noble exercise of the faculties of man; in the political world, a field offered by the Creator to the efforts of intelligence. … Liberty sees in religion the companion of its struggles and triumphs, the cradle of its early years, the divine source of its rights. Liberty considers religion as the safeguard of mores, mores as the guarantee of laws and the pledge of its own duration. Both, taking man by the hand, guide his steps and show his way in the wilderness.
It would be nigh impossible to recreate Puritan New England, and I doubt even many conservatives would willingly subscribe to their extreme ascetic living standards. There are, however, important lessons in Tocqueville’s observations of how the Puritans blended religious virtue and liberty. Education matters. Cultural mores matter. A strong social fabric matters. And most importantly: these things take a long, long time.
Ahmari rightly points out that libertine public activities that conservatives find offensive, like the now infamous drag queen storytime event , “cannot be sustained without some level of moral approval by the community.” This is undoubtedly true. And a huge problem. But I would argue that the solution lies in shifting the mores of the community rather than turning to government coercion to bludgeon-out-of-existence things we find offensive.
This will be a long, drawn-out battle. But it can be won. Just as the culture took multiple generations of decay to get us to where we are now, it will take consecutive hard-working generations to rescue it. We didn’t lose this battle overnight. We can’t win it back with one presidential election or a Supreme Court seat either. Start Treating Education Like the Major Leagues
Conservatives need to take back the education of the young. We should champion—in as many ways we can—classical, liberal arts education steeped in Western heritage and Great Books. We must undertake the long quest of creating an informed citizenry that chooses to be virtuous. If the classical education movement continues to gain ground in private schools along with public charters that’ll be a good indication that the culture is shifting. Politicians can help by promoting school choice and ending taxpayer subsidies for higher education.
Conservatives need to get more media savvy and engage the culture without being transformed or tainted by it (the age-old New Testament challenge). I think the media tide is turning. The rise and success of new conservative media like The Federalist and The Daily Wire show that there’s encouraging movement. We need to continue the momentum, and—as always—be ready for the fray.
As Thomas Sowell has noted, “There are no solutions; there are only trade-offs.” The answer to our cultural crisis probably lies between the positions of French and Ahmari. In the wider war to defeat the radical left, conservatives must find unity in a prudent, simultaneous pursuit of liberty and virtue. A House Divided Cannot Stand
Debate and intelligent discourse are healthy. Fighters like William F. Buckley and Harry Jaffa made the conservative movement smarter and better. They helped sharpen our positions and uncover holes in our reasoning. However, we must always make sure that internecine arguments won’t have an attrition effect on the wider conservative movement.
There’s still merit to Ronald Reagan’s 11th Commandment . Perhaps the phrase should be amended to “Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow conservative,” but the sentiment stands. We must keep our eyes on the prize. As Ben Domenech has pointed out , the larger fight is against the radical left that threatens everything we cherish. If we become a circular firing squad, we only make the work of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her ilk easier.
In 1754, Benjamin Franklin released a political cartoon featuring a snake cut into eight pieces, symbolizing each of the American colonies. Three words were emblazoned at the bottom of the image: “Join, or Die.” Faced with the outbreak of the French and Indian War, Franklin knew that without unity, the fledgling colonies stood no chance against their enemies.
The slogan was taken up again in 1765 in the face of British Imperial oppression. In some colonies, the phrase was altered to “Unite, or Die.” Against the might of the British Empire, a divided America could not hope to win. Numerous philosophical and political differences existed between the colonial leaders. Yet for the sake of survival against a common enemy, these disagreements were prudently set aside to be fought another day.
American conservatives of all stripes joined together in the 1980s against the threat of Soviet tyranny and won a great victory. Today, the most dangerous enemies of the Founders’s version of America aren’t in Moscow—they’re here at home. The radical leftist ideology that has slowly crept into our media, our schools, and our entertainment must be countered and defeated. We cannot afford to get in our own way. We should be looking for friends and allies in this critical fight. The more, the merrier. Prudence and Balance Can Win in the End
Some of the upcoming battles will be better served by the civil, persuasion-based methods French advocates. Many Americans are waking up to the insanity of the modern left and can be moved to the right-of-center by well-reasoned discussion.
But it’s clear now there can be no reasoning with the extreme fringes of the radical left. Those battles are so dire that they must be waged on the left’s playing field and will require pounding the table with impassioned resistance a la Thomas and Kavanaugh, more as Ahmari advocated. Each situation must be measured on its own terms as the circumstances demand, and the tactics selected accordingly.
No side of the individual liberty versus institutional morality debate will get the entirety of what they want. Politics is, at its heart, about compromise. And it’s complicated.
Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill were undoubtedly the greatest statesmen of the last 200 years. Both defended freedom. Both knew when they had to compromise to secure the final victory.
Few would dare to call either man cowardly. We must recognize what is necessary while still pursuing the final cause of the United States—the preservation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
America must always balance a healthy tension of liberty and government-encouraged virtue. We can debate how the balance currently stands. We can argue over how to correct any lopsidedness. But we certainly can’t lie back and let things continue as they are. For the sake of the country we love, we need to pick our battles strategically, then fight with all of our hearts to win.

Politico Falsely Reports That A Pastor Apologized For Praying For Trump,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/04/politico-falsely-reports-megachurch-pastor-apologized-praying-trump/,"June 4, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
President Trump stopped by McLean Bible Church, a megachurch near D.C., on Sunday on his way home from playing golf, where Pastor David Platt prayed for the president–a common Christian practice. Perhaps if Politico reporters and editors understood the biblical command of praying for all those in positions of authority, they might not have botched their coverage of the president’s pit stop so poorly.
On Monday, Platt wrote to his church members with an explanation of Sunday’s prayer, but Politico reported that Platt “has apologized to his congregation after praying for the president during the unscheduled visit.”
Unsurprisingly, Platt did not apologize for doing what the scriptures command him to do. As the pastor read on stage, and explained in his statement , in 1 Timothy 2:1-6, Saint Paul the apostle instructs Christians to pray for their earthly leaders.
First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. 3 This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, 4 who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.
Platt did address members who may have been “hurt” by his prayer, but did not apologize. He simply explained how making petitions to God about those in authority is a command from God, and one that guided his response to the president’s surprise visit. “My aim was in no way to endorse the president, his policies, or his party, but to obey God’s command to pray for our president and other leaders to govern in the way this passage portrays,” he said.
Nevertheless, that not-so-minor detail missing from Platt’s statement didn’t stop Politico from running with it as the headline and framing of their story. Pitting evangelicals against the president they elected was too good of an angle to pass up. Instead, their lazy reporting portrays a pastor apologizing for practicing God’s word. “It is not weird for a Southern Baptist pastor to pray for the president of the United States.” The fact that @emmaogreen even has to write this 🤦🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/WmIUFASadh

Praying for local, state, and national leaders — often by name — is a regular discipline for many Christians. Some churches carve out time for it every Sunday, but it’s not just for evangelicals. Catholics and Jews do it too.
At the time the Apostle Paul was writing these commands to his protégé Timothy, Christians were being murdered and persecuted across the Roman Empire. Emperor Nero ordered Christians to be thrown into arenas with hungry lions, torn apart by dogs, and burnt alive as human torches. Paul himself was imprisoned under Nero, yet while he sat in jail for sharing his faith, he wrote the scripture commanding Christians to pray for the very rulers who put him there.
Paul’s main reason for praying for leaders is that they may come to hear the gospel and follow Christ. “This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth,” he writes.
Platt, who clearly understands this too, asked his members to continue to pray the same for President Trump. “Would you pray with me for gospel seed that was sown today to bear fruit in the president’s heart?” he wrote.

Why Did The Obama Administration Ignore Reports Of Russian Meddling?,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/04/obama-administration-ignore-reports-russian-election-meddling/,"By Margot Cleveland June 4, 2019
During her hour-long interview last week of Attorney General William Barr, “CBS This Morning” journalist Jan Crawford focused mainly on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of President Trump. She also, however, questioned Barr on the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) efforts to ensure that Russian attempts to interfere in our elections are not repeated in 2020.
This revealed the attorney general is probing a second scandal of the Obama administration related to the 2016 presidential election. Or it would be regarded as a second scandal if it garnered more attention: Why the Obama administration failed to forcefully respond to intelligence of Russian interference in our elections.
The DOJ has “an increasingly robust program that is focusing on foreign influence in our election process, with the FBI obviously taking the lead,” Barr told Crawford. But not enough was done in 2016, Barr acknowledged.
“Bob Mueller did some impressive work in his investigation, you know, identifying some of the Russian hackers and their influence campaign and you sort of wonder if that kind of work had been done starting in 2016, things could have been a lot different,” he said. Crawford replied, “It’s just hard to understand why it wasn’t taken more seriously.” Barr agreed, saying he had no idea why it wasn’t. “That’s one of the things I’m interested in looking at as part of my review of the Russia collusion investigation,” Barr stressed.
With people warned as early as April 2016, “I’m wondering what, exactly, was the response to it if they were alarmed. Surely the response should have been more than just, you know, dangling a confidential informant in front of a peripheral player in the Trump campaign,” the attorney general told Crawford before she moved to another topic. Pay Attention to Barr’s Remarks There
On further analysis, it becomes clear that Barr’s remarks hold more significance than the brief mention Crawford’s interview. First, Friday’s interview is not the only time the attorney general raised the issue of the Obama administration’s failure to launch a robust response to Russian attempts to interfere in our election. Barr also raised the issue last month when testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
During those hearings, Sen. John Cornyn (D–Texas) noted that Mueller’s report “accumulated evidence indicating that the Russian government—through intelligence agencies and internet research organizations, such as the IRA—began as early as 2014 to undermine and sew dissension in the 2016 presidential elections.”
In response to questions concerning his efforts to protect the country from a repeat in 2020, Barr commended Mueller’s efforts—“impressive work,” he called it—”in moving quickly to identify and address the Russian elements involved in the election interference.” The attorney general then added: “I was thinking to myself if that had been done in the beginning of 2016, we would have been a lot further along.”
Barr’s comments also should not be considered in isolation. When considered in tandem with several aspects of the Spygate investigation, it suggests the Obama administration habitually ignored Russia’s efforts to affect the election, opting instead to target Trump and the Trump campaign, transition team, and administration.
Barr’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee highlights one such example: The attorney general confirmed his understanding that the Obama administration had failed to provide Trump a defensive briefing before January 2017, to inform him of “what the Russians were trying to do and [to] advise him to tell people affiliated with his campaign to be on their guard and vigilant about Russians efforts to undermine public confidence in the election.”
“I can’t fathom why it did not happen, if you’re concerned about interference in the election,” Barr told the senators. With three former U.S. attorneys involved in the campaign, “I don’t understand why the bureau would not have given a defensive briefing,” the attorney general testified. More Interesting Threads Appear
Last week, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R–Texas), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, added more texture to the attorney general’s testimony, telling Fox News that during an August 17, 2016 defensive briefing of candidate Trump, “He wasn’t warned about a Russia investigation that Peter Strzok had opened 18 days earlier.”
In a follow-up report , Catherine Herridge revealed the campaign was not specifically warned about Russian outreach to the Trump team during the August 2016 briefing, “nor did the FBI warn him that two campaign aides, Mike Flynn and George Papadopoulos, were already under FBI investigation .” The since-fired Strzok also served in dual roles at this time, Herridge reported—both as “a central coordinator for the FBI on the defensive briefing” about Russian activities and as the lead investigator of “Russian outreach to Trump campaign aides.”
The Obama administration’s failure to brief Trump on the investigation into individuals connected to his campaign for suspected collusion with Russia is but a part of the problem. The FBI also failed to promptly interview George Papadopoulos and Papadopoulos’ supposed Russian connection, Joseph Mifsud, even though the FBI claims it launched the investigation into the Trump campaign in late July based on Papadopoulos’s purported foreknowledge of the WikiLeaks hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server.
Specifically, the FBI first interviewed Papadopoulos in January 2017, and Mifsud the following month—sixth months after the start of Crossfire Hurricane. To paraphrase Barr: I don’t understand why the bureau would not have expeditiously questioned, at a minimum, Papadopoulos if they were so alarmed by his contact with a supposed Russian agent. Why Such a Lax Response?
Testimony by former National Security Council Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel provides further evidence of the Obama administration’s lax response to Russian interference. During questioning by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Daniel admitted to telling his team during a morning staff meeting that they had been told “to stand down,” from their planned response to the Russian hacking and that his directive drew a terse response: “Why the h-ll are we standing down?”
While Daniel admitted he received a stand-down order, he told the committee that there was a “larger context” that could be discussed in the classified session. He added that not all activities concerning Russian interference ceased at that point. Instead, the cybersecurity unit shifted in the September and October timeframe to assist states in protecting the electoral infrastructure. But the cyber response was “put on the backburner.”
The release of notes a State Department official took during her October 2016 meeting with dossier-author Christopher Steele also shows the Obama administration’s flatfooted response to Russian interference. “The Russians have succeeded in placing an agent inside the DNC,” Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec wrote based on Steele’s supposed intel.
In his dossier, Steele also highlighted concerns that the Russians had “a dossier of compromising material on Hillary Clinton,” including “bugged conversations” and “intercepted phone calls.” Yet, to date, there has been no mention of the Obama administration investigating either claim—something one would expect in a robust investigation of Russian interference.
While most of these examples connect to Spygate and suggest the Obama administration and career DOJ and FBI employees inappropriately targeted the Trump campaign, that is but half the scandal. The corollary consists of the Obama administration’s reckless handling of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and its decision to prioritize a sting of the Trump campaign over fighting foreign influence on the electorate. Even those who reject Spygate as a conspiracy theory should see the Obama administration’s ineffective response to Russia’s meddling in our elections as a scandal.

NPR Reporter Style Guide: 'Babies Are Not Babies Until They Are Born',thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/npr-reporter-style-guide-babies-not-babies-born/,"By Joy Pullmann June 5, 2019
NPR recently re-upped its guidance to staff about how to discuss abortion given several states’ recent decisions to decriminalize infanticide or, conversely, more strictly limit abortions. To its credit, the news organization published this guidance publicly. To its shame, it uses a pretense of scientific objectivity to cover a deeply slanted take on this controversial topic.
That includes this mind-bending instruction from Joe Neel , a NPR editor and a correspondent on NPR’s Science Desk:
The term ‘unborn’ implies that there is a baby inside a pregnant woman, not a fetus. Babies are not babies until they are born. They’re fetuses. Incorrectly calling a fetus a ‘baby’ or ‘the unborn’ is part of the strategy used by antiabortion groups to shift language/legality/public opinion. Use ‘unborn’ only when referring to the title of the bill (and after President Bush signs it, the Unborn Victims of Violence Law). Or qualify the use of ‘unborn’ by saying ‘what anti-abortion groups call the ‘unborn’ victims of violence.” The most neutral language to refer to the death of a fetus during a crime is ‘fetal homicide.’
This is mind-numbingly stupid. It also reveals a bias against pro-life groups, because it implies that if a pro-life group says the truth, it can’t be the truth just because the pro-life group said it.
The plain truth is, fetuses are babies. Pro-lifers saying so doesn’t make it false, even if NPR’s speech police don’t like to hear it or feel it’s a particularly effective pro-life argument.
And it’s effective because it’s true, and because everyone knows it is true. I saw my first son for the first time when he was about seven weeks post-conception, and I heard his heart thump-thump-thump big and strong. It was then that I knew I had to stop pretending he was not really a person yet, because there he was, the size of a blueberry, with arms and legs and a robust heartbeat I could see spiking across the monitor. That monitor isn’t unscientific, nor non-medical, unless you want to deny science and medicine themselves.
In fact, it’s un scientific to say the heartbeat doesn’t belong to a baby, or a human. What does it belong to, a chicken? A pig? A fruitcake? Denying reality quickly gets you into insane territory. Obviously, that heartbeat comes from a human heart. And where do we find human hearts? Inside human freaking persons, that’s where, and nowhere else. Very young human freaking persons are called babies . That’s also science, in case any NPR reporters are wondering.
Every single mother who has ever seen her baby on that ultrasound screen at whatever stage, and her husband and all her family and friends, knows that a fetus is a baby. And so do the doctors attending that mother and child.
Pretending otherwise to make women who kill their unborn children, and the politicians and corporations who use them for money and a wedge issue, feel better is also deeply offensive to women who have lost children to miscarriage and stillbirth. They didn’t lose a “fetus.” They lost a baby.
They have held those babies in their hands and arms. They know what they lost, and it is not anything other than a human child. Don’t anyone dare lie about their suffering and loss. It only means something if what they lost was a person, rather than an impersonal “fetus,” a “potential person,” or whatever word torturing just came out of Euphemisms, Edition 7.0 to cover the failures of the last generation of lies.
Only a wall of skin and a thin lining of uterus stands between a child and the sunlight before he is born. Being hidden and small doesn’t make babies any less babies. Being unwanted doesn’t make babies any less babies either, just like being unwanted wouldn’t make disabled or elderly people or anyone else less human. While obviously doctors will call an unborn person a fetus, that doesn’t mean there aren’t other accurate words to use for precisely the same thing — like “babies,”“unborn child,” and “human.”
The rest of the guidelines are similarly riven with obfuscation. They also tell writers not to use the phrase “late-term abortion,” because:
Though we initially believed this term carried less ideological baggage when compared with partial-birth, it still conveys the sense that the fetus is viable when the abortion is performed. It gives the impression that the abortion takes place in the 8th or 9th month. In fact, the procedure called intact dilation and extraction is performed most often in the 5th or 6th month — the second trimester — and the second trimester is not considered ‘late’ pregnancy. Thus ‘late term’ is not appropriate.
So, NPR Standards and Practices Editor Mark Memmott says “late-term abortion”“conveys the sense that the fetus is viable when the abortion is performed” about a procedure done “most often in the 5th or 6th month.” Memo to Mr. Memmott: Babies are viable in the 5th and 6th months of pregnancy (which occurs in about weeks 22-28). Many mothers I know, especially those who have experienced miscarriages, wait anxiously until they reach 24-26 weeks of gestation because that’s the point at which doctors have a good chance of saving their baby if he arrives prematurely.
NPR science correspondent Neel ought to be aware of things like this, but maybe he’s not really up on women’s health, so I’ll stick in a bit here from a huge study reported on back in 2015:
According to a new study of more than 34,600 pre-term babies born between 1993 and 2012, published Tuesday in JAMA , overall survival rates for preemies between 22 and 28 weeks of gestation increased to 79 percent in 2012, up from 70 percent in 1993. The smallest babies had the biggest improvement in survival rates, showing a more than 5 percent improvement.
This was four years ago, meaning survival rates for babies this young have only improved. Regardless, let’s go with these numbers for illustration. We see that at least four out of five babies born in the fifth and sixth months of their mothers’ pregnancies survive. Based on this, I would call babies at that stage viable , wouldn’t you?
So what this means, then is that lots of mothers are legally ending the lives of babies who would grow normally if they were simply delivered and transferred to a NICU instead. Maybe that reality is too much for NPR’s staff to handle.
Yet since newspersons deal in daily atrocity and gore from the likes of wars, famines, and hurricanes, it’s hard to understand why they all drive out to gawk at the law-breaking foreigners Americans feed, give medical care to, clothe, protect, and transport, but want to stay as far away as possible from other vulnerable people our society allows to have their heads mortally pierced with scissors or a scalpel inside their own mother’s wombs.

"Policy Elites Want To Dump John Bolton, But Trump Shouldn't Fall For It",thefederalist.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/foreign-policy-elites-want-dump-john-bolton-trump-shouldnt-fall/,"By Jonathan S. Tobin June 5, 2019
The script is familiar: Leaks from White House staffers and others with supposedly good sources in the West Wing start whisper a high-ranking official has lost President Donald Trump’s confidence. Anecdotes in which the notoriously irascible commander-in-chief expresses frustration with the advice he’s been getting and his lack of personal chemistry with the object of the speculation.
What follows is the media’s anxious wait for an instance in which the president will contradict or pour scorn on something the hapless official has said or done. Once that happens, it’s only a matter of time — and usually not all that much time — before the victim is frog-marched out of his office and added to the rogue’s gallery of fired and resigned Trump officials that The New York Times helpfully publishes any time there’s a significant personnel change.
In other words, National Security Advisor John Bolton is a dead man walking even if he doesn’t know it yet. That’s the conclusion that the mainstream media was drawing last week once Trump said he didn’t think North Korean missile tests violated United Nations resolutions and went out of his way to say that he wasn’t interested in regime change in Iran. The produced a front page feature in The New York Times that practically dripped with anticipation about Bolton’s imminent defenestration. Columns in the Washington Post chimed with headlines like “Bye, Bye Bolton.”
The week ended with Bolton still in place as the president headed off for a state visit to Britain. But the foreign policy establishment and Obama administration alumni who were helping to orchestrate the media buzz about his doom were unfazed, certain that, in time, the notoriously brash Bolton would annoy or cross the president one time too often and their bête noire on Iran and other issues would finally be evicted from his unlikely hold on power.
Anyone who makes hard and fast predictions about the Trump administration is on a fool’s errand, so the chorus may eventually be proved correct. Yet this time, the familiar script about the revolving door at key White House offices may not be right. As much as Trump may not love Bolton, there is good reason to believe that he not only values him — the president may have also figured out that on this potential change in personnel, he’s being trolled by the so-called foreign policy “experts” he despises. Trump Needed a Team That Would Drop the Iran Deal
Bolton’s path to the post of national security advisor was not a likely one. Along with just about everyone who had served in past Republican administrations, he was deeply critical of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Moreover, Trump’s flirtation with isolationist policies and retroactive opposition to the Iraq War would have made Bolton a natural target for the president’s contempt. Bolton served as undersecretary of state in the George W. Bush administration before a stint as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and was a strong supporter of the war that Trump still holds up as the greatest mistake in American history.
But Bolton is as well known for his opinions on Iran as he is for his involvement in the Iraq war. Although he has frequently spoken in favor of regime change in Iran and bombing the Islamist regime’s nuclear assets — positions that would run afoul of Trump’s instinctual dislike of entangling the United States in another Middle East war — he has been an opponent of President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran.
Trump’s fervent opposition to Obama’s appeasement of Iran contradicts his desire to stay out of Syria and seek better relations with Russia. But his desire to scrap the nuclear deal and renegotiate a pact that would eliminate the sunset clause that will eventually enable Iran to get a nuclear weapon and to force Tehran to give up its support for international terrorism has been a consistent theme of Trump’s foreign policy views.
Yet over the course of his first 15 months in office, he was frustrated in his desire to scrap the nuclear deal by a foreign policy team that thought they were there to act as the adults in the room constraining the president’s irrational policy whims. Both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster consistently frustrated Trump on Iran, seeking to put off indefinitely the president’s desire to withdraw from the weak pact and arguing that the re-imposition of economic sanctions on the Islamist regime wouldn’t work.
But in April 2018, Trump fired the so-called adults and hired two men who would seek to implement his policies rather than thwart them. With the accession of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state and Bolton as national security advisor, the days of his staff seeking to argue that Obama’s nuclear deal should be left in place were over. Within weeks, the United States finally pulled out of the pact and sanctions on Iran began to be re-imposed. Dropping the Iran Deal Is Working
Freed of the constraints his staff put on him, Trump’s plans to deal with Iran unfolded without a hitch.
Contrary to the predictions of the foreign policy establishment that Tillerson and McMaster had not argued against, unilateral U.S. sanctions almost immediately began to place enormous pressure on Iran, limiting its ability to fund, among other things, its terrorist auxiliaries in Lebanon and Syria. Moreover, as Bolton had predicted all along, America’s European allies were compelled to go along with the sanctions since their threats to find a way to evade them flopped. In 2019, Pompeo and Bolton made good on their plans to lift the last remaining exemptions allowing nations to buy Iranian oil, closing the noose around their economy.
The charge that Bolton is pushing Trump into war is primarily the function of Iranian and Obama sympathizers seeking to reinforce the former president’s old media “echo chamber” talking point about there being only two choices on Iran: appeasement or war. Trump understands that the only way to pressure Iran into submitting to his demands is to not fall from their bluffs or to listen to those “experts” who negotiated the nuclear deal in the first place. He also seems to comprehend that staying the course on his policy provides a path to weakening Iran without war.
Moreover, in contrast to McMaster, who had the advantage of a glittering military resume but failed to engage Trump, Bolton reportedly seems to have found a way to regularly brief the president without boring or straining his patience. John Bolton Is Also Hard to Replace
This did not mean Bolton was a perfect match for Trump. The president worries about the possibility for a military conflict with Iran and frets about his advisor’s bellicose nature. Nor did Bolton’s famously brusque manner, which has earned him enemies at every step of his long government career dating back to the President George H.W. Bush administration, endear him to a president who is well known to like being flattered.
Neither Bolton nor Pompeo are supporters of Trump’s effort to use some of flattery of his own to cajole North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. Trump’s willingness to contradict Bolton on North Korea’s missile tests, which, contrary to the president’s willingness to downplay the issue, are illegal, is a sign that the president may listen to his advisor but doesn’t let himself be talked out of any of his favorite ideas, no matter how foolish (as his effort to win over the North Koreans is) it might be.
Is the ever-restless Trump liable to tire of his national security advisor? Probably. But Trump also knows that until he hired Pompeo and the pugnacious Bolton, he was helpless to get his foreign policy agenda implemented. Finding a replacement as tough-minded will be difficult. If he fires Bolton he knows it will not be easy to replace him with someone else with policy experience who has the will to stay the course on Iran.
An even stronger argument against the expectations of Trump’s detractors is that Trump knows his opponents are gunning for Bolton. Trump’s stubborn nature provides as much motivation for his actions as his pique. So long as The New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, and all the former Obama administration officials on TV are clamoring for Bolton’s head, the national security advisor may be safe.
Reverse psychology notwithstanding, the president may have grasped that he needs Bolton as much as he does Pompeo. Relationships with Trump are not forever commitments. But if Trump wants to avoid further sabotage from self-proclaimed adults seeking to manipulate him, then the best course he can take is to stick with Bolton. Jonathan S.

Bill de Blasio Is Lying About Anti-Semitic Attacks In Brooklyn,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/bill-de-blasio-is-lying-about-anti-semitic-attacks-in-brooklyn/,"June 5, 2019 By David Marcus
At a press conference yesterday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed that anti-Semitism is “a right-wing movement.” Ironically the mayor was speaking in Brooklyn, where attacks against Jews have skyrocketed in recent months. The mayor cannot possibly believe that these attacks are fueled by right-wing rhetoric or Trump supporters.
Hate crimes have risen by 64 percent in New York City and the vast majority of them are anti-Semitic attacks. According to the Anti Defamation League (ADL), such attacks rose in the state of New York by 55 percent in 2018. The city has announced that it will be opening an Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes in coming months, but what good will it be if the mayor refuses to accept the true nature of the problem and continues to pretend that this is all some kind of right-wing plot?
As Joe Borelli, Staten Island’s city councilman, told the New York Post, “A simple look at where anti-Semitic hate crimes have occurred just disproves this– unless you count central Brooklyn as the home of a vast right-wing conspiracy.” He went on to say, “Bill de Blasio regularly says stupid things, but this is literally the stupidest effing thing he’s ever said.”
But it’s far worse than simply being stupid; in fact, it’s incredibly dangerous. As the Orthodox Jewish community is terrorized by violent attacks, the mayor simply refuses to even acknowledge the problem exists. He is giving tacit approval to those who attack Jews by foolishly pretending that anti-Semitism is only to be found among conservatives. How can Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn trust that their mayor is working to solve this problem when he won’t even admit it is a problem?
In fact, the mayor is succumbing to a political correctness that will not allow him to criticize the mostly black and Latino men who are perpetrating these assaults. And let’s be clear: If any other group other than Jews were being targeted for such violence it would be at the top of the mayor’s list of concerns. Instead, he puts his head in the sand and ignores it because he doesn’t like the optics.
At yesterday’s presser, de Blasio said, “I want to be very, very clear, the violent threat, the threat that is ideological is very much from the right.” Not only does this ignore the violent attacks in Brooklyn that only someone living in a fantasy land could believe is the result of Trump or Fox News, but it also ignores the anti-Semitic statements from Democrats like Rep. Ilhan Omar.
Perhaps de Blasio agrees with Omar that Jews are hypnotizing the world with their “Benjamins,” perhaps he believes that Israel should not exist as a Jewish state, perhaps he agrees with the virulent anti-Semitism of left-wing figures like Linda Sarsour. But part of his job is to ensure crime does not go rampant or unpunished. In this capacity, not only is he failing, but he is blatantly lying about who is committing these acts.
This is not a new story in New York City; in 1968 the Jewish Defense League was formed to protect Jews from exactly these kinds of attacks. Vigilantism is not the ideal way for Jews to protect themselves, but when the mayor refuses to act to put a stop to the violence, what other choice is there? Should they just get punched in face and smile knowing that de Blasio says this is just some kind of right-wing problem?
De Blasio is simply and totally negligent on this issue as mayor of New York City. The city needs its mayor to understand, accept, and address this issue with the gravity it requires. This is no time for political correctness to blind him to reality. But yesterday’s remarks make it clear that either de Blasio is as stupid as Borelli claims, or he just doesn’t care.
One thing is certain—the mayor is flat-out wrong about the nature of these attacks, and it is absurd to lay them at the feet of conservatives. Perhaps he is preening for his farcical presidential run, but whatever he is doing, he needs to stop, take stock of the reality on the ground, and work to protect the safety of his citizens—even if they happen to be Orthodox Jews.

Two Brand-New Senators Cast Light On The GOP’s Post-Trump Future,thefederalist.com,Brad Todd,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/two-brand-new-senators-cast-light-gops-post-trump-future/,"By Brad Todd June 5, 2019
The heat and light given off by the nuclear grind between President Trump and his antagonists have blinded Washington’s chroniclers to something important happening right before their eyes. The fusion of populism and conservatism as a workable and ideological political movement is emerging in the actions of two newly elected senators: Josh Hawley and Rick Scott.
It took a political hijacker like Trump to elevate Republicans out of the losing rut in which our old, Goldwater-ish GOP had become mired. But from a policy perspective, Trump has worked out to be more like a Viking conqueror than English colonizer.
Trumpism has proven to be a formidable foe to the new left’s dominant ideology of cosmopolitan elitism—within the bounds of the daily news cycle. But if the realignment that Trump’s win validated is going to be a structural victory for Republicans, it needs more than daily combat. It needs policy pioneers and settlers, and longer-term battles that deliver material results for voters beyond merely thwarting harmful liberal impulses. That’s where first-termers Hawley and Scott enter.
Scott, a self-made health-care CEO who built the nation’s largest hospital corporation, has zeroed in on the crisis of drug pricing. His proposal to outlaw any U.S. drug price that is higher than the price for the same medicine overseas fuses the twin populist urges of corporate accountability and nationalism. The novelty of Scott’s proposal is that it uses the profit motive to achieve an end Democrats have sought only through socialistic means.
Scott would require drug companies that do not want to give up the massive and affluent domestic market—which is all of them—to either sacrifice their foreign sales or wring more price concessions from price-fixing foreign governments. No longer would American consumers be forced to subsidize the market-riggers in Brussels. Rather than mimic the European meddlers, Scott seeks to use the allure of the U.S. market to prod multi-national pharmaceutical powerhouses into demanding more equitable capitalism across the globe.
Scott’s proposal has been quickly written off by conservative D.C. think tanks and organizations long pickled by the cocktails poured liberally at corporate fundraising receptions. But it will be an enduring home run among the Trumpist majority in today’s GOP—a group that is every bit as skeptical of corporate oligopoly and multi-national monopolists as it is of domestic government overreach.
Hawley, the youngest member of the Senate, is waging a similar battle against conservatives’ neglect of Big Tech. The generation of political Republicans already in office before the development of the smartphone still requires their grandchildren’s assistance to toggle between the satellite dish and the DVR, so it’s no wonder those old pachyderms have had no coherent policy approach to the rise of Silicon Valley’s abusive power.
Hawley, the only senator in his 30s, is wired differently and unafraid to confront the complexity of our societal addiction to technological masters. Reconciling the best interests of society with the ruthless realities of algorithmic crack peddlers will be long-haul work, but Hawley, unlike the septuagenarians in the Senate, has the time, and he has eagerly gotten started.
Last week while the press corps was fixated on whether Trump or Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated the latest round of name-calling, Hawley was penning a national column suggesting our largest tech giants are “parasites” and might need to be broken up. As an even younger man, Hawley wrote a biography of another Republican trust-buster, Teddy Roosevelt. His notion of modern-day trust-busting in the vertical Valley might be a big long-term mission for a conservative movement that needs one.
If older conservatives are scared by what they don’t understand about Big Tech, and Democrats too indebted to the Valley’s chieftains on unrelated cultural matters like gay legal preferences, then it will be left to young populists like Hawley to drag Washington to the oversight role that consumers demand. It’s a niche he seems eager to fill, and one he began in his first days as Missouri’s attorney general before Washington knew anything about him.
In the same week Hawley ripped into Big Tech in his thoughtful op-ed, he also excoriated a nominee for a district judgeship, put up by Trump as a concession to Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). A former religious liberty lawyer, Hawley has in a matter of months emerged as the only Republican willing to grill Republican nominees on the depth of their commitment to the First Amendment’s protections for people of faith, who are increasingly outgunned in the public square. If Justice Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation provided the needed bulwark to stop the erosion of religious liberty on the Supreme Court, it will be battles fought by the likes of Hawley that ensure lower courts adhere.
Hawley’s tenacity in vetting judicial nominees has earned him the enmity of the corporate club that runs the swamp. He’s been excoriated not just by the left but by the blinder-wearing editorial board of the Wall Street Journal , which has no doubt checked Hawley’s age and realized he might exercise this unbowed scrutiny from a Judiciary Committee perch for decades. Hawley’s willingness to draw new battle trenches is as notable as his refusal to unflinchingly accept the old partisan fault lines.
Hawley is one of only two Republican senators to have started his political career after the defeat of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, a ticket that embodied the old-wool pin-stripe GOP. As a result, Hawley, like Trump, carries little baggage from his party’s legacy brand. His questioning in a recent commencement speech of the libertine underpinnings of that brand of conservatism proves it.
“For decades now our politics and culture have been dominated by a particular philosophy of freedom,” Hawley said. “It is a philosophy of liberation from family and tradition; of escape from God and community; a philosophy of self-creation and unrestricted, unfettered free choice….But here is the irony. Though the Pelagian vision celebrates the individual, it leads to hierarchy. Though it preaches merit, it produces elitism. Though it proclaims liberty, it destroys the life that makes liberty possible.”
Hawley is asking the GOP to re-examine its cultural frame in much the way Scott seems interested in prompting increased scrutiny for globally-rigged economic elitism. That kind of tough self-reflection is necessary if Republicans are going to forge a thoughtful populism that can be more than a protest speed bump in the road to permanent minority status in a world too dominated by corporate and cultural globalists.
Hawley and Scott began their political careers as self-starting outsiders who stomped the Republican establishments in their home states to win unexpected primaries for state office. Their common thread with each other and Trump is the underdog’s genetic lack of deference, an essential trait to jostle the groupthink that has long ossified the captive conservative minority in Washington.
As senators elected—and mandated—by the populism that now leavens the conservative voting bloc, Hawley and Scott make natural leaders for a new Republican policy approach that is just as critical of concentrated power in the crony-rigged corners of the private sector as it is of the gray muddle of government.
Eventually, in 2021 or 2025, Trump will exit the stage and the curtain will rise on the next chapter of the GOP. To the chagrin of Washington’s cocktail class, it will not resemble the pre-Trump party that proved no match for the rising cosmopolitan and oligopolistic tides of Obama-ism. That party flamed out with Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign.
The post-Trump GOP will not preach laissez-faire economics then benignly accept distorted D.C. deal-making. This next-generation populism will be shaped by its paradigm-disrupting defenses of the aspirational, and faithful, individual—whether those defenses rankle power centers in government or Manhattan C-suites.

"In Advance Of Tiananmen Anniversary, Chinese Censors Crack Down On Foreigners’ Speech",thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/advance-tiananmen-anniversary-chinese-censors-crack-foreigners-speech/,"By Helen Raleigh June 5, 2019 Overseas Chinese critics learned a harsh lesson this weekend: it’s not safe to criticize China anywhere, even if you live in a Western democracy. Cao Yaxue, founder and editor of ChinaChang.org, alerted Twitter through a thread that this is now happening: #Developing A large number of Chinese @Twitter accounts are being suspended today. They “happen” to be accounts critical of China, both inside and outside China. @TwitterSupport @TwitterForGood pic.twitter.com/GHYRkofK9v
— #六四不吃饭 (@YaxueCao) May 31, 2019 The number of accounts affected are in the thousands and those account owners outside China spread from the United States to Europe. Some netizens call this suspension a social media massacre. It even caught the attention of Republican Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.), who tweeted: . @twitter has apparently suspended a large number accounts that are critical of #China including accounts of people outside of China. Twitter has become a Chinese govt censor. https://t.co/TsDQZs7juq
— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 1, 2019 Twitter later explained that the suspension was part of their routine effort to shut down “spam, inauthentic behavior and ban evasion.” Twitter admits “sometimes our routine actions catch false positives or we make errors. We apologize.” It insists the inclusion of China critics’ accounts was not demanded by Chinese authorities. Yet many Chinese dissidents and China watchers don’t buy it. Something Doesn’t Add Up For one, the timing of such suspensions is suspicious. It seems to be a coordinated effort by China’s cyber censors to shut down critics leading up to the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. On June 4, 1989, the Chinese government brutally cracked down on peaceful pro-democracy protestors in Tiananmen Square, resulting in a death toll of hundreds to thousands (exact figures remain unknown). Since then, the Chinese government has ruthlessly suppressed any mention of the event online and offline, and any public commemorative activities inside China. It also has constantly harassed and intimidated activists and sympathizers into silence. This strategy is so successful that new generations of Chinese growing up have zero knowledge of what truly happened at Tiananmen. Thirty years later, China is a much more repressive authoritarian state than it was in 1989. A small number of Chinese activists inside China have used virtual private networks (VPNs) or special software to get over China’s internet firewall so they can access sites like Twitter. Chinese censors know who they are. Anyone who posts any message critical of China on these foreign social media platforms is subject to interrogation or even detention . Chinese censors also are known to intensify internet crackdowns during especially sensitive times, such as the anniversary of Tiananmen. So the suspension of those users inside China is something to be expected. But the last weekend’s massive account suspension affected many Chinese dissidents living outside of China. They suspect Chinese censors tracked them down, posing as Twitter users, then filed complaints against them. Twitter usually suspends an account if it receives a sufficient number of complaints. It seems China is no longer satisfied that it has 1.4 billion people—a quarter of the world population—firmly under its control. It wants to police what’s said outside of China too. Glenn Tiffert, a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institute, explains that China under President Xi Jinping, “Isn’t just trying to bury a set of inconvenient truths and facts, but is trying to construct a new narrative” to ensure the Communist Party’s legitimacy. That overarching goal explains why we see Chinese censors extend their long arm overseas and attempt, in many cases, successfully, to impose a similar level of control on foreigners and overseas Chinese people. This is only the latest example of a long string of such attempts to control the narrative by suppressing free speech and silencing critics outside China. China-Prompted Disinvitations and Harassment In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Durham University students’ union invited Anastasia Lin, a former Miss World Canada and human rights activist, to speak at a debate on whether China was a threat to the West. A Chinese embassy official repeatedly called the union’s president Tom Harwood to ask him to disinvite Lin. The official even hinted that if “this debate went ahead, the U.K. might get less favorable trade terms after Brexit.” In 2018, New Zealand professor Anne-Marie Brady , who wrote about China’s foreign influence, had to seek government security after suffering a yearlong harassment campaign by Chinese agents. More than 160 scholars and China watchers from around the world signed an open letter , urging the New Zealand government to protect Brady and condemning China’s “unprecedented attacks on foreign scholars.”
No one suffers more from China’s long arm than Chinese people who live overseas. In 2017, Yang Shuping, a Chinese student at the University of Maryland, gave a commencement address in which she praised America’s democracy and freedom, in contrast to oppression in China. The video of her speech went viral in China and immediately caused a backlash . The Chinese Students and Scholars’ Association (CSSA) at UM quickly put out a “proud of China” video campaign to discredit Yang. Later, an official from the D.C.-based Chinese Embassy praised UM CSSA’s response and encouraged other CSSAs at American universities to follow suit.
Human Rights Watch interviewed a number of Chinese immigrants in Canada. Many dared not to criticize the Chinese government openly, fearing “their job prospects, business opportunities and chances of going back to China would be affected or that their family members who remain in China would be in danger.” The fear of retribution is shared by Chinese people living overseas, from New York to Sydney.
Part of the reason the Chinese government’s fear campaign is effective is because Western companies, not wanting to lose access to China’s massive consumer market, have become willing accomplices, doing Chinese censors’ dirty work. Roy Jones of Omaha, Nebraska, a former customer service agent of Marriott, was fired by the company in January 2018 because he used an official company account to like a tweet from a Tibetan group. The tweet praised Marriott for listing Tibet as a country, not part of China, in a survey.
A month later, German automaker Mercedes-Benz had to apologize for “hurting the feelings” of the people of China for quoting the Dalai Lama on Instagram as saying “Look at situations from all angles, and you will become more open.” Since Chinese authorities view the Nobel Peace Prize winner as a separatist, they see any public recognition of him as a violation of China’s sovereignty. That is why British band Placebo got a “lifetime ban by the Ministry of Culture in China” after they posted a photo of the Dalai Lama on their Instagram account.
It’s worth noting that both Twitter and Instagram are banned in China, so ordinary Chinese citizens’ feelings are well protected since they have no access to these postings. These incidents show that Chinese censors are actively monitoring foreign media platforms and seeking to exert influence on what foreign companies can say on foreign soil. The fact that these companies quickly kowtow to such censorship is really disturbing. Their capitulation only emboldens Chinese censors to be more aggressive in their efforts to shut down any speech they don’t like abroad.
Here’s a time-tested truth: The more you give in to a bully, the more you will be bullied. The threat of Chinese censors outside China is real. No one should be left alone to fend for themselves because China is so powerful that it can easily intimidate businesses, institutions, and outspoken individuals outside China into conformity and silence.
Therefore, the only way to stop China from regulating our free speech on our own soil is that all of us, especially our politicians at all levels, need to take such threats seriously, stand up for businesses and individuals who are targeted, and respond to each incident forcefully by adhering to values we cherish.

How A Shift To Majority-Childless Adults Will Deeply Change American Culture,thefederalist.com,Auguste Meyrat,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/shift-majority-childless-adults-will-deeply-change-american-culture/,"By Auguste Meyrat June 5, 2019
This year, the birthrate in the United States has fallen yet again, to 1.7 children per woman —well below the 2.1 replacement rate. With the exception of Hungarian President Viktor Orban , most leaders in the developed world seem to shrug at this news and focus on other matters.
Part of the collective indifference to this otherwise-alarming statistic is the way it’s treated. Most often, a low birthrate is framed as a long-term economic problem that might affect the labor market, pensions, productivity, and the like. Occasionally, it’s seen as an environmental issue and not really a problem since each new human being produces whole landfills of garbage and leaves a Godzilla-sized carbon footprint over a lifetime. Because people often resist the suggestion that they have any responsibility to give back to society by having children, and many will be dead or close to dead by the time these kind of effects have become disastrous, many people take little interest in the demographic crisis.
What is more pressing and relevant, however, is how this trend will affect the cultures and general attitudes of the developed world. Not only does low fertility lead to a society dominated by the elderly, with young people shouldering a heavier economic and cultural burden, but it also means a society increasingly dominated by childless adults. This latter development warrants far more attention than it normally receives, because it will determine the character of American life. Not Having Kids Makes You a Different Kind of Person
Having children makes an enormous difference for the average adult in both positive and negative ways. Unfortunately, the more advanced a society is, the more people seem to emphasize the negatives. If individuals hope to be decent parents, they must forego many material freedoms and benefits they used to enjoy. For example, parents must provide and work for their family as a breadwinner or caretaker. They can’t just spend all their income on themselves, or be unemployed long-term.
This reality affects every other aspect of a person’s lifestyle. For most parents, certain forms of recreation are curbed or impossible. To travel, the must make extensive arrangements for their children and feel pressure not to be gone too long. The same occurs if they want to go out for a night on the town with friends.
No longer can they safely binge-watch episodes of “Breaking Bad” or “Game of Thrones”—unless, of course, the mother has a newborn and is nursing all hours of the night. No longer can a father play “Skyrim” for so many hours straight. No longer can a mother enjoy brunch with friends after a wild night of partying. These activities are not technically impossible but, practically speaking, they require much more energy than parents normally have, and if indulged usually would lead to defaulting on a parent’s main priority: caring for their children.
Parenthood can halt or significantly delay certain aspirations. The detached contemplative life of the mystic or philosopher becomes difficult with children needing your attention. Similarly, parents cannot devote their whole lives to helping the poor and downtrodden as missionaries or members of the Peace Corps. The risky and often life-consuming careers of an entrepreneur, artist, or inventor also become less feasible for parents whose business, masterpiece, and new product are their children.
There are, of course, exceptions to this, where people seem to have it all and try to maintain the childless life post-kids with the help of nannies and maids from developing countries . For most people, though, children require serious tradeoffs.
Considering all this, it’s no surprise that many people choose not to have families. But there are also great benefits to parenthood, both personally and to society. Children can bring deep joy and purpose to a parent in a way that no career, no lover, no trip abroad, no college degree can. Even the restrictions that come with parenting have the welcome effect of regulating one’s habits and teaching endless lessons in patience and humility.
Perhaps the most unappreciated benefit is how children frequently make their parents much more social and outward-oriented. Children connect parents to their community in a multitude of ways. They often force adults to break out of their small circle of friends to find other parents for playdates and affirmation.
Many adults never go their public library, or to parks, or to community events until they have kids. Many never think about the church they attend, the schools and daycares in their neighborhood, or the levels of safety in most public places before children. Nor do they really look up information on the local zoo, museums, or performance centers. And most childless adults probably don’t look at grocery shopping, walking through a mall, or driving around the neighborhood as parents do. Political Implications of Being a Non-Parent
Naturally, the different experiences of parent and non-parents frequently create opposing outlooks on life. Mainly, it’s easier for non-parents to favor abstractions and change while parents tend to favor concreteness and stability. This is one reason why millennials (most of whom are non-parents) are much more comfortable embracing once-extreme positions in politics and morality, care more about climate change and perfect social equality than about the livelihoods of blue-collar workers and the fate of public schools, regularly switch careers, identities, and values (they are always “in transition”), and think of people on the screen as more real than the people they see and talk to every day.
By contrast, parents tend to seek what is solid and safe. They want to live in a place that’s predictable and wholesome and allow their children to satisfy their need for surprises. This is why they flock to the suburbs where the houses all look the same, streets line up along a perfect grid, and the main sources of entertainment can include shopping at chain stores and watching high school football.
In terms of politics, parents tend to prefer moderation and familiarity. They shun controversy and activism and embrace the status quo. Politicians who promise big changes and use angry rhetoric do poorly with parents who sense a threat, however smart or visionary they may be. In discussions, parents are more likely to avoid politics and stick to family photos, parent memes, and inspirational quotes. Whenever people recall the golden age of civility in past decades, they are recalling a time where the majority of voters were parents and preferred a much more subdued brand of politics. Parents and Non-Parents Can Learn from Each Other
Overall, a thriving culture requires both parents and non-parents. The latter bring innovation, dynamism, and social progress, while the former hold the community together by preserving traditions and enabling relationships. It’s fair to say that the United States and much of the developed world have become prosperous because of great individuals as well as great families and communities. Of course, the two are often interdependent—families provide the foundation necessary to raise a great individual, husbands and wives mutually push each other further than they ever would have gone alone.
In societies with too many childless adults, however, communities start to dissipate and people become disconnected from one another, their immediate surroundings, and even themselves. Without the reality check of children, many adults inhabit a world of speculation where everything is subjective and all things are possible; they “ dwell in possibility ” and are increasingly progressive in their politics. Needless to say, this kind of life easily leads to the stress of constant transitioning, conflicts with others with opposing ideas, addictions to various forms of escape, and depression from the loss of meaning and identity.
Despite liberal fears of conservatives making “The Handmaid’s Tale” a reality , Americans never really had to worry about the extreme of too many parents. For most of the country’s history, they had a choice between a healthy balance of parents and non-parents, and a progressive bias completely in favor of non-parents .
The declining birthrate suggests Americans today prefer the latter, which has already started to affect American culture by marginalizing families even further. Forget the pensions and overcrowding at retirement homes, civil life will become weirder, more unintelligible, and chaotic—and the days of women shouting their abortion, the Green New Deal, and the candidacy of Beto O’Rourke will seem normal by comparison.
Considering this reality, parents may want to fight back and bring other adults to their side. Otherwise, they will have far more to whine and worry about than dirty diapers and their children leaving their shoes all over the place . Auguste Meyrat is an English teacher in the Dallas area.

"Lobbyists Should Be Allowed To Speak, Just Like Everyone Else",thefederalist.com,Kyle Sammin,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/lobbyists-allowed-speak-just-like-everyone-else/,"By Kyle Sammin June 5, 2019
Everyone wants bipartisanship, in theory. But the results often leave something to be desired. When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D–N.Y.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) agree on something, our first reaction is likely to be that if such politically disparate people both like an idea, it must be good. The truth is often more sinister: the best way to get bipartisan majorities is to propose infringing the rights of an unpopular group of people.
That is exactly what is being proposed when Ocasio-Cortez and Cruz talk about barring former legislators from working as lobbyists. Any such bill would violate the First Amendment while doing nothing to clean up the political swamp in Washington. We Can’t Violate Their Rights Because They’re Unpopular
The unpopular group here is lobbyists — specifically, former members of Congress who have become lobbyists. While many people are happy with their own senator and representative, Congress as a whole has almost never been popular. The most recent Gallup poll put Congress’s approval rating at just 20 percent, and that’s actually an improvement: in 2013, it hit an all-time low of 9 percent.
The public’s opinion of lobbyists is, if anything, worse. A 2013 Gallup poll called Congress the second-shadiest industry, with just 8 percent of respondents saying that the ethical standards in the federal legislature were “high” or “very high.” Only one group was considered even less ethical: lobbyists, who polled at 6 percent on the same question.
Most issues before Congress have lobbyists on both sides, but when we talk about lobbyists, it is much like talking about lawyers. The profession generally is thought to be low-down, dishonest, and corrupt; but the ones representing my interests are crusaders for justice, brave and honest men and women who boldly speak the truth to power. In our minds, it’s always the other guy’s lawyer or the other side’s lobbyist who give them all a bad name.
We don’t think of either lobbyists or congressmen as downtrodden people in need of protection, but the rights protected in the Constitution are not just for the weak. Neither are they only for the popular. Rights belong to everyone. Restricting the rights of an unpopular minority can be popular with a majority of people who don’t care to think things through, but that is precisely why they are protected in the Constitution. The First Amendment Applies to All—Even Lobbyists
The right in question here is one guaranteed by two sections of the First Amendment: the right to free speech, and the right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.
As a matter of basic free speech, the proposed ban is already a problem. What a lobbyist does is essentially free speech in action, and not just any speech but political speech, the sort of speech that is necessary for a self-governing people. Lobbyists are hired by companies, unions, and advocacy groups to talk to government officials about public policy. Their goal is to convince those officials that their client’s view of things is correct, and that some law should be altered (or not altered) in accordance with that view.
That kind of speech is at the core of the free speech protections of the First Amendment. But if that were not enough, the same amendment specifically protects the right of the people “to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” That means that all citizens have the right to write to their congressmen, call their offices, or speak to them in person if they can manage an appointment.
Do lobbyists have an easier time getting appointments? Do ex-congressmen lobbyists have an easier time still? Of course. Powerful people have unequal access to other powerful people. That is unfortunate, but it is not sufficient to destroy their natural rights. The New York Times and CNN have a bigger platform to exercise their rights to free speech, too, but that does not mean that bloggers and YouTube stars can vote to deprive them of those rights. Limiting Rights Requires an Amendment, Not Just a Bill
Limiting natural rights is generally a bad idea, which is why statesmen of the early republic went out of their way to protect our rights in the Constitution. That is a good indication that we should tread lightly around them. The founding generation was not perfect, but they were somewhat unique in acknowledging that there were some things that should be kept beyond the reach of government interference—a lesson we should try not to forget.
If rights are guaranteed by the Constitution, limiting them requires a constitutional amendment. The Democrats acknowledged this when they voted (unsuccessfully) to reduce the free speech and free press protections of the First Amendment in order to overturn Citizens United v. FEC, a 2010 censorship case. Reducing the right to petition the government would require the same effort. Fortunately, respect for the Bill of Rights has become sufficiently ingrained in our culture that the thought of repealing it, even in part, gives most Americans pause.
Limiting those rights in the way Ocasio-Cortez and Cruz propose is especially troublesome because it creates two classes of Americans: one who may petition the government, and one who may not. We have seen examples of this kind of thinking before, but none have made their way into law.
Journalists often tell us that the freedom of the press is a grant of rights to a particular group—them. In reality, and as courts have repeatedly affirmed, the right is a right for all Americans to publish their ideas. It is the same with the right to petition the government: it belongs to all of us, not just those who do it for a living. It Would Fail Anyway
Even if an amendment limiting that right were passed, the legislation required to bring it into effect would be more difficult than Ocasio-Cortez and Cruz make it sound. We have laws regulating lobbyists and requiring disclosure, and one defines “lobbying activity” as “lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts, including preparation and planning activities, research and other background work that is intended, at the time it is performed, for use in contacts, and coordination with the lobbying activities of others.”
What are “lobbying contacts”? The same statute defines it as “any oral or written communication (including an electronic communication) to a covered executive branch official or a covered legislative branch official that is made on behalf of a client with regard to [federal lawmaking or rulemaking].”
There are a variety of exceptions to the law, and the deeper you get into it the more convoluted it becomes. That’s because this law (the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 ) is attempting to regulate a pretty basic function of human interaction: one person telling another what he thinks the law ought to be. Former members of Congress have opinions about these things, and they will continue to make them known, probably even more so than most Americans.
It brings to mind the Eighteenth Amendment, which allowed Congress to ban alcohol, and the Volstead Act, which actually banned it. The wording of the amendment is simple, the legislation that followed was more complex. Exceptions were made, loopholes exploited, and enforcement was nearly impossible. To the extent it was enforced, the Volstead Act created the first stirrings of the big government police state that we now see spread to other areas of the law.
The would-be Ocasio-Cortez-Cruz Act would require snoops and spies following ex-congressmen to meetings, listening in on phone calls, and reading emails just to make sure that no one was talking about what the laws of the country should be. The disclosures required by current law, passed in 1995, are a much better solution. People should be allowed to talk about whatever they want.
To the extent that means professionally lobbying the government, the 1995 act lets everyone know what’s going on and who pays whom to do what. After that, it’s up to the voters to decide if their representatives in Washington are spending too much time listening to the professional petitioners and not enough time hearing about what their actual constituents want to do. The information is out there, and the voters can choose what to do with it. That is a much better solution than gutting the First Amendment to score some cheap political points.

"For Americans To Have Freedom, They Must Revive The Common Good",thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/americans-freedom-must-revive-common-good/,"June 5, 2019 By Nathanael Blake
This past week, First Things’ Sohrab Ahmari criticized the strategy and philosophy of National Review’s David French, which has since developed into a general melee over conservatism and its relation to political liberalism.
Good. This is a debate the right should be having, from French’s appeal to classical liberalism to Ben Domenech’s comparison of leftist cultural radicals to the White Walkers in “Game of Thrones” to Charles C.W. Cooke’s complaint that Ahmari and his allies are in thrall to “ Deneen-inspired anti-liberalism ”—which sounds like a great name for a folk punk band.
There are many aspects to the fight, and they are increasing as it metastasizes (for example, it is probably relevant that Ahmari is a Catholic convert and French is a reformed Protestant). However, the core issues remain clear: Is political liberalism the best we can do and is conservatism therefore just a prudent variety of liberalism?
Although American conservatism rejects modern left-liberalism, it tends to do so in the name of an older understanding of liberalism, rather than in favor of a non-liberal alternative order. American conservatives tend to appeal to classical liberal ideas, rather than some sort of throne-and-altar European-style conservatism.
Furthermore, as liberalism’s defenders note, its foes often struggle to articulate a superior alternative. Some critics, such as Patrick Deneen , only offer tentative hints about what a post-liberal regime would be. In First Things, R.R. Reno suggests the need for something else but does not articulate it. Others, such as the Catholic integralists , theorize about alternatives, but are so far from the mainstream that their ideas are, for now at least, only thought experiments. Where Does Liberalism Come From?
Liberalism seems to win by default. Conservatives want one sort of liberalism, leftists another, and those questioning liberalism itself have few alternatives to offer. But the alternatives may become more clear if a distinction is made between liberal ideology and liberal practice , with the latter being much more worthy of preservation.
The practices of liberalism—such as representative democracy, rights as a means of adjudicating competing legal claims, the rule of law and trial by jury—have deeper roots than liberal ideology. Liberal practices that limited power and established accountability in government were rooted in a knowledge of the fallibility and weakness of human will and reason.
Practices of liberty originated long before John Locke wrote his celebrated “Two Treatises on Government.” The often mistaken theories of Locke and others were attempts to systematize and justify already existing ideas and practices.
These practices were not derived from Locke’s visions of isolated individuals in an imagined state of nature. Rather, liberal practices were developed for human persons as they are in their true natural state, which is society, beginning with the family. As Aristotle observed, man is by nature a political being, and a man who has no need of others must be either a beast or a god.
We begin life utterly dependent and remain, to some degree, dependent on others throughout our lives. The development and well-being of the individual is dependent upon that which they have not produced, but have inherited and been given. Full human flourishing is communal, not individual.
We are born into something greater than ourselves, with ends beyond our own pleasures and selfish interests. Our personal good is realized through the good of the community, which has as its ends the flourishing of its members. Thus, while there may at times be tension between the common good and the individual good, they are bound together. Flourishing Does Not Come Through Sheer Individualism
Locke was aware that we need society to achieve full flourishing, yet he discards it in his anthropology; he carefully pruned away the permanence of marriage, family, and nationality. He suggested (wrongly, we now know) that we are born as blank slates, and sought the essence of man in the capacity to alter the world through work , rather than in our capacity for relationships. Liberal ideology is built around a mutilated, unnatural idea of the human person: the sovereign and autonomous individual, who is defined by economic production and consumption to satisfy desire.
Ideological liberalism sought the essence of the human person by stripping away the contingencies of history, culture, and relationships. But we are what we are because of the specificity of our being. The liberal quest to find the universal essence of man ignores the communal reality of human nature and inhibits the recognition of our finitude and fallibility that that is critical to liberalism as practice.
With its fixation on autonomous individuals, liberal ideology offers contracts to mediate in place of the common good it denies. The liberal view of persons as autonomous producers and consumers makes human relationships transactional and contractual and reduces the bonds of a nation to a social contract. But the idea of a contract is not adequate to describe human society and its ends. Thus, Edmund Burke exposed the shallowness of the theorists of the French Revolution by describing the human realities that their idea of a social contract would have to encompass.
Society is, indeed, a contract…but the state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties…It is a partnership in all science, a partnership in all art, a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection. As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born. Each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great primeval contract of eternal society, linking the lower with the higher natures, connecting the visible and invisible world.
Burke took the language of the social contract and made a covenant of it. In contrast to the image of a contract, the idea of a covenant suggests something deeper and more enduring. If property and individual autonomy is the point, then the idea of a contract is adequate to describe society and the state. But if people in their full flourishing are the point, this directs us toward something communal and intergenerational that may be described using the language of covenant.
We may envision our society as a covenant in which the practice of liberal government is a part of attaining both the common good and the individual goods that are inseparable from it. This covenant liberalism is the preservation and renewal of a patrimony, not the implementation of universal and impersonal principles or philosophy. It is an inheritance whose habits are not readily adaptable to all times and places.
Covenant liberalism is not dependent on liberal ideology, which came later than liberal practice. Liberal practices and instructions such as representative government and trial by jury do not require ideological liberalism; indeed, they developed in communal societies. Covenants and Liberal Practices
Communal ideas are part of the American tradition and were dominant during the Founding era. As Barry Alan Shain has put it , for Americans at the time of the War for Independence, “Individual autonomy, as it is understood today, would have been viewed as inconsistent with human flourishing—in face, it would have been seen as a form of sinful degeneration.”
The idea of a covenant does have religious overtones, including specific theological meanings that have influenced American political history. However, the point of reintroducing the language of a covenant is not to reestablish a Puritan political theory or to support mistaken notions of the country as a Christian nation. Rather, it offers a communal basis for liberal practices, which do not require the atomistic theories of liberal ideology.
Covenant liberalism recognizes that the good of individuals is dependent on and participatory in the common good. Human flourishing and fulfillment require community, not atomistic individualism. If liberal ideology demands policies that are destructive to families and communities, then so much the worse for liberal ideology. Free commerce, for instance, is an instrumental, rather than an intrinsic good. Markets are useful, not sacred.
Political liberalism does not need to be replaced by neo-feudalism, or worldwide Catholic monarchy, or some other unlikely alternative, which is why critics of liberalism are not proposing such. What liberalism does need is to be renewed as a practice ordered toward human flourishing in family and community, rather than a dogmatic ideology premised upon a mutilated vision of the human person as autonomous and sovereign.

"From Occupy To AOC: The Rise Of The New Progressives, Part 3",thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/from-occupy-to-aoc-the-rise-of-the-new-progressives-part-3/,"By David Marcus June 5, 2019
This is part three in a three-part series. Parts one and two can be read here and here . Entering The Halls Of Power
On January 21, 2017 Donald Trump woke up as president of the United States for the first time. In those morning hours, hundreds of thousands of protesters were making their way to Washington DC for the most significant protest since Occupy Wall Street, which had occurred roughly five years earlier. Donning pink p-ssy hats and dedicated to overthrowing the patriarchy, and Trump, the Women’s March took to the streets.
At the time it was presented as an organic outpouring of anti-Trump emotion. But we now know that it was not only carefully organized, but that the New Progressives were the march’s driving force and leadership. Its manifesto, among other things, promised intersectionality, and to break down systems of oppression.
Suddenly these concepts once limited to a few thousand in Zuccotti Park were being marched on by hundreds of thousands. That is not to say that all of these women and men supported the entire far-left agenda of the Women’s March. Rather, Trump’s election provided the New Progressives the opportunity to cast themselves as his opposite, and if Trump was the ultimate evil, that made them the ultimate good.
Indeed, even the Women’s March itself was accused of insufficient wokeness, as illustrated by a Washington Post headline just three days later that asked, “Was the Women’s March just another display of white privilege? Some think so.”
The irony of this is that the organizers, people like Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour, had pushed the march’s manifesto and goals so far left of center using the exactly the same justification as was used for the Occupy General Assembly’s progressive stack: the most marginalized must lead, white women were to take a back seat and listen. Just as with Occupy Wall Street, there was, at best, antipathy towards Israel, and at worst outright anti-Semitism.
The New Progressives finally had what they needed: an archvillain, an enemy to loathe and disdain, a crisis supposedly so deadly and vital that centrist and moderate approaches were insufficient to meet it. If they could summon half a million people to the nation’s capitol and hundreds of thousands more across the country and even globe, then why couldn’t they marshal that support to elect candidates who embodied the Occupy agenda? That is exactly what they set out to do. From Protests to Politics
Two days after the Women’s March, a new political action committee was created, named Justice Democrats. Among its leadership were Cenk Uyger of the Young Turks, a regular at Occupy Wall Street, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who helped develop the most powerful voice to date for the movement. The goals were ambitious: to find candidates for as many congressional seats as possible who shared their political philosophy, one which a mere six years earlier would have seemed laughably out of touch with American values and the will of the American people.
Meanwhile, the badly wounded and embarrassed Democratic Party establishment was engaged in exactly the kind of postmortem that the Republican Party engaged in after Mitt Romney lost in 2012. How on earth had they managed to lose to Donald Trump? The results of both postmortems were remarkably similar. While the 2013 GOP assumed they needed to appeal to more minority voters, the 2017 Democrats landed on the idea that they had failed to appeal to the white working class, and had thereby lost key Rust Belt swing states. The New Progressives did not share this opinion.
Over the next two years of the Trump administration, the level of division and vitriol in the country reached a fever pitch. Commentators on both sides openly spoke of the possibility of civil war. Columns in the progressives press abounded about not dating, or even being friends with, those who support Trump. On the right, many took the attitude that those who opposed Trump were dangerous traitors hell- bent on destroying America.
A new culture war was beginning, not just in the United States but also in the English-speaking world. The American New Progressives and their international counterparts amped up their de-platforming of conservative voices, their boycotts, and claims that some speech is literally violence. In response grew the not-quite-conservative Intellectual Dark Web, spearheaded by an Australian outlet called Quillette and thinkers like Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin. In large part, this counter movement existed to protect intellectualism, and particularly the academy, from the illiberal excesses of the New Progressives.
So removed from any national political power were the Democrats that economic issues took a back seat. Yet from the earliest days of the Trump administration, and even up until now, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, champions of the Occupy economic policies, were already top contenders to try to take down Trump. But as I laid out in part two, they only satisfied the two economic planks, a focus on income inequality, and anti-corporatism, but not intersectionality. It would take new leaders to embody all three of Occupy’s core positions. Such leaders were about to emerge. AOC Comes On the Scene
New York Rep. Joe Crowley, affectionately known as the “king of Queens,” was the picture-perfect image of the establishment Democrat. He was the party’s number-three ranking member, thought of as a possible successor for leadership after then minority leader Nancy Pelosi’s tenure ended. But something happened on the way there. More exactly, someone happened. Out of nowhere, it seemed, a 28-year-old Latina bartender shocked the nation by defeating Crowley in the 2018 primary. The nation was introduced to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
AOC, as she is now known, did not come out of nowhere. She came out of the Justice Democrats PAC that was formed days after Trump’s inauguration. Chakrabarti, her current chief of staff, was a leading force behind her candidacy. Ocasio-Cortez immediately became a superstar in the Democratic Party, and when the Democrats swept into the House after their 2018 midterm victories, she, along with Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who are also aligned with Justice Democrats, became the face of the victory: young women of color speaking truth to Trump’s power.
In a mere six years, the New Progressives had gone from a small encampment in lower Manhattan to seating congresswomen. But the telegenic, witty, and Twitter-savvy AOC, while supporting the Occupy agenda down the line, added a new and important twist. A laser focus on climate change as the animating principle of the movement.
At Occupy, the environment was a subsidiary issue to capitalism, since once capitalism was defeated, it was assumed better environmental practices would ensue. Ocasio-Cortez saw that as exactly backwards. In her version, climate change, which she claims we have only 12 years to solve before the world is doomed, is the catalyst for anti-capitalism and anti-corporatism. Trump had Flight 93; AOC has threats of an apocalypse if the New Progressives’ agenda is not adopted.
We see this at work her Green New Deal, which is more New Deal than green. Her proposal requires government takeover of huge swaths of the private sector and control of American citizens’ choices. Not, as was argued by Occupy, because it is the moral and just thing to do, but because if we don’t the world will be destroyed.
The giveaway is that the Green New Deal does not include nuclear energy, the simplest and cleanest way to reduce carbon emissions. Nuclear’s absence has nothing to do with fear of meltdowns and everything to with the fact that it does not require the state to assert greater control over corporations and people’s lives. Establishment Buyer’s Remorse
In the immediate aftermath of the 2018 midterms, the Democratic Establishment was pleased as punch to bask in the narrative of their New Progressive superstars. Pelosi graced a magazine cover with them. They surely assumed that Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, and Omar would electrify the progressive base, but also be good members of the caucus loyal to leadership. This was a bad misjudgment.
Very quickly, fault lines emerged. When House leadership learned Justice Democrats were targeting more Democrats including possibly Hakeem Jeffries, the second leading black member of the caucus, the establishment started to get the idea that the New Progressives are not exactly on their team.
While AOC and her bombastic Twitter feed that rivals Trump’s was sucking all the oxygen out of the party, Omar engaged in a series of anti-Semitic comments that left leadership between a progressive rock and a mainstream hard place. Meanwhile the early contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination were chomping at the bit to embrace New Progressive policies like the Green New Deal and dazzle with acts of performative wokeness.
These candidates and much of the news media assumed the New Progressives are not only the zeitgeist of the party, but that they truly represent the views of large swaths of the Democratic Party. For months were heard questions on cable news about whether Democrats were willing to vote for a white man when clearly the energy of the party was directed at women, particularly women of color.
Then the polls started to come out. Lo and behold, most of the top candidates have consistently been white men. Not only that, the white man with a consistent and commanding lead was Joe Biden. Uncle Joe, the oldest of old-school Democrats, is basically the antithesis of the New Progressives. One can almost imagine him patting them on the head and, to paraphrase Pelosi, complimenting their “enthusiasm.” The Future of the New Progressives
By any standard, the rise of the New Progressives is an impressive one. In seven years, with the help of a fawning media they have moved from a rag tag, although well-organized and -funded, encampment in the shadow of Wall Street to a major force helping shape Democratic Party politics. They have changed the way many Americans think about socialism, free speech, race relations, and the sexes.
Their political successes thus far, while impressive, have been limited to deep blue enclaves, but their cultural impact has been much larger. While more Democrats seem to support the Biden version of the party today than theirs, youth is on their side. At 29, Ocasio-Cortez could be in Congress and the national spotlight for the next half-century.
Justice Democrats continues to hunt for vulnerable moderate Democrats to primary and replace with their own, and they have strong support in major cultural power centers such as Hollywood and the academy. Even if their actual constituency of voters is relatively small and limited to certain densely populated areas, their broader impact is being felt in every corner of American politics and culture.
Regarding the short-term prospects of the New Progressives, much depends upon outcome of the 2020 presidential election. It is possible, even likely, that the best outcome for them would be a Trump victory, especially against a moderate like Biden. It was, after all, Trump’s win in 2016 that helped transform them from a protest movement into a legitimate political faction.
In November 2011, Occupy Wall Street died, scattered into the streets of lower Manhattan. But it didn’t end there. What seemed like a fabulous burn-out was in fact the start of a political and social movement that America will be dealing with for a long time to come.
Although they are easy for conservatives to mock, the New Progressives should be taken deadly seriously. While the right maintains political and judicial power, the values and ideas of New Progressives are increasingly the ones we see on our screens and stages, in the pages of our newspapers and in the classrooms of our colleges.
Their three-legged stool of intersectionality, redistribution of wealth, and anti-corporatism is sturdy. They are a force, for better or worse, that conservatives will have to contend with, and for now, they appear strong in their effort to permanently recast and reshape the very idea of America.

Pete Buttigieg Has Nothing To Recommend Him Except Identity Politics,thefederalist.com,Benjamin Horvath,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/pete-buttigieg-nothing-recommend-except-identity-politics/,"By Benjamin Horvath June 5, 2019
South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has caught the short attention span of national media, in large part because he is the candidate who checks “intersectional” boxes. I’m a lifetime resident of South Bend, so have been observing Buttigieg’s activities more closely and for a longer time than most. He is young, gay, a critic of President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, an Ivy League academic, and hails from an area of the country Democrats desperately need to win to regain control of the White House.
Of course, MSNBC has fallen to the charms of Buttigieg. He has earned the praise of even some personalities at Fox News, as he labels himself a blue-collar Democrat from the Rust Belt. To prove just how blue-collar the polylinguist is, he rolls up his sleeves to answer softball questions from Washington Post and New York Times reporters.
Buttigieg’s schtick has been to maximize the media’s collective adoration of him, playing into those statuses that automatically earn one points along the intersectional chart. He frequently notes his dissimilarity with President Trump, although his entire career has been characterized by notching credentials within the identity politics hierarchy his party’s egalitarian sensibilities supposedly promote.
Part of his well-worn sales pitch is to bill himself a mayor in the heart of Trump Country, although anyone with access to the Internet can quickly see South Bend lies in the heart of St. Joseph County, one of the four counties in the state Hillary Clinton won in 2016.
It is true Buttigieg carried more than 80 percent of the popular vote in his 2015 re-election, but did so with about 8,000 votes total. Keep in mind this is a city with more than 100,000 residents. For a candidate who has campaigned on expanding the influence of the popular vote, he was unable to mobilize anywhere near 50 percent voter participation in his own city .
Also part of this schtick is to label himself a foil to Pence, a supposed bogeyman of LGBT people. Buttigieg announced his sexual orientation a few months before his re-election bid, just after huge public backlash to then-governor Pence’s signing of a statewide religious liberty law (that Pence quickly reversed). It was also right before the Supreme Court’s landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which legalized same-sex marriage across all 50 states.
Buttigieg speaks of the public announcement of his sexual orientation as if it were politically risky. One has to be naïve or ignorant of American politics to believe there was anything but upside to be gained by this timely announcement.
The timing of his announcement allowed for a prepackaged media narrative: gay mayor wins landslide reelection in Pence’s deep-red Indiana. Predictably, the media has run with this narrative, with nary a mention that a Republican hasn’t won a mayor’s race in this city since Richard Nixon was elected president.
Buttigieg has also touted a so-called recovery for South Bend since his election to the mayor’s office. Some positive things have happened while he has been in office, but this phantom boom has largely come as the result of a few wealthy developers, plus visible Band-Aids over the city designed to boost his credentials for a national election.
For example, the city’s per-capita gross domestic product has failed to change in the past six years, according to a recent study conducted by a Ball State University economics professor. Downtown remains lined with impoverished folks (many of whom are African American) and abandoned buildings where businesses used to thrive.
That study also ironically notes that the city’s growth has come due to investments made during Pence’s Regional Cities Initiative as Indiana governor. In return, Buttigieg has attacked Pence to score political points despite once maintaining an amicable working relationship with him.
Luxury apartments are being constructed in downtown South Bend, ranging from a whopping $1,200 to nearly $2,200 monthly. Recent plans for a grocery store in the downtown have stalled despite significant city involvement.
The mayor is certainly limited in his power to curb certain statistical trends, but since he has so proudly taken credit for the positives that have happened on his watch, the warts that remain on the community should also be given attention during his run.
People are three times more likely to be a victim of violent crime in South Bend, more than two times more likely to be victim of rape, well more than three times more likely to be robbed, and well more than two times more likely to be assaulted, when compared to the national average. All of these statistics more than double the statewide rate in Indiana.
Buttigieg has largely been propped up by the national media because he checks certain boxes that make him an exciting candidate to those who care more about identity politics than political achievement. There is no indication this will translate into sound public policy as president, and thankfully we won’t have to find out.
Although he plays the role of blue-collar moderate, Buttigieg is squarely within the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. He recently advocated for abortion as a fundamental right at any stage of a pregnancy. He has advocated for abolishing the Electoral College. And, in the vein of old-school progressivism, he has proposed depoliticizing the Supreme Court nomination process by expanding its number of justices.
Buttigieg’s candidacy is largely a product of the American left’s continued obsession with identity politics. Substantively, the mayor has put forward a blasé policy platform (radical, which is to say in line with today’s Democrat Party). His early success satisfies a certain itch for the national media, while he runs an otherwise unimpressive campaign based on an increasingly hackneyed, misleading sales pitch.

The 30th Anniversary of Tiananmen Square Reminds Us Of How Far China Has to Go,thefederalist.com,Paulina Enck,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/the-30th-anniversary-of-tiananmen-square-reminds-us-of-how-far-china-has-to-go/,"June 5, 2019 By Paulina Enck
Bipartisan support amassed on the capital lawn on June 4, 2019, in a rally to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen Square, organized by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. Survivors of the 1989 protest, activists, and members of Congress joined forces to pay tribute to those who died in the fight for democracy in China, and to call the United States into action. The message of the event was clear: despite increasing economic liberalization, China’s oppressive regime shows no signs of slowing its authoritarian tactics.
The Communism Memorial Foundation awarded its annual Reagan-Truman Medal of Freedom to the Tiananmen Mothers, a democracy activist group comprised of friends and families of 125 of the students killed in the protests, dedicated to spreading the truth about June 4 and dispelling the government’s false narratives. The Tiananmen Mothers were unable to travel to the United States, so Mi Ling Tsui, the communications director for Human Rights in China, accepted the award.
Tsui called for justice for those killed in the June 4 massacre and honored the work done by the Tiananmen Mothers. “They have refused to accept a state-enforced amnesia,” Tsui said, “to document the dead, to gather evidence of the crimes committed against unarmed civilians simply for exercising their fundamental rights to assemble, and to express their aspirations for a cleaner government and a better China.”
Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Andy Levin (D-MI), Chris Smith (R-NJ), and Jim McGovern (D-MA) spoke to celebrate the unveiling of a statue of “Tank Man,” the unknown protestor who bravely stood in front of a row of tanks that day. He is immortalized in a photo that serves as a rallying cry for defiance against tyranny, even as his fate is still unknown. Levin recalled his personal experiences at the protests, witnessing the bravery of the Chinese students and the bloody suppression by the government.
Since the protest, human rights in China have only regressed. Between one and three million Uighurs and Kazakhs toil in labor camps in China, where they and members of the Falun Gong are subjected to brutal executions via live organ-harvesting, for the profit of the government. Religious groups, from Uighur Muslims to Tibetan Buddhists to Christian groups, are being aggressively suppressed and persecuted, from forced apostasies to imprisonment.
The Chinese government uses technological advancements to increase scrutiny and surveillance on their citizens, from aggressive Internet censorship to mass surveillance of the citizenry through nearly 200 million security cameras, some of which include facial recognition software. The government imprisons activists and dissidents with alarming frequency, brutalizing the human rights of freedom of speech and assembly. Forced abortions, considered a crime against humanity in the Nuremberg Trials, have reached an unprecedented rate.
While the rest of the world takes time to remember the dead and their sacrifices, the Chinese government refuses to acknowledge the existence of the massacre 30 years ago. China’s human rights abuses show no signs of slowing down, even with the increased economic liberalization.
However, the rally carried through it a ray of hope. As many speakers noted, China’s hyper-aggressive suppression of dissidence is not a sign of the government’s strength, but of its fear. Such totalitarianism cannot last forever against cries for the inalienable rights and liberties that the Chinese people have too long been denied.
Smith said, “Someday, China will be free. And they will look back at the heroes of Tiananmen Square, and they will know why that freedom cost so much, but was well worth that price.” Paulina Enck is an intern at the Federalist. Photo"
‘Always Be My Maybe’ Breathes Life Into The Gasping Rom-Com Genre,thefederalist.com,Ellie Bufkin,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/always-maybe-breathes-life-gasping-rom-com-genre/,"June 5, 2019 By Ellie Bufkin
Once a safe bet for date nights, girls’ nights out, and sleepovers, romantic comedies have become an unreliable genre. So often, modern film romance is replaced with raunchy sexuality and many comedic movies demand a level of shock that is far from the subtle wit of their predecessors.
Most modern-day romantic comedies have shed nearly all of their glamour and sentiment in exchange for box office appeal that depends on nudity and gross-out humor, far from the Carole Lombard-helmed screwball comedies of the 1930s or the sophisticated romances of Audrey Hepburn in the 1960s. Today, most rom-coms are terrible movies, and that’s too bad.
Occasionally, however, a little film comes along and sparks hope that this once-enchanting genre could be on the upswing again. “Always Be My Maybe,” a Netflix original film, offers us this little sparkle of hope. Written by and starring comedians Ali Wong and Randall Park, “Always Be My Maybe” is at once charming and funny, leaving nearly all of the raunch and shock on the cutting room floor.
The movie tells the tale of celebrity chef Sasha Tran falling back in love with her first crush and former best friend, Marcus Kim. Fans of Wong’s comedy will instantly recognize the imprint of her observational style in the way the characters interact with one another. There’s a candid nature to Wong, and therefore to Sasha, that seems to make comedy easy. Sasha, like Wong’s comedy persona, is simultaneously overly confident and brutally unassured.
Park, known best for his TV roles on “Fresh off the Boat” and “Veep,” has a spectacularly likable quality. Even in his role on “Veep,” where he played an arrogant albeit aloof antagonist as Governor Chung, it’s impossible not to root for him. As Marcus Kim in “Always Be My Maybe,” Park creates a guy who manages to play the straight, reasonable character while playing in a rap and rock band called “Hello Peril” and having weed-smoking dance parties with his elderly father.
Longtime real-life friends, Wong and Park developed the story of Sasha and Marcus based on several instances of their own lives. There is an authenticity to their characters’ longtime friendship and camaraderie but also to their occasional awkwardness. The film is not a belly-buster from start to finish, but there are plenty of laughs and one pretty epic cameo by Keanu Reeves playing an explosive version of himself you can only hope is at least partially true.
The relationship of Sasha and Marcus is relatable, fun, and highly enjoyable. The characters come together in a cringe-free, satisfying way, and they make the viewer want it for them. The movie is also unexpectedly touching, drawing from the characters’ complicated and sometimes tragic pasts.
The jokes do at times seem afraid to offend an ever-alert wokeness patrol. For instance, a supporting character friend of Sasha’s is having a “gender fluid” baby, about which Sasha almost makes a joke, but the laugh seems to shrivel awkwardly out of the scene before it hurts anyone’s feelings. Sadly, this is not a unique affliction in the world of modern comedy.
Making a great romantic comedy is no easy task. True classics like “Bringing up Baby,” “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” “Notting Hill,” and “When Harry Met Sally” are nuanced movies with great cast chemistry, fantastic scripts, and solid comedic timing. The elements have to come together perfectly, or the entire film falls apart.

Trump’s Promising New Space Plan Won’t Work Without Cutting The Pork,thefederalist.com,Robert Zimmerman,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/trumps-promising-new-space-plan-wont-work-without-cutting-pork/,"By Robert Zimmerman June 5, 2019
Two weeks ago, the Trump administration released a detailed description of its plan for getting American astronauts to the Moon by 2024. The program, now dubbed Artemis, incorporates the already funded first two launches of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule, presently scheduled for 2020 and 2022 respectively.
The Trump plan, however, does a great deal more, including a strategic reshaping of the proposed manned program that NASA has been pushing since 2017. That plan had called for constructing a space station to the Moon, dubbed the Lunar Gateway. Nearly every subsequent SLS mission through the 2030s was to focus on its construction and subsequent periodic occupancy.
Many expressed opposition to the Gateway project. It was called a wasteful and an unfocused boondoggle , designed to fund NASA’s big space contractors (Boeing and Lockheed Martin) while taking far too long to accomplish much too little. Worse, as designed, it would have frozen the United States in lunar orbit as we watched other countries land on the surface and build bases on the best lunar real estate which our own lunar probes had identified in the first place. Trump’s Plan to Return to the Moon Is a Big Improvement
However, as was unveiled during the May 22 meeting of the National Space Council, Trump’s lunar proposal signals a major rejection of NASA’s boondoggle.
First and most importantly, the Trump administration has dumped Gateway as the major focus of our lunar ambitions, limiting it to its “absolutely minimum configuration” during the program’s first half-decade. While it will still have a habitable module, its focus will no longer be to have astronauts live there for any long period. Instead, it will serve as a rendezvous outpost where missions going to the Moon can meet and assemble.
The Trump administration has also shifted the focus of Artemis from a project built entirely by NASA, with minimal help from private companies, to one that includes a significant component of privately built rockets and spacecraft. Rather than depend almost entirely on SLS, the Trump administration will use both SLS and private rockets—dubbed by NASA as “Commercial Launch Vehicles” or CLVs.
The administration has made it clear that if SLS cannot meet its scheduled launch dates they will consider shifting to private companies entirely. Competition is built into the program’s fundamental structure. America Cannot Afford to Fall Behind in Space
If the United States wishes to maintain its place as the world’s leading superpower, it is essential we participate in the coming effort to explore and colonize the solar system. The Chinese, Russians, Indians, and the Europeans all have programs that aim to land and establish manned bases on the Moon. These nations, as well as others, are also preparing to establish unmanned planetary programs to explore Mars and other bodies in the solar system.
I like to call this international effort the new colonial movement, comparable to the European “scramble for Africa” in the 1800s, but without any local populations to conquer. There is a political vacuum in space, and every nation in the world wishes to fill it. The United States must meet this challenge and do the same. As John F. Kennedy said, “We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share.” Unfortunately, NASA’s Recent History Isn’t Great
So, how to do we do it? Is the Trump proposal the right approach? A primary issue is funding. While Congress has provided the funds for those first two Artemis launches in 2020 and 2022, no funds have been provided for any further flights. In recent House hearings about the project, Democrats expressed significant skepticism. Some voiced outright opposition.
While it’s possible that this opposition stems from the same knee-jerk Democratic resistance to every Trump proposal, I think there is more to it. For the past 30 years, NASA’s track record on big projects has been terrible. Few have been finished on time and on schedule. As revealed in a Government Accountability Office report released last week , this track record has only gotten worse in recent years.
In fact, we need only look at SLS/Orion to see this. The concept was proposed by George W. Bush in 2004, with a goal of reaching the Moon by 2015. Instead, NASA won’t get its first manned SLS/Orion launch off any earlier than 2022, with a total cost exceeding $43 billion.
To repeat: It will have taken NASA 18 years and $43 billion to launch a single manned mission. We fought and won both World Wars in less time. It’s, therefore, no surprise that some in Congress are skeptical of the Trump Moon proposal. NASA’s track record certainly does not inspire confidence. Plans Are Still Too Vague and Undefined
There are other worrisome aspects of NASA’s proposal. To meet Trump’s 2024 deadline, NASA has truncated its schedule to only one preliminary test flight. None are currently planned for its unbuilt lunar lander.
A plan like this would have been unacceptable to NASA’s engineers and management in the 1960s. Back during the Apollo years, NASA required a series of at least four preliminary missions leading up to any lunar landing, as well as testing the Apollo capsule and the lunar lander both in Earth and lunar orbit. Only then would they consider sending men to the moon’s surface.
Addition concerns arise out of the vagueness of the Artemis’s future following the planned 2024 lunar landing. On NASA’s Artemis webpage, the description of the goals and plans for each SLS launch post-2024 is disturbingly undefined: “NASA’s Space Launch System will send Orion and its crew to lunar orbit, where astronauts will conduct expeditions aboard the Gateway and on the lunar surface.”
In other words, neither NASA nor the Trump administration has any idea what they will do on the Moon beyond that 2024 landing. Regrettably, this sort of vagueness has been a hallmark of every presidential space proposal of the past half century. Since Kennedy’s 1961 speech committing us to a lunar landing before 1970, almost every president has wanted his own “Kennedy moment”—a space project fervently declaring our intention to go “somewhere” in space by some deadline.
In every case, those presidential declarations have failed. Instead, they all turned out to be expensive boondoggles. They’ve been very successful in funneling pork to congressional districts and giving the politicians who back them nice photo-ops—all while getting us nowhere in space.
This is probably the worst aspect of the president’s pitch. Its dependence on pork (SLS/Orion) and political opportunism (a lunar landing before the end of Trump’s second term) means it will almost certainly not get us to the Moon or Mars, despite NASA’s claims. Like all the past NASA manned projects since Apollo, it will do nothing but spend a lot of money. Private Companies Should Take a Central Role
One portion of Trump’s proposal, however, is very laudable: the administration’s decision to increase the participation of the private sector in Artemis. If made the centerpiece of the program, hiring private companies to do much of what needs to be done would accomplish all the goals this nation requires in space faster and cheaper than NASA.
For example, last week NASA announced that it is buying three privately built unmanned lunar landers to get its science payloads to the Moon. The expected total cost for all three missions—$253.5 million—is far less than what NASA expected to spend for its own (now canceled ) Resource Prospector lander. Additionally, these new contracts will put landers at three lunar locations, not one.
Most importantly, by having NASA act as a customer instead of the builder, the Trump administration has helped jumpstart an entirely new industry of private companies building planetary probes. Using private rockets rather than the government-owned SLS stimulates the private rocket industry and promotes competition, innovation, and efficiency. Just as the competition fostered by SpaceX significantly lowered launch costs, this scheme should help save taxpayers a lot of money.
If President Trump wants our nation to be a dominant player in the coming exploration of the solar system, he should start by dumping the government pork (SLS). Following that, as many individual American citizens and private companies as possible should be encouraged to contribute to space exploration. Rather than make his effort a government “program” run and built by government bureaucrats, Trump needs to foster a creative and vibrant space-faring industry; one that is competitive, innovative, and privately owned. If he can do that, the stars will be ours. Robert Zimmerman is an award-winning space historian and space journalist.

Warren Says Combating Climate Change Is 'A Bigger Challenge Than WWII',thefederalist.com,Susanna Hoffman,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/warren-says-combating-climate-change-is-a-bigger-challenge-than-wwii/,"June 5, 2019 By Susanna Hoffman
At a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan, on Tuesday, 2020 Democrat presidential candidate and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that climate change is an even bigger challenge than World War II.
“America has faced huge challenges before, WWII and putting a man on the moon,” Warren said. “This environmental catastrophe bearing down on us may be the biggest challenge yet.”
Warren’s disconcerting comparison to WWII must mean her plans to prevent climate change are drastic indeed. To handle this global threat, Warren weirdly implies we must have to mobilize a greater American industrial base than was in place during WWII, as well as more scientific innovation and resources than required to put a man on the moon.
This is Warren’s pitch for her Green Manufacturing Plan , which is part of her commitment to the Green New Deal that Democrats across the board have pledged to support. According to her website, Warren is looking at a 10-year plan to invest $2 trillion into an expected $23 trillion market for clean energy technology. This investment will help us “achieve the ambitious targets of the Green New Deal,” Warren wrote on her website.
The Green New Deal—that’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s call to eliminate farting cows . Fellow presidential hopeful Joe Biden and Warren have signed on to this deal by aligning their climate change plans with its goal: zero net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050.
The first element of Warren’s plan requires $400 billion to create a National Institutes of Clean Energy, modeled after the National Institutes of Health. This funding will enable expansion for research and development programs that convert innovation into production, her website says, all of which will boost the economy. At the same time, Warren’s plan calls for a drastic increase in corporate taxes to reach the goal of zero emissions.
The second element—the Green Industrial Mobilization—models the innovations in WWII that created an economic surge for decades. This element includes government-regulated requirements for manufactured goods and materials to be energy-efficient and environment-safe, plus a $15 per hour minimum wage for employees and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.
The third element of Warren’s plan is the Green Marshall Plan, modeled after the Marshall Plan issued in 1948 by Secretary of State George C. Marshall, aimed at rebuilding post-WWII Europe. Warren’s attempt to compare her impossible save-the-world mission to Marshall’s efforts to rebuild lives and homes after utter desolation and horror is embarrassing.
An effort to eliminate global warming in just a decade with mind-boggling expenses in the U.S. is inconceivable. If America must take such extreme and expensive measures, how can we expect countries like China and Saudi Arabia to eliminate their contributions to global warming?
Warren is wrong to compare this challenge to World War II. This insanely expensive agenda that Democrats are pushing is based on improbable climate change scenarios, not a unifying, nationwide effort to fight for Western freedom and values in the face of the totalitarian state of Nazi Germany.

Not to mention that Kirsten Gillibrand has not only actively pushed to eliminate the Hyde Amendment, but also to codify the Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade . Pete Buttigieg and Gillibrand found a common thread when discussing abortion rights. They both believe that repealing the amendment would not suffice to help “women’s rights.”
Buttigieg and Gillibrand announced plans to litmus test their potential Supreme Court nominees to ensure that their picks would uphold Roe v. Wade . Ideal Supreme Court justices “are those who share my view that freedom includes freedom to make decisions about your whole body,” Buttigieg told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews.
What about front-runner Joe Biden? He reaffirmed his support for the Hyde Amendment after telling an American Civil Liberties Union member just one month ago that he was planning to appeal it. Our volunteer Nina asked Joe Biden whether, as president, he would lift the Hyde amendment, which bans federal insurance coverage of abortion.

In the video posted May 8, Biden promises to repeal the Hyde Amendment and bragged about his perfect voting record with the ACLU.
ACLU voter: “I’m an ACLU Rights For All voter and I have one quick question for you. And that is, will you commit to abolishing the Hyde Amendment which hurts poor women and women of color?”
Biden: “Yes… Right now it has to be, it can’t stay.”
However, on June 5, Biden’s campaign team told NBC News that he supports the Hyde Amendment. As a senator, Biden consistently voted for a federal ban on partial-birth abortion and voted against the “ Freedom of Choice Act .”
Biden claims his abortion views are “middle of the road.” However, to many on the far-left, middle of the road isn’t going to cut it on the road to the Democratic nomination.

Border Crisis Deepens: More Than 144K Arrested Last Month,thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/05/border-crisis-deepens-144k-arrested-last-month/,"June 5, 2019 By John Daniel Davidson
U.S. Customs and Border Protections on Wednesday released its numbers for May , and they are shocking. Border Patrol apprehended or turned away more than 144,000 people last month on the southwest border, including more than 100,000 families and children.
That exceeds by 32 percent the total for April, which had represented the highest number of monthly apprehensions since 2007. Over the past eight months, CBP has detained more than 680,000 illegal immigrants—or, as acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders put it, “more than the population of Miami.”
Far from historically low levels of illegal immigration , we’re on pace now to reach the record-high levels that were common in the early 2000s, when annual apprehensions often exceeded 1 million. Border Patrol officials told reporters Wednesday that if the levels remain the same for the last four months of the fiscal year, the agency will surpass all apprehension totals since 2006. Arrests on the southwest border peaked at 1.6 million in 2000. In May of that year, there were 166,296 apprehensions .
Here’s what the CBP chart looks like now. The red line at the top is this fiscal year.
A chart from the Washington Post puts the latest figures in a broader context, comparing the May figures to monthly totals going back to 2000.
The May figures represent a dramatic increase from 2017 and 2018, when border arrests were at a half-century low. Apprehensions on the southwest border just for March, April, and May of this year, for example, far exceed the total for all of 2017.
There’s no sign that this surge is letting up. Last week, a group of more than 1,000 migrants—by far the largest single group Border Patrol has ever encountered—crossed the Rio Grande in El Paso and surrendered to U.S. authorities. On average, Border Patrol apprehended more than 4,200 people a day last month.
Federal immigration officials have been warning that the border is “at the breaking point” for months now. Federal facilities are at or beyond capacity, as are shelters run by private charities up and down the border.
President Trump, frustrated by the ongoing border crisis, has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican imports if Mexico doesn’t do more to stem the flow of illegal immigration. Vice President Mike Pence and other administration officials were set to meet with Mexico’s top diplomat Wednesday to discuss the crisis.
The initial headline on this story listed the number of total arrested plus those turned away from ports of entry, rather than solely those arrested, as the headline states. The error has been corrected."
'Cribsheet' Takes The Air Out Of Inflated Parenting Worries,thefederalist.com,Liz Wolfe,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/06/cribsheet-takes-air-inflated-parenting-worries-can-enjoy-kids/,"By Liz Wolfe June 6, 2019
In a world full of well-meaning but paternalistic people and governments telling you they know what’s best for you, Emily Oster’s delightful second book “Cribsheet” tries not to steer parents toward a particular conclusion as to what’s best for their kids. Without a sense of every parent’s values, priorities, and risk tolerance, it would be a fool’s errand to try to dictate how someone chooses to parent.
Like her first book, the pregnancy-focused not-so-cult-classic “Expecting Better,” this one dismantles myths and pokes holes in junk science, centered on parenting for babies and toddlers ages 0 to 3. Oster creates a rare breed of books: parenting books that tackle most major, contentious topics, providing actionable help, but also teach the reader how to better interpret data on her own, without taking too much time from busy new parents or parents-to-be. The economist and mother of two might not have set out to create an army of data-savvy minions, but that might be a pleasant side effect of reading her books.
The core message is simple: much childrearing-related hysteria is not founded in fact, and too many relatively innocuous parenting decisions are made to seem cataclysmic, like if you mess them up, your child will be destined for unimaginable failure. Data-informed decision making that takes individual and family preferences into account restores autonomy to parents. The vast majority of parenting decisions, within reason, have minor pros and cons, but rarely sentence children to death or failure.
The book picks up right where the last left off, at labor and delivery. “Cribsheet” talks candidly about what to expect in the days and weeks after giving birth; what’s normal versus what should set off red flags. It gets into the bloody details that are so often skimmed over by much of our culture, which helps expectant mothers align their expectations with reality—mesh underwear is discussed (but not the sexy kind), as is passing blood clots.
Oster talks about some of the fright new parents feel when confronted with post-birth infant weight loss, as well as jaundice. She also goes into the pros and cons of circumcision and delayed cord clamping, which can be useful for staving off anemia.
The book then goes into decent depth about some of the big early parenting controversies sure to draw heated debate: breastfeeding vs. formula feeding, crib vs. co-sleeping, to vaccinate or not to vaccinate (as well as the merits, or lack thereof, for delayed schedules), and the “cry it out” method vs. different ways of sleep training (or the choice to not sleep train at all).
The breastfeeding chapter is especially interesting, as Oster spends plenty of time reminding the reader that mothers should do what is best for them; what works with their schedule, child, and budget. Oster talks about some of the absurd science that’s peddled—“one woman told me her doctor had told her that by quitting breastfeeding, she was costing her child three IQ points”—and, through a careful exploration of the relevant data, finds that the benefits of breastfeeding are often oversold.
The claims that breastfeeding lowers child obesity and increases IQ are not supported by evidence, but there is some evidence that shows reduced breast cancer risk for mothers who nursed their children. Who knew?
Oster’s chapter on working moms vs. stay-at-home moms feels like one of the book’s rare weaker parts since it leaves much to be desired, as does her chapter on nannies vs. daycare (instead of full-time care from a parent or other close family member). I’m not a mother yet, but those are the parts of parenting that I most worry and wonder about: how to balance dueling love of work with love of children, and what the data support in terms of how to allocate time, money, and resources to give them a good head start. Oster comes up a bit short here.
There are a few areas in which Oster finds the data to be fairly black and white—vaccines are generally safe and important, smoking during pregnancy is verboten for good reason, and SIDS risk can (and should) be easily reduced. Mostly, Oster supports a reasonably relaxed approach to parenting. There are plenty of decisions to be made, but often the effects of such decisions are exaggerated and used to spike new parents’ cortisol levels, making it harder for them to be the diligent-but-calm parent their young child really needs.
For interested parents, or nerdy people who like thinking about ways to apply the economist’s mindset to real life, the natural companion to “Cribsheet” should be fellow economist Bryan Caplan’s “Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids,” which dissects the all-consuming nature of modern parenting, and whether there’s a way to alter it.
Part of Caplan’s thesis involves attempting to parse out some of the factors that often dissuade people from having more kids—namely, that there are a lot of expectations placed on parents, and a lot of excess time, money, and worrying that can be cut out or at least slightly reduced. Caplan’s book suggests that the basic logic of economies of scale can be applied to family life, and that the marginal cost of each additional kid after the first few isn’t quite as high as people think.
Neither Caplan nor Oster preach neglect or tuning your kids out. Instead, they make having children (or, in Caplan’s case, having more children than you initially intended) seem both rewarding and approachable. Both have managed to sneakily strip away some of the scariness of it all, without being unrealistic about the inherently demanding nature of keeping children alive.
As with all major life decisions, there are costs and benefits to each parenting trade-off. But how sad that when it comes to parenting, so much of our popular discourse focuses on the costs, the fears, the things to avoid, and the expenses, not to mention the potential deadliness of nearly every facet of our world. Armed with well-vetted data, Oster reminds us all that there’s a wider range of possible arrangements to create happy kids than we might have initially thought possible.

"It's Not The Supreme Court's Job To End Trans Bathrooms, It's Yours - The Federalist",thefederalist.com,,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/06/not-supreme-courts-job-end-trans-bathrooms/,"By Rita Dunaway June 6, 2019
It’s always easier to complain about something than to improve it. Sometimes, it’s easier to persuade a court to reverse a bad policy than to do the citizen-work that produces good policy from the start. But people who want to govern themselves must reject such a lazy strategy.
Consider the issue of regulating school bathrooms. This was once a blissfully simple issue. Boys used the boys’ bathroom and locker rooms, and girls used theirs. But in our culture’s never-ending quest for a life unbounded by authority and unlimited by facts, children can now declare themselves to be whatever sex they want.
Some would have the world, school community included, bow to their feelings. Others know a line must be drawn. After all, if we let people self-identify as male or female, don’t we also have to let people declare themselves members of a minority race or a particular age?
Pity the public servants in the nation’s schools, who stand in the no man’s land of this bizarre culture war. School boards across the nation are struggling to sort out which type of policy is best for students. Or in some cases, they just want to know which type of policy will survive the inevitable legal challenge.
The law generally requires courts to err on the side of deference to a local school district’s decision. That is exactly what happened in the Pennsylvania case of Doe v. Boyertown Area School District . A group of high school students asked a court to bar their school from allowing transgender students to use the bathroom and locker room that fit their “gender identity” rather than their biological sex. The objecting students claimed that this policy violated their constitutional “right of privacy.”
The Federal District Court and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the students’ claim and, no surprise, deferred to the school district’s policy judgment. The courts found that even if the other students’ privacy was violated, the school had a “compelling” interest in avoiding the harm that might be caused to transgender students if they were required to use the facilities that matched their biology.
The plaintiff students asked the Supreme Court to overturn this decision, but last week the court declined to hear the case. So for now at least, students and families of Boyertown will have to live with the policy. As much as it pains me to say it, the courts were probably right to defer to the school on this one.
To be clear, the Boyertown policy is a bad policy. School policies—including bathroom policies—should be based on facts. The adults of our world should press children toward knowing and embracing truth, not bending reality to fit their desires. Those with the responsibility of teaching and mentoring children should nurture and protect inclinations toward modesty, not scoff at them.
But the right solution to this bad policy is better policy-making at the local level. In light of how divisive the issue is, it’s no wonder that many would look to a “landmark ruling” from the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve it. The trouble is, that’s not the high court’s job.
Conservatives generally recognize this. It’s why we lament the entire line of precedents built upon a “right of privacy” that allegedly includes a right to abortion and same-sex marriage. The job of the courts is to apply existing law to the particular facts of individual cases; it is not to re-invent the meaning of words to produce a result people want.
Because the courts have so often been willing to go beyond their proper role, we’ve been conditioned to expect them to do so when we can’t get what we want any other way. We take it for granted that the humdrum laws are made by state and local governments, Congress, or even some federal agency. But we’ve come to expect that all the most divisive, controversial issues—what most of the heated debates are about—will ultimately be decided by the courts.
This isn’t the way our government was designed to work. But there’s another problem, too. This latent “Let the courts sort it out” way of thinking effectively kills our motivation for civic engagement. Why should I bother to speak up at school board meetings if some federal court will make the final decision? Why bother finding out which candidates share my views (and voting for them)?
It’s time to stop looking to the courts to come to the rescue in our most pressing policy disagreements. For a self-governing people, the proper solution is much slower and more difficult. It requires us to engage in the messy process of showing up for elections, public discussions, and meetings, all while making a persuasive case for good policy from the start. Rita M.

It’s Time For Congress To Stop Stuffing Bills Full Of Unrelated Stuff,thefederalist.com,Ben Williams,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/06/time-congress-stop-stuffing-bills-full-completely-unrelated-stuff/,"By Ben Williams June 6, 2019
Reading through a summary of the Senate disaster relief bill that recently passed reinforced my long-held notion that there is a serious problem with the way Congress cobbles legislation together, a problem superior to and predating the current partisanship.
That notion got another buttressing during a trip my wife, Louann, and I took to Washington DC a couple of weeks ago. We had been asked to participate in the American Forest Foundation ’s “Hill Day” as landowner representatives from Florida. That “ask” resulted from us being selected as Florida’s Land Stewards for 2019 rather than for some special talent we have for lobbying or for our political connections, which are basically nonexistent.
We’d never before been to DC, never really wanted to go, and surely never desired to wander the halls and lobby. We were ill prepared for the experience. I didn’t even own a coat and tie.
Along with three other landowners from Florida, we were scheduled to visit the offices of our senators, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, and five of our representatives (Al Lawson, Ted Yoho, Neal Dunn, Daniel Webster, and John Rutherford). The other three landowners were heavily affected by Hurricane Michael. Two had the eye pass directly over their farm, so disaster relief for Michael was front and center during the few minutes we were allowed in each office.
Hurricanes battering Florida’s silviculture industry is obviously nothing new. Both Matthew and Irma rendered significant damage to standing timber and infrastructure on our farm. It took us nearly a year to repair culverts, roads, and low water crossings swamped by Irma in 2017.
Our timber losses from the two storms, which amounted to 10-12 percent in some of the more mature and thinned stands, were an unrecoverable loss. And the standing water left us with saturated ground that did not dry for months. This compounded the injury by making site prep and planting impossible, causing the loss of a growing season in stands that needed replanting.
As it cut its way through the Panhandle, Michael rendered not simple damage but devastation. Words cannot capture properly the changes that occurred in just a few hours along the core path from the Gulf up into Georgia.
The best I can do is to ask you to imagine the 2 million acres of timber in the primary zone as the grass in your front yard. Then imagine cutting that grass with a weed-eater, leaving everything just strewn about. But trees are not grass, nor grass clippings once on the ground. You can’t sweep or rake them right up and deposit them at the curb.
Also worth considering is that, unlike the grass which will need cutting again next week, those trees, many 20-80 years old and some old-growth forest, well, it’ll be the grandchildren of those there now who get to see trees like that again. For a real view, both visual and in dollars and cents, the Florida Forest Service has an assessment available online here .
Jim Karels, the director of the Florida Forest Service, was with us in Washington fleshing out the case for how bad it was. He also made clear some of the further consequences that could flow from damaged and down timber. This includes disease and insects, which may move from the hardest-hit areas into the less damaged, causing a second round of devastation. Then there will be the wildfires, as all that formerly standing timber has now become fuel on the ground.
One example of the compounding of the wildfire risk is here . We are now into the peak of Florida’s wildfire season.
These facts were not completely new to our legislators and their all-important staff as we went from office to office. In every instance you could see the understanding, hear an expressed willingness to support the disaster relief legislation when it came to a vote, and note their frustration at it not having happened yet. The understanding and expressed willingness to help was bipartisan, which was very encouraging.
What was not encouraging was that in every office some mention was made of “leadership,” both Democrat and Republican, and of “other issues” as the hold-up. That “hold-up” had been 200 days since Michael as we trooped from office to office. As I write this, it’s stretched more than another 30 days. What took so long?
More important is the question of why the bill contains what it does? It’s worth reading the Senate bill summary to get a feel for how tentatively, tangentially, and creatively some of what’s in it is tied together. (The bill itself will turn your brain inside out! )
Most of us can well see that dealing with wildfires in the West has little to do with and could easily have been addressed separate from typhoons in the Pacific, the Federal Flood Insurance Program, and Hurricane Michael. Then there is something that is not in the bill, but which could have been: funding for “The Wall.” While I agree with the idea of a wall , I see just as clearly that it should not be in there any more than some of what is in there.
The shabby statecraft being employed here is nothing new. The practice of tacking on amendments that are unrelated or only tangentially related to a bill with bipartisan support as a way to get a partisan measure passed is standard practice.
Our leaders are not such geniuses that they are the first to come up with the idea of attaching unrelated items onto a must-pass bill to get items with limited support approved. Nor are they so marvelously sneaky as to have devised a new means of passing legislation that allows them to choose which unrelated part of a bill they harp on as being for or against, to their own political gain, depending on the constituency they are pandering to. If there are enough parts, especially weakly related or unrelated to a piece of legislation, something in there will give cover when a vote is defended to a constituent.
This not only slows down many simple and necessary measures, but also leads to passing bits and pieces of legislation that would not have sufficient support if addressed individually. That this bloats the Federal Register and the national debt is a good bet also. Congress could address this structural and process problem if it wanted to, as the chambers have the power to set their own procedural rules.
If we consider history and politics and statecraft and the crafting of law as sorts of science, and if we accept that a primary use of science is to allow us to improve, then we are bound to consider open-mindedly the sanity and propriety of having Congress operate in this way. While there is no guarantee it would improve things, and surely there would be great effort expended in circumventing it should it become law, it seems well past time for this country to amend the Constitution to make Congress craft single-issue legislation.
It could well be that, in the path of Hurricane Michael, in the West where wildfires need addressing, and in other places left waiting as Congress plays politics with our lives, some support for this idea may exist.

YouTube Takes Conservative Commentator's Speech Platform And Salary Away,thefederalist.com,Chrissy Clark,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/06/youtube-costs-commentators-free-speech/,"June 6, 2019 By Chrissy Clark
Steven Crowder, a conservative comedian and commentator, became the newest victim of a YouTube purge spurred by a Vox reporter. The reporter, Carlos Maza, was triggered by Crowder’s content and flagged the videos he found offensive, essentially using a form of adult tattletaling.
When Maza initially cried “homophobe” to YouTube, they responded that Crowder’s content did not violate their policies, however, they did not agree with the content. After further review, YouTube stated that it suspended Crowder’s monetization, meaning that Crowder can no longer use advertisements to generate revenue on YouTube.
“Update on our continued review-we have suspended this channel’s monetization. We came to this decision because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies,” YouTube tweeted.

YouTube’s purge didn’t end with Crowder. The editor in chief of News2Share tweeted, “Within minutes of YouTube’s announcement of a new purge it appears they caught my outlet, which documents activism and extremism, in the crossfire.

Crowder was able to utilize the YouTube platform to ironically bash YouTube and Maza for stripping his channel from the ability to monetize.
In a recent addition to Crowder’s channel, the comedian dives into the problems that come with censorship and tells his audience explicitly why he was demonetized.
YouTube flagged Crowder for three videos, but most importantly for a link to purchase a shirt that says “Socialism is for f-gs.”
I wouldn’t be caught dead in a shirt that says “Socialism is for f-gs.” I think that kind of rhetoric is unnecessary. But do I call my mommy and tell her that a comedian offended me? No, because why in the world do you care that much about a t-shirt?
Maza claimed that YouTube was a “queer space.” What the heck does that mean? YouTube is a platform where you post videos. It’s not a space designed for any one type of being. It includes videos of all types and I can promise you that there are much more offensive and disturbing videos on YouTube than Crowder’s “Mug Club” videos.
This was not a way to stop online harassment or crude ideas from spreading. This was about silencing the voices of prominent conservatives that have messages and platforms people like.
Steven Crowder is a prominent voice with a large audience and great content, but a conservative can’t have that without some crazy left-winger crying “racist!” or “homophobe!”
Why people can’t just have their opinions and share them without everyone getting their panties in a bunch? In fact, if anyone should be mad about the opinions that are being shared, it should be conservatives, because liberals are trying to tell their collegiate base to physically assault those activists that politely speak their minds on college campuses. It’s absolutely ridiculous that now YouTube needs to attack conservatives as well.
Twitter has always been a platform that silences conservatives. That’s not an opinion, that’s a fact. Don’t believe me? Go on Twitter and find the hundreds of examples.
Why is demonetizing Crowder any different? Because this is no longer just stripping people of their First Amendment rights; now we are also stripping people of their ability to make money and their ability to live a prosperous life doing what they are passionate about.
An average viewer might not know how much work goes into creating video content, but losing monetization could mean losing jobs. These monetary functions on YouTube don’t just help to pay the star of the show and for equipment, these functions provide a salary for every individual that is involved in producing a show like Crowders.
It’s no longer just the First Amendment at risk anymore. It’s the American dream and the fundamental aspects of capitalism that make it possible for anyone to climb up the latter of success with hard work. It doesn’t matter how hard you work anymore, if your work offends someone who has a differing opinion, you should apparently be stopped. Chrissy Clark is a staff writer at The Federalist.

Kay Jewelers Banned Sheriff From Store Because He Was Carrying A Gun,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/06/kay-jewelers-just-banned-a-uniformed-sheriff-from-its-store-because-he-was-carrying-a-gun/,"June 6, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
A Kay Jewelers in North Carolina turned away a uniformed county sheriff who was picking up a pre-purchased engagement ring because he was carrying his firearm, according to the Iredell County Sheriff’s Office.
The sheriff was notified that the ring was ready to be picked up, but when he arrived at the store on his lunch break on Tuesday, the manager on duty stopped him from entering because his uniform, which includes a gun, didn’t meet store policy.
“The deputy informed the manager he was in uniform and his marked patrol car was in the parking lot, and it would be a violation of policy for him to remove his service weapon while in uniform,” officials said in a Facebook post .
According to the deputy, the manager told him he would need to return to the store when he was not armed.
Kay Jewelers responded on Facebook, apologizing to the sheriff and the county sheriff’s office.
“We have tremendous respect for law enforcement, and we thank the Office for bringing this to our attention. We will be sure to reinforce store training regarding our firearm policy with specific regard to uniformed law enforcement,” they wrote.
Another manager at the Kay Jewelers store located in Statesville, North Carolina, declined to provide a comment to The Federalist because she said she had already been receiving threats.
The sheriff’s office, which said they were “saddened” by the incident, had to explain that armed officers are important for the safety of both themselves and the general public.
“Thank you to the citizens and businesses in our area who whole heartily support the men and women who wear the badge,” they wrote. Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour. Follow her on Twitter . "
What The Men Of D-Day Faced Down To Secure The West's Freedoms,thefederalist.com,Joshua Lawson,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/06/heroic-men-d-day-faced-secure-wests-freedoms/,"By Joshua Lawson June 6, 2019
On November 10, 1942, Winston Churchill remarked that the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein was “the end of the beginning.” It was a start; the first major win against the European Axis powers in more than a year. Hope was in the air, but further trials remained.
It would be another 574 days until Operation Neptune—the codename for the initial phase of the amphibious Allied invasion of Normandy, France. When it came at last, “D-Day” would seal the fate of Adolf Hitler. For the fascist Nazi tyranny that had held most of Europe hostage for five years, it was now—finally—the beginning of the end.
Churchill and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt long recognized that a breakthrough in the heart of Europe was needed to take the fight to the Nazis. For a time, Churchill favored cleverly sneaking the Allies into Nazi territory “through the back door” of the Balkans and beating the Soviets to Germany. This was later tabled in favor of a daring attack across the English Channel.
Although German leaders expected an attack to come somewhere in the Pas-de-Calais region, the invasion took place 200 miles west of Calais. The Allies successfully deceived the Nazis until the assault was upon them.
The D-Day attack remains the largest seaborne invasion in history. The Normandy landings on June 6, 1944, followed the triumph of the Anzio campaign, which ended with the capture of Rome a day earlier.
Designated as the supreme allied commander in December 1943, Dwight D. Eisenhower’s moving final message to the men of D-Day is often overlooked in the study of American history. On the morning of the attack, Eisenhower addressed the soldiers of the Allied Expeditionary Force:
You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world. … The tide has turned! The free men of the world are marching together to Victory! I have full confidence in your courage and devotion to duty and skill in battle. … Good luck! And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.
More than 6,900 ships and landing craft escorted Allied troops straight into the jaws of death. Strewn across a 50-mile expanse of the Normandy coastline, 156,000 courageous men took the first steps in the liberation of a continent. It was just as Eisenhower had declared earlier that morning—a united force of free men, marching together in the defense of liberty and for the survival of the Western world.
British troops assaulted the beach sectors codenamed Gold and Sword. The Canadian 3rd Infantry streamed onto Juno beach , penetrating farther into France than any other Allied division on D-Day. Representing the United States of America, more than 56,000 servicemen stormed the sandy beachheads of the Utah and Omaha sectors. The Americans on Omaha Beach faced particularly intense resistance and suffered around 2,000 casualties —the largest price to be paid that day.
Along with the men onshore, 15,500 parachuted into northern France with the paratroopers of the U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. More than 7,500 additional troops from the British 6th Airborne Division were dropped in behind enemy lines.
Led by Lt. Colonel James Rudder, 190 U.S. Army Rangers of the 2nd Ranger Battalion scaled the treacherously steep promontory cliff of Pointe du Hoc. Plunging their Ranger daggers into the cliff face, they slowly climbed up rope ladders tenuously secured by grappling hooks. The fire raining down on them from Nazi defenses was relentless. But the Rangers made it to the top.
Once there, they took out deadly guns trained on the men embarking on the beaches below and held the vital observatory casemates overlooking Utah and Omaha. After two days of brutal struggle, only 90 rangers could continue fighting.
The most recent and accurate modern study reports that 4,390 Allied men died on D-Day . Although the toll was lower than planners had feared, the number is still shocking. Churchill had remarked to his wife the night before the attack, “Do you realize that by the time you wake up in the morning 20,000 men may have been killed?” Compared to predictions given beforehand, the relatively low casualties incurred during Operation Neptune is a testament to the meticulous planning of Allied command as well as the remarkable fighting prowess of the troops on the ground.
It’s hard to imagine enduring even a few minutes of what the Allied Expeditionary Force experienced on June 6, 1944. Most men who disembarked the landing craft that day were in their early 20s. By all rights, they should have been working at the local hardware store, helping their fathers plant crops, or enjoying the summer break from college classes. Instead, they were 5,000 miles away from home at the most dangerous place on earth.
Every day, we mourn the passing of more these brave men . Now in their mid to late 90s, there will soon come a time when none remain among us. We must never forget their heroic service and sacrifice on that fateful day 75 years ago. We must cherish their memory, thank God for them in our prayers, and make sure that future generations know of their increasingly uncommon valor.
The soldiers of D-Day represent mankind at its most noble, most valiant, and most selfless. They truly were the Greatest Generation. Above all, they were John 15:13 in action: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” Joshua Lawson is a graduate student at the Van Andel School of Statesmanship at Hillsdale College.

Lawmaker Accuses Constituents Of Hate Speech For Protesting Drag Queen Story Hour,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/06/lawmaker-accuses-constituents-hate-speech-protesting-drag-queen-story-hour/,"June 6, 2019 By David Marcus
New York State Sen. Andrew Gounardes took to Twitter today to accuse some his constituents of engaging in “hate speech.” The target of his smear was a group of concerned citizens in Brooklyn’s, Gerritsen Beach neighborhood who objected to their local library hosting Drag Queen Story Hour, an international organization dedicated to having drag queens tell stories to children. We are proud to welcome Drag Queen Story Hour to the Gerritsen Beach Library and condemn the hate speech against it in the strongest possible terms. I stand with Brooklyn's LGBTQIA community against intolerance. https://t.co/e8ZteUP5RP
— Andrew Gounardes (@agounardes) June 6, 2019
According a report in the Brooklyn Eagle, the leader of the protest is a father whose first name is Tag but declined to give his last name for fairly obvious reasons, not the least of which is that elected officials might accuse him of “hate speech.” He told the Eagle, “We’re talking about babies who can’t even grab the concept yet that they are boys or girls, never mind gender fluidity. A gender now is what we used to call a personality. Our children should be able to grow up and come to these decisions on their own just like everybody else.”
The event apparently was to include children younger than five years old. Outside the library today, small groups of protestors and counter protesters gathered and exchanged barbs. Although one might expect Brooklyn to welcome the drag queen story hour, there is more than one Brooklyn. Gerritsen Beach is not a hipster hood or full of pram-pushing, Volvo-driving Bernie supporters. It is a fairly conservative, working-class neighborhood.
Drag Queen Story Hour has been the subject of a rather heated debate among conservatives of late. It sparked the spat between The New York Post’s Sohrab Ahmari and National Review’s David French about how forcefully conservatives should attack and work to stop this kind of indoctrination of children. I think we can count these protesters in Gerritsen Beach as team Sohrab.
The way Gounardes chose to respond to the controversy says an awful lot about the debate within conservatism and the broader question of how kids should be exposed to the trans movement. By accusing the protestors of “hate speech,” Gounardes wasn’t just saying he disagreed with them. He also wasn’t just saying their concerns were groundless. He was saying that their concerns are so transgressive and offensive as to have no place in our discourse at all.
This is entirely unacceptable, and it speaks to why so many conservatives agree with Ahmari that we need to attack head-on not only the sexualization of children’s spaces, but an illiberal left that claims even bringing up the issue is hate speech. This is not a situation where we should respect all sides. Gounardes is slandering citizens with quite valid concerns about what their children are being exposed to in public libraries.
The trans movement and progressive politicians have invented out of whole cloth the idea that there is some consensus over whether men can become women or whether children should be exposed to drag queens. There is not. Nobody outside of the elites in the media, academia, and politics ever agreed to any of this, and people aren’t just going to accept it all out of fear of absurdly being accused of bigotry or hate speech.
The protestors are doing exactly what they are supposed to do: peaceably assembling to let their local government know they do not approve of its actions. Gounardes’ shameful attempt to paint them as bigots involved in hate speech is not only dishonest, it is incredibly dismissive of valid concerns expressed by his constituents. He should apologize to the protesters first, then sit down to hear their concerns.
On the whole, we should view today’s protests as a good development. Citizens are refusing to be silenced (even if they aren’t comfortable using their last names) in the face of a culture that is trying to lurch dangerously toward the libertine left without their consent or approval. If that can happen in Brooklyn, folks, it can happen anywhere. David Marcus is the Federalist's New York Correspondent and the Artistic Director of Blue Box World, a Brooklyn based theater project.

3 Reforms To Congress Rep. Gallagher Says Will Reduce The Dysfunction,thefederalist.com,Susanna Hoffman,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/07/3-reforms-congress-rep-mike-gallagher-says-will-reduce-dysfunction/,"June 7, 2019 By Susanna Hoffman
Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin’s eighth district discussed his thoughts on congressional reform on Wednesday in an interview with Adam White of the Hoover Institution. Gallagher and White reviewed an article Gallagher wrote in The Atlantic, “ How to Salvage Congress ,” addressing the problems Gallagher has observed in his two years in Congress.
“Everyone is complaining about Congress,” Gallagher said. “Not just the American people but the members of Congress themselves, and yet we just keep doing things the same way.”
The interview was part of the Hoover Institution’s series “Opening Arguments: Conversations on American Constitutionalism,” intending to facilitate discussions about constitutional self-governance. White began by pointing out the obvious change in Congress since the time of the Federalist Papers , where James Madison wrote that Congress was the first branch of government that “draws all power into its ‘perpetuous vortex.’”
Congress has instead become a means for members to increase their fame and profiles, Gallagher said. This shift of the legislative body’s power away from Founding ideals began with Watergate and the creation of steering committees in the 1970s. Escalating in the ’90s the Republican majority transferred power from committees to House leadership, all resulting in Congress surrendering most of its constitutional authority to the executive branch.
[Listen to Gallagher with Ben Domenech on the Federalist’s Radio Hour]
Gallagher sees a “less-understood phenomena” on the Hill in the breaking down of the committee system. Power is being taken from the committees and concentrated with top members. With the House speaker and steering committees as control centers, Congress is stuck in redundant and ineffective cycles of continuing resolutions and moving from shut-down to shut-down.
Gallagher’s two years in Washington have reshaped his old hypothesis that Congress members were the source of the dysfunction. It is the institution itself that is dysfunctional. No matter how brilliant and hardworking members are, this bad system prevents Congress from effectively doing its job, a job that includes oversight of the executive branch, fulfilling constitutionally mandatory responsibilities, and being a deliberative body to legislatively solve problems.
“We are having kabuki theater debates,” Gallagher said. “We legislate occasionally but it is rarely a result of a deliberative process… And it is rarely legislation on the most important issues.”
Because of the imbalance of power in the House, legislation does not take shape with the traditional committee process. Legislation is now a rare collaboration of the legislative and executive when the top members of Congress meet with the president at the White House while the rest of Congress sits back and waits.
“No!” Gallagher said. “It’s supposed to start with the committee process – it’s supposed to start from the bottom up.”
Gallagher suggests three reforms. The first is to change the congressional calendar. Congress members waste time and taxpayer dollars traveling to their districts on weekends and back to Washington D.C. for the work week.
“It makes absolutely no sense,” Gallagher said.
This system leaves little time for what Congress members are supposed to do: legislation and oversight. Gallagher’s solution is changing the calendar to two weeks in D.C. and two weeks in the districts. This would allow Congress members more concentrated time to focus on the issues as well as their districts.
Gallagher’s second reform is changing the committee chair selection process. Because committee assignments are dictated by the steering committee, ambitious Congress members have an incentive to gain the steering committee’s approval by voting in line with leadership and spending money. There is no test to determine if you know about the issues on that committee and are an effective legislator.
This can be changed by making the members of the committee elect the committee chairs, thus delegating power back to the committees. If committee chairs are elected by members of the committee, incentives will change and aspiring committee chairmen will have to prove themselves productive members of the committee.
White raised a practical objection, saying that because the House is so large, strong leadership is necessary and was even created to make Congress productive. Gallagher responded saying: “Right now we are in a situation where all the power is with the speaker and other members of the leadership. We are in a strong and centralized paradigm right now and the results are obviously bad. The most obvious thing we could do is to reverse that trend and embark on a different experience.”
Gallagher’s third reform is streamlining committee jurisdiction. Gallagher sees the division between appropriations committees and authorizing committees at the source of Congress’ dysfunction.
“If you collapse the appropriations function into the authorization committee, that would make every single committee more powerful,” Gallagher said. “At the end of the day you just want members of Congress who are on those committees who understand those issues. You make each committee more powerful and therefore make the work of each Congressmen more meaningful.”
The key is to simplify committee structures. This can be done by comparing the committee structure and the executive branch structure to find how they can align more closely where certain policy areas share jurisdiction.
“In addition to simplifying appropriations and authorization, there are other efforts to take simply the overall committee structure which I think would result in better oversight,” Gallagher said.
Gallagher’s commonsense approach to his reforms aim at, through the distribution of power to members of the committees, members will have an incentive to do good legislative work on the issues.

"Just Like FGM, Transgender Chest-Binding Is Barbaric",thefederalist.com,The Sexes,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/07/just-like-female-genital-mutilation-transgender-chest-binding-barbaric/,"By Libby Emmons June 7, 2019
When The New York Times ran an article about the medical downsides of chest binding, LGBTQIAP+ people saw it as an attack and lashed back. While the Times was pointing out the very real, physical dangers that go with the practice of women binding their chests to repress their breasts and appear more male, trans advocates fought back with assertions of the psychological upsides of this barbaric practice.
Chest binding is undertaken by women and girls who believe themselves to be men or more closely aligned with the masculine side of the sex binary. For their external appearance to match how they look in the mirror of their minds, they use heavy-duty spandex—basically extreme sports bras—to push the flesh of their breasts down, suffocating the tissue, giving themselves a flat-chested look.
It is reported that these trans men and trans masc women afterwards feel better psychologically about their appearance and their standing in the world. With chests bound, they don’t have to look like women anymore, interact as women, or be treated like women. The Burden of Growing Breasts
For girls entering puberty, or just coming out the other side of it, breasts can be a burden. A girl goes from being looked at as a child, a person with a certain measure of freedom, to someone who is sexually objectified.
This sexual objectification is done by those who are sexually attracted in a positive way, those who wish to do harm, and those who wish to protect young women from the pursuits of both of those interests. In many cultures, this is a time for girls to become more modest, put away the tree-climbing gear, and get comfortable with feminine responsibility. It’s no wonder that many girls don’t want to do it.
While there is much media attention on trans women and men who transition to trans femme, the plight of the girl who does not wish to be a woman is often overlooked. That’s what made this article in The New York Times so essential.
Girls who wish to present themselves as boys are given scant medical information, and trans advocates want them to get even less. Trans advocates even speak out against informing girls of the sterility risks associated with injections of testosterone. They fear this will make some girls who wish to transition not go through with it. Suicide risks are bandied about as though self-harm is an inevitable side effect, and that girls who are denied drastic medical intervention to their healthy bodies will necessarily do themselves in.
Young people who are determined to live as the opposite sex have the freedom to do so. Girls can dress in masculine-presenting clothes, just as boys can don the stereotypical garb of girls and wear dresses and makeup. But when it comes to medically transitioning healthy bodies, medical opinions should be made available. When women and girls are not given the necessary medical information required to make an informed decision, medical professionals and the trans community are doing them a disservice. The New York Times Didn’t Do Anything Wrong
Trans activists were most angered by a 2017 study the Times cited:
[The study] looked at 1,800 transmasculine adults with a median age of 23. Seventy-eight percent of respondents said they had bound for over a year, over half bound an average of seven days a week, and 66.6 percent were interested in top surgery. An additional 13.1 percent had already had the surgery.
Participants reported a statistically significant improvement in mood after binding. They also reported decreased gender dysphoria, anxiety and depression. As for physical effects, 97.2 percent of the group that bound reported at least one negative physical symptom, such as back pain, overheating, chest pain and shortness of breath. Other symptoms included numbness, bad posture and lightheadedness.
Jezebel took issue with this citation:
The Times reported on the study’s findings, but rather than interrogating the benefits outlined, it focused almost exclusively on the medical risks. The Times interviewed only one trans person undertaking the practice—quoting the teen about his pain, but not the reasons he bound his chest, or how doing so affected his mental health.
That 97.2 percent of respondents to the 2017 survey reported at least one negative physical symptom is not what’s important either to Jezebel, the hordes on Reddit , or Shannon Keating of BuzzFeed News, who tweeted the Times article with the caption: “Today’s anti-trans scaremongering from the NYT: an entire story framed to highlight the physical downsides of chest binding. No mention of trans youth suicide rates. No quotes from GNC people for whom binding is lifesaving. Who gets quoted, tho?

— Shannon Keating (@skeatings) May 31, 2019
4thWaveNow is the furthest thing from a hate group. Instead, their site is “a supportive place for parents and others concerned about medical transition of minors and young adults. Many 4thWaveNow contributors are parents of young people who experienced rapid onset gender dysphoria at adolescence, sometimes called ROGD.” These are primarily parents who are concerned about the rapid transformation of their children under guidance from a medical community that is more focused on supporting the suppositions of questioning youth than truly advocating for their psychological and physical health. Attempting to Cover Their Tracks
The backlash against The New York Times was severe enough that the paper issued a call for those who have experience with chest binding to share their experiences. Is this something that would be done with female genital mutilation? Breast ironing? Foot binding? How has something as painful and harmful as chest binding, with documented long-term downsides, become the purview of emotion and not medicine? Trans advocates are more interested in supporting their ideology than individuals who suffer from trans activist-pushed misinformation campaigns.
When the medical and psychiatric industry is more concerned with covering their own backs against the onslaught of trans advocacy vitriol than truly caring for the needs—not just the immediate wants—of their patients, parents must speak out. That’s what 4thWaveNow is all about.
They do not deny that some adolescents will go on to fully transition. Still, the numbers of transitioning youth have drastically swelled, which has led them to rightfully question the practices of transgender affirmation as the first and only line of treatment.
Chest binding is akin to the practices of female genital mutilation and chest ironing, only instead of being implemented by parents seeking to disrupt their daughters’ sex lives, it is being undertaken by girls rebelling against the femaleness of their bodies. The more transgender ideology infiltrates culture, the more girls hear that to be female means to be ultra femme and that any form of female expression that deviates from that must be male. This is directly harming young people by giving the impression that the way they are is not good enough, and that they need to change their appearance to be acceptable.
This is the same kind of barbarism perpetrated on girls in the developing world who are victimized for their emerging sexuality, and the same kind Western feminists used to fight against. Ideas that women and girls need to conform are not new. Physically invasive treatments for the psychological problems of women and girls have been around for generations. What is new is having these girls speak out, having so willingly internalized a misogyny that would destroy women, and advocate for their right to self-harm with the approval of medical professionals and caregivers alike.

Pasadena, California — While shopping along Raymond Avenue in Old Town Pasadena last week, my friend and I stopped into the Church of Scientology to take a free personality test that was advertised on an A-frame chalkboard sign just outside.
As a Christian, I wasn’t really searching for guidance or salvation, but I wanted to hear the Church of Scientology’s elevator pitch. I wanted to know what they said to make people fork over massive amounts of money , or even distance themselves from family members in an effort to work their way up the church’s ranks.
I couldn’t help but notice how luxurious the building was. The church’s visitors center looked like a museum. There were exhibits with many informational panels complete with interactive video screens and elaborate visual props. During our afternoon visit, I noticed there was an indoor fountain, several movie theatre rooms and a coffee shop just in the portions of the building I wandered into.
It’s estimated that about $1.5 billion of the church’s $1.75 billion worth is tied up in real estate holdings worldwide, and some former church members claim that Scientology is nothing more than “a fundraising ploy to buy real estate, to persuade people to give them money.”
Upon entering, my friend and I were greeted by a young man at the front desk named Andrew, who wore a grin that never seemed to escape his face. He explained to us that we should allow an hour to take the Oxford Capacity Analysis developed by the church’s founder, L. Ron. Hubbard. The test would reveal our biggest strengths and weaknesses.
We were given pencils and a scantron-like test as we were guided to an area just beyond the visitors center with rows of desks that were partitioned off.
I took the free personality test at the church of #Scientology . Many of the q’s were to assess if I could”take orders” and “obey” pic.twitter.com/k3iAecSbLB — Bre Payton (@Bre_payton) December 31, 2016
Many of the questions seemed to be aimed at assessing how confident and competent I was.
“Does the idea of talking in front of people make you nervous?”“Can you ‘start the ball rolling’ at a social gathering?”
Another question further down in the test asked something along the lines of whether I thought my opinion was worth sharing out loud. As someone who is paid to speak my mind, I marked down that I strongly agreed with that statement.
After we finished taking 200-question test, we were told the tests would be graded and our results would be assessed individually. The time between taking the test and having them assessed stretched on longer than I anticipated. Whenever I asked a question, I was directed into another theatre room and presented with another short film. Instead of a direct answer, I was guided to another video presentation or elaborate information display in the visitors center.
Next, my friend and I were led to an E-meter machine , which passes a small amount of electricity through your body in an attempt to read how “strong” a particular thought, memory, or sensation is.
Our tour guide, named Kenny, handed me two can-like objects which were attached to the wires stemming from the E-meter. With my permission, he pinched me, and I watched as the needle on the machine ticked upwards on the screen. He explained this indicates this had a strong reaction in my reactive mind and that I needed to think about it a few more times to bring my experience out of the reactive mind and into the analytical mind.
I was asked to think about the pain again and again until the needle didn’t tick up as high on the reader. He told me that this was because I had rationalized the painful experience and all problems could be rationalized through auditing sessions. You can read a more complete explanation of all this here. When I asked how much these sessions cost, Kenny told me that the cost varied person to person, but that I could buy a package of 12 one-hour sessions for about $120 to start.
After about 45 minutes of videos and the E-meter demonstration, we were finally separated and given our results. Then things took a turn for the weird.
While my friend sat with the aforementioned Andrew, he told her to stop taking her anti-depressants, because she wouldn’t be able to complete the church’s “Dianetics” course unless she was off any prescribed medication for at least 24 hours before taking the initial assessment. Andrew bragged that he had convinced a schizophrenic man the week prior to stop taking medication and to rely on the church instead. He kept pushing Scientology as a cure for mental illness because, he said, it can solve everyone’s problems without “making it up” like therapy and medication.
After she resisted his efforts to sell her Hubbard’s “Dianetics” book, Andrew told my friend that people never come back to the church unless they buy a copy. When my friend responded that she could just buy the book online at a later time, he responded that he was scared of what the Google results would be.
Don’t trust what they say on the Internet, he warned.
He proceeded to ply her with questions about her job and about how much money she earns, before revealing that the church doesn’t pay him well, but that he continues to work for them anyway because he likes to be around people. It’s no secret the church has issues with paying its employees a decent living wage. Members of the church’s Sea Organization are reportedly forced to work for mere slave wages , and when they leave the Sea Org, most do so with little to no money in their pockets.
“I do this because I like to help people,” he said.
Meanwhile, Kenny tried to convince me that I had problem areas in my life. According to the church’s assessment, my thoughts are often dispersed, I’m frequently nervous, and I’m a critical person.
He asked me how I felt about my scores and about myself, and I responded that I felt pretty good. This answer baffled him. But what about these areas in which you scored low? he asked. I told him they didn’t bother me, and his demeanor quickly changed. He seemed to ease up after realizing that I was confident and didn’t see myself as a damaged individual who needed the church’s help.
The stories of the three church employees I met were remarkably similar. All said they had “problems” in their life and came to the church to help work them out. All were poor communicators, according to Hubbard’s test, and had social anxiety. One man told us he dropped out of high school at 17 when he was required to read something aloud in front of his history class. Andrew said he had a speech impediment and stuttered before joining the church, and Kenny told me he scored as low as possible in the communication category and was traumatized from a friendship that turned ugly.
None of the three church employees whom I spoke with at length had an education beyond high school. Our two tour guides both started working for the church at 17 years old and have no other professional experience outside of the church.
All came to the church with low self-esteem and a lack of necessary social skills. The church, its courses, and its auditing sessions gave them the confidence they so desperately lacked, they said. The church’s recruitment methods all seemed to be directed at finding a specific kind of person: someone who was vulnerable, overwhelmed by his or her shortcomings, someone who had poor communication skills, who lacked confidence, and was desperate for help.
The most alarming part of the visit was when I asked Kenny what happens if someone wants to leave the Church of Scientology. He responded that when individuals don’t follow the church’s rules, the church intervenes.
“We don’t force anyone to stay,” he said. “But I could see why people have that idea.” Bre Payton was a staff writer at The Federalist."
Report: Aborted Baby Body Traffickers May Be Raking In U.S. Tax Dollars,thefederalist.com,Bre Payton,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/08/report-aborted-baby-body-parts-traffickers-may-raking-u-s-tax-dollars-2/,"June 8, 2019 By Bre Payton
We originally published this article on September 11, 2018. In honor of Bre Payton’s memory, we’re republishing it today on what would have been her birthday. Congress still has not defunded Planned Parenthood, nor have there been any legal consequences for what undercover whistleblowers exposed back in 2015.
Warning: Graphic content.
A new report shows that an organization that harvests aborted baby organs for research has been charging more than what is legally reimbursable.
The 11-page report details how Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc. (ABR), which is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ), charged universities a significantly marked-up price for the organs it harvested from aborted babies.
Federal law prohibits the sale or purchase of fetal tissue — that is, human body parts harvested from pre-born or aborted babies — for “valuable consideration.” The law does, however, allow reimbursing baby body part suppliers for costs “associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.”
This is the very workaround that undercover videos showed abortion giant Planned Parenthood using to make money from human remains. That got it hauled into Congress for investigations but as of yet has cost PP none of its half trillion in annual federal funding.
The Center for Medical Progress released a report on Monday showing ABR charged researchers up to hundreds of dollars per harvested human organ in addition to packing and shipping fees — prices that indicate the organization may have been marking up the cost of fetal tissue beyond what is legally reimbursable.
Invoices CMP obtained show that ABR charged the University of Wisconsin-Madison $680 for two eyeballs from a second-trimester baby in 2015. The going rate for a single eyeball was $340, according to an invoice from the University of Colorado, Denver. Charging per eyeball is questionable, as shipping costs for two eyeballs would be the same as for one, and the cost of harvesting two eyeballs from one skull would cost minimally more than obtaining one.
In one instance, ABR billed a University of Utah customer $12,000 for two unsuccessful attempts to harvest organs from babies that were aborted in January 2015. When the researcher objected to these huge charges, ABR replied that they were merely asking for reimbursement for their costs.
The clinic charges us for the time, space and utilities for the two day minimum that we are in the clinic for the RTA, for Phases 1 & 2, which on its own is a fee of $500…If there is no suitable tissue acquired, which is always an unfortunate possibility, the labor and time-intensive work on behalf of [Redacted] has still be done, and performed in good faith that ABR would be reimbursed for the work.
The researcher wrote back:
I calculated the costs for travel, hotel, time, food, personnel time, clinic fees and some overhead in the scenario of a non-useable product and I figured your costs to be around $3,000. Therefore, instead of charging the full $6,000 or $7,000, I would recommend $3,000.
ABR ended up agreeing with the researcher, writing: “We are willing to accept the decreased amount of $3500, to cover our costs.” Had the researcher not objected, it seems likely ABR would have pocketed an extra $8,500.
On July 25, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed a new contract with ABR to acquire “fresh” organs, primarily from elective abortions, to implant them into mice. The project part of an attempt by the FDA to create “humanized mice”— that is, mice with a human immune system for experimentation, CNS News reports.
The taxpayer-funded project includes paying nearly $16,000 for ABR-harvested organs, even though the organization remains under investigation by the DOJ. Contract details are available from the FDA here and from the Congressional Research Service, here.
As The Daily Signal reported , the FDA is taking ABR at its word that it will not break the law when procuring aborted baby organs, rather than checking for compliance.
In a statement, the FDA said that ABR has ‘provided assurances with all applicable legal requirements … relating to research involving human fetal tissue’ and that the FDA is not involved with how ABR sources the tissue. In other words, the FDA is simply taking ABR at its word, despite the troubling findings of congressional investigations.
So while it’s unclear if ABR is charging more than what is legally reimbursable, as it appears to have done in 2015, the FDA is taking a hands-off approach even though the organization is under federal investigation. Bre Payton was a staff writer at The Federalist. "
$2 Million Art Above Homeless Encampment Highlights DC's Problems,thefederalist.com,Bre Payton,06-08-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/08/2-million-art-homeless-tent-encampment-highlights-dcs-problems-2/,"By Bre Payton June 8, 2019
This article originally published on October 28, 2018. We’re republishing it today on Bre Payton’s birthday in her memory.
Tents are a permanent fixture beneath the bridges that support the train tracks feeding into Washington DC’s Union Station, particularly along the sidewalks in the rapidly developing NoMa neighborhood. Along the portions of M, L, and K Streets that are covered by railway overpasses in Northeast DC are dozens of tents — some taking over the entire width of the sidewalk, forcing pedestrians to step down into the street and dangerously close to oncoming traffic to get by.
Camping on public property is illegal in DC, but the police don’t typically crack down on tent-dwellers. Every now and again the city cleans things up by sweeping through heavily tented areas , ordering campers to leave and packing up any belongings left behind in storage, which residents can collect from the city up to 60 days later. Residents are given two weeks notice prior to the scheduled cleanup and the tents often return soon after.
Steps away from these densely populated overpasses are newly built, high-rise luxury apartments with studio units that rent out at close to $2,000 a month. Not long ago, the area was once a seedy bus station, but it has transformed into a millennial’s paradise. It features an outdoor beer garden, a massive REI store, bike lanes galore, a Trader Joe’s, and nearby Union Market that contains craft beer and cocktail sellers, a raw oyster bar, and numerous artisanal jewelry and home products.
The NoMa Parks Foundation, which oversees the distribution of a $50 million taxpayer-funded grant to purchase public land and build parks in the neighborhood, has set aside $2 million of that money to install artistic light displays or, as the foundation’s website calls it, “Underpass Art Parks,” to spruce up the dark tunnels. Near-completed light installation on M Street NE. A Tent Dweller Is Shocked At The $2 Million Sticker Price
One woman camped just outside of the L Street bridge, where she will likely be forced to vacate soon when the light installation project expands, was aghast at the $2 million sticker price for the project.
“That money could’ve been used for little huts or something,” said the woman, who asked to be identified only as a lady who’s been on the street for seven years. The city’s problems are “like cancer,” she says, adding that the sidewalk under the bridge often floods and that rat infestations have plagued the city for years. “You can’t cover it up, you’ve gotta get it out. Fix the problem, and then make it pretty.”
Yet “pretty” isn’t a word she would use for the nearly completed M Street art project, adding that she hopes the L Street project will “look better than that.”
“They say tents are illegal in the district, but who can pay $2,600 for a studio?” she said as she gazed at the high-rise apartments just blocks away outfitted with rooftop pools, indoor pet washing stations, and 24-hour concierge service.
Under the nearby K Street bridge, a notice hangs announcing the next cleanup is in three days. Dozens of tents and ramshackle shelters made with plywood and blankets line both sides of the sidewalk. Tent dwellings.
“Do not take photos of our tents!” a man’s voice yelled from inside one of the tents. “Don’t be doing that! Next time ask first!” Expensive Lights Won’t Fix These Underpasses
Throughout the construction of these “Art Parks,” fencing has appeared along M and parts of L Streets in an effort to clear the area for work crews to install the lights. Just outside of the fencing along M Street sits one tent, stubbornly defying the obvious intention of the nearby chain link barrier.
Last week, several tents were pitched inside the fencing, only to disappear the next day. After the completion of these light installations, it’s likely the tents will return, making the sidewalks once again un-walkable in places.
Drugs and alcohol abuse, mental illness, and a lack of affordable housing contribute to DC’s homeless population, which is the highest per capita in the entire United States, according to data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development . Activists say rapid gentrification, spurred by taxpayer subsidies and government programs, have made areas like NoMa less affordable for longtime residents.
DC-based lawyer Ari Theresa is suing the city for $1 billion over its development plans to attract transient and childless millennials with higher incomes. He alleges the plan discriminates against poor, African-American families.
It might seem odd that a city that has never had anything but a Democratic mayor and is densely populated by liberals is being sued for racial discrimination, but its leftist policies and spending habits that have spurred rapid gentrification. Government subsidies are part of the problem, Theresa explains, as a reas with the most new development are receiving the most subsidies. Taxpayers Are Subsiding Luxuries for High-Earning Singles
A peek into DC.gov’s Inclusionary Zoning database shows a number of the District’s newest high rises — 77H, Ava on H, Aria on L, among numerous others — offer subsidized units for residents earning up to 80 percent of the Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area Median Family Income (MFI), which is set at $117,200. The chart shows that a single person making $65,650 a year could qualify to live in a subsidized unit in of the city’s most luxurious apartment buildings.
The database shows many of buildings have studio and single bedroom units available for those making between 50 and 80 percent of the median family income, but there is a scant offering of units with additional bedrooms to fit a family with children. In short, DC taxpayers are footing the bill for a single person making plenty of money to live in luxury apartments, which are driving up the cost of housing for everyone by raising property values and therefore taxes and rent.
“ When you throw subsidies around like this, that ends up setting the floor,” Theresa said. “ Everything goes up.”
Absurd housing subsidies and million-dollar light installations aren’t the only ways the District has chosen extreme gentrification in favor of millennials over its longtime African-American residents. The rapid expansion of bike lanes in the city has made it difficult for families to find parking outside of their churches on Sundays. Bre Payton was a staff writer at The Federalist."
‘Dark Phoenix’ Crashes And Burns Without Rising From The Ashes,thefederalist.com,Paulina Enck,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/09/dark-phoenix-crashes-and-burns-without-rising-from-the-ashes/,"June 9, 2019
Some spoilers ahead.
With “Dark Phoenix,” X-Men fans must say goodbye to a franchise that has delighted, entertained, and disappointed for 19 years. From highs such as the Academy Award-nominated “Logan” to the catastrophe that was “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” you never know whether to expect a masterpiece or a terrible, unfocused mess. “Dark Phoenix,” the final installment in the beloved franchise, is decidedly the latter. It is almost astonishing how much the final installment in the X-Men franchise gets wrong.
Adapted from one of the most beloved comic sagas of all times, “Dark Phoenix” tells the story of Jean Grey, who gets overwhelmed by a powerful force inside her, and must struggle with increasingly dark impulses.
“Dark Phoenix” writer and director Simon Kinberg co-wrote the widely despised “X-Men: The Last Stand,” so many fans questioned why he was the choice to try once more to adapt the Phoenix Saga for cinema. While he served as a cowriter on one of the best X-Men films (“Days of Future Past”) and two of the more disappointing outings (“The Last Stand,” “Apocalypse”), and produced the exceptional “X-Men First Class,” his work on the previous failure to capture the iconic Phoenix Saga justifiably concerned fans. Those already high fears were understated, as Kinberg took what didn’t work about “The Last Stand” and amplified those problems to a dramatic degree.
The problem with “The Last Stand” was the inclusion of the Phoenix Saga at all. The ideas of the existence of a mutant cure, and the questions of whether mutation was immutable or a problem that needed fixing like a disease, are a fascinating concept that deserved its own film. This quandary contained more nuance than the previous two X-Men films, superior cinematic experiences as they are, as it brings the message beyond the mere “prejudice is bad” to explore some truly complicated questions.
But then the writers just had to include the Phoenix Saga. What could have been a fascinating, fun, action-packed exploration of nuanced and complex themes with some of the best characters to ever don super suits became a rushed, unfocused mess. The Phoenix Saga is one of the most iconic and beloved stories in the X-Men comics, and for good reason. Telling the story of an inherently good woman overcome by an overwhelming dark power, Jean Grey’s transformation explores the struggle between the good and evil within her. Random, C-level Subplot Could Have Been Dropped
The choice to add a subplot about an alien race to “Dark Phoenix” was odd and unneeded. The film was already crowded and over-complicated, while ignoring much of what made the original story a classic. The D’Bari subplot is a minor aspect of the Phoenix Saga, and not one of the more compelling parts.
By completely divorcing Jean from the Phoenix energy, rather than portraying it as an integrated part of Jean once it overtakes her, the formerly powerful and complex protagonist becomes little more than a pawn in her own story. She spends the entire film at the mercy of the Phoenix force and manipulated by Vuk, a member of the D’Bari attempting to gain control of the Phoenix force.
Like “The Last Stand” before it, “Dark Phoenix” explores a C plot that could easily fill a fascinating movie on its own. Some of the best X-Men stories come from the various attempts at handling humanity’s fear of mutants, from Magneto’s violent genocidal aspirations to Professor X’s attempts at diplomacy. In “Dark Phoenix,” the two leaders’ positions mature in fascinating ways: Magneto, a Holocaust survivor and mutant supremacist, now rules a peaceful mutant homeland called Genosha, an obvious allegory to Israel.
Professor X, however, has turned his former students into a superhero team, the eponymous X-Men, who are sent around the world to save humans and generate goodwill towards mutants. While Raven fears that his pushes towards heroism are in service of his ego, it makes perfect sense that Charles, who desperately wanted a peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants, would strive to maintain the delicate acceptance by any means necessary. This conflict in ideologies deserves far more attention than a few moments early in the film, as it holds the type of dramatic weight and serious questions that draw people towards the X-Men.
Kinberg’s script is incredibly weak, boasting dialogue that is simultaneously awkward and obvious. Early in the film, Mystique delivers a particularly heinous line, “It’s funny, I can’t remember the last time you were the one risking something. And, by the way, the women are always saving the men around here. You might want to think about changing the name to X-Women.”
The line is spoken straight, without a trace of irony or nuance. It’s doubly humorous with Mystique speaking it, as she has been the team’s biggest liability and one of the weakest characters in the franchise. The entire script follows this terribly awkward and obvious line. All Work and No Play Makes This a Dull Film
The pacing is likewise poorly executed. Kinberg’s status as a first-time director is painfully obvious in every frame. The tone is remarkably self-serious and dour, taking any of the fun out of the franchise. Quicksilver is the only character allowed to make any jokes, and he is benched early in the film. What comes next is a series of scenes in an odd order without any fun.
The action set pieces were incredibly hit or miss. There was one brilliant action scene near the end, set on a train. All of the major characters fought together, using their powers to their full potential in unexpected and exciting ways. While not at the grand level of some of the final battles, watching the way the characters played off each other and used their powers together made a brilliant viewing experience I wish carried over to more of the film. All it was missing was a Quicksilver slow-motion scene set to a Nirvana hit.
The film ends with Charles and Erik sitting down in Paris for a game of chess before Charles joins Erik to lead Genosha together. For fans of the franchise, this moment feels like a fitting end. The original trilogy, while focusing on Wolverine and Rogue, was held together by the enmity, respect, and affection between the rivals and old friends, portrayed by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen respectively. The pseudo-prequel trilogy beginning with “First Class” pushes this through-line to the front, as the relationship between Charles and Erik, now played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, becomes the central focus of the films.
So it must have seemed odd to fans to have these old friends interact so rarely throughout the film, despite their bond serving as the heart of the series. Further, Fassbender and McAvoy are two of the best actors in the franchise, particularly the rebooted prequels, and their chemistry is the best in the entire series. “Dark Phoenix” proves resoundingly that X-Men films only work when focusing on either Wolverine or the messy love-hate friendship between Professor X and Magneto. Sophie Turner Simply Can’t Act
“Dark Phoenix” has some of the best and worst acting in the X-Men films. Sophie Turner, best known for her role as Sansa Stark on HBO’s ubiquitous “Game of Thrones,” takes on the role of the protagonist as Jean Grey. As seen on “Game of Thrones,” Turner is excellent at crying, but little else. Jean should be the emotional core of the film, but Turner’s awkward, stilted, and unbelievable performance leaves the character as a dead presence in the center of her own film. Turner cannot act, and her position as the lead surrounded by some truly brilliant actors only serves to highlight this.
Fassbender’s intensity, rage, and passion once again shine through in his role as Magneto. The complicated former villain is sidelined, with an undue focus on his heartbroken reaction to Raven’s death, a woman he was intensely attempting to murder just two films earlier.
McAvoy’s Professor X had some fascinating character development dealing with his guilt for past mistakes and his hubris. McAvoy handles the development masterfully, saying his terrible lines of dialogue with a surprising level of believability.
In her brief scenes as Raven, Jennifer Lawrence reminds viewers how terribly miscast she was as Mystique. The film continues the confused decision to keep the typically villainous Mystique firmly on the side of the heroes, which makes her far less interesting than the suave, cold character fans knew and loved. Lawrence’s performance is so bland and uninspired that her death honestly breathes some life into the film.
Nicholas Hoult returns to form as Beast, providing a strong, at times feral performance of a man who has lost the woman he loves. His chemistry with Lawrence is passable at best, but Hoult’s depth and sympathy makes viewers invest in the relationship solely due to the passion in his performance.
Tye Sheridan does a serviceable job as Scott, Jean’s boyfriend and teammate. Due to Cyclops’s laser eyes, Sheridan must give his entire performance without the use of his eyes, which is naturally challenging. However, he shows genuine care for Jean despite his and Turner’s severe lack of chemistry. It was also an odd decision to give Scott the sole f-word, which felt both out of place and out of character.
Evan Peters brought the same charm and humor to the role of Quicksilver as he did the previous two installments, but his role was cut down dramatically, giving the charismatic actor only a handful of scenes before leaving him critically injured and therefore left behind.
Alexandra Shipp and Kodi Smit-McPhee round out the X-Men team as Storm and Nightcrawler. Both actors do a strong job with their characters, although they receive next to no development and very little to do outside the enjoyable action set pieces.
Jessica Chastain labors in a thankless role as the villain, Vuk, who manipulates Jean. Chastain is given nothing to do, and even her immense talent cannot make this character either interesting or important in the film.
I cannot bring myself to recommend “Dark Phoenix” to anyone other than serious X-Men fans. The train sequence is enjoyable, and McAvoy, Fassbender, and Hoult give strong performances, so watching their last outings in these iconic roles is worth the terrible dialogue and self-serious tone. However, anyone who cares about the film should prepare to leave the cinema remarkably frustrated at the state of the final installment in the incredible franchise.

"Why Courts Need To Treat Embryos As People, Not Property",thefederalist.com,Rita Lowery Gitchell,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/courts-need-treat-embryos-people-not-property/,"June 10, 2019
“The Supreme Court kept me from my freedom.” — Dred Scott
The U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1857 decision, Dred Scott v. Sandford, erroneously and shamefully held that the Constitution could never confer American rights and privileges to black people. Today’s courts risk a similarly disgraceful stain on their reputation by neglecting to keep pace with life science, especially embryology.
Scientific advancement in fertility has now moved four decades beyond “test tube baby” Louise Brown, conceived outside the womb via in vitro fertilization (IVF) in a petri dish. Cryogenically preserved embryos, while not commonplace, are no longer rare, and custody battles have rocked courtrooms and gossip programming. The problem surrounding the legal assignment of custody for preserved embryos is that courts are more prone to address these tiny new humans as property rather than the offspring they truly are.
The science of embryology has documented the development of human life prior to implantation in the womb, yet the legal process is way behind the science in failing to recognize them as developing human beings. In the same way that the high court fell victim to errant understanding in the discreditable days of slavery, the judicial system is missing the mark on conceived, pre-implanted, fully human embryos.
Embryos are organisms, not cells or tissue. IVF clinics do not store dead embryos, but viable embryos intended to continue life. These cryogenically preserved children are human beings, and the 13th Amendment unflinchingly removes human beings from the category of property to be owned. Distinct Beings, From Conception Onwards
This week, the National Embryo Donation Center celebrates the births of 800 children, implanted as embryos in women who are not their genetic mothers. These children, birthed and parented by their adoptive mothers, have been separate beings from conception.
Sadly, legal case precedent still treats these embryos as property, mislabeling them as cells or tissue. The courts do not recognize what science has proven: when human life is created, human development begins.
When divorcing couples dispute the fate of their embryos, current case precedent is based on a 1992 Tennessee Supreme Court decision, Davis v. Davis , which in dicta classified embryos as belonging to an interim legal status between person and property. The next embryo fate dispute case, Kass v. Kass , let the embryos be treated as property to awarded to the clinic by contract. Those seeking disposal of frozen embryos mistakenly claim a “right not to procreate,” which is a moot point as the embryo only exists after procreation.
Limited by a lack of current information about embryonic development, Davis erroneously opined the “pre-embryo” was human tissue, agreeing with the American Fertility Society that “the first cellular differentiation relates to the physiological interaction with the mother, rather than the establishment of the embryo itself.” However, this is primarily rhetorical and not scientific, as the embryo undergoes one continuous, self-directed existence from sperm-egg fusion through the prenatal life to birth and after. The Davis case was decided before studies and time-lapse photography of early human embryonic development had taken place.
In contrast, the trial court in Davis had found, based on genetics, that the embryos were human beings and had properly applied a “best interest of the child” standard to decide their fate. However, the Davis Tennessee Supreme Court denied the embryos were existing human beings. In the decision, a law review by John A. Robertson was referenced. American Fertility Society advisor John A. Robertson’s, 1990 law review claimed that the “early embryos, while genetically unique, consist of a few undifferentiated cells that will first form the placenta before the embryo itself develops.” Robertson’s “biologic reality” is contrary to modern scientific fact.
Dr. Robert Edwards, one of the IVF pioneers who successfully engineered Louise Brown’s conception, has detailed how both the inner cell mass components that give rise to the human body and the components that give rise to placental cells are simultaneously present in the embryo prior to implantation. Learning More About Human Embryos
Similarly, Dr. Renee Reijo Pera, former director of Stanford’s Center for Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research and Education, studied human embryos with time-lapse photography and published how individual embryonic cells behave differently. The visual differences among the cell’s composition and behavior within the embryo prior to implantation can be easily observed.
The Virtual Human Embryo database shows an embryo about four to five days old that was washed from a uterus after insemination, then transferred to the uterus of an infertile woman, where the embryo continued development through birth. The Virtual Human Embryo photo distinctly identifies the inner cell mass giving rise to the human body, and trophoblast cells giving rise to the placenta, visible in the embryo before implantation.
One arena in which the law has understood the clear distinction between an embryo and cells is in permitting federally funded research on embryonic cells but refusing to fund embryo destruction for research.
Robertson’s law review, overlooking the biologic fact that an embryo is already a human being in development, recommended “that the party wishing to avoid reproduction should prevail whenever the other party has a reasonable chance of becoming a parent by other means.” His erroneous understanding of the facts of life has created a prejudicial legal environment that puts a parent wishing to preserve their embryonic child at a serious disadvantage and condemns that child to death, despite the presence of a parent willing to take full responsibility for that baby.
Recent embryo custody disputes, McQueen v. Gadberry (2016, Missouri) and Rooks v. Rooks (2018, Colorado), both referenced old secondary sources claiming “pre-embryo” as an accurate term, despite the fact that Davis ‘s ruling that the embryo is only a “pre-embryo” before day 14, is not how the embryo is described today in scientific literature. Embryos prior to implantation in a womb are developing, and not “pre-embryos” or “pre-humans.” These cases each failed to recognize modern scientific findings that development of the cells giving rise to the human body begins at conception, not at implantation.
In Bilbao v. Goodwin (2017, Connecticut), the mother of cryogenically preserved embryos wanted them destroyed, rather than “placed for adoption by strangers.” The father wanted the lives of his offspring spared. A trial court ruled that the mother’s interest in “her eggs” outweighed the defendant’s interest in continued preservation or adoption of the embryos. The case moved to the Connecticut Supreme Court, where an amicus brief from the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists emphasized that the plaintiff’s “eggs” no longer exist after fertilization has occurred because each human embryo involved is a purposefully created human organism with his or her own unique DNA. The Heartbreaking Case of Embryo Loss
A storage tank failure that caused the loss of stored embryos resulted in a lawsuit brought by their parents. In Penniman v. University Hospitals Health System (2019, Ohio), the court claimed that one of the reasons the embryos were not persons because an embryo could not “on its own, become a child.” One must surely acknowledge that a newborn cannot, unaided, become a child either. All humans need food and shelter to survive.
The Declaration of Independence ensures parents an inalienable right to protect their offspring as part of their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as affirmed in 1972’s Stanley v. Illinois, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared that the rights to conceive and to raise one’s children have been deemed “essential,” basic civil rights of man, and “far more precious … than property rights.”
There is no mystery to when human life begins. Just as the sun starts the day, fertilization starts a developing life which ends at death. Courts do not create genetic parentage or offspring; people do. There can be no uncreation of life—life can only end in death.
The courts got it wrong in 1857 when they declared that Dred Scott was not deserving of human rights. Ratified in 1865, the 13th Amendment ended one era of treating humans as property. Today’s courts are all too often depriving humans created through IVF of the unalienable rights with which they are endowed.
Human embryos are people, not property, and the lesson of slavery should cause all Americans to refuse to label any class as subhuman or unequal. The fates of embryonic children as decided by courts must be, as they are for any child, in their best interests. Rita Lowery Gitchell, Thomas More Society Special Counsel, has published and worked with private clients and public organizations on legal issues in advance reproductive technology, particularly with embryo fate decisions."
Don't Minimize Conservative Concerns About Big Tech Censorship,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/dont-minimize-conservative-concerns-big-tech-censorship/,"By Emily Jashinsky June 10, 2019
One glaring lesson of the last four years is that making assumptions about the Republican electorate is a dangerous game. Yet I’m told in the pages of National Review it’s a “blunt truth” that “most red Americans either don’t know or don’t care about social-media censorship.”
I wouldn’t be so bold as to assume “most,” in fact, do care. But the signs are hard to miss. That’s why I was genuinely baffled to come across this paragraph in David French’s take on the Steven Crowder controversy:
Here’s the blunt truth, however — most red Americans either don’t know or don’t care about social-media censorship. They certainly don’t care enough to delete their apps. This isn’t a market failure; it’s a market verdict. Apathy rules, and this apathy is sustained in part because social-media companies have chosen their targets carefully. There are few normal Americans who want to jump off their favorite app because YouTube censored someone who uses phrases like ‘lispy queer’ or because Facebook ditched Alex Jones, a man who claimed the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax.
“Those who do truly care about censorship are a rounding error in the market,” French continues. “They’re part of the tiny slice of American citizens who are not only engaged in online conservative politics, they’re motivated enough to do something about censorship.”
First, there is an important distinction between not caring and not caring enough to delete your apps that is lost in the argument above. It’s of course possible to have serious concerns about a service and still use it regularly (a position with which many conservatives are familiar). Concern and apathy can exist alongside one another. Given other factors, it makes little sense to read the “market verdict” in this case as an indication that Republican social media users don’t care about viewpoint discrimination.
A Media Research Center/McLaughlin & Associates poll conducted less than a year ago found that 65 percent of self-described conservatives “believe social media companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are intentionally censoring conservatives and conservative ideas from their sites” and 66 percent “said they do not trust Facebook to treat all of its users equally regardless of their political beliefs.” But less than 7 percent said they stopped using Facebook “because of its censorship of conservatives.”
A Pew survey conducted last May-June found “Republicans and Republican leaners are around twice as likely as Democrats to say [major technology companies] are less ethical than others (30% vs. 16%).” It also found 44 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners believe those companies should be regulated more than they are currently.
Second, I’m as sensitive to the perils of the online bubble as anyone. I don’t think concerns about social media censorship are confined to it, and am surprised that even needs to be said. Specific dust-ups like the Crowder controversy may not meaningfully penetrate the media diets of average Republicans, but the sheer volume of such stories almost certainly means the broader point does. And there are many signs to suggest Big Tech has become a kitchen table issue, even beyond the GOP base.
Censorship is, of course, only one element of the larger package of conservative concerns with Big Tech. But evidence suggests it’s a big one. Consider, for instance, Fox News’s frequent coverage of these cases. Even if it started as a top-down campaign to stoke ire over censorship (which I doubt), the network’s ongoing focus suggests its large audience is absolutely concerned. Consider also how doggedly conservative politicians like Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn), and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) have focused on social media censorship, deliberately elevating it to a major campaign issue.
As Federalist Publisher Ben Domenech wrote in Friday morning’s Transom:
[I]t is no accident that one of the most accurate pollsters in the business also advises Senator Josh Hawley, the most vocal Senator on this subject. Not all politicians are guided by polls, but they are guided in how they talk about issues by polls. And it is very clear that there’s a shift going on in the way that politicians talk about Silicon Valley and Social Media, and that’s definitely showing up in their internal polls.
Ben further illustrated how censorship has likely grown from a strictly online concern to a kitchen table issue:
If you want to know why, just consider this: internet activists hear about people like Steven Crowder. What you don’t hear about is the local realtor who put a Trump sign in their lawn, and because of that, the neighborhood listserv and Nextdoor app filled up with people campaigning to nuke their Google mentions, respond to their Facebook page with constant harassment, and deface their ads in the neighborhood, calling them a white supremacist. That is not a major story. It is not even a minor story. But it is the sort of story that radicalizes a church, a community, a group of likeminded people… and then you start looking for politicians who take this issue on.
Also consider, if you must, the White House’s heavy focus on social media censorship. It’s true this president dwells in the Twitter bubble, but “most red Americans” listen to him, and he’s often better at tapping into the concerns of the electorate than those of us behind our keyboards.
To be sure, the priorities of our conservative politicians and media outlets aren’t always in line with the priorities of the Republican electorate. I don’t think most Republicans are freaking out over Crowder, and I agree that concerns over censorship have not meaningfully impacted the market. I disagree that either of those points indicates average Republicans don’t care much about the issue, especially given the mounting attention it’s received from Fox News, high-profile GOP politicians, and a president popular with his party.
To assert with such confidence that “most red Americans either don’t know or don’t care about social-media censorship” seems very unwise indeed, especially in light of previous failures to develop an accurate and complete understanding of the Republican base.

Why Conservatives Should Stop Giving To Arts Organizations,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/conservatives-stop-giving-arts-organizations/,"By David Marcus June 10, 2019
It’s no big secret that arts organizations in the United States skew incredibly leftist in comparison with the general citizenry’s ideas and attitudes. It is almost axiomatic that our theater companies and museums are operated by and support the art of people with left-leaning politics and social views. It is something we just take for granted, as if artists by their very nature will always tend to be leftists.
But leftist hegemony over the arts is not merely the product of some genetic feature of artistic types that makes them prefer Democrats to Republicans. Another significant reason for this is the not-for-profit funding model used by the majority of country’s arts organizations. In most cases the successful arts organization is not the one that reaches out to audiences and generates the most earned income, but the ones that can keep the free donated money rolling in.
There are a number of reasons why a not-for-profit model will tend to make organizations leftist. The first is that the very nature of asking for money, rather than simply selling tickets, suggests some higher purpose for the arts than mere entertainment. At one point in time, this higher purpose was viewed to be the edification of citizens, providing them with a well-rounded understanding of culture. But increasingly that higher purpose has come to be activism, especially leftist activism. That leads conservative donors to a question: Should they be funding the arts?
Let’s take the example of Jubilee 2020, a project originally organized within the theater commons Howlround. The original concept behind the Jubilee was that for one year all of the theater produced on American stages would be written by women, people of color, the disabled, LGBT — well, it’s easier just to say anybody except straight, white, non-trans men.
The current website is a bit more coy about what exactly is intended, likely a result of accurate complaints that the Jubilee is engaging in discrimination, but the original intent still shines through. The essay defining the Jubilee has this polite little section telling white dudes to shut up: “This is also a time for straight, white men to rejoice, to witness, to listen, and to be fed for one year by the stories they’ve also been denied.”
Thus far, about 80 theater companies nationwide as well as some universities and even secondary schools have signed the pledge to produce only works written by the supposedly marginalized. Among these theaters are some of the nation’s best-known and most important, including HERE arts center in New York City, The Bloomsburg Theatre Ensemble in Pennsylvania, Arena Stage in Washington DC, and the Marin Shakespeare Company in California. These are not outliers. In fact, they are a fairly representative cross-section of the not-for-profit arts world. That is to say, this level of political correctness is fairly uniform across the arts.
In addition to direct government grants to these companies, which is a whole other story, as 501(c)3 corporations they receive millions of dollars in tax-deductible donations. Now if one is a conservative who believes that people should be treated as individuals, not representatives of their race, sex, or any other identity, if one believes in equal opportunity rather than redistributed opportunity, if one believes that human beings ought not be defined by their demographic proximity to historical oppression, but rather by their unique experiences and abilities, then how can one give money to organizations dedicated to the exact opposite?
Now, I know the receptions are nice. And celebrities come out and you get to mingle with them. They tolerate you for a few minutes to help the theater company or arts space they are shilling for. That’s fun, and nice. You get photos to put on Instagram. I get it. But maybe you should stop. Because every dollar you give them feeds a fecund and fierce hatred of basic American values.
And it isn’t just identity politics. Non-profit arts organizations often create content in support of gun control and abortion. They create versions of Julius Caesar in which Donald Trump is stabbed to death on stage. Theatre Communications Group, the leading industry organization of non-profit theater companies, has as part of its mission “activism,” which it describes as a “fight for effective cultural and economic policies.”
Arts organizations do all of this based on the support of taxpayers and donors. When conservatives pull out their checkbooks, thinking, “My, how wonderful and important it is to support the arts,” they should think twice. Not only are they very likely giving to organizations that actively promote a political and cultural agenda they oppose, they are also funding the development of artists who will go on to write our television shows and movies, who will help to enact progressive cultural change without any significant input from the American people.
Some argue that without this funding the arts will simply disappear, that conservatives should hold their nose and give because no art is worse than art that supports a progressive agenda. But this is a stupid argument. Art is one of the oldest and most fundamentally human phenomenon that exists. There will never be a time when there is no art. Even when governments actively try to suppress art, people make art.
Would moving the arts to a free-market model change them? Yes, absolutely. It would look and feel different, but art is a living thing. It is meant to change. Would moving the arts to a free model help break up the leftist hegemony? Here again the answer is likely yes.
There is one art form we can look to that is relatively untouched by the non-profit movement. Stand-up comedy exists almost entirely in the free market, and it is more or less the only art form that dares to mock the leftist shibboleths of identity politics and political correctness. Comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and Dave Chappelle regularly challenge the taboos of the left. The universe of stand up has room for the “unfunny” woke comedy of a Hannah Gadsby, but it also has Bill Burr taking aim at progressives.
The rest of our art, our plays, operas, ballets, and museum exhibits should reflect the wide range of American political and social views that stand-up does. Right now that is not the case. The best thing that conservatives can do to fix it is to stop giving. Stop feeding a system that we can blatantly see is a breeding ground for leftist ideologies. Let a new system emerge to create art that better reflects what America truly is.

The Toronto School Board's New Marxist 'Dress Code' Is A Huge Red Flag,thefederalist.com,Joshua Lawson,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/toronto-school-boards-new-marxist-dress-code-huge-red-flag/,"By Joshua Lawson June 10, 2019
The Toronto District School Board recently announced changes to their official dress code. Shaping the direction of the new code is the TDSB’s push to ensure that school attire reflects “individual expression of identity, socio-cultural norms, and economic factors,” which it deems “important factors to a person’s health and well-being.”
What has so far caused the most controversy is that the new policy allows students to wear hats in class while the national anthem plays at the start of the day. In a tone-deaf move, the news broke the morning Canadians were paying their respects to those who fought at Juno Beach on D-Day.
It’s the second blow against the Canadian anthem in the last two years. Back in early 2018, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shut down debate in the House of Commons and pushed through legislation that changed the lyrics of “O Canada” to become “gender neutral,” replacing the lyric “in all thy sons command” with the awkwardly forced “in all of us command.” Removing Your Hat to Show Respect Goes Back Centuries
The tradition of removing your hat in certain situations goes back hundreds of years . It was a sign of reverence to God when entering a church or addressing someone of higher rank. This subsequently entered Western culture as a sign of admiration or respect.
Not so long ago, taking one’s hat off during the anthem, while entering a building, while praying, or while eating was universally observed etiquette. Such actions recognized that there were situations, spaces, and people deserving of respect. In this case, that would be respect showed to the business of schooling and to the country that pays for and provides that schooling.
Even on the 19th-century frontier, it was customary for men to take off their hats when talking to women. Why? Women were held in high esteem and all men knew they deserved to be treated with a certain level of decency. Now? Policies like the TDSB’s new dress code reinforce the end of deference that has been seeping into the culture. This Is Radical Leftism Masquerading as a Dress Code
This isn’t about the fact that there are too many bare midriffs, low-riding pants, and spaghetti-strap tops in schools—and there are—this is about propogating an insidious ideology. The TDSB’s rationale for the new dress code policy makes this clear:
Historically, school dress codes have been written and enforced in ways that disproportionately and negatively impact: female-identified students, racialized students, gender diverse, transgender and non-binary students, students with disabilities, socioeconomically marginalized students and Indigenous, First Nation, Métis, and Inuit students. Focused, explicit, persistent and determined action is required to challenge and overcome this history.
This is postmodern neo-Marxism dressed up in meaningless odes to “inclusivity” and “diversity.” It’s leftism 101, and like everything it touches, it’s destroying school culture.
The radical postmodernists reject objective truth, facts, and all other sources of tradition or meaning—in fact, they reject the concept of meaning itself. Neo-Marxists, in turn, believe that all history should be viewed as a story of the “oppressed” versus their “oppressors” (note the TDSB policy’s absurd line about using the new dress code to somehow “challenge” and “overcome” historical slights). Add those two treacherous doctrines and voila! you get the new TDSB dress code.
For the leftists running the education system, dress codes shouldn’t make anyone feel “oppressed” or be grounded in any objective, traditional standards. They must also apparently be wrapped in a banner of apology for the perceived sins of every white man in history. Nothing redresses colonialism’s centuries-old injustices like allowing teenagers to wear spaghetti-strap tops, pajamas, and onesies to school. Even the New ‘Standards’ Are Meaningless
The very name of TDSB’s new policy reflects a fall of standards. The policy document that used to be titled “Appropriate Dress” is now just called “Student Dress.” Why? Using the word “appropriate” implies a judgment call involving a measure of objective truth. The postmodernists can’t have that. Once you start labeling some things “appropriate,” people might get the radical idea that other things may be “inappropriate.” That brings up crazy notions of “right” or “wrong” and before you know it, we’re executing heretics like it’s 1692.
Not all standards have been washed away by the TDBS’s new policy, however. Sure, students can now openly parade exposed stomachs, midriffs, cleavage, thighs, and hips. But don’t worry. The new policy specifies that “bottom layers must cover groin and buttocks and top layers must cover nipples.” If that doesn’t finally crush the oppressive cisnormative patriarchy, I don’t know what will.
At its heart, this is about more than just hats, anthems, or the tiny, opaque bits of fabric required to cover your unmentionables. And the problem isn’t relegated to loonie school boards in Toronto, Canada. The fact that education systems are now dominated by leftists is a problem that affects the entire continent. Student’s Don’t Know What’s Best
Allowing students to wear hats during the national anthem is emblematic of a much wider problem in school culture—one that has become far too casual, irreverent, and focused on student tastes. Most education in North America now focuses on making school “experience” fun and comfortable.
As award-winning education author Cheryl Lowe once put it, “there is a lost art of taking school seriously.” The lack of gravitas in most North American classrooms should worry every parent with school-aged children, as well as all those concerned about future generations.
Proper education requires a certain level of seriousness combined with systematic, formal instruction. Classrooms should be quiet, orderly, and driven by respected teachers who function as the expert—ideally because they are experts. Modern education, however, places the students as experts. Students call the shots now in most classrooms, not teachers. This is how you get dress codes that cater to students’ whims.
Instead of boards and teachers establishing objective rules of etiquette and decorum, the “standards” that do exist in schools today are often set by the students. After all, what high schooler isn’t an expert on modesty and virtue? This is the inmates running the asylum.
In most schools now, students “teach” each other, engage in “project-based learning,” and control the pace of the classroom. An emphasis on play, discovery, and exploration might be appropriate for preschool. However, carrying these priorities into K-12 education has been, in the analysis of Lowe, “the single most destructive influence in education today.” Schools Need to Address Their Gravitas Deficit
The casual atmosphere that accompanies these student-catered standards and practices reveals itself in several ways. A growing number of students refer to teachers by their first names, hang out with them on the weekends, and know everything about their personal lives.
A teacher’s area at the front of the room used to be protected by a halo of reverence. Now, it’s common for students to grab items off the teacher’s desk or sit in his chair when it’s free. Teachers used to be seen by students as mentors and exemplars. Now, many teachers try to make students their best friends. This lack of decorum and respect further erodes the gravitas deficit facing our schools today.
The TDSB’s new lax dress code that also allows students to disrespect the national anthem is just a symptom of an entire system that is in deep trouble. Education must re-embrace the teaching of respect, the value of tradition, the need for virtue, and objective standards of etiquette. Until then, any attempt at academic excellence will be a fantasy, and the cultural rot will continue to fester.

Inside Gaming’s Latest Revolt Against The Social Justice Left,thefederalist.com,Joel Kurtinitis,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/inside-gamings-latest-revolt-social-justice-left/,"By Joel Kurtinitis June 10, 2019
Jeremy Hambly has a foot in two worlds, and a YouTube channel for each. The bearded, bespectacled YouTuber has become popular for his pointed commentary on gaming and entertainment, published daily on his main channel, The Quartering .
He analyzes gaming news, delivers blistering critiques of game publishers and game journalists, and even dives into the occasional Hollywood drama. His content is edgy, sarcastic, informative, fun, and ferocious. He also maintains a second channel, called Midwestly , in which he analyzes a different kind of game: politics. The topics often aren’t as far apart as he—and many other gamers—would like.
To combat the blending of the worlds, Hambly launched Exclusively Games , a site dedicated to gaming and escapism, without the contrived social justice narratives and political nonsense he sees as having fractured the broader gaming world. He says the response so far has been incredible.
“With no industry to support, essentially nobody covering the project, we raised almost $150,000 and put together a site that is growing in traffic consistently every single week. We’re adding additional new features every single week, the forum’s growing every single week, the Discord’s growing every single week,” Hambly said of the new site.
One purpose of the new site is to present an alternative to agenda-driven journalism from mainstream game sites pushing a one-sided political narrative.
“I believe strongly we can drive more engagement and have more visitors than Kotaku, Polygon, and all these other sites combined, without ever touching a single bit of their audience. I think their audience is very narrow, and they’ve built it over ten years, you know, many years building these things with huge marketing budgets,” said Hambly. “I think the market for actual content like this is far more vast, and I think we’re proving it with YouTube. YouTube is dominated by a dude in front of a camera. My channel, The Quartering, consistently gets more views than some of the mainstream shows on CNN in a day.”
The numbers back it up. The Quartering boasts more than a half-million subscribers on YouTube, and strong support from legions of loyal gamers. But the success has come at a cost. Hambly’s channel is frequently targeted, both by non-gamer social justice warriors (SJWs), and by the game and tech journalists who carry their water.
And the hammer came down this week. Just one day after the #VoxAdpocalypse perpetrated by Vox journalist Carlos Maza, tech journal CNET used similar tactics to go after The Quartering’s advertisers in a shockingly pointed hit piece , and got many of them to drop. Predictably, the piece took time and space to finger-wag Hambly’s comments on forced diversity, SJWs, and feminism, in a stunning validation of what the content creator has been saying all along.
“I think a lot of the editorials that you read… they’ll call people toxic. And you can only call people toxic so long before they’re like, ‘No, wait a minute, I’m kind of tired of hearing this. I’m tired of being blamed, being used as a marketing tool,’” said Hambly. “It’s the whole reason the media still brings up Gamergate, five years after anyone has cared about it. It’s because they continually need a reason to dump on people, and I think people have had enough of that.” Gamers Just Wanna Game
The CNET piece is a case study in bad journalism and classic projection that spends 3,000-plus words accusing gamers of the same things critics have thrown at them for years: ragebaiting users and mining hateclicks. But anyone who regularly watches the named content creators can easily identify a theme missing from their tech-and-game-journal counterparts: leave us the bleep alone.
The popularity of these YouTubers, which CNET and other popular publications attribute to “ YouTube Radicalization ” and general bigotry, has a much simpler explanation: with nearly all major game sites run, and often funded, by lockstep leftists in Silicon Valley, YouTube is the only place people can go for alternate perspectives.
That’s part of why Hambly started The Quartering in the first place: “I felt like there was a hole and an opportunity for more voices in the conversation that, at least in my opinion, more accurately represented the community,” he said. “There were so many voices that clearly, in my opinion, have ulterior motives; these are like the mainstream video game journalism outlets. And even among my fellow commentators, there are many of them that are bought and paid for.”
In another corner of the web, another YouTube powerhouse agrees. Kelly Van Achte, a.k.a. The Act Man, is a popular game reviewer and self-styled epic gamer who boasts nearly 600,000 subscribers and regularly reviews the good, the bad, and the ugly in mainstream games. While he wants to focus on gaming and reviews, he frequently finds himself dragged back into political debates by the social justice elements Hambly also decries.
In one video bluntly titled “Stop Politicizing Video Games,” The Act Man unloaded both barrels on game developers and game journalists who seem more interested in politics than in producing and reporting on things gamers actually care about.
“There’s this growing concept that if you make a game based around war or any part of politics in the past, present, or future, there’s this growing expectation that you have to make a statement with this game. As in, the developers have to put their beliefs and agendas in the game and talk about them,” a frustrated Vanact said. “It’s just kind of this growing social justice agenda that’s really sinking its claws into everything… Gaming has become so big, so popular, such a big industry, that these parasites just want to latch onto it and create issues where none exist because they have nothing better to do with their lives.”
He has also been targeted by the outrage mob, and observes that the cost of insufficient fealty to social justice orthodoxy is often exclusion: “There’s this dynamic within game developers and the way they look at content creators, even people like me: you either stay out of it completely, or you take their side…because if not, well you might not get invited to events because you don’t think the same way that they do politically.” ‘Hijacked by People Who Just Want to Complain’
Game enthusiasts like Hambly and Vanact aren’t looking for people to conform to their political views, they just want people to stop injecting partisan politics and cultural preachiness into one of the last, crumbling refuges from an increasingly polarized society. Vanact sums ups his frustration with the death of escapism this way:
Video games for a long time have been a sort of haven for all sorts of people: social outcasts, people with disabilities, those who don’t have many friends. Video games are a way for people of all walks of life to just come together and enjoy something and be able to play it, and discuss it, and just have fun and enjoy life. But in these last few years, the glory days of simpler times are starting to slip away, and what we’re starting to see is the politicization of video games… Meaning that when a new game comes out, there are people who will write articles, or complain, and say this game needs to make a point about racial issues in the world today, and then there’s people that just want to enjoy this product for what it is. It seems like the game industry, and a lot of people who work in it, and a lot of journalists, a lot of people who write about it, it’s being hijacked…It’s being hijacked by people who just want to complain, bicker, and moan, and want to be right about something.
Meanwhile, the push to politicize gaming continues on all fronts. While game journalists and developers continue to foist narratives from their platforms, some politicians have taken a more direct approach.
In January, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) made an appearance on a gaming livestream to discuss transgender issues, and mainstream tech and game journals gushed . Hambly compared the stunt to the popular “How do you do, fellow kids?” meme , and doesn’t think it will do much to sway the game community to her political brand.
“Above all it has to come from a place of sincerity. And the gaming community at large, the one I try to speak to, can smell a fake from a mile away. So while AOC got some positive pub from being on that stream, most people in the gaming community were making fun of her,” he said. Still Waiting for Their Moment to Take the Stage
But at least the left is trying. The traditionally tech-challenged political right has yet to begin sowing in the highly libertarian soil of the game community. As early as 2012, Democratic candidates and causes were running ads on platforms like YouTube and XBOX Live. The outgunned Mitt Romney campaign was nowhere to be found.
But with the far-left declaring war on gamers, there’s an opening for the libertarian right to swell their ranks with the passionate, influential, and tech-savvy activists who make up the gaming resistance. Hambly sees opportunities to make gains with “new conservatives” by focusing on issues gamers care about: internet freedom, unfair lootboxing practices , and big tech censorship .
The longer these issues remain unaddressed, the more gamers will be pushed to temporarily shelve online escapism and engage in more direct political activism—a (tactical) nuclear option for which the left may not be prepared. With solid online infrastructure, broad influence, and fundraising experience under his belt, Hambly has seriously considered running for office, and joked that the only thing keeping him away is hesitance to part with his signature wild-man beard.
In a nation that elected a reality TV star president in 2016, it’s not a reach to suggest that today’s YouTube influencers could be the representatives and governors of tomorrow. But until that influence is translated, gamers will continue to flex their online muscle in this boss battle, defending escapism and working to ensure companies that peddle social justice narratives instead of real game content meet their expected end: Get woke, go broke.

Are Pro-Choicers Okay With The Black Baby Death Toll? - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/intersectionality-lie-pro-choicers-okay-black-baby-death-toll/,"June 10, 2019 By Stephanie Curry
“The right doesn’t actually care about black or brown babies.” I have seen viral variations of this quote on social media countless times the past couple of weeks, amidst pro-life victories in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Ohio, and more.
I listened as Alyssa Milano claimed that protecting the preborn would be “catastrophic” for black women. I was deeply disturbed as major news outlets flooded readers with arguments that black women would be hurt the most by pro-life laws, even to the point of enslaving them once again. And I was in utter disbelief when Ohio state Rep. Janine Boyd proposed an amendment to a bill that would only allow black mothers to have an abortion.
The left thrives on recklessly leveraging race. They inflame and foment racial differences until their voters are hysterical over the idea that slavery is returning to our country at the hands of the pro-life movement. The left’s frenzied panic and outlandish claims compel me to respond to the insidious lie that “the right doesn’t actually care about black and brown babies.”
I am black. I am pro-life. And I do care. I think I can speak for all pro-lifers when I say we care about all pre-born babies—babies so early in development that they don’t even have a skin color yet. Regrettably, it is the left that has a race problem at its core, and this problem is as old as the institution of slavery.
It is the left, in fact, that worships an organization that was birthed out of the racist ideas of its founder, Margaret Sanger. She was a staunch proponent of the contemptible, progressive, eugenics movement—the discredited philosophical concept that “undesirable” people should be eliminated from the gene pool of the human race. “Undesirables” like the poor, illiterate, disabled, and the dark-skinned.
Unfortunately, Sanger’s degenerate beliefs led her to work very closely and intentionally with the black community, “assuring” them that her goal was not to “ exterminate the Negro population.” America’s intricate strategy to dovetail racist policies and eugenics was so effective that it was studied by one Adolf Hitler, and the horrors of the eugenics movement were fully realized in the unspeakable atrocities of the Holocaust.
Fast-forward to today, and Sanger’s early organization, the American Birth Control League, has become today’s Planned Parenthood, and the intentional targeting of America’s minorities continues. It appears that 79 percent of Planned Parenthood’s surgical abortion facilities are within walking distance of black and brown neighborhoods. Indeed, more than 19 million black babies have been aborted since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973, effectively reducing the size of today’s black community by 40 to 50 percent!
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 36 percent of all abortions in the United States are performed on black women, despite the fact that they represent just 13 percent of the population. Hispanic babies are also aborted at 1.5 times the rate of white babies, making up 18 percent of all aborted babies. Essentially, more members of the black community are killed by abortion each year in the United States than by all other causes combined.
Despite the intentional targeting of poor and minority communities that has persisted across the decades, Sanger’s strategy to ensure that blacks remain unaware of their extermination has worked perfectly, with both pro-choice blacks and their allies insisting on their right to choose .
More than 100 years ago, the “pro-choice” party of today insisted that the institution of slavery was also a choice to which every state was entitled. Their platform was that each state should have the right to choose whether slavery was a morally acceptable option for its own citizens. In addition, states were not allowed to impose their moral beliefs about slavery on others because slavery was a constitutionally protected right.
If leftists were truly staunch advocates of racial equality and harmony, they should be moved to address the fact that the face of abortion has a color. They should be compelled to address the fact their pro-choice platform of a century past has resulted in tens of millions of lives lost, a great many of them black. Pro-lifers understand that a law that is ruled to be “constitutional” can still be morally reprehensible.
So the next time you hear someone on the left claiming that the right doesn’t care about brown and black babies, know that it’s a lie designed to cover up their own shameful past and present. The truth is this: Regardless of political philosophy, no one is doing more to protect brown and black babies than the pro-life movement."
What Happened When I Tried Out The Belmont Stakes Horse Race,thefederalist.com,,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/happened-novice-tried-belmont-stakes-horse-race/,"By Libby Emmons June 10, 2019
I’d never been to the races, so when an invitation came along to join a group of friends and witness the third leg of the Triple Crown—the Belmont Stakes—I had to do it. On a glorious Saturday spring morning, I boarded the Long Island Rail Road and headed out to the track.
By the time I was embedded in a sea of pastel, preppy twenty-somethings on the train I figured I should get some understanding of horse racing, and the horses we’d be seeing compete. Turns out there would be 13 races, different horses in each one, with the 11th race being the official Belmont Stakes.
More exciting than picking a horse was picking my hat. I took selfies in my best four hats (I only have four hats) and sent them to friends to help me pick. We settled on a simple summer hat, with a vibrant Pucci scarf and a prim, navy blue dress. I don’t have lots of chances to get dressed up, so I embraced it, in my prim, navy blue way. I donned my hat as I stepped off the train at Belmont Park. I still didn’t know anything about the horses.
Gambling is one of the only vices I’ve had no trouble rejecting, for the simple reason that I find no joy in being tense about money. But I am all about embracing an experience, fully embarking upon everything it has to over, and as such, I figured it wouldn’t be an authentic day at the races if I didn’t put down some cash. I dedicated $20 to the enterprise, more interested in snacks and rosé on this lovely, sunny day.
I purchased an overpriced but right on time sparking rosé and proceeded to the window to place my bet. I was intercepted by a rep from New York Racing Association (NYRA), who told me there was an app for that. I downloaded it and got my first look at the horses in all the races. A quick glance at the horses’ names gave me inspiration. Intrepid Heart was a 10-1 shot in the 11th, and based on the glory of name alone, I knew that was my horse. I have an intrepid heart, so I figured we were simpatico.
I uploaded $20 to my betting account and doled out small sums across the first 11 races. Still, it had the feeling of an anti-climax. Most of the betting windows had touch screens, which also had an inauthentic feel. I wanted to be part of this place, and to be part of a place means to communicate with the people of that place. I made my way to a betting window with an actual person behind the glass.
The woman behind the window accepted my $15 and gave me two slips, which I carefully tucked into my wallet. My betting was now up to $35. For all the high spenders out there, I’m sure this is chump change, but for my freelancing self, this was big spending. I started to get a sense of how betting on the horses can become something of an obsession. It made the races more exciting to have money on the line, but more than that, the outlay of a bet brings with it a feeling of hope and anticipation.
So long as the race isn’t yet run, and my horse hadn’t yet lost (spoiler alert: my horse lost), I had the fantasy of a big payout, and all the things I could do with that money. Waiting to see if you’re a winner opens a door in your imagination. It was a joy to live in hope.
Horse racing has come under scrutiny with a spate of recent horse deaths. Since late December, 27 horses have died at Santa Anita, California, and NPR recently reported that Kentucky underreports horse fatalities. Activist organizations want to put a stop to racing, saying that the conditions are inhumane and that there’s no other sport where the athletes are treated as chattel, drugged, doped, and whipped without their consent.
In watching the horses hurl themselves around the track, they for sure look fragile. Their spindly legs hold up these giant bodies, with jockey near hovering atop, riding stirrups more than the saddle. They run in a clump, a tangle, each horse and rider vying for position. An ambulance follows the pack at a short distance. The danger of the enterprise is front and center.
The trumpets announced each race, just like in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. With every race, the drunkenness of the crowd increased. In the 8th, I had money on Hog Creek Hustle to place, and he won, but there was an inquiry about interference with horse number nine. He was exonerated, and we all cheered for him, and for ourselves. I’d tell you what his odds were, but I don’t really know. I won $7.60 on my $1 bet.
We snuck up to the clubhouse level earlier in the day and it really would have been worth the price of admission. The general admission level began to take its toll on the young crowd, where the event was as much an opportunity to try on their most obnoxious drunken personalities and awkwardly grope each other as it was to place a wager. The scene devolved into a drunken mess before the 10th. The heels start breaking apart. The girls cry into their cell phones on benches, the bros looking even more desperate in their beer-dampened petal pink button-downs and deck shoes.
All the races seem to have names, but the only ones I caught were the Manhattan, which was the 10th, and of course the 11th. Between the 10th and the 11th, the final leg of the Triple Crown—the Belmont Stakes—for which the day is named, is an hour interlude. It’s a long hour. Standing in the sun with a bunch of inebriated finance bros drunk on Belmont Juleps and ego is headache-inducing.
If you’re gonna go, here are some tips: You need only cash, and a credit card for when you run out of that; you need sunscreen if you burn. You need a sense of humor, sunglasses, and if you don’t normally wear heels or just aren’t that into bondage, wear flats. You need a cute dress, but make sure it’s comfortable, and effectively covers your rear so that when you’re too drunk to remember to cover your rear, your cute dress picks up the slack.
Do not forget your hat. It does not matter if you’re not a hat person, just go with a fascinator like a British royal wedding, and keep it on. It doesn’t matter if you feel silly; that’s at least half the point. Make sure to have a good breakfast. You’re gonna be drinking in the sun all day, and you don’t want to end up a complete disaster by the end.
The buildup to the Belmont Stakes was really exciting. By that time, I’d thoroughly embraced the experience. Intrepid Heart was number eight, and I kept my eye on the board. I strained to hear the commentary over the loudspeaker but could hear nothing intelligible over the roar of the crowd.
By the time the horses left the gate, I had all my hopes and dreams for my future pinned on at least a showing for Intrepid Heart. My imagination was captured by the name. Even so, the loss wasn’t particularly devastating, given I got to experience some of the best people-watching around. Libby Emmons is a writer and theatre maker in Brooklyn, New York.

Requiring Work For Medicaid Went Well In Arkansas Until A Judge,thefederalist.com,Victoria Eardley,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/requiring-people-work-get-medicaid-went-really-well-arkansas-judge-stopped/,"By Victoria Eardley June 10, 2019
Since 2000, the number of able-bodied adults using Medicaid quadrupled nationwide. The program is one of the chief costs for state governments, squeezing other priorities.
When last summer Arkansas became the first state to require Medicaid recipients to work in exchange for taxpayer-provided health care, welfare advocates would have had you believing the world was ending: health coverage for the needy was being slashed, the reporting process was too complex, and those who lost coverage didn’t even know about the requirement. On and on the hysteria went.
But those apoplectic claims were far from reality . Arkansas’ work requirement was a big step towards restoring the state Medicaid program to its objective. It was saving taxpayers money, freeing up resources for the truly needy, and—notably—changing people’s lives for the better.
What critics of the requirement neglected to disclose were the thousands of people who found work as a result of the reform—some for the first time in years. These folks went from a life of government dependency to a life of independence, an undeniably better future for both themselves and their families. These are real people, with real stories, reported by the Arkansas Department of Workforce Services in late 2018.
Consider Jeff, who was unemployed for more than nine months when he found he was subject to the Medicaid work requirement. He worked with his local workforce center to look for a job, immediately matching with employers in the area.
Now Jeff makes more than $17 an hour in an industry where he’ll likely grow, further increasing his income. That’s the power of work.
Take it from Jeff himself: “I now work with a great company—in a job that I actually would not have gotten without the help from Department of Workforce Services. They have given me an opportunity to provide a better life for my family and I can’t and won’t be able to thank them enough.”
Then there’s Julia, who decided to use education to fulfill the work requirement. She enrolled at North Arkansas College and now attends class four days a week, working once a week as a certified nursing assistant at a local long-term care facility.
Without the work requirement, Julia wouldn’t have had the opportunity—or the push—to take the next step in her career, changing her life through education and work. Her story also serves as a reminder that those subject to the requirement had more than 12 different ways to meet it, a fact critics ignored time and time again.
Here’s the truth: Jeff and Julia’s stories aren’t anomalies. After the requirement went into action, more than 9,200 expansion adults found jobs.
Only a small fraction of case closures were the result of non-compliance. Instead, more than 14,000 individuals left the program due to increased incomes. The work requirement empowered them to move from government dependency to financial independence.
There’s a reason Arkansans—and the majority of Americans— support Medicaid work requirements. Simply put, they work. Arkansans have seen the effects first-hand. They don’t need liberal judges and outsiders telling them otherwise: they’ve seen the proof.
By the end of 2018, Arkansans were on track to save at least $300 million per year because of the decline in enrollment. This was welcome news, given that Arkansas’ Medicaid budget has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2013 and is now more than double the state’s entire education budget. The work requirement put the state on a path towards a more sustainable program. Had the work requirement remained intact, there’s no doubt that the savings would have continued.
Unfortunately, a court halted the life-changing success of the Medicaid work requirement, thwarting budget savings and leaving thousands of Arkansans without the opportunity to lift themselves from welfare. More than 4,000 able-bodied adults immediately returned to the program once the work requirement was paused.
But Arkansans should take hope. The state has committed to fighting for work requirements, and the Trump administration has appealed the ruling. That’s great news for Arkansans—and Americans everywhere: they’ll soon be empowered to change their lives once again.

"In Ignoring FBI Info, Are The Media Protecting MLK Or ‘Call-Out Culture’?",thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/ignoring-nasty-fbi-info-media-protecting-mlk-call-culture/,"By Warren Henry June 10, 2019
Martin Luther King Jr. biographer David Garrow recently wrote an article in the British magazine Standpoint on FBI files alleging King’s adulteries were more prolific than previously known (including an orgy) and he may have fathered a child with one of his mistresses. More explosively, the reports allege King laughed and offered advice to a friend committing sexual assault in his presence.
In response, The Federalist ran an article by Ellie Bufkin concerned that the latest allegations should not negate the greatness of King’s achievements. This concern was misplaced. The establishment media in America not only refused to run the column Garrow pitched, but largely ignored it after it was published in the United Kingdom. The story was kept off television , but for one segment by Laura Ingraham and one by Tucker Carlson.
The two flagships of American establishment journalism—The New York Times and the Washington Post —not only turned down the story, but ran articles attacking both it and Garrow.
Moreover, the personal attacks on Garrow do not appear to bear much relationship to his scholarship in this matter. For example, the Post column claims Garrow’s biography of former president Barack Obama, “Rising Star,” was controversial because it was not a fawning hagiography .
On this point, the column includes an ad hominem quote from Obama biographer David Maraniss, who happens to be an associate editor at the Post. Perhaps the Post should be given credit for letting their masks drop.
The crux of the attacks on the story presume the Hoover-era FBI’s reporting on those they perceived as political threats is unreliable. In this case, as Garrow argued to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in trying to get them to publish the story, the reports summarize surveillance tapes, raising the question of why an agent would fabricate the most scandalous of episodes when the fabrication might be easily discovered. (The tapes were never destroyed and remain under judicial seal until 2027.)
Moreover, the concern over the accuracy of FBI reports seems rather selective. The press has reported for decades on the contents of John Lennon’s FBI files, despite the lack of surveillance audio that might prove or disprove their contents. Similarly, when Hillary Clinton was investigated for mishandling classified information, the establishment media was not scandalized by the FBI’s failure to record their interview of her .
This case is particularly ironic, as the new allegations against King come from records made public under the 1992 President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. A significant impetus for the passage of that law was Oliver Stone’s “JFK” (1991), an actual fevered conspiracy theory committed to film. Also, as recently as 2017, the Post ran a column arguing we should be thankful Stone’s paranoid propaganda helped create transparency about our history.
The records brought into the sunlight by this law could in turn spur legislative action to unseal King’s files, but the media—and the historians they chose to make their case—were too busy going on the attack to consider the opportunity. Or perhaps they would prefer this piece of the past be buried a while longer, then dismissed as “old news” in 2027.
Among major media outlets, Politico proved to be the exception, publishing a long analysis by history and journalism professor David Greenberg that criticizes the summary dismissal of the allegations and admits “they may well be accurate to a significant degree.”
Given the ferocity of the response to Garrow, it appears most media outlets are not interested in making that admission, largely because it would force them and the public to try answering the question Greenberg raises at the outset of his column: “What do you do when a great hero is alleged to have done something awful?”
Greenberg has a suggestion regarding what we should avoid:
Even if the ugliest charges against King are bolstered by additional evidence, that doesn’t mean we should talk about renaming Martin Luther King Day, tearing down statues of him, or stripping him of his Nobel Prize. In recent years, we’ve had altogether too much wrecking-ball history—history that takes public or private flaws or failings as reason to cast extraordinary men and women out of our political or artistic pantheons. Historians know that even the most admirable figures from our past were flawed, mortal beings—bad parents or bad spouses, capable of violence or cruelty, beholden to sexist or racist ideas, venal or megalomaniac, dishonest or predatory. Awareness of these qualities doesn’t mean despising figures once held up as heroes. Rather, it gives us a more complete and nuanced picture of the people who shaped our world.
For the establishment media to take the allegations against King seriously, even with all the appropriate caveats and nuanced framing, would involve wrestling with not only what they may say about King decades ago, but also the iconoclastic scourge of “ call-out culture ” today.
Do America’s establishment media fear that publishing Garrow’s story in a straight fashion would risk a swath of their core woke audiences turning on one of history’s greatest civil rights leaders? After all, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg does not think his party should honor Thomas Jefferson, who primarily authored the promissory note King ultimately marched on Washington to collect.
Prominent African-Americans like the Rev. Al Sharpton and former Congressional Black Caucus director Angela Rye believe statues of and monuments to Jefferson should be torn down because he owned slaves. Do they fear social media mobs would demand similar treatment for King? Are these questions too uncomfortable to ask people like Sharpton?
Perhaps worse, do America’s establishment media fear defending King would involve convincing their audience that cancel culture is wrong? Do they enjoy the political benefits of oppressive social media mobs so much they cannot bear to give them up?
Faced with those choices, it is sadly easy to see why the media has reacted with denial and vicious personal attacks. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois. Photo "
"Until SCOTUS Acts, Christians Will Be Punished For Thought Crimes",thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/supreme-court-acts-christians-will-punished-thought-crimes/,"By David Harsanyi June 10, 2019
If a long Struggle Session couldn’t break Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cake Shop, I doubt another frivolous lawsuit will do the trick.
Then again, the campaign to destroy Phillips’s business was never merely about punishing a single man for refusing to submit to prevailing leftist orthodoxy. It was also a warning to all would-be apostates that thought crimes could lead to fiscal ruin, public denunciation, and endless harassment. In that sense, the prosecution has probably already paid off.
Courts won’t put to rest the cultural debate over social issues. But it’s worth noting that it wasn’t howling protesters but the state-empowered Colorado Civil Rights Commission that attempted to destroy Phillips’s business when he refused to design a specialty cake for David Mullins and Charlie Craig’s gay wedding ceremony in 2012—before gay marriage was even legalized in Colorado or recognized by federal courts.
Even today, after getting it wrong for so long, mainstream news outlets like to report that Phillips refused “to bake a wedding cake” or denied a gay couple “service.” Phillips, however, didn’t query his customers about their sexual preferences or their preferred pronouns, nor did he bar anyone from purchasing any products made in his shop, a place of public accommodation. No, Colorado had attempted to compel a citizen to say something he didn’t believe.
After years of fiscal and personal struggles, Phillips finally prevailed, but only because of a narrow Supreme Court decision that found commissioners hadn’t displayed religious neutrality and exhibited “a clear and impermissible hostility toward [his] sincere religious beliefs” when pursuing Phillips. That is a nice way of saying commissioners had compared orthodox Christians to Nazis and segregationists—because nothing says “inclusion” like comparing a genteel baker in Lakewood to murderous SS officer.
In any event, the Colorado commissioners went after Phillips only one day after SCOTUS ruled in his favor. And on June 26, 2017, the day the Supreme Court agreed to hear Phillips’s case, the lawyer and transgender activist Autumn Scardina called Masterpiece Cakeshop, one of dozens of bakeries in the Denver area—there is one approximately a quarter of a mile from Masterpiece Cakeshop—and asked Phillips to design a custom cake with a blue exterior and a pink interior to symbolize a transition from male to female, or, as her lawyer now claims, her “birthday cake.”
Phillips turned Scardina down, because, well, he turns down every request for specialized cakes that aggravate his long-held religious views, and not only from customers who are gay or transgendered.
“I was stunned,” Scardina claimed in her complaint to the Civil Rights Commission. Scardina, of course, wasn’t stunned, at all. The activist didn’t happen to fortuitously contact the most famous Christian baker in the country to make a “transition” cake on the very day SCOTUS took on his case. Scardina was part of a mob that had been harassing Phillips.
Previously, Scardina—going by “Autumn Marie” and other monikers—was the one who allegedly asked for “an image of Satan smoking marijuana.” In another request from “the Church of Satan”— also, according to a complaint, likely Scardina—Phillips was asked to make “a three-tiered white cake” with a “large figure of Satan, licking a nine inch black Dildo.” How creative, right? “I would like the dildo to be an actual working model that can be turned on before we unveil the cake,” went the request.
The Colorado Civil Rights Commission ended up dropping the case against Phillips, not because the attack was a transparent way to punish Phillips for his beliefs, but because the Alliance Defending Freedom sued Colorado in federal court and they would surely have lost.
Next time, though, commissioners in Colorado and elsewhere will, no doubt, be more careful about their public statements. What stops them from a destroying a business then? Very little, apparently.
The Supreme Court has another chance, after punting on the central issue in the Masterpiece decision, to re-affirm that religious Americans can’t be compelled to abandon their free expression and religious liberty simply because they’ve decided to enter the marketplace.
A case now in front of the court revolves around another ham-fisted authoritarian, Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian, who attempted to fine a small establishment called Sweet Cakes by Melissa into submission when the owners refused to design a wedding cake for the same-sex couple in 2013. The state demanded that Aaron and Melissa Klein pay $135,000 in “emotional damages” to a wounded lesbian couple—just in case anyone still believes this isn’t about hurt feelings.
We won’t know what court has decided until June 27, at the earliest. But SCOTUS could effectively strip these extra-constitutional “civil rights” commissions, which have become little more than star chambers that punish citizens for wrongthink, of much of their power.
It might even undermine frivolous lawsuits. In Colorado, for example, Scardina filed yet another suit against Phillips, this time in Denver District Court. “The dignity of all citizens in our state needs to be honored. Masterpiece Cakeshop said before the Supreme Court they would serve any baked good to members of the LGBTQ community. It was just the religious significance of it being a wedding cake,” her lawyer said.
Although it’s true that bullies like Scardina don’t have much dignity, it has nothing to do with their gender identity. Nor is it the bailiwick of government to find it for them. There are numerous people in this country who believe transgendered Americans suffer from mental illness, but not one can compel Scardina to take on those cases. In the same way, Scardina shouldn’t be able to coerce a business owner into participating in her transition celebration.
But compelling the right kind of speech no longer seems a bothersome prospect to most progressives. Any neutral principles that are inherent in the First Amendment have long been discarded for more pressing matters of social justice.
So, while courts might not be able to stop this corrosion of liberalism, they can stop the state-sponsored attacks on individuals. At least for now.

Biden’s Reversal On Taxpayer-Sponsored Abortions Puts Blood In Water,thefederalist.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/bidens-reversal-taxpayer-sponsored-abortions-democrats-trump-smelling-blood/,"By Jonathan S. Tobin June 10, 2019
Former vice president Joe Biden has been campaigning with the confidence of a man who currently holds a 16.8 percent lead in the Real Clear Politics average of polls for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has mostly avoided venues where he might have a hostile audience — like the California Democratic Convention last week where John Hickenlooper was booed for criticizing socialism and praising pragmatism — and tried to avoid being entangled in questions of impeachment or the details of his proposals on health care.
His lead is built on three elements. One is name recognition. The second is his status as the stand-in for President Barack Obama, whom he served for eight years and whose presidency is now viewed as a lost golden age by despairing Democrats who are still coming to grips with the fact that Donald Trump is president of the United States. The third is the belief that Biden’s moderation compared to his competition in the primaries and his ability to connect with the working-class voters who helped elect Trump makes him the Democrat most likely to beat Trump in 2020.
But the problem with the latter is that while Biden would like to act as if the nomination is in the bag in order to concentrate on winning back Trump defectors, the Democratic primary race’s tone and issues are still being set by the party’s left-wing base. In a party increasingly intolerant of any deviations from leftist orthodoxy on any number of topics, that means even frontrunners dare not try to defy the activists who have a disproportionate say in determining the nomination. Length of Career a Liability as Democrats Get Extreme
Given that Biden has been a reliable lefty for most of his career, that ought not be too much of a problem. But the length of that career — dating back a staggering 47 years ago to when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate from Delaware — has provided Biden an equally staggering amount of baggage from various stands and controversies he has dealt with over the course of five decades.
The includes his alleged responsibility for abusing Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings, his role in passing the 1995 crime bill that is blamed for incarcerating a disproportionate number of African Americans, and his opposition to forced busing to integrate schools. The latest piece of his legacy to jump up and bite him is his support for the Hyde Amendment.
That measure, named for the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and which forbids federal funding for abortions, has been on the books since 1976. Biden has always supported it. That was consistent with his longstanding efforts to represent the views of moderate and conservative Democrats who may have made their peace with the Roe v. Wade decision but didn’t want to be compelled to pay for abortions.
But the days of being able to reach out to that key constituency are over for Biden. Faced with a tremendous backlash after he recently reaffirmed his support for Hyde, Biden backed down this week and said he no longer supported the measure.
It was an act of sheer political expediency that showed Biden and his handlers know they cannot allow him to be vulnerable on issues on which the base will tolerate no dissent. Abortion is probably the one issue that motivates that base more than any other. That means the difficult balancing act that moderate Catholic Democrats have been forced into, during which they state they will not impose their personal support for life on others, is probably no longer viable.
The pro-abortion lobby’s dominance within the Democratic Party is nothing new. But the passage of more restrictive abortion laws in some conservative states as well as the adoption of measures in liberal states that allow children born after an unsuccessful abortion to be killed has fired up the left in way that eclipses their past efforts.
Without full and enthusiastic support for abortion, no Democratic nominee next year can hope to win the votes of the liberal activists and women — especially minority women — who will have an outsized say in determining the outcomes in early primary states. Biden might have preferred to retain some ambiguity about his pro-choice stance in order to appeal to socially conservative general election voters who like Democrats’ message on entitlements and economics. But he knew the only way to get to the general election was to cut his losses and reverse himself on Hyde. Will that be enough to satisfy the left? Joe Biden’s Flip-Flop Puts Blood in the Water
The problem with Biden’s decision is that it was so blatantly political in nature that it still leaves his opponents plenty of room to outflank him on the left on abortion. Although his campaign has gone smoothly until now, its handling of Hyde was a mess. This should have been done before, or at least have been shown as the result of a process. But his abrupt and awkward decision to “evolve” on federal funding for abortion makes it clear that he was only doing it because he feared sticking to the position he had held for many years.
While a Sister Souljah moment in which he can show his independence from the party base would be the best thing he could do to wrong-foot Trump next year, Biden clearly feels it isn’t possible yet. Given the swiftness of his decision to succumb to the left-wing mob, it may never come.
The problem here is not just that this reminded political veterans of the Biden whose previous attempts to run for president were amateurish flops. It’s that this won’t be the last time Biden will feel he has no choice but to run harder to the left to fend off his Democratic rivals.
Just as important is that this demonstration of weakness will only embolden other Democrats to hit him harder on other points of vulnerability, such as Anita Hill and the crime bill. He’s already repented of his past “sins” on those points, but that doesn’t mean anyone on the left will let him forget them.
With eight months to go until the first votes are cast in Iowa, Biden would prefer to think about how he can run out the clock on his left-wing rivals. But in addition to demonstrating the kind of weakness that will already encourage his opponents to start banging away at his record, Biden has also just handed Republicans another cudgel with which to attack him if he does eventually succeed in securing the nomination.
Biden needs to confront Trump as a confident moderate, even if his moderation is only credible in comparison to his left-wing Democratic rivals. But a weak Biden who is afraid to cross those angry and ideological Democrats who don’t like the idea of nominating a compromise is a man who just began to exude fear.

Women Prefer Socialism To Capitalism. Here's Why They're Wrong.,thefederalist.com,Chrissy Clark,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/women-prefer-socialism-to-capitalism/,"State control and regulation of private property (61 percent) High taxes for the rich (60 percent) State-controlled media and communication (57 percent) Strong environmental regulations (56 percent) High public spending (55 percent) Government “democratizes” private businesses—that is, gives workers control over them—to the greatest extent possible (52 percent)
Looking at this data, it seems 55 percent of women want free healthcare, free college, and to not work, but still make a living wage. I’m sure Susan B. Anthony didn’t pioneer the women’s movement so that women could get a government pay check and never work. Next, we’re going to hear that women need reparations made in order to find equality after being suppressed by the evil, male patriarchy.
The irony of the idea that receiving a universal basic income check will help women is that, in most plans, to qualify for one, you can’t be working. Yet, the women of the left are the ones that encourage other women to give up the typical 1950s family life for a career.
Why, as women, would we want to work hard only for the government to take a solid percentage of our paycheck and hand it over to the lazy man that’s sitting on his couch and cashing in on universal basic income? How is that feminism? How is that inspiring women to work hard and feel liberated from the control of the “patriarchy”? It doesn’t.
Think about the women that pioneered freedom movements to give future women the right to vote and the rights to equality. They wanted women to have the same rights as men—and now, they do. There are so many people that debate that American women need to seek more progress, but please name one thing that women in America can’t do.
I feel empowered to be a woman in this modern age. I don’t feel oppressed by anyone. Real feminists would know that reaching for progress in a society that helped champion women’s rights is a waste of time when so many women around the world are actually oppressed by governments (socialist governments, might I add). True feminism should stem from helping and building up women that are truly oppressed, not seeking reparations for past injustices—especially when the system is now beginning to work in your favor.
Working hard and achieving a great deal of success is not the principle upon which socialism was founded, it’s the principle upon which capitalism was founded.
Women have won a record number of seats in Congress as of 2018, and thanks to Justice Kavanaugh, there is the first ever all-women clerk staff in Supreme Court history.
Women are doing better now than at any other point in history. Comparing our success to the past doesn’t mean that the future can’t be better for women. But, a socialist system would not empower women to run for Congress or graduate from law school and work for a Supreme Court justice. A capitalist system not only will empower women into the future, but has been the greatest equalizer of men and women in history. Chrissy Clark is a staff writer at The Federalist.

"Now That YouTube Bans Everything But Twerking Drag Kids, The Right Needs More Than Just Yelling ‘Stop’",thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/now-youtube-bans-everything-twerking-drag-kids-right-needs-just-yelling-stop/,"By Sumantra Maitra June 11, 2019
A recent dust-up over conservatism’s goals and methods was triggered by public libraries promoting drag queens to kids , which, if this Vice report is accurate , is not very dissimilar to the sexualization of kids in Afghanistan , where young boys are dressed as women to dance and are sexually abused by pedophiles.
The second issue was YouTube’s demonetization of Steven Crowder after concerted public activism by a Vox writer named Carlos Maza. Maza is self-declared gay and Marxist, so much so that this is his only identity and everything revolves around it. He claims to be against bullying, while relentlessly advocating direct action, assault, and deplatforming of conservatives , the irony completely lost on him.
Picture in your mind a Vox writer explaining why Fox news is bad , and you can imagine the tone and accent. This all overlays a raging protest and counter-protest on the Right that started with a tweet by commentator Sohrab Ahmari about David French and what he labeled “Frenchism,” a sort of benign, civil version of conservatism in an era of dogfights .
Put simply, conservatism is not conserving anything traditional, whether family, religion, social cohesion, or nation-state, but instead is fixated on liberal individualism, which ultimately destroys the bonds that hold a society together. This is the main line of argument against French and his idea of conservatism, or Frenchism, as Ahmari puts it, where everything is determined on the basis of individualism.
Put simply, Ahmari argued French is simply too nice while we are in a culture war, and to defend liberal public squares and neutral institutions there needs to be some sort of pushback including, if needed, punishment. “The only way is through—that is to say, to fight the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils in the form of a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good,” Ahmari wrote.
French wrote a lengthy rebuttal, claiming politics is not war : “My political opponents are my fellow citizens,” he wrote. “There is no political ‘emergency’ that justifies abandoning classical liberalism, and there will never be a temporal emergency that justifies rejecting eternal truth.” Plenty of others chipped in .
I initially hesitated to write anything on this, as it is as futile to opine on as anything—and because I have written for both First Things and National Review , and I like to read both French and Ahmari. But almost by divine Providence, two of Ahmari’s principal contentions were proved prescient in a matter of hours with the reports about sexualizing children during Pride Month.
Ahmari contended there’s no public square that the left has not captured, and that hypocrisy needs to be fought. If any idea, person, speech, or opinion that doesn’t conform to the liberal consensus is banned and de-legitimized, there’s no way a benign conservatism can win back an equal space in society.
I call this “ The“Bridge on the River Kwai” paradox. The classic film shows the clash of two distinct sets of philosophy, between a British officer, who, while a prisoner of the Japanese, wants his men to build a bridge worthy of British honor and history so posterity can remember their names. The other is an American Navy sailor whose only objective is to sabotage the Japanese war machine, honor be damned.
The current philosophical clash somewhat signifies the same predicament. As the exasperated American finally shouts at the British officer, “You and Colonel Nicholson, you’re two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules—when the only important thing is how to live like a human being!”
On one hand, there’s this set of conservatives who would rather honorably lose than manage to actually survive—meaning, in this case, have an equal say in a neutral public square. The others have not figured out what to do, but have realized that the old consensus is dead, regardless of how polite and civil one is and expects the other side to be.
Kevin Williamson also pointed out this paradox recently, although he comes to a different set of conclusions than I do: “Streitbare Demokratie is the idea that liberal democracies must sometimes behave in illiberal and anti-democratic ways in order to preserve liberalism and democracy from much worse threats. ‘Democracies withstood the ordeal of the World War much better than did autocratic states — by adopting autocratic methods,’ Loewenstein wrote.”
When your opponent wants to throw milkshakes at you for holding a different opinion, when you and your kind are essentially the only people continuously de-platformed from all the public platforms—media, social media, and academia, all of which are dominated by the left—when the norms of social interaction are broken beyond repair, what is to be done?
Look around you, and see the “slippery slope” argument being realized, as the Huffington Post proudly proclaims the “ future is queer ” showcasing a 10-year-old kid in drag, stripping and dancing as people throw cash at him , with full support of his parents. Or a self-declared communist claiming fetus is violence because “gestators” (not mothers) are not paid for their labor.
As Ross Douthat writes , “Liberalism has never done as well as it thinks at resolving its own crises. America’s gravest moral evil, chattel slavery, was defeated by an authoritarian president in a religious civil war, not by proceduralism or constitutional debate. The crisis of the 1930s ended happily for liberalism because a reactionary imperialist withstood Adolf Hitler and a revolutionary Bolshevik crushed him. The liberal peace that followed may depend on fear of the atomic bomb…a genuinely post-liberal politics might, indeed, someday be required — to save liberal civilization from dystopia or disaster.”
What do you do when you’re amidst a handful of activists determined to destroy the foundations of a society from within? You treat them like insurgents, and you root them out.
We are, for good or for bad, living in a new age of reaction. It was inevitable, as history suggests . The problem is no one on the right still has a clue about what to do next. Ahmari might be right in pointing out what is lost, but he doesn’t prescribe any policy on how to solve that problem, other than tautological pronunciations about finding a greater purpose for the greater good. If politics is genuinely about survival, as Ahmari suggests, then Ahmari and his ilk’s purification campaign would drastically reduce the conservative coalition and lead to its decimation.
On the other hand, Frenchism, (I guess it is a thing now) can only go so far against a bunch of people who are determined to demonstrate any non-leftist idea is evil, not to be reasoned or shared space with, but to be eradicated. To put it simply, for all his personal virtue and morality and sense of fairness, French is at an evolutionary disadvantage against a bunch of totalitarians-to-be, who are determined to see the end of his kind.
No sane, functioning society can survive the toleration of this level of public (and tax-funded) degeneracy in the name of liberal rights and freedom. A line must be drawn somewhere, by someone. And if the public votes for people who ban such deviancy and obscenity through a democratic majority, it’s only rational. Sometimes, simply “standing athwart history, and yelling stop” doesn’t make enough of a difference.

Mixing Kids With Drag Queens Sets Gay Rights Back Decades,thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/putting-drag-queens-front-children-sets-cause-gay-rights-back-decades/,"By Chad Felix Greene June 11, 2019
The first organized effort to oppose the gay rights movement came as argument that many today would find absurd. In 1977, the well-known singer Anita Bryant learned of a new city ordinance in Miami, Florida designed to protect gays and lesbians from employment discrimination.
Among other things, the law prevented private Christian schools from discriminating against openly gay teachers. As the Washington Post reported at the time , “‘This is not a campaign to kick the homosexuals out of where they’ve always been,’ said Bob Green, Bryant’s husband and business manager. ‘It’s strictly a defensive measure on our part.’ Save Our Children contends that passage of the law will enable homosexuals to ‘recruit’ youths.”
Thus, the battle over sexual identity in public life found its key debating point: How would it affect children? Over the course of this long debate, the religious right routinely came back to this argument, and much of the gay rights movement’s message developed around disproving the accusation.
For example, in 1981, Jerry Falwell sent a fundraising letter warning, “Please remember, homosexuals don’t reproduce! They recruit! And they are out after my children and your children.” In 1992, conservative writer Judith Ann Reisman argued that the gay rights movement was primarily focused on recruitment efforts , speculating that 20-30 percent of America’s youth would be recruited into homosexual activity by increased public exposure.
Despite the last two decades or so of progress in significantly reducing this stereotype, the progressive movement, as it tends to do so often, has pushed the boundaries too far. This deeply embedded fear of what might happen to children has bubbled back up to the surface. The current LGBT movement’s fixation on child drag queens and transgender identity in children certainly appears to validate Bryant and her day’s Religious Right. The sudden prominence of adult gay men dressed as caricatures of women and reading to preschool-aged children has resurfaced this long-held fear.
The official organization, called Drag Queen Story Hour, does little to dissuade this view, either. Their website states , “DQSH captures the imagination and play of the gender fluidity of childhood and gives kids glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models. In spaces like this, kids are able to see people who defy rigid gender restrictions and imagine a world where people can present as they wish, where dress up is real.”
A participating drag queen named Santana Pilar Andrews said he had grown up feeling different and being bullied and hoped Drag Queen Story Hour would allow children, often as young as three, to find normalcy in being different. But for many concerned about the program, it certainly sounds like the organization is seeking to influence the sexual and gender identities of the kids they entertain.
Supporters argue the entertainment is not only harmless fun for everyone involved, but positive for the gay men as well. Jonathan Hamilt, who co-founded The Drag Queen Story Hour, argued it helps gay men “to get out of the night life and into their communities, their neighborhoods, their towns where they live, and give back.”
In another interview, Hamilt said , “Wherever we go there is a big community who come out — especially in more rural or conservative areas, people come from farther away to support our events because nothing like this has happened there before. There is a big need for it in areas that aren’t liberal big cities.” Clearly, supporters believe it is an extremely positive part of every child’s life to interact with LGBT role models.
There is no doubt many who participate in these events are harmless and are genuinely seeking to be a positive influence. Andrews says, “I can go in and entertain adults in a club and also entertain a group of students and young children. I’m able to do that because I’m an adult and able to filter myself.”
There is also the risk of sex offenders engaging in the program as drag queens, as has happened in Houston, Texas . For the most part, however, children most likely see the adults as merely characters entertaining them, as at a theme park or if a clown read to them. It is unlikely a three-year-old will understand that the person reading to her is really a man dressed a woman in an effort to inspire openness to sexuality and gender identity.
But there is a larger issue at hand. Drag queens are adult entertainment. There is no way around this reality. From the make-up to the dress to the personality, a drag queen is built from the ground up as a caricature of a sexual, adult woman.
This is the fun of drag culture for many. Drag queens are associated with sassy, edgy and explicitly blunt humor and sexuality. They are allowed to be over-the-top and aggressively sexualized because they are meant to be exaggerations. A man dressing as a drag queen to read to children is essentially the same as a female adult entertainer teaching a preschool dance class while fully clothed. It just does not work, despite the innocence of the intention or of the children involved.
I was once asked to speak to a middle school about Jewish identity and culture. During a class discussion, one of the kids asked if my wife was also Jewish. I answered that my husband was not Jewish, but had moved here from Scotland, which they all found fascinating.
The kids did not seem to care about the “wife/husband” substitution or the realization that I was a gay man. But I also did not elaborate on my sexual identity. In drag queen events, LGBT advocates want LGBT people to be active in everyday life and for children to see them as normal, as was my experience. They want young LGBT kids in the room to see someone like them and not feel so alone. But doing so through the more elaborate and extreme versions of sexual and gender identity is not the way to do it.
When LGBT activists argue their goal is to introduce preschool-aged children to concepts of gender-fluidity and openly “queer” people, they are arguing for forcing leftist views about sexuality and gender on children. That, in many ways, is what the conservative opposition is truly about.
We do not want kids to be confused by a culture that cannot decide if drag queens are positive expressions of queer identity or a transphobic mockery of gender identity. We do not want kids to be pushed into believing their childhood exploration of identity is evidence they must change everything about themselves. We don’t want kids to look up to adult men dressed as sexualized caricatures of women and believe this is, indeed, normal or respectful towards women.
In this, the movement has lost its way. Rather than enjoy the vast and open freedom and acceptance LGBT people have in our culture, they continually believe they are entitled to push the limits. By promoting adolescent boys as drag queens and intentionally setting up events in which adult entertainers entertain children, they have reignited the fears the community spent 30 years fighting.
The majority of gay men who work as drag queens are not out to hurt kids, but LGBT activists are placing them in increasingly compromising social positions. Drag queens were never meant to be educators or entertainers to children.
In many ways, Anita Bryant foresaw a movement pushing the boundaries too far, too fast. While the LGBT movement has become such an accepted and normal part of society that drag queens are generally looked upon as playful, funny adult entertainers, progressive extremism is undermining this progress. Drag queens should not be teaching children. The LGBT community loses nothing by respecting the boundaries of adult entertainment and could lose everything if they continue to push this envelope.

"In Our Humorless Age, The New York Times Has Cancelled Political Cartoons",thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/humorless-age-new-york-times-cancelled-political-cartoons/,"By David Marcus June 11, 2019
The political cartoon has a long and storied history in the United States. But according to a blog post by New York Times cartoonist Patrick Chappette, he has been informed that his artwork will no longer run at the Grey Lady, as the paper has decided not to run cartoons anymore.
The decision comes in the wake of justified outrage over a recent anti-Semitic cartoon that ran in the Times’s international edition. That cartoon featured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog leading a blind Donald Trump.
Cartoons were a relatively new phenomenon at the Times. It was Chappette who first began running them for the historic outlet back in 2013. He sees the decision to spike them not just as a statement about cartoons, but also about journalism more broadly:
I’m afraid this is not just about cartoons, but about journalism and opinion in general. We are in a world where moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm, falling upon newsrooms in an overwhelming blow. This requires immediate counter-measures by publishers, leaving no room for ponderation or meaningful discussions. Twitter is a place for furor, not debate. The most outraged voices tend to define the conversation, and the angry crowd follows in.
That is all true, of course, but it makes sense that political cartoons would fall victim to the politically correct attitudes in ascendance in so many newsrooms today. They are, after all, a form of journalism that is all about exaggeration, and often about stereotypes. In a real sense they are literally “fake news.” It is a form of comedy that is often transgressive at a time when transgression is punished by simply being erased by the culture.
In the age of “that’s not funny,” what chance does the political cartoon really have? The Times had already taken measures, specifically breaking contracts with the cartoon syndication firm that produced the Netanyahu cartoon, to address its recent mistake. But it is easy to see why the Times’s editors and publishers would look at political cartoons as a ticking time bomb.
Political cartoonists tend to engage in caricature, and in today’s day and age that is a dangerous game. Is an exaggerated physical characteristic simply a fun and funny way to depict a political leader? Or is it sometimes the representation of a ethnic or racial stereotype? Who decides where that line is? Clearly the editors of The New York Times want no more part of such decisions.
It’s not just political cartoons under attack. In an apoplectic and over the top New York Post review of David Mamet’s new play “Bitter Wheat,” Johnny Oleksinski writes, “David Mamet has done it again! By which I mean that the out-of-his-mind playwright has appalled, offended and perplexed a packed house of hundreds of people — this time with his comedy about Harvey Weinstein . You read that right. Mamet wants you to have a laugh about one of the most infamous workplace monsters of our time.”
This is one of the stupidest complaints I have ever read a critic make. It is profoundly historically illiterate and fails to grasp the very purpose of comedy, which is to make light of and expose some truth about the too short and often brutal experience of existing as a human being.
“Lysistrata” is a comedy about the brutal horrors of war, “Merchant of Venice” is a comedy about bigotry, “A Modest Proposal” is a comedy about genocide, “The Producers” is a comedy literally about Nazis. The point is that laughter is an opportunity to be vulnerable, to stare the blistering pain of existence in the face and best it with a smile. Even, perhaps especially, when it appeals to our darkest impulses, it helps teach us how to be human.
Political cartoons have a long history of racism, from blacks and Irish being portrayed as monkeys in the 19th century to Netanyahu being portrayed as a dog this year. But the value of satire far outstrips the inevitable bad joke, the one that goes too far, the one that crosses the line we demand comedians and cartoonists tip toe up to every day without triggering the tripwire.
We need comedy and cartoons. We always have, whether in ancient Greece or modern midtown Manhattan. We need to laugh at ourselves, at the absurd condition we find ourselves puttering around in. That the New York Times has acquiesced to fear and decided to stop running political cartoons is a shame, but a likely one.
But at least for the near future we can still count on The New Yorker to run incomprehensible cartoons. Those should be safe, because if nobody knows what they mean, nobody can be offended. Probably.

"No, Judicial Nominee Mike Bogren Is Not An Anti-Religious Bigot",thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/no-judicial-nominee-mike-bogren-not-anti-religious-bigot/,"By Margot Cleveland June 11, 2019
Conservatives have long maintained that they have no litmus test for judicial nominees. Rather, the right claims, it is a question of judicial philosophy and whether a future judge or justice is an originalist—a man or woman dedicated to interpreting the Constitution consistent with its original understanding. But over the course of the last three weeks, a shortsighted faction on the right has unwittingly argued itself into a scorched-earth litmus test unrelated to judicial philosophy.
Freshman Republican Sen. Josh Hawley unveiled this new litmus test during questioning of President Trump’s nominee for the Western District of Michigan, Michael Bogren, who happens to be my cousin. At the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing held on May 22, 2019, to consider Bogren’s nomination, Hawley condemned the Michigan lawyer for his advocacy on behalf of his client, the city of East Lansing, in a case challenging the city’s decision to bar a family-owned orchard from the local farmer’s market because it refused to rent its facilities for same-sex marriage celebrations.
“You think those things are equivalent. You think that the Catholic family’s pointing out the teachings of their church is equivalent to a KKK member invoking Christianity [to justify discrimination],” Hawley barked at Bogren. “Respectfully, that is not what I said,” Bogren responded. The Right Stands Up for Bogren
Several conservative commentators added their voice to Bogren’s drowned-out denial, pushing back against Hawley’s misrepresentation of Bogren’s legal argument. Notwithstanding Hawley’s spin, Bogren did not compare Catholics to the Klu Klux Klan. Rather, as Ed Whelan stressed in countering Hawley’s tirade, “To argue that a principle that applies to A also applies to B is not to ‘compare’ A and B or to assert that they are equivalent.”
Whelan and others likewise pointed out the fallacy of holding lawyers responsible for the positions they advocate for their clients. Bogren “was advancing legal arguments on behalf of his client, not expressing his personal views,” Whelan wrote, adding that his “arguments strike me as exactly what you’d expect from someone representing his client.”
The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal concurred: “An acute danger in these polarized times is that partisans will trample core American principles to achieve their political goals. One such principle is that every American deserves legal representation, and a corollary is that lawyers don’t have to agree with their clients to represent them.”
Bogren’s partners at Plunkett and Cooney also stressed this point in a letter sent late Friday to Sens. Lindsey Graham and Dianne Feinstein in defense of Bogren. “Mike was retained by his client to provide a defense,” they wrote. “As a result, he was bound by the Rules of Ethics and Michigan’s Rules of Professional Conduct, both of which require zealous advocacy on his client’s behalf.”
In their letter, Bogren’s partners also pointed out that Justice John Roberts, for whom Hawley clerked, had also been “asked questions during his confirmation hearing about his representation of clients on various issues.” As a nominee, Roberts testified that he had never turned down a client for ethical or moral reasons, stating: “I appreciate that may sound like I’m a hired gun. I think that’s a disparaging way to regard what is in fact an ennobling truth: that lawyers serve the rule of law.” Conflating a Lawyer’s Job With His Legal Philosophy
Attempts to counter this concern actually prove the problem. Ramesh Ponnuru in “The Case Against Bogren” wrote : “Would conservative senators be obligated to look past a judicial nominee’s past work for Planned Parenthood — arguing, let’s say, for a constitutional right to subsidies for abortion — because everyone has a right to a lawyer? Would a conservative White House be so obligated? What if the nominee had spent much of his career providing such representation? Or — if the social-issue context is too much of a distraction — would conservatives be obligated to say it’s perfectly fine for a Republican administration’s nominee to have argued for Obamacare’s individual mandate while working for health insurers?”
These hypotheticals expose that behind the umbrage, the Hawley approach consists of a series of single-issue litmus tests. Did the nominee defend a city’s decision to enforce an ordinance barring LGBT discrimination? He is anti-religious freedom. Did the nominee defend a city ordinance banning high-capacity magazines? He is anti-Second Amendment. What about defending city employees sued for excessive force? He is pro-police brutality.
The positions a judicial nominee advocates for a client tell us nothing of the would-be-judge’s own legal views, much less insight into an overriding judicial philosophy. That is not to say that an attorney’s representation decisions will never raise concerns about a nominee’s judicial philosophy. But the long-term representation of a liberal organization dedicated to the slaughter of millions of innocents, such as Planned Parenthood, is so different in degree from the handling of legal work for a municipality—which may or may not involve issues of ideology—that it is different in kind.
But why accept the case? Critics point out that Bogren could have refused to represent East Lansing. This ignores the countervailing demands that attorneys in private practice face.
Bogren is an equity partner at Plunkett Cooney and, as such, has a duty to his partners to develop business. East Lansing is a long-time client of the firm, with Bogren currently representing the city in two other cases—one involving a challenge to East Lansing’s billboard ordinance and a second defending the city against a malicious prosecution claim. The reality is that if Bogren had refused to represent East Lansing, the firm would likely have lost the client and Bogren would have violated his fiduciary obligations to his partners.
So, are we as conservatives saying that Bogren had a moral imperative to withdraw from the firm, which would have been the only way to avoid this Catch-22? And do we believe his failure to do so renders him unfit to serve as a federal court judge? If so, where do we draw the line? How do we draw the line? Impartiality Doesn’t Equate to Bigotry
Those opposing his nomination fail to appreciate that their real beef with Bogren is not his legal advocacy, but how he balanced his obligations to his partners and his personal beliefs. This balance no doubt presents difficult moral and philosophical questions, but no one is having that discussion. Instead, critics are unjustly condemning Bogren as an anti-Catholic bigot—or, at a minimum, implying he is one.
Given the bashing religious conservatives and religious liberties have taken of late, it is understandable that senators seek assurances that Bogren and other judicial nominees do not hold an anti-religious bias or a hostility to religious liberty. Without my relation to Bogren—he is my cousin—I too might have zoned in on a few passages in his briefing in the East Lansing case and equated his advocacy with his personal views and judicial philosophy.
But here I have an unfair advantage: I know that Bogren is respectful of persons of all faiths and a Catholic himself. From conversations over the years about the Constitution, court decisions, judges, and justices, I know that Bogren is a solid choice for the district court nomination.
This knowledge allowed me to avoid a knee-jerk response to Bogren’s representation of East Lansing, even though I condemned East Lansing’s decision in an article I wrote for National Review nearly two years ago. For others seeking assurance of Bogren’s bona fides, there is plenty of evidence. Bogren Has Also Advocated for Religious Liberty
First, Bogren’s representation of other clients demonstrates that he is a strong advocate for all, and has zealously defended religious freedom. His advocacy for the Methodist summer resort of Bay View’s right to a religious exemption under the Fair Housing Act provides a case-in-point.
Second, his Plunkett Cooney partners who, as they note, “other than his family, know Mike best,” countered the claims of bigotry in their Friday letter to the Judiciary Committee: “Several of us are devout Catholics, having attended Catholic grade schools, high schools, colleges, and law schools and having also sent our children to these institutions. Others of us are Jewish or Christians of other denominations. We would not support Mike or his nomination if he held anything resembling the anti-religious-rights or anti-Catholic bias he is falsely accused of holding.”
Finally, conservatives should find comfort in Trump’s unimpeachable record of screening judicial candidates. Yes, the Republican-controlled Senate continues to honor the blue-slip tradition at the district court level, but in a deal reportedly made with Michigan’s two Democratic senators, Trump got his pick for one district court slot—and Bogren was Trump’s choice. If nothing else, that should tell you something.
UPDATE: THREAD: I just learned that my cousin, Mike Bogren, has sent White House a letter withdrawing his name from consideration of the district court position. For those celebrating this as a win for religious liberty, it is not–it is a Pyrrhic victory at best. Here's why. 1/

Minority Kids’ Spelling Bee Dominance Proves Racism Is Far Less Important Than Work Ethic,thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/minority-kids-spelling-bee-dominance-proves-racism-far-less-important-work-ethic/,"By Helen Raleigh June 11, 2019
Life is unpredictable, but there are a few seemingly sure bets: the New England Patriots play in the Super Bowl and Indian-American kids win the National Spelling Bee. In the last two decades, the Patriots have had nine Super Bowl appearances and six titles. During the same time period, Indian-American kids have won all but four Scripps National Spelling Bee championships.
This year is no exception: on May 31, the Scripps National Bee Championship competition ended in an eight-way tie with seven out of the eight champions Indian Americans. The final round lasted to midnight, and all eight kids spelled 47 consecutive words correctly.
It was the adults in the room who called quits. Dr. Jacques A. Bailly, the official pronouncer of the Bee, told the kids, “We do have plenty of words remaining on our list. But we will soon run out of words that will possibly challenge you, the most phenomenal collection of super spellers in the history of this competition.” Even Merriam Webster, whose Webster’s Third New International Dictionary serves as the official dictionary of the Bee, accepted its defeat on Twitter .
How did kids from South Asia—including Bangladesh, Pakistan, and especially India—become so dominant in the National Spelling Bee competition? Personal dedication, family commitment, cultural acceptance, and community support. A Not-So-Secret Formula
There is no question that these kids work hard. Rishik Gandhasri, one of the eight co-champions, said in an interview that he spent between one and four hours each day on learning new words, in addition to his homework and various after-school activities such as swimming and piano lessons. Akash Vukoti, who qualified for the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 2016 when he was only six years old, spent between one and five hours each day on learning new words.
These kids work so hard because adults in their families foster a culture of learning and are leading by example. Indian-Americans have one of the highest rates of educational attainment in the United Stats. About a third of them have college degrees, and more than 40 percent of them have postgraduate degrees, according to Pew Research . The majority of their degrees are in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.
Academic achievement is highly valued among Indian parents. Not surprisingly, parents who have higher education attainment and value education tend to raise kids who strive to be high achievers.
Education isn’t just a means to an economic end, although highly educated Indian-Americans are doing very well economically—the average household annual income of Indian families was around $100,000 in 2015 . My friend Sosamma Samuel-Burnett, an Indian immigrant with two children, told me that besides economic benefits, “Education is considered a noble pursuit—expanding the mind and capacities. The fact that many Indian students are excelling in school, and particularly on the spelling bee, is a reflection of that educational value.” Family Sacrifice Is Part of Their Successful Culture
The emphasis on education means spelling bee competitions are usually a family commitment. Akash’s mom gave up her job to homeschool him when he was two years old. Like any other sports, parents sometimes have to drive for hours and even take time off to take their kids to regional and national competitions. Siblings help too. Rishik’s older brother, Rutvick, who competed in spelling competitions too, drilled Rishik on new words and provided feedback about his younger brother’s presentation style.
In addition to hard work and a culture that values education and family commitment, one unique factor of these kids’ success is community support. Their dominance today makes it hard to believe that Indian-American kids hadn’t always been good at spelling. Once upon a time, they consistently outperformed in every subject except English.
After Balu Natarajan became the first Indian American to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1985, Indian-Americans like Ratnam Chitturi, who founded the North South Foundation (NSF) in 1989, believed that getting kids excited about spelling bee competitions would be a good way to improve their English language skills. NSF organized its first spelling bee competition in 1993.
Today, NSF has more than 90 chapters in the United States. These chapters organize annual Regional Education Contests in spelling, vocabulary, math, essay writing, public speaking, and geography. Winners of these contests are invited to the NSF’s National Finals, where champions receive scholarshipsto college.
The 2002 documentary, “Spellbound,” which follows eight competitors in the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee, really fired up Indian-Americans’ enthusiasm because one of the competitors—Nupur Lala, an Indian American girl—beat David Lewandowski and won the 1999 national title. Lala became a household name among Indian-Americans, and inspired many kids to follow in her footsteps. Enthusiasm for Achievement Sparks New Institutions
To meet the growing demand, Rahul Walia launched the South Asian Spelling Bee in 2008, a platform focusing on spelling bee training and organizing annual competitions in the United States for children of South Asian descent. Its regional and national competitions are covered by South Asian-focused news media.
Adults in the community have also set up tutoring centers, summer camps, software, and study materials to train young spellers to get better and raise the bar of the competition. Each year, many kids of South Asian descent who qualified for the National Scripps Spelling Bee finals are alumni of NSF and South Asian Spelling Bee competitions.
These community-level competitions (nicknamed “minor league”) and the media coverage have turned spelling bees into a popular sport within South Asian American communities. Kids who win national titles are celebrities. Just about no one in the community laughs at them being nerds. Instead, they are respected and admired, like Olympic gold medalists or Nobel laureates. Their performances have been recorded and watched over and over again like popular TV shows. Their success becomes a magnet for more kids to get into the spelling bee competitions.
Based on this year’s outcome, kids of South Asian descent, especially those with Indian heritage, will continue to dominate the spelling bee in the foreseeable future. Their accomplishment and dominance have attracted some ugly attacks from social media: “The kids in the spelling bee should only be AMERICAN”; “No American sounding names who won the spelling B. #sad#fail”; “We need an american to win this spelling bee #tiredofindians.”
These attacks are really stupid, to say the least. These kids are either born here or became naturalized citizens with their parents. They are Americans. Spelling bees are some of the fairest competitions because each participant competes against a dictionary. The same opportunity is open to anyone of any race and ethnicity. No “supremacy” or “privilege” of any kind will ensure success. You either know how to spell a word or you don’t — there is no grey area.
These Indian-American kids deserve to win because they earn it, and their achievement exemplifies what’s best about our country—we are a largely meritocratic society where any individual and any community can be successful if they put their minds and efforts to it.
Politicians, educators, social engineers, and leaders from other communities should draw inspiration from Indian-Americans. Whenever we talk about how to improve public education and close the achievement gaps among different racial groups in the United States, the left’s standard answers tend to involve blaming white privilege, historical racism, and lack of spending. Very little time is spent on looking inward and discussing how to create a culture that fosters learning, values education, and involves adult and community support.
While individual prejudice and discrimination do exist, Indian-American kids’ progress from underperforming in English to dominating in spelling bee competitions in two decades shows that it’s dishonest to blame institutional bias or privilege for the dismal education outcomes in certain racial and ethnic communities in the United States. Any individual and any community in the United States can thrive if they follow Indian-Americans’ time-tested formula: success equals personal dedication, family commitment, cultural acceptance, and community support.

Meet The Radical Technocrat Helping Democrats Push Single-Payer,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/meet-radical-technocrat-trying-sell-single-payer-democrats/,"By Christopher Jacobs June 11, 2019
If anyone had doubts about the radical nature of Democrats’ health care agenda, they needn’t look further than the second name on the witness list for this Wednesday’s House Ways and Means Committee hearing on single-payer health care: Donald Berwick of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.
If that name sounds familiar, it should. In summer 2010, right after Obamacare’s passage, President Obama gave Berwick a controversial recess appointment to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Democrats refused to consider Berwick’s nomination despite controlling 59 votes in the Senate at the time, and he had to resign as CMS administrator at the end of his recess appointment in late 2011. Berwick’s History of Radical Writings
Even a cursory review of Berwick’s writings explains why Obama’s only option was to push him through with a recess appointment, and why Democrats refused to give Berwick so much as a nomination hearing. As someone who read just about everything he wrote until his nomination—thousands of pages of journal articles, books, and speeches—I know the radical nature of Berwick’s thinking all too well. He believes passionately in a society ruled by a technocratic elite, thinking that a core group of government planners can run the country’s health care system better than individual doctors and patients.
Here is what this doctor believes in, in his own words: Socialized Medicine: “Cynics beware: I am romantic about the National Health Service; I love it. All I need to do to rediscover the romance is to look at health care in my own country.” Control by Elites: “I cannot believe that the individual health care consumer can enforce through choice the proper configurations of a system as massive and complex as health care. That is for leaders to do.” Wealth Redistribution: “Any health care funding plan that is just, equitable, civilized, and humane must— must —redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and less fortunate.” Shutting Medical Facilities: “Reduce the total supply of high-technology medical and surgical care and consolidate high-technology services into regional and community-wide centers … Most metropolitan areas in the United States should reduce the number of centers engaging in cardiac surgery, high-risk obstetrics, neonatal intensive care, organ transplantation, tertiary cancer care, high-level trauma care, and high-technology imaging.” End of Life Care: “Most people who have serious pain do not need advanced methods; they just need the morphine and counseling that have been available for centuries.” Cost-Effectiveness Rationing of Care: “The decision is not whether or not we will ration care—the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.” Doctors Putting “The System” over their Patients: “Doctors and other clinicians should be advocates for patients or the populations they service but should refrain from manipulating the system to obtain benefits for them to the substantial disadvantage of others.” Standardized “Cookbook Medicine”: “I would place a commitment to excellence—standardization to the best-known method—above clinician autonomy as a rule for care.”
For those who want a fuller picture of Berwick’s views, in 2010-11 I compiled a nearly 30-page dossier featuring excerpts of his beliefs, based on my comprehensive review of his prior writings and speeches. That document is now available online here , and below. View this document on Scribd Where’s the Political Accountability?
Some of Berwick’s greatest admiration is saved for Britain’s National Health Service on the grounds that it was ultimately politically accountable to patients. For instance, Berwick said his “rationing with our eyes open” quote was “distorted,” claiming that
Someone, like your health insurance company, is going to limit what you can get. That’s the way it’s set up. The government, unlike many private health insurance plans, is working in the daylight. That’s a strength.
Except that Berwick did not work in the daylight. Due to his controversial writings, which the Obama administration didn’t want him to defend , Berwick spent most of his tenure as administrator in CMS’s version of the Witness Protection Program . To avoid answering questions publicly , he exited behind a stage in one case, called for a security escort in another, and in a third, ignored a reporter’s questions while emerging from a closed-door meeting with lobbyists.
When running for governor of Massachusetts in 2013, Berwick claimed he “regrets listening to White House orders to avoid reaching out to congressional Republicans.” But that doesn’t absolve the fact that Berwick went to great lengths to avoid the political accountability he previously claimed to embrace.
It also doesn’t it answer the significant questions about why Obama waited until after Obamacare’s enactment to nominate Berwick—deliberately keeping the public in the dark about the radical nature of the person he wanted to administer vast swathes of the law.
Thankfully, however, Wednesday’s hearing provides a case of “better late than never.” Republicans will finally get a chance to ask Berwick about the extreme views expressed in his writings. They will also be able to raise questions about why Democrats decided to give him an official platform to talk about single payer (and who knows what else).
At the least, the hearing will give the public a chance to witness just what they’re in for if the left gets its chance to implement a full-on government takeover of the health care system. For every American patient, either present or future, it should be must-watch TV.

Blaming YouTube’s Algorithm Is A Cop-Out,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/blaming-youtubes-algorithm-cop/,"June 11, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
It’s here , another profile of another young man corrupted by Big Tech’s unruly algorithms, and another opportunity for us to unload our blame on Silicon Valley.
This weekend, the New York Times chronicled 26-year-old Caleb Cain’s journey to and from the alt-right, facilitated by YouTube’s recommendation algorithm, which takes users from zero to 100 on the ideological scale in jarring speed. It’s a fascinating trip, and well-worth the profile for its representative value—and I say that as someone Caleb’s age, having been tempted down my fair share of YouTube rabbit holes.
It’s odd, though, how the impulse of the chattering class is to blame an algorithm, rather than the human behavior that shapes it. I agree that YouTube’s recommendation algorithm steers vulnerable young minds in unfortunate directions—playing a bit part in radicalizing some unknown portion of them—but the question should really be why our minds are vulnerable.
It’s a curiosity borne of our weak moral bearings , and exploited successfully by YouTube’s system to keep users on its website as long as possible. The algorithm gets its power from our moral confusion.
Sometimes this confusion finds a positive antidote on YouTube, in the form of popular personalities with serious answers you won’t find on classroom reading lists like Ben Shapiro or Christina Hoff Sommers. (Jordan Peterson’s popularity is explained well by this dynamic.) Sometimes, as in Caleb’s case, the website’s expansive library of darker content appeals more.
Caleb, who “successfully climbed out of a right-wing YouTube rabbit hole, only to jump into a left-wing YouTube rabbit hole,” is an instructive example. After documenting his YouTube-aided transition from left to right and back again, the Times observed, “It is still difficult, at times, to tell where the YouTube algorithm stops and his personality begins.” Perhaps this shouldn’t be a surprise. Our political culture is now built largely on shapeshifting internet platforms, which have made flipping partisan allegiances as easy as changing hairstyles. It’s possible that vulnerable young men like Mr. Cain will drift away from radical groups as they grow up and find stability elsewhere. It’s also possible that this kind of whiplash polarization is here to stay as political factions gain and lose traction online.
Without a moral anchor, we’re swayed easily by the breeze—and YouTube is a windy place. For those who don’t wish to idle, it’s the go-to resource.
I think a lot of people our age don’t know what to believe, but feel a strong urge to believe something. It’s hard to know how many Caleb Cains are out there. It’s also hard to know how many people watch extremist videos out of sheer curiosity, and never hesitate to avoid veering down that path themselves. The latter almost certainly outnumber the former.
Blaming the algorithm is easy. Blaming the person who clicks on the videos, or the culture that bred their curiosity—their craving for answers—is much more difficult. But it will also be much more effective. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky ."
Women Are Aborting Their Babies Based On Incorrect Prenatal Test Results,thefederalist.com,Georgi Boorman,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/women-aborting-babies-based-incorrect-prenatal-test-results/,"By Georgi Boorman June 11, 2019
Making the rounds on Facebook is news that an Irish couple aborted their preborn child upon receipt of a positive test result for Edwards Syndrome, only to discover afterward that the baby was healthy. Edwards Syndrome causes life-threatening organ defects, an abnormally shaped head, and—if the child survives—developmental delays. It is usually fatal within the first year of a child’s life, often within the first several days after birth.
The couple was told by medical professionals at the National Maternity Hospital that there was “no hope” for their baby, even though some people with Edwards Syndrome have gone on to live joyful lives despite their serious impediments. They were strongly encouraged to take advantage of Ireland’s newly legal abortion framework, and did so at 15 weeks’ gestation.
As Live Action reported, the mother underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS), in which cells from the placenta are sampled to screen for chromosomal abnormalities. According to reporting by the Irish Times, the test is “99% accurate,” and “in 0.15 per cent of cases, a false positive can occur.” Some may be shocked that a healthy baby could be aborted “by mistake.” A 0.15 percent false positive rate? That’s tiny, right? How could they have known?
The false positive in this case resulted from mosaicism, where the cells of the placenta showed abnormalities that the baby’s cells did not. According to a 1990 study :
Most instances of mosaicism detected in CVS are not associated with a fetal abnormality and should be evaluated by further prenatal testing, i.e., amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling. Because of the frequency of chromosomal mosaicism in CVS and its attendant need for further testing, a discussion of mosaicism should be included in counseling prior to CVS.
The study’s authors stated that mosaicism occurs in 1 percent of CV samples, a proportion 10 times greater than what’s observed in newborns. Non-mosaic false positives accounted for an additional 0.11 percent of CV samples. But here’s what’s being missed: a false positive rate of 0.15 percent (or multiple times that, based on the study) doesn’t mean there’s a 0.15 percent chance a positive result is false—it means that 0.15 percent of CV samples of normal babies will yield a false positive.
To really examine the accuracy of prenatal testing, you have to look at the positive predictive value (PPV)—the percentage of all positive tests that reflect true positives, or, put another way, the probability that a positive test result reflects an actual abnormality in the child. For chorionic villus sampling, the PPV is 72.6-78.3 percent, according to a 1992 study in Denmark.
A prenatal test’s PPV can be higher or lower depending on other factors, such as maternal age. But it is not unlikely that for some women, the odds of a positive CVS test being wrong could be one in four. False Positives Aren’t Discussed Well, or Often Enough
False positive rates are mentioned much more often in popular prenatal literature than the PPV, though, and can give unfounded confidence to couples who agree to these tests. That confidence, reinforced by medical professionals, sometimes leads them to choose abortion. In a co-signed letter to the editor in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, three medical doctors affirmed that “PPVs are more valuable to clinicians than detection rates.”
They advised caution when using CVS as a diagnostic to confirm less accurate prenatal screening results because CVS’s accuracy was established on tests of older women at greater risk for non-mosaic abnormalities. “An abnormal CVS result should not be considered fully diagnostic,” they wrote. Positive results from early Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS or NIPT) confirmed by CVS “need confirmation through amniocentesis or ultrasound scans to prevent termination of a normal pregnancy.”
Other prenatal tests produce far more false positives than CVS but are nonetheless advertised to pregnant women and their partners as highly accurate. A study published in 2014 analyzed the blood samples from 1914 women from 21 different centers in the United States who were subjected to both standard and cell-free DNA testing—the scientifically specific term for what is in shorthand referred to as NIPT. Its authors found positive predictive values of 45.5 percent for Trisomy 21 and 40 percent for Trisomy 18 with cell-free DNA testing (see Table 3).
That means that according to this “accurate” early testing, 54.5 percent of women who were told their child likely had Down Syndrome delivered (or would have delivered) non-DS babies, and 60 percent who were told their child probably has Edward Syndrome delivered (or would have delivered) non-ES babies. Notably, 17 patients who received positive results with the standard screening in the aforementioned 2014 study of cell-free DNA testing went on for invasive testing (five with CVS and 22 with amniocentesis), which ruled out fetal abnormalities in all cases.
Researchers from Baylor and Hong Kong studied positive results from several different brands of NIPT and found that about 22 percent of all positives studied were false (69 out of 307). For the popular Harmony test, researchers from UCSF, Columbia University, and Ariosa (which created the Harmony test) found:
The positive predictive value of the Harmony test was 80.9 percent, comparing favorably to just 3.4 percent for standard screening. For women under the age of 35 only, the positive predictive value of NIPT decreased to 76 percent, and for women considered low-risk based on standard screening, it was 50 percent, still outperforming current first trimester screening. (Emphasis mine.)
While every patient’s scenario is unique and other clinical factors have to be taken into consideration, knowing the average PPV for a category into which many women fall (at least three-quarters of birthing women would have a PPV of three in four, according to census data) seems like an important piece of patient education.
The “standard tests” of quad screens or nuchal translucency tests, outperformed by NIPT, are indeed highly inaccurate. One analysis put their combined PPV at one in 18 with a false positive rate of 6.9 percent for Trisomy 21, while another more recent study published in the Journal of Prenatal Medicine found the popular “combination test” of nuchal translucency and serum screening has a PPV of 9.0 percent for Trisomy 21 and a false positive rate of 5 percent.
So by comparison, yes, cell-free DNA tests are more accurate. The companies that offer NIPTs seem to be quite comfortable letting pregnant mothers put their confidence in statements like “most proven” and “more accurate than standard testing.” It’s good for business. As the above letter to the editor put it, “When the detection rate is close to 100% (as in the case for trisomy 21), it may provide a misleading view on noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) and suggest that it is actually a diagnostic test.”
It’s much more comforting to read that the false positive rate is only 0.1 percent (touted on the Harmony Test FAQ page) than to read there’s a one in five chance (or, for mothers under 35, a one in four chance) that your baby is totally fine despite a positive result. NIPT Companies Want to Promote Confidence
Knowing the PPV could be excruciating for women who consider abortion a valid option in case of fetal abnormality. Imagine being a pregnant mother younger than 35, getting a positive result, and thinking to yourself, “But what if he’s totally fine? What if he’s the one in four?”
Instead, the emphasis is put on the efficacy of the test in catching 99 percent of Down Syndrome cases and similarly high percentages of Trisomies 18 and 13. NIPT manufacturers promote the idea that identifying major abnormalities should be almost the sole concern for parents undergoing screening; whether a mother might abort a perfectly healthy baby in the effort to prevent an abnormal birth is nearly inconsequential.
As far as secondary diagnostics to confirm or reject screening results, Harmony, at least, utilizes misleading language. A slide in their “Expecting Parents” section reads:
Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) uses cell-free DNA (cfDNA) derived from the pregnancy to evaluate possible chromosomal conditions in a pregnancy. NIPT is a prenatal screening test that can be performed as early as 10 weeks of pregnancy using a single blood draw. Prenatal diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and CVS diagnose the presence of chromosomal conditions. They are typically performed later in pregnancy and are associated with a small risk of pregnancy loss.
Their FAQ section contains the following statement:
The Harmony prenatal test is also much less likely than traditional tests to give you a false-positive result, meaning there is much less chance your doctor would recommend follow-up invasive testing like amniocentesis.
The Harmony prenatal test is a screening test. Results should be confirmed with diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS).
Now, they could mean that since you are less likely to receive a positive result in the first place, you’re at a lower risk for more risky follow-up testing. But expecting couples could easily read that first sentence as an assurance a positive result really means their baby has an abnormality and that it may be enough to make a decision about “continuing the pregnancy.”
Even this 2016 clinician-facing document from Harmony (found at a URL in tiny print in the bottom corner of the last page of a sample test report ) about the PPV states that the newfound attention paid to the PPV “challenges providers and laboratories alike since there is no precedent for either clinical discussion or reporting of PPV in previous methods of aneuploidy screening, i.e., serum analyte screening. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues” (emphasis mine).
If they really do value PPV as part of patient education, however, one would think they’d include a discussion of its benefits and limitations on their FAQ page. I reached out to Roche, the company that now owns Harmony, for comment, but they did not respond by time of publication. Misleading Results Artificially Increase Abortions
Misleading statements are nothing new in the marketing of medical products and services. But does the trust of patients and doctors in inaccurate testing lead to more than a handful of abortions? There is evidence to suggest so.
In a small retrospective study of women with positive cell-free DNA test results conducted by researchers from Harvard, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Diagnostic Ultrasound Associates between 2012 and 2014, the termination rate was 66 percent (56/84). One-fifth of those abortions (19.6 percent or 11 fetuses) were done “for suspected autosomal trisomy without karyotype confirmation,” making up 13.1 percent of positive results for autosomal (non-sex chromosome) trisomy. That is to say, 13.1 percent of women who received positive results for trisomy aborted based on screening alone.
Given the authors’ stated PPV for cell-free DNA testing (used alone) of 58.6 percent, statistically, four to five of those unconfirmed terminations followed from false positives, constituting 4.8-6.0 percent of the total. Based on the sparse data available, the termination rates after secondary diagnostic tests of CVS (PPV ~75 percent) or amniocentesis (PPV 92 percent) could range from 53 percent (45/84) to perhaps as high as 82.9 percent . It would follow statistically that a significant number of non-trisomy babies are aborted even after diagnostic tests. All Human Life Should Be Carried to Term
None of this is meant to imply that only healthy babies should be carried to term—that’s a reprehensible position. All human life has value; all humans are image bearers of God. The abysmal proportion of positive prenatal tests that are false is only as consequential as it is because abortion is legal in most of the places where it is used. Not only has the widespread use of prenatal testing practically wiped out the Down Syndrome population in Iceland and Denmark , but it is also prompting mothers and fathers across the world to unwittingly abort normal babies.
If abortion were illegal, couples with positive screening results would not be pressured into abortions by their health-care providers. It would no longer be “an agonizing decision.” It would be, with proper disincentives built into the legal system, a non-starter.
Instead, we have built ableist societies in which people with disabilities or life-limiting conditions are devalued to the point where we accept and even encourage their destruction in the womb, and where mothers and fathers who refuse to participate in death culture struggle to find support during (and after) the pregnancy.
The inaccuracy of prenatal testing isn’t just another misunderstood medical issue. When we try to play God, we pass judgment on those who reject our moral authority and sentence them to despair, pariah status, and a lifelong uphill battle just to have people recognize the dignity of their disabled or life-limited loved ones. When we try to play God, we get more death than we bargained for .
It’s one thing for medical professionals to passively play off of misconceptions about the accuracy of prenatal testing. It’s wholly another for it to do so when the consequences are literal life and death.
Correction: This sentence earlier stated “one in four” instead of “three in four”: “at least three-quarters of birthing women would have a PPV of three in four, according to census data…”"
5 Reasons The Right Shouldn’t Despair About Young Voters’ Leftism,thefederalist.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/5-reasons-right-shouldnt-despair-young-voters-leftism/,"By Jonathan S. Tobin June 11, 2019
Liberal and Never Trump pundits have seen the future, and it is telling them exactly what they want to hear. Polling data and their sense of the way the culture — both entertainment and politics — is trending is leading them to believe that the age gap is the silver bullet that will ensure the political demise not only of President Donald Trump but also of the Republicans as a party of government in the foreseeable future.
The latest prediction along these lines comes from The New York Times’ David Brooks, who wrote last week of “The Coming GOP Apocalypse,” in which he noted that Republicans are “stumbling blind in the age of diversity.” His basic thesis is that young voters “hate” Republicans and there is no reason to think they’ll change their minds as the millenials (those born from 1981 to 1996) and generation Z or post-millenials (those born from 1997 or later) age.
As much as he spoke to a genuine problem for Republicans, however, Brooks’s assumptions should be taken with the same shovelful of salt that all political predictions about future elections cycles deserve.
Even those on the right who dismiss Brooks as a liberal’s idea of a conservative must admit that he raises a troubling prospect. The polls show that voters from 18-38 tilt heavily Democrat. Moreover, as Brooks points out, the difference is largely ideological, with the young being far more inclined to identify as liberals than older Americans.
On key issues, like those relating to gay rights and climate change, young voters tend to take liberal orthodoxy as normative and to regard any dissent as offensive. They are also more likely to embrace the “resistance” against Trump.
If, as a Pew Research Poll shows, only 12 percent of millenials call themselves conservatives and even fewer of those who fit in the generation Z class are on the right, it leads to some very uncomfortable assumptions about what happens as the members of the so-called silent generation (those born from 1928 to 1945) and baby boomers (those born from 1946 to 1964) begin to thin out.
Brooks argues the assumption that people get more conservative as they age isn’t true. To the extent that the young are deeply influenced by the left’s dominance of pop culture — epitomized by the daily in-kind contributions to Democrats made by late-night comedy shows — it’s hard to argue with him on that point.
Brooks is also right that sometimes elections can imprint an ideological orientation on voters. That was the case with many Americans who came of age during the Great Depression, whose largely spurious assumptions about the responsibility for causing that cataclysm and the value of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal affected elections for the next 40 years. Brooks assumes that attitudes about Trump will have the same shelf life.
Even more important, Brooks argues that the electorate’s changing racial composition will be decisive. If America will be a majority-minority country within two decades, then liberal attitudes toward diversity and multiculturalism may be baked into the political cake. But here are five basic reasons why there is a strong case to be made against GOP despair. 1. Predicting the Electoral Future Is Impossible
It is nearly impossible to predict American politics more than one election cycle at a time. As Brooks acknowledged in his article with respect to a 2002 book called “The Emerging Democratic Majority” that essentially made the same prediction about demography dooming the Republicans, trends that seem set in stone don’t always pan out.
Brooks calls the insights of its authors merely premature, but the victories the GOP won in 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2016 undermine their thesis. They are hardly alone in that predicament.
Many on the right thought Karl Rove’s ability to turn out the conservative base in 2004 heralded a long run of Republican dominance. Just two years later Democrats took control of Capitol Hill, then elected Barack Obama two years later.
Former New York Times Book Review editor Sam Tannenhaus was so besotted with Obama’s success that he wrote “The Death of Conservatism,” which foresaw a permanent political shift to the left. That paean to liberal triumphalism was published in time to greet the emergence of the Tea Party movement and the massive GOP victory in 2010. And it’s unlikely that those who wrote books on the heels of Trump’s 2016 win that foresaw endless winning for his brand of Republicanism predicted the Democrats winning back the House in 2018. 2. The Bifurcated Media Means No More Landslides
We live in an era in which adherents of the right and the left no longer read, listen to, or watch the same media. That wasn’t true in earlier eras when fundamental electoral changes occurred.
This means it is extremely difficult for either party or ideological cohort to reach voters who don’t already agree with their side. As a result, there are fewer persuadable swing voters and the possibility of a landslide outcome to a presidential election of the sort that used to occur with some regularity until the 1990s seems remote.
The ability of liberal and conservative media to rally behind their respective sides under any and all circumstances changes the political playing field. No single dominant narrative about an issue or an election is possible under these circumstances, putting assumptions about fundamental changes — even those rooted in demographics — on even shakier ground than in the past. 3. Issues Tend to Overcome Demography
Politics isn’t science. Although academics are always creating models to analyze elections and predict future outcomes, these models only relate to one set of circumstances that will be radically altered by the time the next election occurs.
In some ways, Brook’s predictions mirror the assumptions behind Michael Anton’s famous September 2016 essay, “The Flight 93 Election,” in The Claremont Review of Books. In it, Anton highlighted that conservatives were so afraid fundamental demographic changes would make them a permanent minority that they would embrace Trump.
That caused older white voters to vote more Republican than before. Also, counter to the left’s expectations, even with Trump leading the GOP Hispanics have not become lockstep Democrats in the same manner as African-Americans. Their votes, including those of the young, are up for grabs, and Democrats’ failure to secure them because of their stands on social issues and economics undermines assumptions about their ultimate victory. 4. Candidates Matter as Much as Ideology Does
Political outcomes are always a function of comparison-shopping more than ideology. If Democrats nominate someone who can inspire major portions of the electorate in the way Obama did in 2008, they will win. But the opposite is also true.
Party activists assume that young voters will fall in line behind someone like former vice president Joe Biden in order to beat Trump, and left-wingers think the same about Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. But the idea of any of them generating the kind of massive turnout from minority and young voters that elected Obama in 2008 and 2012 seems a stretch.
The Obama turnout figures, which are the foundation of all demographic predictions about future Democrat wins, may be the white whale liberals chase for the next generation in much the same manner that Republicans sought in vain to generate the same kind of enthusiasm as Ronald Reagan. The electoral coalitions that elected both men were not transferable to others.
Democrats may think antipathy for Trump will be enough to turn their voters out in 2020. But that same assumption failed to work for Hillary Clinton in 2016. There will be no permanent Democratic majority without a candidate around whom voters can rally. In theory, there might be someone like that among the two-dozen Democrats vying for the 2020 presidential nomination, but until they emerge, skepticism is warranted. 5. Ideological Extremism Always Fails
The 2020 Democratic candidates will be primarily focused on pleasing a party base that is shifting hard to the left in the primaries. That means a lot of exposure for some of the most extreme ideas circulating on the left about a massive expansion of entitlements and taxes, not to mention regulations that could reverse the current economic boom. They are prescribing a future that sacrifices economic opportunity for the young in the name of the climate.
Young voters may care about climate change, but a campaign in which Democrats are weighed down by a defense of radical measures like the Green New Deal or the consequences of Medicare for All will create new problems. They are prescribing a future that sacrifices economic opportunity for the young in the name of the climate. The same is true on the cultural issues Brooks assumes work in favor of Democrats if voters think radicals like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez indicate what future Democratic administrations will be like.
Trump’s low favorability ratings won’t matter as much if Democrats are tied to the sort of extreme measures that Americans have always distrusted. Bold political stands create equally bold reactions. If liberals overplay their hand, they won’t win in 2020 or any other election.
None of this ensures that the GOP will win in 2020 or in any future election. Democrats have genuine advantages heading into 2020 with female, minority, and young voters. But Republicans will have every opportunity to mitigate those problems and to increase their advantages among other voters.
Anyone predicting more toxic division is on safe ground. The willingness of both parties to distrust their opponents’ motives guarantees that neither side will fully accept defeat or the legitimacy of their opponents if they win. But anyone who thinks that demography determines the destiny of American politics or a lengthy age of dominance for Democrats has an excellent chance of being proven wrong. Jonathan S.

Watch Corrupt Watergate Fossil John Dean Get Obliterated During Anti-Trump Hearing,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/watch-corrupt-watergate-fossil-john-dean-get-obliterated-anti-trump-hearing/,"June 11, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday, Democrats hauled in a former White House counsel to Richard Nixon, John Dean, to testify on obstruction of justice as they pursue impeachment of Donald Trump. Republican members of Congress criticized Dean, a CNN contributor and author, who is often called on to compare the Russia investigation (or anything Democrats don’t like) to Watergate.
Just as Democrats had hoped, Dean testified on the “remarkable parallels” between Watergate and the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. In fact, Dean, a convicted felon, has repeatedly charged that past Republican presidencies, including Reagan, Bush, and now Trump, are “worse than Watergate.” Dean argued that “events in both 1972 and 2016 resulted in obstruction of the investigations.”
During Monday’s hearing, Rep. Matt Gaetz called out Dean’s unoriginal claims, and noted his appearance as a “prop.”
“Mr. Dean has made a cottage industry out of accusing presidents of acting like Richard Nixon. I would like to know how much money he makes based on making these accusations and exploiting them for his own economic benefit,” Gaetz said.
“It’s not by choice that I’ve done a lot of this. It’s that I’ve been dragged into it,” Dean protested.
“Who forced you — who forced you to accuse George W. Bush of being Richard Nixon?” Gaetz asked.
Indeed, Dean has written and profited from his book, “Worse than Watergate” which makes the case that both President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney should have been impeached for lying to Congress.
Rep. Jim Jordan, also fed up with Democrats’ futile hearings and witnesses, caught Dean in a web of lies and called him out for advising Lanny Davis, Michael Cohen’s lawyer, to obstruct Cohen’s testimony before the House Oversight Committee.
“Today Chairman Nadler brings in front of the judiciary committee a guy to talk about obstruction of justice, a guy who went to prison in 1974 for obstructing justice,” Jordan said. Rep. Jordan calls out John Dean for advising Lanny Davis to obstruct House Committee https://t.co/9tc3VMs0p1 pic.twitter.com/pDWvqRzuge

In 1973, Dean testified before the Senate Watergate Committee against Nixon, and went on to serve four months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal. Rep. Doug Collins called Dean the “’70s star of obstruction.”
“This committee is now hearing from the ’70s and they want their star witness back. In fact, it is very difficult for one of the witnesses here today, for many of us who could actually trace the distrust in government back to the witness here today. The ‘70s star of obstruction,” Collins said.
On Twitter, President Trump suggested that Democrats are using Dean as a prop to “do over” the results of the Mueller report. ….No Obstruction. The Dems were devastated – after all this time and money spent ($40,000,000), the Mueller Report was a disaster for them. But they want a Redo, or Do Over. They are even bringing in @CNN sleazebag attorney John Dean. Sorry, no Do Overs – Go back to work!

"Maternal Instincts Shine In The Cold, Robot World Of ‘I Am Mother’",thefederalist.com,Libby Emmons,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/maternal-instincts-shine-in-the-cold-robot-world-of-i-am-mother/,"June 11, 2019
Heavy spoilers ahead.
Netflix’s “I Am Mother,” directed by Grant Sputore, is a post-apocalyptic psychological thriller that zooms in on the maternal impulse as a driving force for the continuation of humanity. The story begins one day after an “extinction event” wipes everyone out. There are 63,000 embryos stored in the Unu-Hwk Repopulation Facility.
While this is a sort of seed vault for the species, there are no humans until a young girl, spawned from a frozen embryo by a robot mom, becomes the last human on Earth. She is an orphan of an orphaned species, having no contact of any kind except with her robot mom.
Robot Mom, voiced by Rose Byrne, is sentient. She gestates the baby in an external, artificial womb, counting down the months, weeks, days, and hours until precisely the right moment before releasing the baby from its pod. Robot Mom is meticulous in the baby’s care. Formula is mixed in precise measurements, and developmental milestones are rigidly enforced.
It’s sort of terrifying to see a robot nurse cradle a baby. The child grows, with no human contact. Daughter smiles at Robot Mother, although she’s never seen a human smile. She seeks comfort from cold metal and CPU circuits, and throws tiny arms around a mechanical neck. Her sequence of childhood is montaged, with the soundtrack of a 20th century lullaby, and the entire child-raising enterprise looks sterile and cold. One daughter and one Mother Robot are the only beings in the Repopulation Facility, yet the child appears to have no unmet needs, and grows into a well-adjusted teen.
Their home has the feel of a final outpost from a broken earth, in that it has all the provisions necessary, with no ostensible deprivation, and no threat to their utilities. The power is always on. As Daughter grows, she is shown discovering her humanity in this antiseptic space. That humanity is as unsullied as the space. There is no dirt, mess, or disorder.
She watches “The Late Show” to get a sense of what humanity is about. It’s hard to see how she’d get the jokes. With no other humans to relate to, even this unscripted show seems like fiction
Daughter has no frame of reference for reality other than what Mother Robot has presented. Mother Robot is everything: parent, teacher, authority figure, enforcer. In studying medicine, Mother Robot gives a lesson on organ transplantation. She poses an extrapolation of the Trolley Problem, asking if Daughter would choose to save one person over many, or sacrifice that one person, even herself, to save the many.
Mother Robot says “The fundamental axiom suggests that a person is morally obligated to minimize the pain to the greatest number possible.” Daughter accepts this. She knows the importance of placing the needs of others over herself, because it has been drilled into her. She believes that her family is contained in the embryo vault, and she would do anything for these anticipated brothers and sisters. She would risk her own existence, even for an unknown future.
There is a sense in this axiom that perhaps what took humanity down was a focus on individual rights over group demands. Perhaps there was a flaw in the human algorithm that prioritized personal freedom over group need. But no group can have freedom if the freedom of its individuals is compromised. Individuals must choose to be responsible to the group over the pursuit of their own interests; they cannot be forced. People must be trusted to make the right choice.
What is presented as a healthy, fulfilling relationship for Daughter begins to deteriorate when Daughter discovers a mouse. This is the first living thing she has ever encountered, and she wants to cherish it. She shares her joy with Robot Mother, but Robot Mother destroys it, expressing concern that the mouse may carry whatever plague-type event killed everyone. That this mouse is a life form, more similar to Daughter than Robot Mother is, Robot Mother does not understand. Robot Mother either believes in or is programmed to respond as though she is a life form, equally or more capable than humans.
This destruction spawns an urge in Daughter to go outside. She begins to question Robot Mother’s narrative about what’s happening beyond the facilities, and if there are conditions for life. When she works up the nerve to open the sealed, giant steel door, she meets her first human.
Played by Hillary Swank, this is only the second mammal Daughter has met. She knows Robot Mother will most likely kill her as she did the mouse, so she hides her. This new human speaks of a completely different reality than the one Robot Mother has described. It’s as though a veil is being lifted from Daughter’s eyes, and she’s seeing both the possibilities for what truth is, and beginning to have a growing awareness that Robot Mother’s priorities may be totally different from her own.
Robot Mother turns out to be unreliable. The narrative she has told her daughter about the end of humanity left out the part where droids were a big part of the problem. The air outside is not toxic, and there is no roaming infection. Daughter learns that her Robot Mother has been unclear, uncertain, has posited a truth about humanity that is untrue. This is only the first twist of narrative in “I Am Mother,” which takes a sharp turn at every step.
The film opens with the idea that droids can be human caregivers, that they can be maternal beings in our lives, even from infancy. With the coming emergency of robot caregivers for the elderly and AI integration in hospitals, we are getting more comfortable with robots tending to our vulnerable. But as “I Am Mother” progresses, the relationship between droid and human becomes sinister.
What was a symbiotic and comfortable relationship between the childlike human and her mother robot is entirely disrupted by the existence of an actual human being. It is no accident that robot is mother and human is child. The film illustrates how the technology we’ve created now shapes our narrative, we trust it to tell us what reality is, as opposed to the other way around. Do we program our tech, or does our tech program us? In “I Am Mother,” it’s surely the latter.
Daughter discovers that Robot Mother has been fully programmed with the axiom of group needs over the needs of the individual, and that she has destroyed more than the simple mouse. Rearing Daughter is not Robot Mother’s first maternal rodeo. But the others she had gestated to term, cared for, and raised, have all been terminated.
Robot Mother has no reason to tolerate or continue to expend resources on a being that contains imperfections. When Daughter realizes how many of her brothers and sisters have been incinerated, she loses all trust for Robot Mother, too aware that Robot Mother would have no qualms about destroying her if she showed too many flaws.
In many ways, this is not a story about tech, but a coming of age narrative about a girl who has no understanding of reality outside her isolationist mother. She needs to discover her humanity, her autonomy, and take on the responsibility for the next generation that will make her an adult. Daughter is a child until she breaks through the narrative web her mother has woven, sees the dangers in the world beyond, and comes to understand that she has the strength to face and overcome them.
Daughter chooses to trust the human over her mother robot, as we all should. Even so, that human is not giving Daughter the entire truth. The title “I Am Mother,” in the end, is not only a reference to Robot Mother, but to the daughter becoming a mother to all her ungestated brothers and sisters. She is the sexless Eve, nurturing a generation who will necessarily leave her behind.
But she has been taught well, and as a true, human mother, she will sacrifice herself for the unwritten future of her children. Maybe what this film is telling us is that it’s the mother’s impulse, the maternal instinct, that will save us. Libby Emmons is a writer and theatre maker in Brooklyn, New York.

The Left Preaches Diversity While Forcing Conformity Through Culture And Courts,thefederalist.com,Kristen Waggoner,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/left-preaches-diversity-forcing-conformity-culture-courts/,"By Kristen Waggoner June 11, 2019
We hear an awful lot from the left about how important it is to promote diversity and make sure all perspectives are represented. But while politically left groups certainly value the importance of promoting their views and making sure their perspectives are represented, time and time again they’ve shown that their diversity commitment seldom includes those who hold different views. In fact, anyone who disagrees with leftist dogma runs the risk of being vilified, slandered, and silenced.
Just ask Kay Coles James, president of The Heritage Foundation. Earlier this year, James was appointed to Google’s external advisory committee on artificial intelligence. The point of the committee was to have a dialogue among people with varying viewpoints about the appropriate role of artificial intelligence in society. Sounds like a great idea, doesn’t it?
But there was a snag: James doesn’t share the left’s views on every issue, and it didn’t take long for Google employees to make their anti-conservative bias clear. A petition started circulating, calling for Google executives to eject James from the committee because of her views—such as her reasonable view that biology and sex are related, and her defense of limited government. The petition quickly turned into a social media firestorm in which James was publicly slandered and insulted, with no opportunity to defend herself.
Rather than standing up for true diversity, Google caved. Google dissolved the committee, communicating that the presence of a single individual with a diverse viewpoint made dialogue impossible.
James opened up about her experience on Fox News in May, sharing just how disturbing it was to hear how the left characterized her. One slanderous title that really made her head spin was that she, an African-American woman, was a “white nationalist.” “I didn’t recognize the person they were describing,” James said. “This was bigotry.”
James’ strong indictment runs counter to a predominant cultural narrative that says progressives are above bigotry, and those who disagree with them are guilty until proven innocent. The actions she calls out—slandering and excluding those who have different views—are incredibly widespread. Every day, individuals on public university campuses, in business and the arts, and in medical professions have to choose between sharing their beliefs and living out their values in their education, careers, or businesses, or being blasted as bigots the way James was.
“Diversity” advocates are so committed to shutting down opposing views that they don’t limit themselves to cultural pressures to get their way. They also use federal courts to improperly redefine federal law to marginalize opposing views.
Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in the case R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Home v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the EEOC could force a century-old, family-run funeral home to allow a male funeral director to wear women’s clothing when serving and supporting grieving family members and friends—in direct conflict with the funeral home’s sex-specific dress code.
There was nothing exceptional about the funeral home’s reasonable stance: Federal law has long allowed sex-specific dress codes, as confirmed by the EEOC’s own employment panel. So to pull off this ruling, the Sixth Circuit unilaterally redefined “sex” under Title VII federal employment law, which provides for equal employment opportunities regardless of a person’s race, religion, national origin, or sex.
When Title VII was enacted in 1964, the public meaning of sex was biological sex, either male or female. After all, that meaning has been rooted in the English language from time immemorial. Ironically, Title VII was a law that protected women, ensuring that employers couldn’t discriminate against women in their employment practices.
By redefining “sex” to mean “gender identity” or “transgender status” rather than biological male or female, the Sixth Circuit punished Harris Funeral Homes for violating a law that was completely different than the one Congress enacted. And the court created innumerable other problems.
If “sex” means “gender identity,” then biological men can take women’s spots in high school athletic competitions, as recently happened in New England. Biological men could also demand to sleep mere feet away from women who have been victimized by rape and domestic violence, as happened in Anchorage, Alaska .
Of course there is room in our culture to debate the nature and value of gender identity theory. But reinterpreting laws that have a well-understood public meaning to punish a business owner and to deny women equal opportunities and bodily privacy is the exact opposite of respecting diversity. Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court has accepted Harris Funeral Homes for review, providing an opportunity to correct the Sixth Circuit’s ruling.
Diversity of thought is an absolute necessity in our country. America is diverse—beautifully, wonderfully, incredibly diverse. To preserve that diversity, we must be able to respectfully share our different perspectives without being shut down.
What the Sixth Circuit did by unilaterally imposing a trendy notion that sex and biology aren’t related was an attempt to silence one point of view. What Google did when it dissolved the committee on artificial intelligence implies that the presence of one dissenting view justifies ending the discussion.
So if we truly believe in diversity, we have to stand up for the people and perspectives that are being systematically attacked by the left. When Alliance Defending Freedom argued at the Supreme Court for Jack Phillips and his views on marriage in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case , and for pregnancy centers and their views on life in NIFLA v. Becerra , we were arguing freedom for all Americans.
Now that the Supreme Court has accepted the Harris case, we will do so again, arguing that the public meaning of “sex” discrimination in 1964 referred to biological sex, and that changing the meaning through judicial fiat harms businesses who rely on the law and women who are entitled to equal opportunity and bodily privacy.
After all, the ability to debate this in our culture and in our legislatures is a freedom for us all, and the wins for freedom in Masterpiece and NIFLA were wins for all of us—as would be a win for Harris Funeral Homes.

If The 2020 Democratic Candidates Were Cast In ‘The Office’,thefederalist.com,Chrissy Clark,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/10/2020-democratic-candidates-cast-office/,"June 10, 2019 By Chrissy Clark
“The Office” quickly became one of the most quotable TV shows with cringe-worthy moments and lines so stupid it makes you laugh out loud. It turns out the 2020 Democratic presidential field isn’t all that different. Here’s who each of the 2020 Dems would be if they took a role in NBC’s “The Office.”
Joe Biden: Michael Scott
\
Plagiarism and flipping your position multiple times — sound familiar? They’re both bad, and both Joe Biden and Michael Scott don’t seem to understand that. Let’s explain it to them like they’re five.
Biden is notorious for using work that is not his own. Michael Scott wrote Pam a goodbye poem when she left for art school in New York, and he “took a lot from other poems.” When he wrote Helene’s birthday poem, he stole it wholesale from Shel Silverstein.
Changing stances on the Hyde Amendment that prevents federal funds from paying for abortions is Biden’s specialty. Flip-flopping is Michael Scott’s specialty, as well. How about Scott’s Tots?
Cory Booker: Dwight Schrute
Cory Booker and Dwight Schrute both don’t want to be idiots, but with titles like “Spartacus” and “Assistant to the Regional Manager,” it’s tough not to. Cory Booker wants to pass health care for all, which is wildly unrealistic. When Phyllis gets flashed by a pedophile, Dwight wants to rid the office of bananas and women wearing makeup in order to solve the problem. Also unrealistic. They both have good intentions, but terrible solutions.
Pete Buttigieg: Toby Flenderson
They both try to be heard and no one seems to be listening to their obvious, yet gentle, messaging. Pete Buttigieg truly is the Toby of the 2020 Democratic race. Buttigieg tries to be heard and tell anyone who will listen about his platform and his ideas, just like Toby tries to tell everyone about his time on the Scranton Strangler jury.
As a mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Buttigieg may as well be back in the annex with Toby. Residents of South Bend say Buttigieg hasn’t done much to help the city, and Michael Scott would say the same thing about Toby in the office.
Kirsten Gillibrand: Holly Flax
A little awkward and a lot of cringeworthy? Sounds like Kirsten Gillibrand and Holly Flax all summed up. Gillibrand showed up to the Iowa LGBT pride parade, and a video posted of her was about as weird as flipping someone off with your ring finger. Kirsten Gillibrand relaxes after working a gay bar in Iowa pic.twitter.com/JYiU3c0Oc9
— 2020 behind the scenes (@Behind2020) June 8, 2019
Kamala Harris: Jan Levinson
Kamala Harris has an issue with everything and everyone, so does Jan Levinson. Jan claims to have a “self-destructive streak,” and if you follow Harris’s campaign for more than five minutes, you’ll come to similar conclusions. Not to mention that it’s difficult to find a picture of Jan in a colorful outfit, and same with Kamala. Grey and black blazer suits are a go-to for these self-destructive #girlbosses.
Beto O’Rourke: Andy Bernard
A candidate who looks perfect on paper, but then you meet him in real life and he’s, well, awkward. These two are constantly trying to impress those around them in their rise to mediocrity.
Beto was given the opportunity to run for what seemed like a vulnerable seat in the Senate, and he failed. Andy was given the opportunity to become regional manager of Dunder Mifflin-Scranton, and he failed as well. Maybe they should both pursue their careers in acting.
Bernie Sanders: Creed Bratton
Creed is the office nut job. He talks about subjects that make no sense and he’s losing his mind. But he doesn’t care, and neither does Bernie. Democratic leadership has condemned Bernie for his outwardly socialist policies and for promoting unrealistic ideas, but you know who doesn’t care? Bernie. Because he’s Democrats’ nut job.
Elizabeth Warren: Angela Martin
Elizabeth Warren and Angela Martin are substance-oriented women, but they don’t have a lot of flash going for them. When Warren first announced that she was running for president, she posted a video of her drinking a beer. It makes you feel bad for her beer.
When Angela wanted to win the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre coupon book, she wore a slutty nurse’s costume. She walked down the runway in a manner that made the whole office stop and cringe.
Andrew Yang: Kelly Kapoor
He’s like really smart for coming up with ideas that won’t work in this country. You could ask Andrew Yang what he wants to do about health care in the United States, and he would be like “Blah blah blah blah blah blah,” giving you the exact answer that only the socialists in this country want to hear.
Although Yang has a ton of ideas for if he were to become president, he consistently has to prove it to Americans, because when you look at his campaign website , you might think he’s a little crazy.

Un-Woke John Cleese Lights Up Twitter,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/un-woke-john-cleese-lights-up-twitter/,"June 11, 2019 By David Marcus
John Cleese, of “Monty Python” and “Fawlty Towers” fame, has been stirring up a bit of controversy. Last month, he went on record saying that he no longer views London as an English city as a result of immigration and cultural change in the English capital. Cleese, who left England last year to take up permanent residence in the Caribbean, is not backing down from the comment. In fact, he’s lighting up Twitter, to the dismay of the woke.
In a series of tweets over the last few days and in his typical dry and wry fashion, Cleese has taken aim at the idea that race, and other things such as sex, are simply social constructs. The undercurrent is the idea that we simply can’t say things that are demonstrably true anymore lest someone, somewhere, take offense. True. Many folk believe there's only one sex too
I've also hear there's a lot to be said for the idea that the North pole and the South pole are virtually indistinguishable
Everything's on a spectrum now. And quite right, too
So that should settle our differences https://t.co/CanzzabaUQ
— John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 3, 2019 We are the same height
The difference between us is merely a social construct https://t.co/SHO5zjJRiu
— John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 10, 2019 I have been assured by some geneticists that the idea of 'race' is purely a 'social construct' that has no basis in reality
Good news !
But I think they should inform the Institute of Race Relations, as this may make it harder for them to pursue cases of racial discrimination
— John Cleese (@JohnCleese) June 11, 2019
In looking back over his storied career, it is easy to see why Cleese would be nervous about the politically correct bent of our current media and society. Much of his own comedic work from the late 1960s and early 1970s would appear terribly offensive if viewed through the lens of today’s identity politics.
In “Fawlty Towers,” the lovable bellhop Manuel was played by German-born British actor Andrew Sachs with a stereotypical Spanish accent and a distinct lack of intellect. Such a broad-brush ethnic character played by a white actor would certainly be out of bounds in today’s media environment.
Likewise, in in the Monty Python movie “The Life of Brian,” while playing a revolutionary Cleese mocks Eric Idle’s character, Stan, for wanting to become a woman called Loretta. Stan, or is it Loretta, says he (or she), wants to have babies, prompting Cleese to inform him (or her) that he or she doesn’t have a womb, then asking if the fetus will gestate in a box. This again clearly runs afoul of today’s progressive positions on gender and would likely never make it on stage in a movie today.
Cleese is not the only British comedian clashing with the censorious nature of today’s progressives. Stephen Fry of “Fry and Laurie,” and the best Jeeves to ever appear on screen, teamed up recently with Jordan Peterson to debate political correctness against Michael Eric Dyson and Michelle Goldberg.
Fry quite correctly knew he would catch a lot of grief for appearing with Peterson, whom some on the left believe to be a dangerous bigot, but just before the debate Fry said, “I wanted to appear with someone from a different side of the political spectrum, if you can put it that way, in order to express, as much as anything, just a sense of worry.”
Fry is right to be worried, and so is Cleese. Fry is not without his own fraught comic history, as one episode of his “Jeeves and Wooster” series contains multiple scenes featuring blackface. What both comedians have realized and are worried about is that we cannot have a productive society in which anything that offends people cannot be spoken.

Kirsten Gillibrand Compares Pro-Life Views To Racism,thefederalist.com,Chrissy Clark,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/11/kirsten-gillibrand-compares-pro-life-views-racism/,"June 11, 2019 By Chrissy Clark
During an interview with the Des Moines Register, Kirsten Gillibrand compared pro-life beliefs to racism.
“There’s no moral equivalency when it comes to racism. And I do not think there’s a moral equivalency when it comes to changing laws that deny women reproductive freedom,” Gillibrand said.
The latest Marist poll shows that a 47 percent of Americans call themselves pro-life, while 47 percent consider themselves pro-choice. Seventy-one percent of Americans oppose abortion after a child reaches 20 weeks of gestation. Are the majority of Americans morally equivalent to racists? Or has Kirsten Gillibrand gotten her moral understanding of abortion precisely backward? Kirsten Gillibrand compared pro-life beliefs to racism and suggested the pro-life viewpoint is ""not acceptable"" during an interview with the Des Moines Register https://t.co/B2Cvvgnt6e pic.twitter.com/Knr4h5OvVh

In her opening statement, Gillibrand said some issues that have such moral clarity that society has fully decided that the other side is not acceptable. She was referencing a pro-life stance.
Gillibrand’s notion that being pro-life is a radical, ultra-conservative position is false. The most up-to-date Gallup poll states that Americans are split 48 percent to 48 percent when asked if they identify as pro-life or pro-choice. When half of Americans call themselves pro-life, to suggest that being pro-life is radical in any way, shape, or form is not only false but the height of hubris.
“Imagine saying that it’s okay to appoint a judge who’s racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic, asking someone to appoint someone who takes away basic human rights of any group of people in America — I don’t think those are political issues anymore,” Gillibrand said.
Comparing pro-life views to racist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic views is nuts. Not that Gillibrand ever had a chance at becoming president, but after this interview her chances are looking even more grim.
Gillibrand also argued that imposing religion on the American people is a direct violation of the Constitution, as if opposing policies due to one’s religion is beyond the pale, or pro-lifers don’t also make myriad scientific arguments.
“And all these efforts by President Trump and other ultra-radical conservative judges and justices to impose their faith on Americans is contrary to our Constitution. And that’s what it is. And so, I believe that for all of these issues they are not issues where there is a fair other side,” Gillibrand said.
Only 28 percent of Americans believe that abortion during the second trimester, or after a baby has grown inside his mother’s womb for approximately 14 weeks of the total 40, should be legal. Gillibrand wants to make abortion legally available at any and all times during pregnancy, regardless of whether the fetus has a heartbeat or is about to exit his mother’s womb. Approximately nine out of ten Americans oppose near-birth abortions.
If Kirsten Gillibrand really wanted to give us a lecture on following the Constitution, she would have explained that even the left knows the Supreme Court spit on the Constitution when it decided Roe v. Wade . That 1973 decision forced until-birth abortion policies on the entire nation with no ability for the people of each state to decide that issue themselves, or ever alter their decisions, through their lawfully elected representatives.

Campus Insanity Is Migrating To Society. Stop It Before It's Too Late,thefederalist.com,Inez Feltscher Stepman,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/campus-insanity-migrating-society-republicans-better-stop-late/,"June 12, 2019 By Inez Feltscher Stepman
Conservatives once laughed at radical campus politics, imagining that upon impact with the “real world,” blue-haired social justice warrior activists would have to grow up and confront the hard realities of the capitalist marketplace. Instead, what’s becoming increasingly clear is that academic leftism is metastasizing off-campus, spreading into some of the world’s largest corporations as well as institutions of culture, with graduated millennial employees as its carriers.
While the right wrestles with how to deal with big technology companies’ hostility to conservative voices on their platforms, the source of that enmity goes mostly unremarked upon: Google’s highly credentialed workforce has roughly the personal politics of a faculty lounge. Regrettably, universities don’t live up to the Las Vegas adage–what begins on campus definitely does not stay there. It spills over into every aspect of our broader culture, from complaints about actors not precisely matching the intersectionality profile of the characters they portray, to the leftward tilt of America’s corporations.
That’s all the more reason for Republicans on campus to take the ideology that threatens free speech in universities seriously and advance legislation to protect one of America’s most cherished freedoms. Without strong, smart pushback at the academic source, the country will soon be dealing with even more censorious consequences of an ideology that does not recognize its opponents’ rights to speak.
Congress is currently considering the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA), the law that governs the doling out of billions to universities in the form of direct grants and subsidized student loans. President Trump’s executive order on free speech, which directs agencies to ensure that public universities are in compliance with the First Amendment, is massively popular across political and racial categories, although the limits of executive action prevent effective enforcement of its dictates.
Even so, key Republican leaders, like Senator Lamar Alexander (R–Tenn.), are resisting calls from among their colleagues and conservative groups to attach protections for free speech to the endlessly flowing spigot of cash from Washington. Instead, Republicans seem to be substituting real support for free speech with a toothless resolution, which pays lip service to calling out speech codes and speech “zones” as contrary to the First Amendment.
The HEA already has similar language, which, due to lack of any enforcement mechanism, has not stopped the routine and serious speech violations occurring at universities across the country. In place of one of the most foundational political battles of our time, Republicans are prioritizing for their HEA negotiations a kind of technocratic, No Child Left Behind-style matrix accessing the value of various college degrees.
Unless the right gets serious about the role massive taxpayer sponsorship plays in keeping the institutional left bankrolled, recent debates between traditional small-l liberal conservatives and those who want to use the power of government to advance communitarian ends are irrelevant to the actual political battleground. Libertarians, populists, and traditionalists should all be able to agree that government shouldn’t throw its weight heavily in favor of the left in the culture wars, yet that’s exactly what’s happening in education and many other key areas of policy.
Academia’s radicalization—and the resulting unconstitutional policing of speech—should be the highest priority for Republicans in HEA reauthorization. If the formerly Grand Old Party lacks the spine to cut off the massive flow of subsidies to colleges and universities, they should at minimum require that public universities respect their constitutional obligations under the First Amendment in order to receive their taxpayer largesse.

"Deal Or Not, Mexico Can’t Stop The Border Crisis On Its Own",thefederalist.com,John Daniel Davidson,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/deal-not-mexico-cant-stop-border-crisis/,"By John Daniel Davidson June 12, 2019
Let’s get something straight: the deal announced last week between the United States and Mexico to avert tariffs and curb the border crisis isn’t going to work. Unveiled as a diplomatic triumph, the deal says Mexico will send 6,000 National Guard troops to the Guatemalan border and allow Central American migrants to remain in Mexico pending their asylum claims in the United States.
These are almost entirely face-saving measures for both the Trump administration and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. They have the virtue of making it seem like the United States, through tough diplomacy and the threat of punitive tariffs, has convinced Mexico to crack down on human smuggling and illegal immigration. But in practice they amount to smoke and mirrors.
The deal, touted by Trump officials on Monday as a breakthrough , will likely have little long-term effect on the actual numbers of migrants arriving at the U.S. border, or on the underlying conditions prompting so many Central Americans to leave their homes in the first place The Mexican National Guard Does Not Inspire Confidence
To understand why, consider the measures themselves. The deployment of the Mexican National Guard, a force that came into being less than a year ago as a way to fight organized crime, is not a serious move. López Obrador created the 60,000-member Guard shortly after taking office last year as a corrective to the failed policy of his predecessor, President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose federal paramilitary police force, or gendarmerie , proved totally ineffective .
The Guard is a hybrid organization, comprising officers from the Federal Police and members of the army and navy’s policing units, but run by civilian leadership in the Ministry of Security and Citizen Protection. That leadership is untested, and sending a 6,000-man detachment of troops to the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, without any clear policy directives or infrastructure for detaining migrants, seems to be asking for more of the grave human rights abuses , including the disappearance of minors, that the Army and Navy have been implicated in along Mexico’s northern border.
Beyond questions of corruption and abuse is the matter of simple competence. How exactly is the Guard going to stop illegal immigration from Guatemala along a porous 541-mile border that almost entirely lacks the security features of our border with Mexico? As Todd Bensman of the Center for Immigration Studies noted in a recent post , the Mexicans shouldn’t expect any help from Guatemalan officials, which they will certainly need to be effective.
“That’s because Guatemala’s leadership, border patrol, and police forces all have been neck-deep in the smuggling industry for years, despite ongoing corruption investigations and a contentious national election campaign,” writes Bensman, adding that the smuggling infrastructure in Guatemala and southern Mexico is “entrenched, dynamic, and politically connected, having grown uninhibited for decades and with citizen populations on both sides depending on it for sustenance.”
Mexican security forces might not even try to take on sophisticated and well-financed smuggling networks and focus instead on relatively easy-to-target caravans. Last week, Mexican authorities arrested two caravan organizers, including the head of advocacy group People Without Borders, and charged them with human smuggling. The irony is that migrants join caravans because they can’t afford to hire smugglers, and traveling with a large group helps protect them from predation by cartels and corrupt officials.
One human rights advocate told the Wall Street Journal that the security forces “are taking on the poorest migrants who travel in caravans or alone, but they are doing little to dismantle criminal networks.” The poorest migrants traveling in caravans certainly make for easier enforcement targets—especially if the goal is to make it appear that Mexican officials are cracking down on illegal immigration. How Exactly Will ‘Remain In Mexico’ Work?
The second measure in the deal involves a border-wide expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocol program, informally known as “Remain in Mexico,” which forces Central American asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases work their way through U.S. immigration court.
This is the part of the deal we know least about. How exactly will it work, even on a practical level? Since the program began this year, only about 10,000 asylum-seekers have been sent back to Mexico. In recent weeks, U.S. authorities have been sending about 250 a day back. But Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that Mexico had agreed to allow “ALL illegal immigrants from Central America to remain in Mexico pending their asylum claims.”
All? Right now, U.S. Border Patrol is arresting on average more than 4,200 people a day, about 60 percent of which are asylum-seekers from Central America. Does the vice president mean to imply that the United States is going to send thousands of asylum seekers a day back to Mexico?
Whatever one thinks of the policy, that’s simply not going to happen. Mexico doesn’t have the resources to house that many people in its northern border cities, which are themselves some of the most dangerous cities in the world, where migrants are often targeted for kidnapping and extortion.
Even if the United States does start sending thousands of Central Americans back to Mexico every day, many of them, facing horrible conditions and grave danger, will simply turn around and try to sneak into the United States without being detected. That will further tax U.S. Border Patrol and add to the chaos along the border. More Than Anything, the Deal Is a PR Stunt
Beyond the specific reasons these measures likely won’t do much to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from Central America is the larger problem of placing the onus for solving the migrant crisis on the Mexican state, whose institutions are notoriously weak and susceptible to corruption. Mexican civil society is in crisis. The last two years have seen a record number of homicides in Mexico , with more than 130 political candidates assassinated in the months leading up to national elections last year.
The reality is that the government of President López Obrador is no more in control of migrant smuggling networks in Mexico than the U.S. Border Patrol is, and unless America is prepared to give substantial and direct aid—and Mexico is prepared to accept it—asking Mexico to solve this problem on its own is pure fantasy.
The deal might nevertheless accomplish its near-term goal of making it seem like something is being done about the crisis. The number of border apprehensions is probably going to drop in June after reaching nearly 133,000 in May, including more 100,000 families and unaccompanied minors. This is because of the heat, and it follows a regular pattern. Arrests along the southwest border have dropped every June since 2000—with the exception of 2017, when the numbers were at their lowest point in a half-century.
That means next month when the numbers drop, the Trump administration can claim a big victory regardless of what Mexico does. That, of course, is the real purpose of the deal. John is a senior correspondent for The Federalist. Follow him on Twitter. Photo U.S. Customs and Border Protection"
Whether The Media Adores Intel Agencies Depends On Who's President - The Federalist,thefederalist.com,,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/whether-media-adores-despises-intel-agencies-depends-whos-president/,"By Lew Jan Olowski June 12, 2019
Media’s heart and soul is partisanship. When journalists appeal to principle, they are faking a moral identity for the sake of their political agenda.
Consider The Daily Beast’s attack last weekend upon a private citizen. They investigated and shamed him just because he shared a slowed-down video excerpt of Democratic Party leader Nancy Pelosi (which you can slow down yourself ). The journalist who attacked this private citizen is a known felon .
Bad faith underlies much news reporting, not just occasional abuses like this one. For example, the media’s attitude toward government accountability hinges upon the current president’s party affiliation. Specifically, contrast media’s present opposition to investigating intelligence agencies for spying on Americans versus their decades-long persecution of intelligence agencies for interrogating foreign terrorists.
Today, media weep crocodile tears for intelligence agencies. They accuse the attorney general of politicizing intelligence . They bemoan agency morale . They say lives are at stake . They claim it is an abuse of power and a threat to national security for the president to declassify public records about intelligence agencies spying on Americans. They call the investigation a corrupt propaganda exercise and “an escalation of the president’s yearslong assault on the intelligence community.”
Yet media are the undisputed champions of corrupt propaganda and of waging such “yearslong assaults.” For most of this century, they demonized American intelligence agents for waterboarding foreign terrorists in pursuit of information. Media called them “ torturers ” and compared them to Japanese war criminals. They urged President Obama to criminally prosecute elected officials, civil servants, lawyers, and even medical doctors at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Few accused President Obama of threatening national security when the president declassified top-secret documents about CIA interrogation methods. And few mourned agency morale when the president imprisoned a CIA whistle-blower who hadn’t even done the waterboarding.
Why was the news media unconcerned about intelligence workers’ morale under Presidents Bush and Obama? And why is the news media more upset about intelligence agents abusing foreign terrorists than about intelligence agents abusing American citizens?
The difference, of course, is partisan. These media supported President Obama, a Democrat, even when the president condemned intelligence agencies over their treatment of foreign terrorists. And they attack President Trump, a Republican, even when the president investigates the intelligence agencies over its treatment of Americans.
Likewise, under President Bush, a Republican, media hated the CIA’s interrogation program, while under President Obama, media were nonchalant about the president’s “ kill list .” The president bombed foreign terrorists and their families—even targeting a U.S. citizen teenager —instead of merely capturing and interrogating them.
To be sure, President Obama was correct to kill terrorists in defense of the United States. Accordingly, President Obama should not have chastised Americans who interrogated these same people for that same purpose under President Bush. It is absurd to support bombing suspected terrorists off a “kill list” but object to waterboarding suspected terrorists in pursuit of information.
U.S. intelligence agents risked their lives and freedom to capture and interrogate terrorists. We owe these agents our gratitude. And we owe nothing to al-Qaeda terrorists our government has killed or interrogated: not even a word of apology or regret, however insincere.
But, of course, the American people deserve to know what’s being done in their name. Hence the value of the whistle-blower who confirmed that the CIA waterboarded foreign terrorists in pursuit of information. President Obama thanked this whistle-blower by throwing him in jail; President Trump should pardon him , instead.
Punishing intelligence agents for protecting America from actual foreign terrorists, and for informing Americans about it, is peak ingratitude. It’s also dangerous. When intelligence agents choose to bomb terrorists, or merely interview them instead of capturing and exhaustively interrogating them, then it becomes slightly easier for terrorists to compartmentalize their most valuable information: the information they might only forfeit at their wits’ end , if at all. Information gathered under the CIA’s interrogation programs even contributed to the intelligence that led the United States to Osama bin Laden .
Intelligence agencies’ worst misconduct under this interrogation program was to spy on the Democrats in Congress who were investigating it. CIA agents read Senate emails. The CIA used a fake identity to gain access to Senate computers. CIA agents also sent false information to the Justice Department, hoping that it would result in criminal indictments. CIA Director John Brennan falsely denied the affair.
Regardless, since such spying happened under President Obama, few called for Brennan’s resignation—let alone for impeaching the president. After all, it wasn’t a partisan issue, but merely an ethical one, so it was easy to ignore.
The fruits of that ignorance are obvious. Before spying on Congress, President Obama’s administration had first gotten away with targeting grassroots activists through the Internal Revenue Service. After jailing the CIA whistleblower, the Obama administration also scapegoated and imprisoned a YouTuber, punishing his free speech. Then the White House spied on Congress again , targeting opponents of its nuclear giveaway to Iran, and spying on American supporters of Israel more generally.
Eventually the Obama administration spied on the Republican presidential campaign under fake pretenses while excusing actual criminality by the Democratic candidate. Weaponizing the government against its political opponents had become a yearslong habit. And when Obama’s FBI failed to rig the 2016 presidential election, their “ insurance policy “ targeted the new president-elect and his transition team instead, fishing for an impeachment referral .
We do not have a constitutional republic if federal police censor, surveil, entrap, and imprison dissenters, then insubordinate themselves to successive presidents. But not everyone wants a constitutional republic. Hence the media’s apparent yearning for a one-party system of government and its penchant for punishing thought crime among private citizens . Although we cannot force the media to genuinely appreciate civil liberties or attempt objectivity in news reporting, we can at least call them out when they fake it. Photo"
Democratic Candidate Who Had Sex With A Minor Has Plenty Of Company,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/democratic-candidate-sex-minor-plenty-company/,"June 12, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
In addition to blackface, infanticide , and alleged sexual assault , the Democratic Party in Virginia can now add “sex with minors” to the list of questionable hobbies they’ll allow politicians to dabble in.
On Tuesday night, Joe Morrissey, a former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, won the Democratic primary for state senate. It was less than four years ago when Morrissey, who was in his fifties at the time, was jailed for having sex with a 17-year-old secretary at his law firm. According to statements from a prosecutor, Morrissey had sex with the girl multiple times in his law office and possessed a nude picture of her that he texted to a friend.
Morrissey was indicted for felony charges of indecent liberties with a minor and possession and distribution of child pornography. He denied the charges, but ended up pleading guilty to a misdemeanor in 2015. After serving jail time that year, he continued to deny sexual contact with the teenager, then denied paternity of a baby she delivered months later. Fast-forward a few more months, and Morrissey admitted on the radio that he was the father of the child, and the former secretary is now his wife.
Morrissey won Tuesday’s primary by 14 points, defeating incumbent state Sen. Rosalyn Dance, who was endorsed by Gov. Ralph Northam. Despite campaigning against Northam and the Democratic establishment, both Morrissey and the governor are doing their part in exposing Democrats’ hypocritical pearl-clutching about the sexual behavior of political candidates.
We all know about how media on the left and right talk about Donald Trump’s sexual history. And no one can forget that, for weeks leading up to the Alabama Senate race in 2017, all journalists and the pundit class could talk about was how Republican candidate Roy Moore was a pedophile for dating teenagers. They did forensic analysis on yearbooks from the 1970s, and shamed Alabama voters who supported Moore.
Now we have a modern-day romance with a 40-year age difference and another power dynamic between a teenager and her boss to boot. All without a single question raised or Virginia voter shamed by media think pieces.
Of course, we know exactly how these two cases studies would have turned out if Morrissey and Moore swapped the “D” and the “R” near their names. But what really makes this story rich is that Morrissey is simply another politician in a long list of morally objectionable elected officials who currently hold office in the Commonwealth.
At least Morrissey, who stepped into his son’s life after an unexpected pregnancy, chose life — unlike Northam, who supports late-term abortion and advocates for killing unwanted children after failed abortions. Of course, there is still time for racist photos of Morrissey wearing blackface or a Klu Klux Klan robe to emerge, like they did Northam, or for women from his past to step forward with accusations of sexual assault, like they did for Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax.
But thanks to the new standards set by both Democratic leadership and the media establishment (but I repeat myself), the new state senator candidate will not have to worry for a second about his job security should any additional scandals emerge.

"Hey Joe Biden, Here Are Some Scandals You Forgot About",thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/hey-joe-biden-here-are-some-scandals-you-forgot-about/,"By David Harsanyi June 12, 2019
“Know what I was most proud of?” presidential candidate Joe Biden told a crowd on Wednesday. “For eight years, there wasn’t one single hint of a scandal or a lie.”
In an era where every presidential tweet is an existential threat to democracy, there are probably plenty of people who believe this myth. Off the bat, though, it should be mentioned that even liberal factchecking outfit PolitiFact once awarded Barack Obama the “Lie of Year” for misleading the American people about his technocratic health-care plan.
Our former vice president, no slouch about misleading the public on the ACA, probably forgot.
Obama’s most famous lie, of course, upturned millions of lives. Without it, it’s doubtful Obamacare—which was perhaps the only wholly partisan national reform effort in American history—would ever have passed. Even with a stream of falsehoods, the bill had to be shoe-horned through Congress. Media did a lot of heavy lifting for the administration in those heady days.
“If you like your health care plan, you can keep it” was only one of an array of demonstrably false statements fed to the public to give (now-extinct) moderate Democrats cover. You might remember one of Obamacare’s architects, Jonathan Gruber, explaining how this “lack of transparency” compounded by “the stupidity of the American voter” was a huge political advantage for the administration. Or maybe you don’t.
How many Americans knew, for instance, that “Operation Fast and Furious” put around 2,000 weapons into the hands of narco-traffickers (and an Islamic terrorist), leading to the murder of hundreds of Mexican citizens, and at least one American, a border agent named Brian Terry ? Not enough.
There must have been at least a sniff of scandal, by the way, because even after a federal judge rejected Obama’s assertion of executive privilege in efforts to deny Congress files relating to the operation, the administration wouldn’t budge. Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, refused to cooperate in the investigation, becoming the first sitting attorney general in American history to be held in contempt of Congress — a vote that included 17 Democrats.
That’s odd, because today asserting executive privilege is exactly like Watergate. And ignoring courts? Well, Obama did that all the time .
Then again, Obama could secretly send planes filled with cash to pay ransom to an Islamist terror state responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American servicemen (using money that had been earmarked for terror victims), and most reporters would still regurgitate echo-chamber talking points . You remember Ben Rhodes bragging about how the Obama administration could trick 27-years-olds whose “only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns” because they “literally know nothing?”
Politico’s Josh Meyer, who did know something, would write a deeply sourced piece —featuring numerous real-life, on-the-record administration officials— about the Obama administration’s efforts to undermine investigations into a drug-trafficking ring run by Hezbollah operating in the United States , and most major news organizations never even mentioned it.
Today, President Trump’s Twitter attacks on CNN reporters are threats to the future of free expression. Back in 2012, the Obama’s Department of Justice spied on the Associated Press, tapping around 20 different phone lines—including cell phone and home lines—that captured at least 100 staffers who worked for the outlet. The government kept records of all outgoing calls “for both the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters” and the main line used by reporters in the House of Representatives.
The Justice Department had already spied on Fox News reporter James Rosen in 2010 , collecting his telephone records, looking at his personal emails, and tracking his movements. Holder, by the way, shopped the case to three separate judges, until he found one who let him name Rosen a co-conspirator in the crime of reporting the news. If only this episode had gotten a fraction of the breathless coverage of a William Barr letter.
There is, of course, so much more. Obama’s CIA director, John Brennan, oversaw an operation of illegal spying on a staffer of the legislative branch of the U.S. government . At least five agency officials under his watch broke into Senate computer files, viewing drafts of a report on torture and reconstructing emails of at least one staffer. Brennan would attempt to cover up the agency’s actions by doubling down, blaming the Senate, and pushing to fire at least one staffer charged with investigating his agency.
Then there is Obama’s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who brazenly lied to Congress about spying on American citizens.
Biden might not remember that Internal Revenue Service leadership aggressively targeted conservative groups to undermine their voice in elections. The IRS admitted as much in an apology letter . Then there was Obama national security advisor Susan Rice, who went on national television and claimed that terrorist attacks against Americans at Benghazi were a “spontaneous reaction” to “hateful and offensive video,” even when she knew it was a sophisticated and pre-planned terror attack. Defenders of free expression were nowhere to be found as the maker of the video was conveniently thrown into jail .
There were cronyistic green projects that enriched political allies . There was the Secret Service’s many embarrassing breaches and general debauchery. There was Hillary Clinton’s infamous attempts to circumvent transparency — more than likely to cover up favor-trading. Even more seriously, there was Veterans Affairs negligence .
Then again, perhaps Biden feels “most proud” of his mythical eight years of non-scandals because it’s about the only thing in his political past he isn’t going to be forced to abandon . "
"In Abortion Debate On House Floor, Democrat Dismisses Republicans As ‘Sex-Starved Males’",thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/abortion-debate-house-floor-democrat-dismisses-republicans-sex-starved-males/,"June 12, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) turned an abortion debate in the House of Representatives bizarrely personal on Wednesday, seeking to undercut her Republican colleagues by calling them “sex-starved males.”
“Mr. Speaker, it is tiring to hear from so many sex-starved males on this floor talk about a woman’s right to choose,” lamented Torres, drawing audible protests from other members.
Republican Rep. Rob Woodall of Georgia immediately pressed her on the inflammatory language. “I would just like to ask my friend if she’d like to change her last statement,” he said.
“Mr. Speaker, if it pleases my colleague on the other side, I will withdraw my statement about sex-starved males on the floor,” Torres replied. Roll Call noted the congresswoman’s remark “clearly broke House Rules” against “personally impugn[ing] their colleagues on the floor.” ""Mr. Speaker, it is tiring to hear from so many sex-starved males on this floor talk about a woman's right to choose.""
— Howard Mortman (@HowardMortman) June 12, 2019
The conflict arose amid debate over a spending package. Republicans, according to Roll Call, “oppose language in the bill authored by House Democrats that would block the Trump administration from enforcing a rule that protects health care providers that refuse to participate in services, such as abortion, that go against their beliefs.”

"In Democratic Socialism Speech, Bernie Sanders Predictably Lies About The Economy",thefederalist.com,Chrissy Clark,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/democratic-socialism-speech-bernie-sanders-predictably-lies-economy/,"June 12, 2019 By Chrissy Clark
Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered a speech at George Washington University today that insisted “democratic socialism” is the only way to defeat oligarchy. Sanders spouted his usual go-to lines about how everyone should have a $15 per hour minimum wage and fight the rich.
With a speech writer like David Sirota, who penned an article about how Venezuelan socialist dictator Hugo Chavez helped create an economic miracle, it should come as no surprise that Bernie offered some pretty whack facts. During his speech, Bernie said three things that weren’t just misleading, but complete lies. 1. ‘We Now Have an Economy That Is Fundamentally Broken’
Not to bore you with charts and facts, but U.S. gross domestic product growth for the last quarter was an estimated 3.1 percent and recovery from the slow economic growth in 2016 remains steady. The unemployment rate as of May 2019 is at 3.6 percent . The United States hasn’t seen low unemployment rates like this since 1953 .
Sanders says GDP rates and unemployment rates have nothing to do with understanding how good the economy is. According to Sanders, the data and statistics used to gauge the well-being of world-wide economics is not an adequate reflection of the American economy. I must ask then, what data and statistics should we use to understand the economy?
We can’t use a make believe feelings-meter to decide how the American economy is doing. The facts are in, and the economy has been wildly, record-breakingly successful under President Trump. 2. ‘The Average Wage Is No Higher than It Was 48 Years Ago’
This statement was a flat out lie. I’m not sure if Sanders gets his data from the same place he gets his ideas, but they’re both crazy.
The national average wage index, which measures changes in U.S. wages over time, was $50,321.89 in 2017, while the national index 48 years ago in 1969 was $5,893.76. This does not account for inflation, so I did the math for you.
The average wage index in 1969, while factoring in inflation , was $43,682.69 in 2017 dollars, for a 48-year span. That means Americans today on average earn approximately $6,639.20 more than they did 48 years ago. Sanders is $6,639.20 from being accurate, which is not a small number. 3.’The New Deal Was Very Popular Politically’
Not only did the New Deal face serious opposition from the Supreme Court, which only began ignoring its obvious unconstitutionality after the president held a political gun to their heads, but after the 1937 economic downturn during Franklin Roosevelt’s reign, even conservative Democrats said they would block further legislation for the New Deal.
FDR’s own party turned against him in blocking legislation for the New Deal. Does that sound like a politically popular idea to you? FDR’s presidential popularity is not indicative of how well-liked or disliked his New Deal policy agenda was.
Sanders spent a large portion of his speech talking about the legacy FDR left for the American economy. “FDR created an economy that worked for all, not just a few,” Sanders said.
He completely neglected to mention that the New Deal and its subsequent ugly stepchildren from the Great Society — primarily Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — are the largest contributors to the United States’s globally unprecedented $20 trillion in current national debt, plus between $50 trillion and $200 trillion in current federal unfunded liabilities. That’s money we’ve already promised people and cannot pay without enormous tax increases, benefit cuts, or both.
Sanders said we must complete the New Deal in the 21st century as the unfinished business of the Democratic Party. That Democratic Party “unfinished business” already might finish off the United States. And Bernie Sanders wants to do it faster. Go figure. Chrissy Clark is a staff writer at The Federalist.

‘Historical Roasts’ Didn’t Quite Get The Formula Right,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/historical-roasts-didnt-quite-get-formula-right/,"June 12, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
Netflix let Jeff Ross play with the concept of “Historical Roasts” for six half-hour installments, and the results were pretty mixed. Supported by a rotating cast of comedians and actors, Ross took on Abraham Lincoln, Freddie Mercury, Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr., Cleopatra, and Muhammad Ali. (Yes, they really roasted Anne Frank. More on that later.)
In typical roast format, each historical figure was lampooned by a handful of relevant friends and enemies. John Stamos, for instance, was on hand to roast Bob Saget’s Abraham Lincoln as John Wilkes Booth. Cleopatra was roasted by Julius Caesar (Ryan Phillippe), Mark Antony (Ken Marino), and Isis (Bridget Everett).
Counterintuitively, the concept is well-suited for the moment at hand—a showcase of comedy’s ability to relieve tension with jest and disrupt staid politics with candor. But the execution was mostly unsuccessful.
I watched the controversial episodes first, knowing that’s typically where Ross shines, and assuming the subject matter would yield better results. It actually turned out to be the other way around.
The Anne Frank roast, which features Gilbert Gottfried as Hitler and Jon Lovitz as FDR, is mostly just a roast of Hitler, and entails some moments of serious reverence for Frank. But the comedy is too mediocre to justify the leap into sensitive territory. Ultimately it lacks purpose, which is fine if you’re roasting a singer, but not so much a beloved Holocaust victim. If you’re going to make a joke at Anne Frank’s expense, maybe be better than calling her “the inventor of the staycation.”
“You reached puberty while you were stuck in the attic with your family, making World War II the second-worst period of your life” is a joke Ross actually tells. In a word, the whole just affair feels cheap, a string of mediocre jabs at the lowest-hanging fruit without successfully conveying any meaningful point. (Gottfried’s Hitler worries at one point that he left his oven on.)
Thanks to an amusing Nelson Mandela impression, the roast of Martin Luther King Jr. is a little bit better. Sasheer Zamata has some good moments as Rosa Parks. But overall the episode suffers from the same problem: too many lame jokes about serious topics, lazily relying more on shock value than good content.
Consider this line Ross could have cribbed from a Boomer Facebook meme: “President Obama really broke down barriers for people of color, because now we have our first orange-American president.”
“We went from we shall overcome to we shall comb over!” he jokes.
The less fraught roasts are actually much better. When Nikki Glaser’s Kurt Cobain takes the stage to roast Freddie Mercury, she opens with, “Sorry, I’m a little nervous. My head is all over the place,” later adding, “I’m mostly used to roasting spoons.” Philippe, Marino, and Everett are hilarious as Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, and Isis in the roast of Cleopatra.
The difference in quality is probably explained by the relative lack of pressure involved with roasting a rock star, not a beloved Holocaust victim. If we roast the ones we love, you can see how it’s maybe possible to take on Martin Luther King Jr. as an opportunity to mock his racist detractors and celebrate his legacy. But that’s incredibly difficult to pull off, and “Historical Roasts” just didn’t figure it out. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky ."
Breaking: Michael Flynn Drops His Lawyers In Favor Of Special Counsel Critic,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/breaking-michael-flynn-drops-lawyers-favor-special-counsel-critic/,"By Margot Cleveland June 12, 2019
Last Thursday, in a surprise development in the Michael Flynn criminal case, his long-time lawyers filed a motion to withdraw as his attorneys of record. News just broke that Flynn has hired former prosecutor turned defense lawyer—and vocal critic of Robert Mueller’s special counsel team—Sidney Powell to represent him.
“I’m honored to represent Lt. General Michael T. Flynn, who has been cooperating with the Special Counsel investigation from the beginning, and will continue to cooperate with the government in the Eastern District of Virginia and otherwise as needed,” Powell told The Federalist in an email. “General Flynn and his family deeply appreciate the support they have received from thousands of people across the country, including cards, notes and contributions.”
Flynn’s firing of his former attorneys, Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony, from the well-respected Washington firm of Covington and Burling, LLP, and his selection of the high-profile Powell comes at a strange time, and following several significant developments, raising speculation about Flynn’s intentions.
While there is nothing inherently unusual about a defendant changing counsel over the course of a criminal case, in Flynn’s case, the substitution came so late in the day, one must wonder why. In 2017, Flynn entered a plea agreement with Mueller, agreeing to plead guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
On December 1, 2017, when Flynn entered his guilty plea, he revealed that he was cooperating with Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion by the Trump team with Russia—something we now know didn’t happen. Then, after several delays in sentencing, Mueller’s team indicated in late December 2018 that the prosecution was ready to proceed with sentencing.
At that time, the special counsel team recommended in its sentencing memorandum that Flynn, whom the government agreed had accepted responsibility for lying to the FBI and had substantially assisted the special counsel, should receive little or no jail time. However, at Flynn’s December 18, 2018, sentencing hearing, presiding Judge Emmet Sullivan chastised Flynn and his legal team for suggesting in court filings that Flynn had not lied.
After quizzing Flynn on whether he was in fact guilty of the charged offense, and whether he wished to consult with a different attorney before proceeding, Sullivan suggested it would be better to await sentencing until Flynn’s cooperation with the special counsel ended. Given the tone of Sullivan’s comments—the long-time federal judge suggested Flynn had “sold your country out”—and Sullivan’s statement that if he proceeded with sentencing then, he could not assure Flynn that he would “not receive a sentence of incarceration,” Flynn accepted the court’s suggestion to delay sentencing.
Notwithstanding Sullivan’s heated comments, which were prompted by his lawyers’ strategy to downplay Flynn’s culpability in Flynn’s sentencing memorandum, Flynn did not fire his Covington and Burling attorneys following the December 2018 hearing. Now that Flynn’s cooperation is complete, all that seemingly remains is for Flynn to receive his sentence. So, why fire Kelner and Anthony now? And why replace the team with firebrand Powell?
Initially, let’s put to the side questions of finance and conflicts. Some have suggested the mundane explanation that attorneys withdraw from a case all the time because of billing disputes or because a client isn’t paying them. But in this case, in their motion to withdraw, Flynn’s attorneys stated that Flynn had notified them “that he is terminating Covington & Burling LLP as his counsel and has already retained new counsel for this matter.” These facts negate the straightforward money explanation.
Similarly, that Flynn fired his attorneys and notified them only after he had already retained Powell counters an alternative theory: that the release of the transcript of the call between former Trump attorney John Dowd and Kelner raised a conflict of interest between Flynn and his legal team. Further, the special counsel team long knew of those conversations, as did Flynn, and the only thing new now is the revelation that Mueller’s report selectively edited the details of the call to cast Dowd (and vicariously Trump) in the worst light possible.
But that does not mean a plea withdrawal is imminent, as many have speculated. Rather, Flynn may merely seek a fresh start when he appears before Sullivan at sentencing and believes Powell can erase the taint caused by the Covington and Burling attorneys’ attempt to minimize Flynn’s culpability. Given Sullivan’s comments at the December 2018 sentencing, Flynn may reasonably fear prison time without a new face to represent him. Relatedly, Flynn may believe Sullivan’s comments demonstrated an impermissible bias, necessitating Sullivan’s recusal, and the former Trump national security advisor may believe that a different attorney is best positioned to push that argument.
Given that Powell stressed in her statement to The Federalist that Flynn has cooperated with the special counsel investigation from the beginning, and will continue to do so, it appears that Flynn has no intention of attempting to withdraw his plea—at least at this time.
Things may change, though, once Powell emmeshes herself in the case. Powell explained her next step “will be filing our status report with Judge Sullivan by the 14th,” and then Flynn’s new attorney “anticipate[s] asking for an additional 90 days for the next status report.” This extension, at a minimum, Powell told The Federalist, is needed to review the file.
How Flynn decides to proceed at that time is anyone’s guess. Flynn’s choice of Powell understandably led many to assume Flynn wanted out of the plea deal. After all, for the last two years, Powell has been front and center in condemning the special counsel investigation and its tactics. She has been especially harsh in her criticism of Mueller’s lead pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. That’s understandably so: Weissmann pulled some questionable moves in prosecuting the Enron defendants, including some of Powell’s former clients.
In fact, more than a year ago, Powell argued that Flynn should withdraw his guilty plea. “Extraordinary manipulation by power people led to the creation of Robert Mueller’s continuing investigation and prosecution of General Michael Flynn,” the former federal prosecutor wrote. But with the “recent postponement of General Flynn’s sentencing” and “the opportunity for more evidence to be revealed,” Powell argued that Flynn would have “massive ammunition for a motion to withdraw [his] guilty plea and dismiss the charges against him.”
Powell’s plea withdrawal suggestion came after Flynn’s criminal case was reassigned to Sullivan and Sullivan entered a standing order directing the government to disclose exculpatory evidence to Flynn. At the time, I also suggested that a plea withdrawal was likely in the works, but Flynn remained steadfast in his decision to plead guilty, even under questioning from Sullivan.
Some have suggested that Flynn pleaded guilty and later refused to withdraw his guilty plea because the special counsel’s team was threatening to prosecute his son for illegal lobbying if Flynn fought the criminal charges. If that was the case, Flynn may now feel safe to come clean because Mueller is no more.
But Powell has now moved from pundit to counselor and the equation may look vastly different from that angle. First, if Flynn attempts to withdraw his plea at this late stage, he faces an uphill battle because Sullivan provided him ample opportunity to do so in December. And any attempt to back out now will likely increase Sullivan’s ire and translate into a heftier prison sentence.
But with Mueller gone and evidence continuing to mount that his investigation was a political hit job, and that the special counsel report misrepresented key facts, Flynn may fare better now if he attempts to change strategies. The optics also now favor Flynn, with news that Mueller used child predator George Nader as a key witness in the Russia collusion investigation, and that a delay in pursuing criminal charges against Nader while he cooperated with Mueller allowed Nader to flee the country. (Nader was since arrested when he attempted to return to the United States.)
Yet, even with witnesses of the likes of Nader, and efforts by the special counsel’s office to squeeze those closest to the Trump team, like Flynn, Mueller failed to find any evidence of Russia collusion. These developments may strengthen Flynn’s resolve to fight the criminal case.
In consultation with Powell, Flynn will now have to decide how to proceed. And while Flynn’s selection of Powell as his new attorney suggests he had serious misgivings about his plea, Powell’s statement stressing his cooperation with Mueller, and his intent to continue to cooperate, negates that narrative. So, for now, not much can be read into Flynn’s decision to change attorneys. Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Writer and best-selling author Ann Coulter joins Ben Domenech on the Federalist Radio Hour to discuss a range of topics including: Trump’s immigration failures, the Democrats’ plan for impeachment, 2020 candidates, and how voter demographics are rapidly changing.
Coulter questions whether Trump can win using the exact same campaign he ran in 2016, and whether the U.S. could really have a president with the name Pete.
“The liberal base is white hot, and they’re doing everything they can to lose it. It would be so easy to beat Trump by pointing out that he has not kept his central campaign promise,” Coulter said.

Ava DuVernay Refuses To Apply The Same Standards To Linda Fairstein She Wants For The Central Park Five,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/ava-duvernay-refuses-apply-standards-linda-fairstein-wants-central-park-five/,"By David Marcus June 12, 2019
History and art form a complicated combination. Most often the artist’s impulse when reaching into the past to actual events is not so much to accurately describe them, but to tell what they mean to us now. According to Linda Fairstein, the prosecutor depicted in Ava DuVernay’s critically acclaimed mini series “When They See Us,” about the Central Park Five, the history in the film is wrong. Now Fairstein is paying a price for her alleged actions back in 1990. Have those actions been accurately depicted?
As a result of the docu-drama, an art form with loose rules and no regulation, Fairstein has lost book deals, left boards of directors, and essentially become a pariah. This week in the Wall Street Journal, she penned a piece to claim not only her innocence, but that DuVernay deliberately misled in her portrayal. Her op-ed lays out some important facts in her defense, and while DuVernay has dismissed her concerns as “expected and typical,” she has not chosen to address any of Fairstein’s specific concerns.
What we know is that five black teenagers were convicted of raping the “Central Park jogger,” and that years later, in 2002, another man confessed to that crime and was proven through forensic evidence to be guilty. But according Fairstein, and the myriad contemporaneous court documents she cites, the story is much more complicated.
Fairstein opens her Journal piece with this paragraph: “At about 9 p.m. April 19, 1989, a large group of young men gathered on the corner of 110th Street and Fifth Avenue for the purpose of robbing and beating innocent people in Central Park. There were more than 30 rioters, and the woman known as the ‘Central Park jogger,’ Trisha Meili, was not their only victim. Eight others were attacked, including two men who were beaten so savagely that they required hospitalization for head injuries.”
Fairstein seems to have no doubt that the Central Park Five were part of the “riot,” even though they were not guilty of Meili’s rape. Although she agrees that the rape conviction was rightfully vacated, she does not believe that anything exonerates the five men from the other crimes committed that night. But ultimately, that is not at the root of her problem with how she is depicted in the film.
Fairstein’s real issue with DuVernay is that she claims the character based on her says and does things in the movie that she never said or did, and acts out of motivations that she never had. This brings us back to art and history. To understand the relationship between the two, we must think about the artist’s motivation.
It is evident that DuVernay’s intention in creating “When They See Us” was not merely to accurately describe and depict the facts behind the Central Park Five case, but to craft a compelling piece of art that tells us something about our own time. This is a practice as old as history and as old as art. But to the extent that it requires artistic license — that is to say, imagining actions or conversations for which there is no historical record — it is a work of fiction, not a work of fact.
Writing in The Boston Globe, Renee Graham claims that “Yes, It’s a small justice. Still, Fairstein is now being held accountable for her wrongdoing.” The piece is a diatribe against the former prosecutor, but one thing stands out: at no point does Graham offer any evidence that Fairstein’s facts about the case and her account of it are wrong. While Fairstein’s account is not being stipulated to by her accusers, it also isn’t being disputed. And that is telling.
Because this is a work of art, Fairstein isn’t just Fairstein, she is a stand in for an archetype, actually several. She is the overzealous, racist prosecutor who wants to win at all costs, she is the criminal justice system that targets black men, and she is a white woman, an archetype of late derided not only as the historical root of false allegations against black men, but also as the dark force behind the election of Donald Trump.
It is quite possible that Fairstein made mistakes in prosecuting the Central Park Five. Perhaps she was too zealous, too credulous of the police. People do get wrongly convicted both as a result of prosecutorial misconduct and good faith efforts that come to the wrong result. Only Fairstein can really know which was the case with the Central Park Five.
But if she is to be dragged and cancelled, if she is now the one to be punished, we must apply the standard that should have been applied to the Central Park Five. We must base her punishment on facts, not feelings. She must be found guilty based on her own actions, not as an avatar of the criminal justice system or some nebulous concept of white women.
If Fairstein’s account is wrong and DuVernay can prove her version of events, the latter should do so. If not, if liberties were taken to tell a better story and craft a message about our world today, that should also be acknowledged.
History and art are strange bedfellows, but Linda Fairstein deserves to have her claim that she has been smeared taken seriously. So far, that has yet to happen.

"Meet Justin Amash, NeverTrump’s Newest Shiny Object",thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/12/meet-justin-amash-nevertrumps-newest-shiny-object/,"By David Harsanyi June 12, 2019
“As a conservative who has grave concerns about Donald Trump, I’ve arrived at an unavoidable conclusion,” writes Daily Beast’s Matt Lewis: “it’s time to draft Justin Amash for president.” It’s actually an easily avoidable conclusion. If anything, this infatuation with Amash is evidence of an increasingly frivolous NeverTrump resistance.
Now, perhaps enough voters are willing to support an exotic candidate to help sink Trump and elect the Democrat. Which is, of course, the point of all this. Even if there were a genuine appetite among conservatives to challenge the president, there are any number of candidates ideologically better suited to represent the Max Boot faction of the party. Joe Biden, for example.
But “Amash,” writes Lewis, “distinguished himself in the last several months—first by voting against the president’s bogus ’emergency order’ regarding the border wall—and then by coming out in favor of impeachment.”
For one thing, Amash had already distinguished himself by criticizing his own party while opposing Barack Obama’s numerous precedent-setting attack s on the Constitution—many of them more damaging than Trump’s ill-advised use of a funding mechanism handed to him by Congress. It’s true, there was no NeverObama movement calling out Democrats who rubber-stamped those abuses.
As someone who sympathizes with many of Amash’s positions, I’m comfortable with the notion of a libertarian presidency. By most standards, however, Amash’s worldview would be considered radical. Not merely by the average voter, but by most of the pundits now willing to abandon their own positions to oppose Trump.
I’d detail Amash’s stance on gun control , for example, but I can’t find any evidence of it. The congressman has argued against any controls on Americans who “purchase, transport, store, or possess arms” on public or private property. While this might be constitutionally sound, it doesn’t sound like it comports with Salon Republican values.
It’d be interesting if some curious journalist, maybe one of his new fans, asked Amash where the Constitution empowers the federal government to (effectively) ban fully automatic weapons—or grenade launchers, for that matter? Because, color me skeptical, I’m unconvinced that the average CNN Republican is going to be a good-faith supporter of a politician who believes anyone should be able to walk into a 7/11 and buy a dozen AR-15s.
As far as we can tell, Amash doesn’t support any energy regulations, either. If oil companies want to drill, Amash has never had a problem with it. He’s also voted to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases, which, although a reasonable libertarian position, might not be a huge hit with the John Kasich wing of the party.
Will newly woke constitutionalists praise Amash’s consistency the next time the congressman votes “nay” on reauthorizing the “Violence Against Women Act”? The problem, according to Amash, is simple: the bill “expands federal criminal law, and the crimes that it expands are not authorized by the Constitution.” Enumerated rights, and all that. I’m sure single women voters will be sympathetic.
What will Amash supporters say the next time he is the only member of the House to vote against creating a three-digit national suicide prevention hotline? A fine idea, he explained, but one that lacked any “constitutional basis.” Now that , unlike supporting impeachment, is a courageous political position.
Will GOPers like Lewis be open to discussing the future of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? I mean, Amash says it “was helpful in remedying government-mandated discrimination in some states” but nowadays “these types of laws may unintentionally increase discrimination.” Libertarians since Barry Goldwater have wrestled with the constitutionality of certain aspects of the law, and all have been smeared as racists. I’m not sure agreeing with Democrats on impeachment will finally convince them to have a salubrious discussion about the proper limits of federal power.
In a rare moment of pandering, Amash once “strongly” supported the federal Defense of Marriage Act before taking a more traditionally libertarian position, maintaining that government should get out of the marriage business altogether . That means he doesn’t believe gay marriage should be state sanctioned.
Amash is also “ 100 percent pro-life ,” supports federal limits on abortion, and believes life begins at conception, not at 24 weeks of pregnancy, or 40 weeks, or whenever the mother decides.
Perhaps there will be some common ground on tariffs (Trump has turned plenty of people into zealous free traders; welcome!) and a few other policies that happen to intersect. Yet Amash supports deep cuts in spending, tax cuts, balanced budget amendments , real debt limits, free market-based health-care insurance (and everything else), and, one assumes, the privatization all kinds of highly valued government programs. I’ve been hearing for years from pundits that these positions induce voters, especially young ones, to abandon GOP.
Admittedly, it’s confusing to see a libertarian who’s railed against the surveillance state now more concerned about the president acting within his constitutional purview—firing an FBI director, for instance—than he is with an administration spying on its political opponents. The difference between Amash and his new boosters, though, is that his conclusions are almost certainly not propelled by a Trump obsession.
“Even with his solid judicial nominees and tax cuts, how in good conscience can a principled conservative support four more years for this president?” Lewis begs the question in his Amash endorsement.
I imagine for many voters the equation is more complicated. Perhaps Trump has exceeded their policy expectations. Perhaps, in addition to “solid judicial nominees and tax cuts,” they understand that he’s defended religious liberty, adopted pro-life policies, cut regulations, exited the Iran deal, taken immigration enforcement seriously, and pushed back on broader cultural battles they care about. And whether they approve of his methods or not, whether he’s done an effective job or not, they probably view him as a bulwark against increasingly extremist Democrats.
Many Republican voters are undoubtedly more interested in fighting those battles than in trying to appropriate the idealism of a long-shot candidate. To most, a vote is merely a political consideration, and not, as many pundits seem to believe, a sacred act of moral affirmation."
