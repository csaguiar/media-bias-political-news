A former Republican lawmaker who served for 17 years in the House of Representatives called Trump an “illegitimate president” and said he should be impeached. “I’m calling for impeachment now because the Mueller report is out, and in it [special counsel Robert Mueller] describes 10 obstructions of justice charges that he could not bring because of a Department of Justice rule and regulation that says you can’t indict a sitting president. That’s number one,” former Rep. Tom Coleman, who represented Missouri from 1976 to 1993 in the House, told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

Coleman also said that Trump is an “illegitimate president” because he welcomed help and influence from the Russians in his campaign.” Coleman cited as an example the way his then campaign chairman Paul Manafort shared information with a “Russian intelligence asset” during a meeting in New York. “It’s wrong and it needs to be handled and looked at by the Congress because I believe it’s an impeachable offense,” he said.

""I think there is some confusion that it has to be a crime to be impeachable. Abuse of power, lying to the American people were two grounds for Nixon's articles of impeachment before he resigned."" - Tom Coleman, a former Republican lawmaker calling for Pres. Trump's impeachment pic.twitter.com/FGAwDxdkft — CNN (@CNN) May 25, 2019

Coleman had earlier argued the case for impeachment in an op-ed piece in the Kansas City Star. In the piece, Coleman argues that even though Mueller “did not find sufficient evidence that Trump or his campaign had violated a criminal statute” the way Trump welcomed help from a foreign power means that “the president’s election victory brought forth nothing less than an illegitimate presidency.” In the piece, Coleman notes that some Democrats are reluctant to discuss impeachment and that instinct is “understandable … but critical times require exceptional leadership.” For now, “the only viable option available is for the House of Representatives, under Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, to open its own investigation, hold public hearings and then determine if they should pursue removal of the president through impeachment.”

If impeachment isn’t pursued, “I believe the public would conclude Democrats are no better than the Republicans who have enabled Trump for the past two years, putting party above country,” Coleman wrote. “It could hand Trump a second term.”"
Jason Chaffetz accuses Dems of 'projection' in criticizing Trump's declassification plan,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jason-chaffetz-democrats-projection-declassification,"Democrats were puffing hot air and criticized the Trump administration because they feared his declassification plan would uncover their dirty deeds, according to Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz.

When ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Jedediah Bila asked Chaffetz about Democrats' concerns that President Trump's plans would hurt national security Saturday, the former chairman of the House Oversight Committee responded that it was ""hogwash.""

Trump's plan, Chaffetz argued, would improve Attorney General William Barr's ability to communicate with intelligence agencies.

""First of all, the attorney general has every security clearance that he could possibly have, the Federal Bureau of Investigations has a counterintelligence component.""

He speculated that Democrats were projecting their own fears about the declassification uncovering troubling activities on their part.

""I think it's projection by the Democrats that they're scared to death that the highest echelons within some of these agencies -- specifically [former CIA Director John] Brennan and [former Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper and perhaps [former national security advisor Susan] Rice and some of these other people along the way were doing some things that they shouldn't have been doing,"" Chaffetz said.

Spy agency veterans are horrified at Trump's decision to grant AG Barr sweeping power to declassify Russia intelligence: 'Lives are on the line',https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-barr-russia-declassification-intelligence-veterans-react-2019-5,"President Donald Trump's decision to grant vast authority to Attorney General William Barr to declassify intelligence as he investigates the origins of the Russia investigation stunned national-security veterans and has the Justice Department hurtling toward a clash with the US intelligence community.

Trump announced on Twitter that at Barr's request, he ""directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate"" with an internal investigation into "" surveillance activities"" that took place during the 2016 US election.

The move marks another flashpoint in Trump's ongoing attack on the FBI and US intelligence community.

The president, Barr, and their loyalists argue the inquiry constitutes a legitimate look at whether the US government abused its authority for political motives. But detractors say the move is another partisan attempt by the president to thwart his own intelligence community and weaponize the Justice Department against his perceived enemies.

Robert Deitz, a former top lawyer at the CIA and the National Security Agency, characterized Trump's order as a ""direct insult to the leadership of the intel community.""

Typically, in such an investigation, Barr would prepare a report on the matter and ask senior leaders at the NSA, CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and other agencies to declassify specific documents without harming the intelligence-gathering process.

Barr's course of action ""puts the cart before the horse in a dangerous way,"" Deitz said.

More importantly, current and former officials say, Trump's order represents a direct threat to the lives and safety of US intelligence sources abroad.

The New York Times reported this week that Barr wanted to know more about the CIA's foreign assets in Russia in 2016, and what those informants were telling the agency about how Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to interfere in the 2016 election.

""There's a reason why the CIA is so vigilant about guarding its sources,"" one former covert operative, who requested anonymity to freely discuss how the agency handles sensitive information, told INSIDER. ""It's because lives are on the line. The AG is either ignorant of that fact, or he doesn't care. Either way, it's horrifying.""

The politicization of sources and methods could also have far-reaching effects on agencies' ability to gather intelligence in the first place.

""Why would a source want to cooperate with us if we cannot protect his or her identity?"" former FBI agent Frank Montoya Jr., who retired in 2016, told INSIDER. ""Or, just as importantly, the information they share with us? It will endanger the lives of sources if their identities or that information becomes public.""

Read more: The DOJ agreed to turn over Mueller counterintelligence documents to Congress that could answer many lingering Trump-Russia questions

Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent, largely agreed.

""Make no mistake: If Barr discloses the identities of CIA and [counterintelligence] sources providing information on Russia he is disabling our intelligence capacities to Russia's advantage,"" Rangappa wrote. ""It puts sources providing intelligence in danger and cripples the [intelligence community's] ability to recruit new sources.""

'The inquiry has been pre-cooked'

Trump's directive will also negatively impact interagency relationships, which Montoya said they have ""already been strained in terms of how much 'shared' information has been exposed in public venues, whether it's in news accounts or at congressional hearings, or in the Oval Office.""

To be sure, then FBI director James Comey took the extraordinary step of revealing the existence of the Russia investigation in March 2017 because of intense public interest on the subject.

Since then, the Justice Department has turned over to Congress thousands of pages of intelligence related to the investigation, and it is in the process of turning over more counterintelligence and foreign intelligence documents related to the Mueller probe to the House Intelligence Committee.

Meanwhile, Trump himself invited significant public backlash when it was reported that he revealed classified information provided to the US by Israeli intelligence to Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.

It's worth noting that this isn't the first time intelligence officials have raised concerns about their work being manipulated. Indeed, Deitz told INSIDER in an earlier interview, the US intelligence community has long been a ""whipping toy"" for lawmakers.

But there's one significant difference between then and now. Trump's order confers a tremendous amount of authority on a singular figure — the attorney general — to declassify sensitive intelligence for purely political ends.

""The President has an outcome in mind that he would like to see,"" Deitz said. ""And since Barr was so accommodating over the Mueller report, asking him to conduct an investigation, and then giving him declassification authority, suggests that the inquiry has been pre-cooked.""

Sharing sensitive information with Barr 'is tantamount to sharing it with Trump, which is tantamount to sharing it with our adversaries'

California Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, characterized Trump's directive as a ""corrupt escalation of the President's intention, with the assistance of the Attorney General, to weaponize and politicize the nation's intelligence and law enforcement entities.""

Schiff added that his committee will ""conduct vigorous oversight of any steps to selectively reveal and distort classified information, abuse the declassification process, and place at risk sources and methods"" in a way that could jeopardize US national security.

Rangappa wrote that Trump's move amounts to ""collusion in plain sight"" because it would ""enable Russia's efforts by thwarting our own.""

The ripple effects, moreover, go beyond just Russia — Trump's and Barr's actions will likely prompt US sources and foreign allies to withhold information out of fear of it being released or politicized. That could significantly hamper the country's ability to work with partners on critical issues like counterterrorism and cybersecurity.

The bottom line, Montoya said, is that ""sharing source data from CIA and NSA with Barr is tantamount to sharing it with Trump, which is tantamount to sharing it with our adversaries.""

""One can only hope Barr handles whatever data he gets ... with some sense of responsibility to sources and methods,"" and that he ""doesn't turn it into political fodder,"" Montoya added. ""But given his track record so far as a shill for Trump (as opposed to a defender of the presidency), it is, admittedly, a feeble hope."""
President Trump Arrives In Japan For Inaugural State Visit Under New Emperor,https://www.npr.org,['Shannon Van Sant'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/726984850/president-trump-arrives-in-japan-for-inaugural-state-visit,"President Trump Arrives In Japan For Inaugural State Visit Under New Emperor

Enlarge this image toggle caption Koji Sasahara/AP Koji Sasahara/AP

President Trump is in Japan for the first official state visit since Japanese Emperor Naruhito assumed the throne.

The president and first lady Melania Trump have already dined with Japanese business leaders and will attend a sumo wrestling match, at which Trump will present the winner with a trophy called the ""President's Cup.""

Emperor Naruhito and his Harvard-educated wife, Empress Masako, will host an imperial state banquet for Trump. The president's trip will also include a visit to a naval base and bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Top of their agenda will be trade and North Korea. Michael Green, the Japan chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told NPR, ""The Japanese economy is No. 3 in the world, behind the U.S. and China, so it's a really important relationship that both leaders need to move forward. Prime Minister Abe really needs Donald Trump to move past his 1980s vision of Japan, and see the great potential in the relationship.""

Green was also a senior adviser to President George W. Bush and the National Security Council.

In 1987, Trump took out a full-page newspaper ad declaring: ""Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States.""

As president, Trump has maintained the view of Japan as an economic rival, rather than an ally, and has kept tariffs on Japanese metals in place, while lifting tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico. Trump has also threatened Japan with duties on autos. Last week, Trump said he had decided to delay those new auto tariffs for six months. Trump is seeking a bilateral trade deal with Japan, after pulling the U.S. out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Concerns over North Korea, and its resumption of short-range missile tests earlier this month, will also be a focus of Trump's meeting with Abe. Japan has urged the Trump administration to maintain pressure on North Korea and has said this month's missile tests are a violation of U.N. resolutions.

NPR's Ayesha Rascoe reports, ""Japan wants to show it's the U.S.'s best friend in the region, and this is important because Japan is dealing with China on the one hand, trying to assert its dominance, and North Korea on the other, being confrontational. Prime Minister Abe has invested a lot into developing a personal relationship with Trump, and in many ways, this trip will be an extension of that."""

The “Deadline: White House” host said on her show that the clash between Trump and Pelosi this week has “deteriorated to a level beneath words — comprehensible words at least.”

“That’s why we’re going to do something different here to make sure you understand just how low the president has stooped in his efforts to smear the Speaker of the House,” Wallace said.

""We believe that transparency is the best disinfectant for dirty politics, so we’re going to break down what the president of the United States did to the Speaker of the House when he shared a doctored video of her with his millions of Twitter followers,"" she added.

Wallace, who served as White House communications director in the George W. Bush administration and as a GOP campaign aide, noted that Trump had shared an edited video clip Thursday that made it seem like Pelosi was stuttering.

The video, while itself not doctored, was shared the same day The Washington Post reported that videos doctored to make Pelosi appear to be slurring her words as if she were drunk had gone viral on social media.

Trump shared a video from Fox Business Network that had been edited to combine clips of Pelosi tripping over her words in a press conference. Trump tweeted the clip with the caption ""PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE.""

Wallace noted that the slowed-down video ""has the effect of making anyone look like they’re having a hard time speaking.""

The MSNBC host proceeded to air a clip of her speaking that had been slowed down so her audience could see what she looked and sounded like doctored.

She also pointed out that Trump has been a victim of doctored videos himself, playing a clip that showed a campaign speech that had been altered.

Wallace said her MSNBC show had decided not to show the clip of Pelosi that Trump shared with his 60.5 million Twitter followers.

The president on Friday denied knowledge of the altered videos and praised his ability to work with the Democratic leader before accusing her of ""not helping the country.""

""I don’t know about the videos. I can tell you that — what I’m here is to help the country,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving on a trip to Japan."
"Buttigieg slams Trump over Iran escalation, vows ‘I’m going to win’ in 2020",https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-slams-trump-over-iran-escalation-vows-win-2020,"Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is blasting President Donald Trump for “chest-thumping militarism” and warned that rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran “could very quickly get away from this president.”

At a campaign event Friday night in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire, the one-time long shot for the nomination -- who has surged the past two months to become a credible contender -- also vowed that “I’m going to win” as he took an indirect jab at former Vice President Joe Biden, the clear front-runner in the Democratic 2020 race.

TRUMP SENDS 1,500 TROOPS TO MIDDLE EAST AMID RISING TENSIONS WITH IRAN

The South Bend, Indiana mayor and Afghanistan War veteran criticized the Republican president just hours after the Pentagon said that 1,500 additional U.S. forces and firepower are headed to the Middle East as the specter of potential conflict with Tehran increases.

The Trump administration has been ringing alarms the past month over what it calls “troubling” and “escalatory” moves by Iran. The U.S. has been raising the volume on Iran ever since the president took the country out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran a year ago.

Trump has spent weeks alternating between tough talk towards Tehran while still insisting he’s open to negotiating with the Islamic Republican. On Friday, the president told reporters before departing on a trip to Japan that “we’re going to be sending a relatively small number of troops, mostly protective.”

Buttigieg, speaking at a campaign event in Exeter, New Hampshire, claimed that Trump “now seems to be setting us on a course that could lead to violent confrontation.”

He later told reporters that “I’m very worried because we have steps towards confrontation in Iran that almost make it seem as though we learned nothing from the experience in Iraq.”

And he warned that “what we’re seeing right now is a set of escalations that could very quickly get away from this president to where he’s not even in control.”

JUDGE TEMPORARILY BLOCKS TRUMP'S BORDER WALL CONSTRUCTION PLANS

For the third time in two days, Buttigieg took aim at Trump accusing him of faking a disability decades ago in order to avoid military service in the Vietnam War.

Speaking to a crowd jam-packed into Exeter’s historic town hall that his campaign estimated at 680 people, the candidate charged Trump “used his privilege to avoid serving when it was his turn.”

He made similar comments at a campaign event with veterans in Londonderry, New Hampshire earlier in the evening.

Trump received five deferments from the draft for military service during the Vietnam War. Four were education deferments while he was a college student and the fifth – in 1968 after he graduated – was a medical exemption.

Two daughters of a New York podiatrist told The New York Times recently that 50 years ago, their father diagnosed Trump with bone spurs in his heels, as a favor to the doctor’s landlord, millionaire real estate developer Fred Trump.

SANDERS RIPS BIDEN FOR SWANKY FUNDRAISERS, ACCUSES HIM OF COURTING ELITE

On the campaign trail in 2015, as he was running for president, Trump said: ""It was a long time ago ... I had student deferments and then ultimately had a medical deferment because of my feet. I had a bone spur.""

Trump told reporters at the time that he couldn’t remember which foot had the problem. His campaign later said the bone spurs affected both feet.

Minutes after once again charging that Trump used his “privilege” to avoid military service, Buttigieg emphasized to the audience that “we can’t spend all our time thinking up a zinger that’s going to knock the president flat. Because any energy that goes his way, any attention that goes his way, even in the form of criticism, it’s kind of like food, he just takes it in and gets bigger off of it.”

Asked later by Fox News how he could square those comments with his repeated attacks on Trump the past two days over his Vietnam War deferments, the candidate answered “we absolutely need to say exactly what we think about the president’s wrongdoing, malfeasance and lies. It’s just that that can’t be our message. As soon as we say that, we’ve got to return to the question of how we’re going to make American lives better.”

Buttigieg also appeared to take a shot at the former vice president during the town hall. In an obvious reference to Biden – who many voters feel may be the most electable candidate of the two-dozen Democrats currently running for president, Buttigieg argued that “sometimes we pick somebody who is less inspiring that we think will also be less risky and we wind up getting somebody that's neither.”

""The point is you can move people. It's not just about ideology. It's not just about where your dot is on the political spectrum. It is about offering something new, offering something different,"" the 37-year old candidate emphasized.

Asked by a member of the crowd why they should support him, Buttigieg declared “two reasons, I’m going to make a really good president and I’m going to win.”"

President Donald Trump’s declassification order Thursday night has set up a showdown between his own Justice Department and the intelligence community that could trigger resignations and threaten the CIA’s ability to conduct its core business — managing secret intelligence and sources.

Trump’s order directed intelligence agencies to fully comply with Attorney General William Barr’s look at “surveillance activities” during the 2016 election — a probe that Trump’s allies see as a necessary check on government overreach but that critics lambaste as an attempt to create the impression of scandal. Numerous former intelligence officials called the move “unprecedented,” saying it grants the attorney general sweeping powers over the nation’s secrets, subverts the intelligence community and raises troubling legal questions.

“There’s nothing CIA or NSA, for example, guards more jealously than sources and methods,” said Larry Pfeiffer, a 32-year intelligence veteran who served as the chief of staff to CIA Director Michael Hayden. “It is not hyperbole to say that lives are at stake.”

“I doubt any of the [CIA directors] or [directors of national intelligence] that I worked with would have sat by silently if their president contemplated or made such a decision,” added Pfeiffer, who also served as senior director of the White House Situation Room.

It’s the latest chapter in Trump’s rocky relationship with his own intelligence community. During the election, Trump cast doubt on Russia’s role in hacking Hillary Clinton’s campaign. As president, Trump has publicly disagreed with his own intelligence agencies on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, the threat posed by the Islamic State, the situation in Afghanistan and whether the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The two sides have usually papered over their differences, but national security veterans said this time might be different.

“I could see something of a showdown happening here, where the CIA says, ‘We’re not comfortable with the declassification of this material and we won’t provide it without the assurance that you won’t declassify it,’” said a former senior Justice Department official who served under both Trump and President Barack Obama, and requested anonymity to discuss the directive more freely. “They feel that these are their sources, their connections.”

If that happened, Trump’s order leaves it unclear who would prevail.

Trump on Friday defended his decision as a pro-transparency move that will give the public insight into nefarious government activity. And he praised Barr as the ideal person to judge what should be released.

Barr is “a great gentleman and a highly respected man, so everything that they need is declassified and they’ll able to see how the hoax or witch hunt started and why it started,” Trump told reporters before leaving for a trip to Japan. “It was an attempted coup, an attempted takedown of the president of the United States.”

Later on Friday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats issued a carefully worded statement, confirming that his agencies will turn over “all of the appropriate information” for the DOJ review. But, Coats added, “I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the [intelligence community] in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk.”

Numerous national security veterans did not share Coats‘ confidence. They said Trump’s order has challenged those “long-established standards” and raised questions about how the government’s legal power structure might shift in the months and years ahead.

Under the National Security Act, a post-World War II overhaul of the country’s military and intelligence structure, intelligence agencies are legally required to protect the unauthorized declassification of their secretive sources and information-gathering tactics. But Trump’s directive seemingly gave the attorney general the power to determine what should be declassified, potentially upending decades of precedent.

“The president's memo effectively revises the executive order on classification and gives the AG the authority — previously assigned to the head of the agency that originated the information — to declassify information related to the election inquiry,” said Steven Aftergood, a classification expert who directs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy.

While the order includes a caveat that the directive should not impair “the authority granted by law” to agency heads on classification, it also notes that Barr has to consult these agency heads only “to the extent he deems it practicable” about declassification decisions.

And if intelligence chiefs and Barr disagree on what to reveal, Trump retains final say.

“Does an agency head or the DNI have any recourse? Sure — a direct appeal to the president … or threatening to resign over a bad decision,” Pfeiffer said. “Neither is good governance.”

April Doss, who served as the head of intelligence law at the NSA from 2003 to 2016, said she hoped Barr would consult with the intelligence community heads and heed their advice. “But under this memo he is not required to,” she noted.

And that has created a once-unthinkable situation for intelligence professionals — they could lose control of what remains a secret.

“I can’t remember a time when a non-IC officer was given declassification authority over intelligence information,” said Michael Morell, the former acting director of the CIA under Obama and the host of the Intelligence Matters podcast.

The result, Morell added, is a loss of faith in the U.S. intelligence system. “It is yet another step that will raise questions among our allies and partners about whether to share sensitive intelligence with us,” he said.

Particularly curious to many intelligence veterans and experts is the fact that Barr asked for this new authority from the president, as well as the breadth of the directive. The memo targets not only the FBI — which Trump has repeatedly accused of hatching a “deep state” plot to overthrow him — but also the CIA, which is fiercely protective of its sources and methods. In particular, Barr is seeking more information about the foreign sources the FBI used in 2016, according to a New York Times report.

The result is a shifting perception of the attorney general’s role.

Since Watergate era, the DOJ chief has been seen as the legal check on intelligence agency overreach, said David Kris, a former Obama-era head of DOJ’s national security division who also held a high-ranking DOJ position during the George W. Bush administration, and the founder of Culper Partners consulting firm.

“Now,” he added, “many observers have the opposite fear; that the AG, rather than the IC, is the real danger, the real threat to apolitical intelligence under law. Whether or not that fear is entirely valid, it is deeply concerning because it threatens the foundations of intelligence oversight that has protected us for more than 40 years.”

Steve Hall, a former CIA chief of Russian operations, said Trump’s actions are likely to have a chilling effect on the government’s ability to recruit both agents and informants.

The revelation that longtime Cambridge University professor Stefan Halper, for example, was used as an FBI informant in 2016, and the microscopic focus placed on former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele — another longtime FBI source — has made the intelligence community, and its sources, extremely wary.

“Put yourself in the position of considering working for CIA at this moment,” Hall said. “You’d probably want to wait until this all blows over.”"

WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show that Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog.

The decision by Mr. Pruitt was notable because it came as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was campaigning for a third term and trying to bring a Foxconn factory, and thousands of new manufacturing jobs, to a part of the state where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.

Mr. Walker ultimately lost his re-election bid to Tony Evers, a Democrat. And Foxconn , the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, announced in January that it was reconsidering its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, though the company later said it would build a smaller factory in the state.

But, in spring 2018, as the governor’s race was heating up, Mr. Walker championed the Foxconn deal and the 13,000 jobs it promised to create. The factory, however, also threatened to create a new source of pollution in the region."
USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"
Mark Meadows views fresh 'Strzok coverup' material at DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-views-fresh-strzok-coverup-material-at-doj,"Rep. Mark Meadows said he was at the Justice Department to review new information about former FBI agent Peter Strzok.

The North Carolina Republican was spotted at Justice Department headquarters in D.C. with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday.

Asked by a reporter why he was there, Meadows said, ""I was reviewing text messages and new correspondence that pertains to the Strzok coverup.""

Hours after their visit, President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Meadows and Jordan's visit to the Justice Department also comes after House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes said he learned that an August 2016 text from Strzok about an ""insurance policy"" had to do with the FBI's use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Both Strzok and Lisa Page, who are no longer with the FBI, have been a focus of GOP investigators concerned about potential bias within the Justice Department and FBI."

USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth,https://www.politico.com,['Catherine Boudreau'],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/agriculture-dept-ends-job-corps-conservation-centers-1472208,"The program — known as the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. Employment USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has decided to end a U.S. Forest Service work program that trains at-risk youth to be first responders to natural disasters, maintain national forests and work on rural infrastructure projects.

The program — known for operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. As part of the move, the department intends to close nine of 25 centers, according to a statement released Friday. The action could lead to a significant cut of the number of Forest Service employees.

“There are reasons why the secretary made this decision,” Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen told staff members during a conference call announcing the move on Friday morning, less than an hour before the Department of Labor’s news release. She said she learned of the decision only four days ago.

“Perdue has a goal of efficient and effective government,” Christiansen said, adding that the secretary believes the mission of the program better aligns with the Labor Department. The Forest Service’s Civilian Conservation Centers is the only Labor Department Jobs Corps initiative operated by federal employees.

“This was a high-level policy discussion and decision. It in no way reflects on your excellent work and dedication,” Christiansen said.

Perdue, in a letter to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, wrote the move would help the Forest Service prioritize its “core natural resource mission to improve the condition and resilience of our nation’s forests, and step away from activities and programs that are not essential to that core mission.”

Forest Service officials did not disclose how many employees will be affected by the change, which is expected to be completed by September. However, a spokesperson for the National Federation of Federal Employees, the union representing Forest Service workers, told POLITICO that as many as 1,065 workers could be let go.

Another Forest Service official on the conference call said the agency will request authority for a reduction in force, which must go through the Office of Personnel Management because of the size of the staff cuts. The Civilian Conservation Centers closing are in states such as Montana, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Forest Service official said that agency will try to help employees find other jobs within the department and push “voluntary separation incentives,” or buyouts.

The Labor Department said 16 of the 25 centers will be replaced by new contract operators or a partnership overseen by DOL. The announcement added that the “new operators will implement new policies and approaches that will offer students the skills they need to earn an independent living and succeed in meaningful in-demand jobs.”

The Civilian Conservation Corps dates to the Great Depression but was disbanded during World War II. The current iteration was designed during the Johnson administration as part of its Jobs Corps effort. Today, thousands of young people aged 16 to 24 from low-income communities participate in the program.

“During hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, these students are some of the first people to respond,” said Brittany Holder, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Federal Employees. The organization, in a recent review of the Civilian Conservation Corps, found that in 2017, more than 300 students were sent to wildfire assignments, providing about 200,000 hours of support, among a range of other services.

The union argues the program has been a success and that the administration is misrepresenting data to make its case to privatize the centers. The Trump administration — in annual budget requests — and Republican lawmakers have criticized the program as being wasteful of taxpayer money and having little accountability.

“They have no plan for the students, no idea how to stop the loss of 613,000 hours of student service, and are not concerned about the impact on rural jobs and local economies,” Beverly Tobin-Ford, the union’s Forest Service Council vice president, said in April. “It’s as if this administration just decided to do this without reservation or any forethought.”

EPA wants to triple level of rocket fuel chemical allowed in drinking water,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-rocket-fuel-chemical-drinking-water-e6ee56c9ee13/,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to raise the threshold for a chemical found in rocket fuel to triple the previous limit allowed in drinking water supplies. This is the first new drinking water rule introduced by the agency since the George W. Bush administration.

In the EPA’s latest move to weaken environmental and health protections, it released a notice on Thursday requesting public comment on its proposal to raise the maximum level allowed for the chemical perchlorate — which is linked to thyroid problems — to 56 micrograms per liter.

This is three times higher than what the EPA previously recommended as a safe level for drinking water (15 micrograms per liter). The previous recommendation was just an advisory to help guide states, as opposed to an enforceable limit, which is what the agency is now proposing.

In addition to this change, the EPA is seeking comment on three other alternate options: setting the level to 18 micrograms per liter, to 90 micrograms per liter, or simply abolishing the rule regulating perchlorate in drinking water.

The news comes after a decade-long delay following a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) demanding the EPA set an enforceable standard for the chemical.

“This is enough to make you sick—literally,” Erik Olson, senior director for health and food at NRDC, said in a statement on the new proposed limits. “As a result, millions of Americans will be at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of this toxic chemical in their drinking water.”

In addition to rocket fuel, perchlorate is found in fireworks, airbags, matches, signal flares, some food packaging, and munitions. Health risks from exposure include disruption to the thyroid’s ability to produce hormones needed for normal growth and development, along with potentially causing reproductive problems.

According to NRDC, scientists recommend a limit that is “10 to more than 50 times lower” than what the EPA is currently proposing. Two states currently have much stricter, enforceable standards than required by the EPA: California (at 6 micrograms per liter) and Massachusetts (at 2 micrograms per liter).

The EPA’s proposal comes as the agency has been dragging its feet on implementing a similar legally enforceable standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a group of man-made chemicals that are toxic to humans and can increase the risk of cancer — in drinking water. Currently there is no maximum level for PFAS chemicals under EPA rules. Numerous communities in 43 states are currently suffering from the toxic chemical polluting their water.

These delays or weakening of chemical standards come despite EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler recent arguments that water issues are the world’s leading environmental crisis.

“This is another Trump administration gift to polluters and water utilities that have lobbied to be off the hook for cleaning up the problem,” Olson said of the proposed change to perchlorate.

The Trump EPA features several top officials who once worked for the chemical industry. This includes a former Koch Industries staffer, David Dunlap, who worked on water and chemical policy and now serves as deputy EPA assistant administrator for research and development, and a former chemical industry attorney, Steven Cook, who oversees Superfund sites. Meanwhile, Nancy Beck, the Trump administration appointee who oversees the EPA’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups.

What’s more, a 2009 House Committee report found that Beck, a former Bush administration official, was slowing progress in confirming the health threats from chemicals like perchlorate found in drinking water. The committee concluded she had been “inappropriately intervening in agency science.”

Ties to the chemical industry also extend to Wheeler. In a letter sent to the EPA administrator last month, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D- MD), accused Wheeler of failing to disclose his previous lobbying on behalf of Darling Ingredients, which is involved in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA."
"A better VA, with mental health services, is essential for America's veterans",https://thehill.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/445286-a-better-va-with-mental-health-services-is-essential-for-americas,"In our nation’s history, more than 1 million American servicemembers have been killed in U.S. wars. For the past 151 years on the fourth Monday of May, we have honored the great soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen who have fallen.

Much has changed, but the generations of brave men and women willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom have endured, and the sanctity with which we regard these individuals has remained.

There are many millions of veterans, however, who returned home from war to find a country unable to provide them access to basic human rights such as quality civilian employment opportunities, health care and education. In recent years alone, 20.4 million men and women risked their lives for their country and, in return, many were refused fundamental care by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). President Trump Donald John TrumpA better VA, with mental health services, is essential for America's veterans Pelosi, Nadler tangle on impeachment, contempt vote Trump arrives in Japan to kick off 4-day state visit MORE has renewed the fight for these veterans.

The VA fell into disarray under the Obama administration. President Obama tried to establish reform with initiatives such as the Veterans Choice Program to expand health care options and reduce wait time for medical appointments to a maximum of 30 days. This policy was great in theory, but in practice the Government Accountability Office found that some veterans waited up to 70 days for care and many died as a result.

Why was this happening? Some VA personnel neglected their duties by falsifying wait times for medical care and ignoring major systemic issues in the medical network with no accountability.

When President Trump took office in 2017, he pledged that the men and women who uphold our country’s freedoms no longer would be ignored by their government. In June 2017, he signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This legislation resulted in the removal, demotion or suspension of more than 4,000 employees who exhibited substandard performance. By weeding out the under-performers, veterans have been left with a better-functioning VA.

The Trump administration continues to move forward with efforts to expand VA accountability like the implementation of the “Access and Quality Tool,” a platform that allows veterans to view wait times and assess quality-of-care data when choosing health care providers. As a result, wait times have improved and are comparable to the private sector.

There is a prevalence of mental illness in the veteran community that was not effectively addressed under Obama. Thirty one percent of active duty and reserve military personnel who were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have experienced some form of mental illness or have reported experiencing a traumatic brain injury, but only 30 percent of those servicemembers will get treatment. The 70 percent who go untreated are forced to cope and, sadly, 22 veterans die by suicide every day in the United States, on average. Substance abuse precedes approximately 30 percent of all veteran suicides and about 20 percent of high-risk behavior deaths.

The stigma surrounding mental health treatment has created a substantial access gap in coverage, meaning many people who need to be receiving treatment may not be. In an effort to create more accessible options, President Trump secured $73.1 billion in funding for VA mental health services, opioid abuse prevention, suicide prevention and rural veterans’ health initiatives.

Veterans’ choices and access to medical care have expanded with the VA Mission act, making it easier for veterans to find treatment in their own communities and providing access to walk-in clinics for immediate care.

The president also signed an executive order requiring Homeland Security, Defense and Veterans Affairs secretaries to construct a joint plan that affords veterans access to mental health treatment.

The transition from a uniformed life to a civilian one is not easy, but President Trump has worked to ensure that veterans have access to quality job opportunities. The jobless rate for all veterans fell to an 18-year low of 3.5 percent in 2018, from its peak at 9.9 percent in 2011.

President Obama once said, “Our nation owes a debt to its fallen heroes that we can never fully repay.” Although that is true, it is with gratitude that we honor the fallen heroes whose bravery and sacrifice has ensured our freedom. Not just this day but every day, we must choose to honor their memory by caring for those soldiers who did return home. As President Trump said, “We will not rest until all of America’s great veterans receive the care they’ve earned through their incredible service and sacrifice to our country.”

U.S. State Department misses deadline to explain Iran arms control report: aide,https://www.reuters.com,"['Arshad Mohammed', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-armscontrol/u-s-state-department-misses-deadline-to-explain-iran-arms-control-report-aide-idUSKCN1ST2VY,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department failed to meet a deadline on Thursday to provide information to three congressional committee chairmen looking into whether an annual arms control report slanted and politicized assessments about Iran, a congressional aide said.

In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.

The chairmen’s letter cited a Reuters article on April 17 about how the administration’s annual report to Congress on global compliance with international arms control accords provoked a dispute with U.S. intelligence agencies and some State Department officials.

The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.

A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”

The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S.-Iranian tensions rose following U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and his reimposition of tough economic sanctions. They sharpened earlier this month after Trump tightened sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports.

Strains further deepened with Saudi Arabia accusing Iran of ordering armed drone attacks on two oil pumping stations and the May 12 sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. government sources said Washington strongly suspects militias with ties to Tehran were behind those attacks as well as a rocket strike in Baghdad’s Green Zone.

Iran denied involvement in the incidents.

In their May 16 letter to Pompeo, the three chairmen said they were “deeply concerned” the arms control report may have been produced by political appointees “disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning.”

The State Department, they noted, was legally bound to submit to Congress a “detailed report” on compliance by the United States and other countries with international arms control accords.

Instead, they wrote, this year’s report was only 12 pages long, “contains no meaningful discussion” of U.S. and Russian compliance with such agreements and “consists largely of hypotheticals or opinion.”

Several sources told Reuters that the report made them wonder if the administration was painting Iran in the darkest light possible, much as the George W. Bush administration used bogus and exaggerated intelligence to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq."
Why Trump’s new $16B farmer bailout could hurt agriculture,https://www.politico.com,"['Catherine Boudreau', 'Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Liz Crampton']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/23/trump-farmer-bailout-trade-usda-1459840,"Many farmers are still contemplating what to produce this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the trade package, such as soybeans. | Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images agriculture Why Trump’s new $16B farmer bailout could hurt agriculture

President Donald Trump's snap decision to send billions of dollars in new aid to farmers could be bad for the farm economy and the federal budget.

Many farmers are still deciding what to plant this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the aid package, such as soybeans. That would add to already record supplies and further depress prices that have been falling for five years.

Story Continued Below

Trump tweeted about the new bailout for farmers earlier this month, soon after he decided to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China and Beijing retaliated by raising duties on $60 billion in U.S. products, many of them agricultural. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who weeks earlier denied the White House was discussing another round of aid so soon after a $12 billion bailout last year, suddenly interrupted a trip to South Korea to announce a second program.

Farm groups are headed to the White House on Thursday afternoon to join Trump as he announces a $16 billion boost for agriculture. The American Farm Bureau Federation and groups representing soybean, corn, wheat and pork producers are expected to attend, as well as lawmakers including Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who has worked closely with the administration on the aid package.

“We want to make sure that the farmers are being protected as we go through the process of negotiating new trade deals,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday outside the White House.

But the Trump administration’s decision to roll out the program now is drawing critics.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the White House should have been more cautious about the timing of the announcement because farmers are still planting.

“[W]e want farmers to make decisions on how many acres of corn and soybeans to plant based on the market and not something the government’s doing,” he said.

“The timing couldn’t have been worse,” said Jonathan Coppess, an agricultural policy professor at the University of Illinois, and a former head of the USDA Farm Service Agency during the Obama administration.

Rainfall in the Midwest has delayed planting, so many farmers can still switch up their crops. Even the prospect of another round of trade assistance could encourage them to plant more soybeans, Coppess said.

""There is certainly enough experience at USDA to know that announcing payments during planting might well cause more problems,"" Coppess said.

USDA’s first trade aid package sent the bulk of direct payments to soybeans given the significant damage that China’s 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports has done to prices and demand. China, the world’s top pork producer, is expected to need fewer soybeans to feed its hogs this year because African swine fever has forced the government to kill more than a million animals.

This year, the amount of money farmers receive will largely depend on the county in which they live in, instead of what they grow, the USDA announced on Thursday.

USDA officials estimated the amount of economic damage inflicted on different counties as a result of the trade disputes and will multiply that by what was planted in the area this year.

“We wanted to make sure producers are planting for the market,” Bill Northey, USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation, told reporters Thursday.

The 2018 trade package was based on what crops farmers actually planted that season — bucking Congress' efforts over the years to make subsidy programs more market-oriented by tying them to farmers' average historical acres and yields.

The aid programs in both years primarily involve sending direct payments to farmers and ranchers using funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era financial institution under the USDA that has broad authority to stabilize the farm economy.

But it is unclear whether the CCC has enough borrowing authority to fund another tariff-relief program. It is only allowed to borrow $30 billion per fiscal year from the U.S. Treasury to fund its work, and last year’s bailout used a big chunk of that. The CCC also is used to fund traditional farm subsidies authorized every five years by Congress.

Lawmakers last September included language in a short-term spending bill that effectively gave the CCC more flexibility to keep money flowing.

Hoeven, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subpanel overseeing USDA, told reporters last week that Congress can easily reimburse the financial institution if needed.

Trump is using taxpayer money to help just one industry harmed by trade policy. Other industries reeling from the tariff battles, from car manufacturers to shoe retailers, are not expected to receive financial aid.

Some farmers recognize the disparity, and stress that they would prefer to have open access to markets.

""We prefer that over a check from the government,"" said Mark Watne, president of the North Dakota Farmers Union. ""But right now, our own government is making our demand go down. We can't control that.""

"Ex-FBI lawyer: Carter Page FISA application approved in 'unusual' way by McCabe, Yates, and Baker",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-fbi-lawyer-carter-page-fisa-application-approved-in-unusual-way-by-mccabe-yates-and-baker,"A former top lawyer for the FBI described to lawmakers the “unusual” way the surveillance request targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page was handled by top leadership at the Justice Department and FBI, according to a transcript released this week.

In front of a joint session of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees on Aug. 31, 2018, former FBI Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson said she was normally responsible for signing off on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications before they reached the desk of her superiors for approval. Anderson said the “linear path” those applications typically take was upended in October 2016, with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates signing off on the application before she did. Because of that unusual high-level involvement, she didn’t see the need to “second guess” the FISA application.

The Page FISA application was filed by the Justice Department and FBI with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in October 2016. A surveillance warrant was granted and three renewals were subsequently approved. The FISA application relied heavily on unverified research in British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier on President Trump's ties to Russia, which was compiled through his employment with opposition research firm Fusion GPS with funding from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm.

Anderson said all FISAs need to be signed off on in the FBI’s National Security Law Branch, where she was assigned at the time. Anderson said she was the Senior Executive Service approver for the “initiation” of the Page FISA, including determining whether there is legal sufficiency.

But Anderson stressed “in this particular case, I'm drawing a distinction because my boss and my boss’ boss had already reviewed and approved this application.” She emphasized “this one was handled a little bit differently in that sense, in that it received very high-level review and approvals — informal, oral approvals — before it ever came to me for signature.”

Anderson said that FISA approvals are typically “tracked in a linear fashion” and that someone in the Senior Executive Service “is the final approver on hard copy before a FISA goes to the director or deputy director for signature.” She said the Page FISA was approved outside regular procedures.

""Because there were very high-level discussions that occurred about the FISA,"" Anderson said she believed that meant “the FISA essentially had already been well-vetted all the way up through at least the Deputy Director [McCabe] level on our side and through the DAG [Yates] on the DOJ side.” Yates had already signed the application by the time it made it to Anderson’s desk.

The publicly available Page FISA documents show then-FBI Director James Comey also signed off on it.

Because the FISA application had already been approved at such high levels, Anderson said she did not look at the Page FISA application with much skepticism. “I wouldn't view it as my role to second-guess that substantive approval that had already been given by the Deputy Director [McCabe] and by the Deputy Attorney General [Yates] in this particular instance,"" she said.

Asked why this FISA application was different, Anderson said she believed “the sensitivity level of this particular FISA resulted in lots of very high-level attention both within the FBI and DOJ.”

“The General Counsel [Jim Baker] … personally reviewed and made edits to the FISA, for example,” Anderson said. “The Deputy Director was involved in reviewing the FISA line by line. The Deputy Attorney General over on the DOJ side of the street was similarly involved, as I understood, reviewing the FISA application line by line.”

Baker recently defended the FBI’s handling of the FISA process, saying “we took [the dossier] seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally” and did not treat it as “literally true in every respect.” Baker also said, “I am not going to go into details with respect to what investigative steps we actually took to try to validate it.” Former FBI Director James Comey still referred to the dossier as “salacious and unverified” even in 2017.

Anderson stressed that McCabe, Yates, and Baker all played key roles in reviewing the Page FISA. “My approval at that point was really purely administrative in nature. In other words, the substantive issues — the FISA had already substantively been approved by people much higher than me in the chain of command,"" Anderson said.

Anderson said it “typically would not have been the case” that people such as McCabe and Yates would sign off on a FISA application before she did.

""That part of it was unusual, and so I didn't consider my review at that point in the process to be substantive in nature,"" Anderson said. ""In other words, there were smart lawyers, high-level people on both sides of the street who had reviewed and signed off on the application, the details of the application. And so I was simply signaling, yes, this package is ready to go forward.""

Anderson said the seal of approval from such high-ranking FBI and DOJ officials meant that her signature on the FISA application was mostly perfunctory.

Anderson cast doubt on whether Comey would usually read a full FISA application, considering he could receive more than a dozen in a given day. “And so, yes, the director or deputy director, if he signs the FISA, you know, relies on others,” Anderson said.

Even in normal circumstances, Anderson said she likely would not read the full FISA application before signing off on it “unless there were an issue that was identified by the cover note,"" due to time constraints.

Anderson admitted she did not read the Page FISA the day that she signed off on it but noted she’d read it at some earlier point in time.

The FBI’s handling of the Steele dossier has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks, and there are at least three federal investigations into alleged FISA abuse and other matters related to the way the FBI and DOJ conducted the Trump-Russia investigation."
Veterans Affairs employee charged for recording women in department restroom,https://www.cnn.com,['Devan Cole'],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/veterans-affairs-hidden-restroom-camera-arrest/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A Department of Veterans Affairs employee was charged Wednesday for allegedly recording multiple women without their knowledge in a restroom at the department's headquarters near the White House, according to court documents.

Authorities arrested Alex Greenlee on four charges of voyeurism for ""surreptitiously"" recording four women, one of them multiple times, in late January, according to the documents. Investigators say he recorded a fifth woman whom they have yet to identify.

The VA said in a statement to CNN that it ""immediately notified law enforcement after learning about this abhorrent behavior"" and that Greenlee is in the process of being fired.

According to the documents, Greenlee used two micro cameras to record the women in a restroom at the VA's office in downtown Washington.

The first camera was discovered by a woman who said it was attached to the stall next to the one she had used in the restroom, according to the documents. After leaving the restroom and reporting the camera to another female employee, the woman -- who authorities said was not captured on the camera -- saw Greenlee outside the restroom on his cellphone. She said he asked her if everything was OK and ""attempted"" to go inside the restroom, saying he needed to get paper towels.

US is considering duties on countries that undervalue their currencies,https://www.cnbc.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/us-is-considering-duties-on-countries-that-undervalue-their-currencies.html,"The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it was proposing a new rule to impose anti-subsidy duties on products from countries that undervalue their currencies against the dollar, another move that could slap higher tariffs on Chinese products.

The new rule also could put goods from other countries at risk of higher tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, India, Germany and Switzerland.

Those countries, along with China, were all listed on the Treasury Department's semi-annual currency report's ""monitoring list,"" which tracks currency market interventions, high global current account surpluses and high bilateral trade surpluses.

The department said its proposed rule would amend the normal countervailing duty process to include new criteria for currency undervaluation. Trump administration officials have long viewed China's yuan as undervalued against the dollar, despite the U.S.-China trade war, which foreign currency experts say has hurt the yuan's value.

""This change puts foreign exporters on notice that the Department of Commerce can countervail currency subsidies that harm U.S. industries,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.

""Foreign nations would no longer be able to use currency policies to the disadvantage of American workers and businesses,"" he said.

It was a step toward making good on a campaign promise by U.S. President Donald Trump to address unfair currency practices, Ross said.

The department did not identify the specific criteria that it would use to evaluate whether U.S. pricing of a product was artificially low because of currency undervaluation."
Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

FORMER OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ON INCREASING NUMBER OF BORDER APPREHENSIONS

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., first allowed Underwood's words to remain on the record, stating that ""the language is approprite and that it should not be taken down.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Underwood later took to Twitter to comment on what happened.

""For over a year, it’s been clear that policies at the border have harmed the physical and mental health of migrant children,"" she said. ""I believe, at this point, failure to change these broken policies based on that knowledge is intentional and unacceptable.""

President Donald Trump won’t release White House visitor logs, he refuses to hand over his tax returns, he made staffers sign non-disclosure agreements and he’s balking at congressional investigators.

Yet during a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday, he again proclaimed himself “the most transparent president” in U.S. history, adding to the reporters gathered before him, “I think most of you would agree.”

Story Continued Below

It may be true that Trump reveals more of his personal thoughts and emotions than any of his predecessors. But by most other measures of presidential transparency, including the congressional oversight at issue during his White House appearance Wednesday, Trump operates behind dark-tinted windows.

The end to White House visitor logs, a way for the public to see who is getting direct access to the most powerful man in America, is a break from Obama administration practice. He’s the first president in decades not to release his tax returns. No modern White House has held as few daily press briefings as Trump’s, a ritual his Pentagon and State Department have also largely phased out. And while many presidents have battled Congressional oversight requests, Trump has dismissed the queries of House Democrats as illegitimate partisan inquests.

All of which has many critics saying that Trump has it backwards.

“It is for sure the least transparent administration in modern history,” said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a prominent Washington consumer advocacy group.

Norm Ornstein, a longtime government reform advocate and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called the Trump administration “the opposite of transparent.” Trump’s statement, he deadpanned, “made me laugh -- before I cried again.”

Even by the standards of Trump’s penchant for embellishment and falsehoods, Trump’s claim of unprecedented transparency — which he and his aides have made repeatedly — is particularly outrageous to the cadre of outside groups who’ve spent the last 2.5 years clashing with an administration they view as deeply secretive.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2659/1155968404_6039857995001_6039857592001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

There is no universal definition of government transparency. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defines transparency as “the disclosure of government information” that can be used to “hold the federal government more accountable for its actions or inactions.”

Measured by that sort of standard, critics say, Trump has fallen far short.

Within the first year of Trump’s presidency, the federal government denied or censored more public information requests than at any time in the last decade. And Freedom of Information Act lawsuits intended to force the administration to turn over records reached a record high last year, increasing by nearly 70 percent compared with the last full fiscal year of President Barack Obama’s term.

“There’s only one way in which he’s the most transparent president and that’s that we can see him broadcasting his thoughts on Twitter when he gets angry in the morning,” said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government accountability group. “Otherwise, it’s ridiculous.”

White House officials counter that Trump is more accessible than any modern president, broadcasting his thoughts to his millions of followers everyday, answering shouted questions from reporters and granting regular print, television and radio interviews. By that measure, the public likely has a better understanding of Trump’s minute-to-minute opinions than they did of other recent presidents, who were often reluctant to spout off in public until their ideas had been vetted by their advisers.

Though White House aides hold up Trump as a pillar of accessibility, they have also sought to tightly control Trump’s interactions with the media. Trump’s exclusive interviews tend to be with friendly news outlets. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last appeared in the press briefing room in April to answer children’s questions during “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day,” and White House officials argued that her answers should be off the record.

Watchdog groups said accessibility alone isn’t enough to claim the transparency mantle.

“I don’t think that’s meaningful transparency,” said Liz Hempowicz, public policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, adding that the true transparency requires a government-wide commitment across federal agencies.

Hempowicz and other experts noted that the lack of transparency at federal agencies has massive consequences for the public, but often gets less attention than Trump’s headline-grabbing statements.

Just this week, for example, the Washington Post disclosed the existence of an internal Defense Department memo restricting the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress. And POLITICO recently detailed efforts by the Agriculture Department to reassign nearly all its researchers who study the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps, in what employees call a crackdown on economists whose assessments don’t square with Trump’s policies.

Then there is Trump’s categorical rejection of House Democratic oversight requests, including the extraordinary use of lawsuits to fight back against his investigators.

Trump’s claims of unprecedented transparency seem to be increasing as he grows more frustrated with the investigations encircling him. Aides and associates say Trump is furious that the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report has not dampened appetites for more investigation into subjects like his finances and tax returns.

“The President was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation. He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations,” White House spokesman Steven Groves said in a statement. “The White House and the Administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting Executive Branch rights and privileges. In addition, the President and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day.”

On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of engaging in a “cover-up,” countering that his administration had cooperated extensively with Mueller’s inquiries. Trump did give current and former staffers the green-light to participate with Mueller, although he himself refused to sit for an in-person interview, answering written questions instead.

“I think most of you would agree to this,” Trump said after abruptly ending a meeting with Democrats and vowing not to work with them until they end their investigations. “I’m the most transparent president, probably, in the history of this country. And instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said I was doing a cover-up. I don’t do cover-ups.”

Trump isn’t the first president to throw around transparency-related superlatives. Soon after winning the presidency, Barack Obama vowed to make his administration the most transparent in history. And he did take steps toward that goal, including through the first-ever release of White House visitor logs. But watchdog groups often complained that Obama was betraying that promise when he blocked access to records or his Justice Department prosecuted government leakers.

“The [Obama] administration’s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I’ve seen since the Nixon administration,” former Washington Post editor Len Downie wrote in a 2013 report.

“It’s unwise for a president to make a statement like that” unless he can back it up, Hempowicz said of Obama’s boast, noting that good government groups criticized the 44th president throughout his time in office. “It makes it very easy for us to push back.”"

USDA to shift some inspector tasks to pork plant workers — in everything but name,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

At a Smithfield hog plant in central Illinois, federal meat inspectors examine pig carcasses on the slaughter line, remove diseased and contaminated meat, and mark it “condemned.” They have the exclusive responsibility for performing this work.

At another hog plant about 75 miles away, JBS USA Food Co. employees are part of a long-running test program in which they perform tasks similar to those done by federal inspectors. When plant employees do this food safety work, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says they are “sorting” and “removing” or “disposing” of the meat, not inspecting or condemning it.

The shift in language is central to the USDA’s efforts to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors.

The proposed new inspection system transfers some responsibilities that traditionally have been handled by USDA inspectors to employees of pork plants. The USDA says it has studied the new inspection system for 20 years and that pork products from the test plants are at least as safe as those produced by traditional inspection. They say federal inspectors will spend less time visually assessing pork and more time ensuring sanitary conditions are maintained throughout the plant.

Several food safety lawyers, Democratic members of Congress and a former agriculture official say that the USDA is using sleight-of-hand tactics to get around legal mandates that have been in place for more than a century. Those mandates require federal regulators to inspect — and either pass or condemn — every live hog that arrives at a slaughterhouse and every hog carcass on the slaughter line.

“They are playing these linguistics games,” said Rena Steinzor, a food safety expert who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “What they are doing is illegal. If they have a problem with the statute because they think it’s a waste of energy for federal inspectors to eyeball every single animal, they could go to Congress. . . . The Constitution requires them to do that, not gut the law by regulation.”

The test hog-inspection program is expected to expand this summer after the agency approves new rules. Certain pork plants would have the option of using the new inspection system. Thirty-five plants plan to join the five test plants in using the new program; they would produce 90 percent of the pork consumed in the United States.

The number of federal inspectors on hog slaughter lines at the plants new to the program will be cut from 365 to 218, a 40 percent cut, according to a USDA analysis published in the Federal Register. The overall number of inspectors at those plants will drop from 400 to 288, a decline of 28 percent, according to figures provided by the USDA.

The new rules will allow the slaughter-line speeds to run as fast as the plant desires. The current cap on line speed is 1,106 hogs per hour, or 18 per minute.

Records show there have been no serious public health problems or pork food poisoning outbreaks linked to the test plants. Critics of the test plants say they have more food safety problems than the traditional plants; the USDA disputes that.

A half-dozen food safety groups, along with the USDA inspectors’ union, say they are concerned that increased line speeds and federal staff reductions on those lines will cause diseased and contaminated meat to slip by the remaining inspectors. They also cite an inherent conflict-of-interest among plant employees since they work for pork producers and not the public. Training for those workers, they point out, is also done entirely at the plant owners’ discretion.

Pat Basu, former chief veterinarian for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) who retired in 2018, is critical of the proposed regulation. He says the agency is using semantic tricks as it reassigns duties to plant employees that the law says inspectors should perform.

“These are word games they are playing,” Basu said. “What they are really doing is removing hogs that are diseased and contaminated. Why are these suddenly not inspections?”

USDA officials say they are modernizing the inspection process and that the new system will not violate existing laws and regulations. They say the agency has the authority to change how federal inspections are performed so long as a carcass-by-carcass inspection is performed on all of the hogs presented by the plant as fit for human consumption.

“In the proposed rules we are just giving the plant employees the opportunity to more fully execute their [food safety] plan before we make that final verification that the product is safe,” said Phil Bronstein, an assistant administrator with the FSIS.

Bronstein acknowledged that under the proposed rules, the number of USDA inspectors on the slaughter line in most large plants will be reduced from seven to three. Bronstein said the remaining inspectors would be more experienced and have a higher level of training. Also, the number of USDA inspectors who will roam large plants to ensure sanitation procedures are in place and to check on animal welfare will grow from one to two, officials said.

At least 17 members of Congress, all Democrats, have stated their opposition to the new system. “It is appalling to watch the Trump Administration and [USDA] leadership justify their gutting of hog slaughter inspections with meaningless technicalities and semantics,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee and chair of the Food Safety Caucus, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Who do they think they are fooling? This giveaway to corporate special interests means company-based employees will carry out responsibilities that are currently performed by government inspectors.”

Defining inspection

In addition to the term “condemnation,” other transferred tasks have also been given different names under the proposed new program, records show.

For example, when plant workers have examined a hog’s head and internal organs, looking for and removing signs of disease and contamination, they have “trimmed dressing defects and contamination, and identified pathology defects on the carcasses,” the proposed regulation says. They have not inspected the animal, the USDA says.

“The agency has trivialized what we have done and what we do by calling it sorting and other consumer protections,” said Charles “Stan” Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which represents inspectors. “The plant workers are clearly expected to do food safety inspections.” Painter said, given the increased role that plant workers will have on slaughter lines, he believes federal inspectors are “now nothing more than window dressing at the end of the line.”

The USDA has long used different terminology for the same tasks, depending on whether they were performed by federal inspectors or employees in the test plants. But it has become more steadfast in asserting the need for others to adopt its language, and the proposed new inspection system has focused attention on the matter.

The proposed regulation emphasizes that plant employees’ primary jobs involve “non-food safety standards concerned primarily with diseases of no public health significance.”

However, records show that nearly every transferred task involves food safety issues. For example, when plant workers are removing defects, such as blemishes, from a carcass, they might also trim abscesses that could be a sign of a serious disease or trim spots with fecal contamination that may contain dangerous pathogens.

When they remove internal organs and examine them, they are looking for signs of disease such as septicemia, which would mean the entire carcass could be filled with harmful bacteria.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

“They are, in a sense, performing part of the inspection process, doing a pre-screening,” said Daniel Kovich, director of science and technology with the National Pork Producers Council. “Yes, they are looking at it and they are supposed to move things from the line that are not supposed to pass inspection. But only FSIS can inspect an animal.”

In an interview, USDA officials acknowledged that many of the tasks handled by plant workers would be related to food safety but said they are not inspections.

Although there is no cap on how fast line speeds may run, the USDA anticipates about a 12.5 percent increase at the large plants under the new system, records show.

Zach Corrigan, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said that means the fewer remaining inspectors would need to examine an average of 6.1 heads per minutes versus about 2.7 heads per minute in the traditional system.

Corrigan said that the new system places a heavy burden on the USDA inspectors who remain on the line and must inspect every carcass. He said the new system will sometimes make it impossible for the USDA to comply with the law.

“The definition of inspection is a ‘critical appraisal,’ ” said Corrigan, citing a 2000 court case that dealt with USDA inspections. “That legal threshold cannot be met when you remove inspectors from the lines and you increase the line speeds.” He called the USDA’s varying terms for the same food safety tasks “Orwellian doublespeak.”

The USDA said a 2002 legal ruling found that the hog test program did not violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act. However, that court decision was limited to the test program and said it “may not necessarily foreshadow the outcome of judicial review of such future regulations.”

The USDA says only a federal inspector or veterinarian has the power to place the department’s mark of inspection on the pork — under the traditional and the alternative new system.

The department also says the word “inspection” is a technical term, and can only be applied to situations in which a USDA inspector or veterinarian has performed a food safety oversight task. At meat plants, veterinarians are typically the highest ranking federal official.

In response to a recent Washington Post article that said the proposed rules would shift much of the power and responsibility for food safety inspections at hog plants to plant employees, the USDA wrote: “By law, only federal inspection personnel conduct inspections of animals, carcasses and parts — and USDA inspection personnel inspect every carcass and part before it leaves the slaughterhouse and processing plant.”

However, inside the test pork plants, USDA inspectors use the term inspector — as in “TS [trimming and sorting] inspector” — to refer to their plant employee counterparts. For example, in a 2013 citation for a food safety violation, a USDA inspector said a diseased hog had “passed all three of your TS inspectors” without them spotting the problem and the carcass had to be condemned.

And in job advertisements, owners of the test pork plants consistently call some employees inspectors or use the word inspector in job descriptions. In a recent job posting by JBS, “quality control inspector” was used as a job title, and it said work tasks include performing “various quality control functions including but not limited to line inspection, audits.” JBS did not respond to several requests for comment.

Spotting problems

Five USDA inspectors said in sworn affidavits, taken by the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, that plant workers routinely miss problems in the test plants that they believe are potential food hazards.

They also said plant workers aren’t in a position to stand up to plant supervisors when they do spot problems.

“On numerous occasions, I witnessed them fail to spot abscesses, lesions, fecal matter and other defects that would render an animal unsafe or unwholesome,” said one inspector, who was not named. “Furthermore, plant inspectors don’t actually want to shut off the line to deal with the problems they spot on the job. . . . Obviously their employer will terminate them if they do it too many times.”

Outside evaluations of the test plants have exposed problems. The most recent review was done in 2018 by Food & Water Watch. In its assessment, the group compared USDA inspection reports from the five test plants with those of five comparably sized traditional plants.

The group received copies of citations from 2013 to 2016 through a Freedom of Information Act request. In all, more than 3,500 citations were issued by USDA inspectors to the 10 plants. Food and Water Watch determined that 73 percent of citations issued for a carcass contaminated with feces, bile, hair or dirt were at the five test plants.

In the five test plants, 32 citations were issued after inspectors spotted carcasses that were “so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.” Five comparably sized traditional hog plants received no citations for this offense, which is considered to be one of the most serious food safety violations because it can lead to possible recalls and food-poisoning outbreaks.

Carmen Rottenberg, who runs the FSIS, said the evaluation was not a meaningful comparison. She said citations to the test plants were higher because plant workers had assumed more responsibilities. When they fail to properly perform these new jobs, she said, the plants are then cited for those failures.

“We are holding the plants accountable for a lot more tasks,” Rottenberg said.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

Inspection reports illustrate some of the problems USDA inspectors found with the work done by plant employees.

At one test pork plant in Michigan, employees assigned to remove sick and diseased live hogs overlooked one that had collapsed and died, then presented it to USDA inspectors as fit for slaughter.

At an Illinois test plant, plant workers failed to identify more than a dozen abscesses in the internal organs of a slaughtered hog — a clear sign that the entire carcass was contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

And in Minnesota, employees at a test plant overlooked patches of yellow and green material on the chest wall and hindquarters of a hog carcass. It was fecal matter that could have contained dangerous pathogens.

The Food & Water Watch evaluation followed two independent government audits of the test program that were critical of the alternative inspection system. In 2013, the USDA’s inspector general found that three of the five test plants were among the worst in the nation for food safety and sanitary problems. Also in 2013, the Government Accountability Office raised food safety concerns due to the faster line speeds in those plants.

In the USDA’s self assessment the following year, the agency said its data showed the test plants “are performing as well as comparable large [traditional] market hog establishments and are meeting FSIS expectations.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and 16 other Democratic lawmakers opposed to the new inspection system asked the USDA inspector general’s office last month to investigate whether the department properly disclosed data on worker safety during the public review and comment period for the proposed regulations.

In a statement to The Post, Kaptur cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that say 1 in 6 Americans get sick and 3,000 die due to foodborne diseases each year: “If we are to improve those numbers, we cannot hand over the integrity of inspections to an industry focused more on profit and less on human and animal welfare.”"
US Energy Department Wants to See Lighter Offshore Wind Turbines,https://www.greentechmedia.com,[],,,,https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-energy-department-wants-to-see-lighter-offshore-wind-turbines,"Offshore wind power could be a lot cheaper if the generators inside the turbine nacelles were lighter. The U.S. Department of Energy is here to help.

DOE recently made available up to $8 million for four projects aiming to “develop more efficient, smaller, and lighter-weight generators.” According to DOE, the prospective designs could result in 50 percent smaller and lighter generators, which could reduce the levelized cost of wind energy by as much as 25 percent.

With an eye toward the mammoth wind turbines coming online by the mid-2020s — GE announced plans in March 2018 to commercially deploy a 12-megawatt offshore turbine in 2021 — the Energy Department wants to nudge manufacturers to build generators that can more easily be hoisted atop hubs topping out more than 100 meters above the waterline.

Project teams led by ABB, WEG Electric Corporation, American Superconductor and General Electric Global Research, respectively, were each to receive up to $400,000 to design a wind turbine generator capable of scaling to a capacity of 10 megawatts or more. ABB subsequently confirmed to Greentech Media it will not pursue the research project it had planned under the DOE grant, but the other three remain active.

After an initial one-year conceptual design phase, DOE will select one of the projects to receive up to $6.4 million for the construction of a scaled prototype. The full research program is expected to last four years.

Next-gen direct drive generators

The teams involved in the DOE-funded research project are developing direct-drive technologies for their planned high-efficiency, lighter generators.

Direct-drive machines generate electricity without using a gearbox, resulting in avoided maintenance. “Having all of those moving parts makes the gearbox one of the highest-maintenance parts of a wind turbine,” noted the DOE in a recent blog post.

According to Aaron Barr, senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, the current generation of direct-drive wind generators “has reached technical and commercial maturity,” accounting for 26 percent of the wind turbines installed on land and 50 percent installed at sea globally in 2018.

But direct-drive turbines come with their own tradeoffs. Current designs rely on permanent magnets that require expensive, heavy rare earth elements. This in turn increases the weight of direct drive generators relative to those used in geared wind turbines.

WEG Electric Corporation plans to develop a lightweight generator designed both to use less rare earth materials than conventional geared turbines and to be integrated into its existing platform. ABB had planned to develop a generator that uses a magnet cooling system for use in either geared or direct-drive turbines as large as 15 megawatts.

The other two project teams — American Superconductor and GE — are developing superconducting generators expected to greatly reduce the need for rare earth materials.

GE’s proposed ultra-light low-temperature superconducting generator relies on lessons learned from the company’s decades-long magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) work. The goal is a solution customized for offshore wind turbines larger than 12 megawatts.

“Superconducting electric machines aren’t really anything new. What is new is some of the cryogenic technologies that have evolved over the years for MRI we can now bring to electric machines to make them practical,” David Torrey, GE’s team leader, told Greentech Media in an interview.

He added, “To the extent you can raise the magnetic field, you can produce more power with less heat, making your generator more efficient.”

Superconducting generators' path to market

According to WoodMac's Barr, superconducting generators have been researched for years but manufacturers have yet to develop a commercial prototype.

Wood Mackenzie estimates that the technology is at least a decade from commercialization, with deployment likely to come in next-generation 15-megawatt or larger offshore wind turbines.

“However, this will require an intensive R&D effort from OEMs, supply chain partners, and government-funded research,” Barr said.

That's the reasoning behind the Department of Energy’s push to jump-start R&D in this space.

Direct-drive and superconducting generators have the most market potential at sea, where the reduced size and weight of the next-generation generators envisaged by DOE are likely to have the greatest impact.

“Offshore turbines are expected to be 60 percent direct-drive by 2025,” said Barr.

DOE sees high-efficiency, lightweight generators as one way to reduce the weight and cost of towers and foundations for both bottom-fixed and floating offshore turbines.

“As we look to the future with floating offshore wind platforms to access wind resources where the water is too deep for conventional foundations, lightweighting while maintaining high efficiency becomes even more important,” wrote the DOE’s project team.

Just don’t expect the DOE-backed generator designs to take over the market in the near term.

“The design cycle for offshore turbines is very long, due to the massive scale of the technology, significant supply chain investment, and high risk that dictates extensive validation periods,” said Barr.

“The DOE-funded research is unlikely to be applied commercially on the next generation of offshore wind turbines until 2030 or later.”

However, GE’s Torrey was optimistic that earlier deployment might be possible.

“We consider the MRI technology to be quite mature right now. Barring any unforeseen surprises, I think we can certainly have something deployed well before 2030.”"
DOJ Attorneys Reportedly Ready to Block T-Mobile/Sprint Merger,https://gizmodo.com,"['Dell Cameron', 'About The Author', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Tech Policy', 'Email', 'Dell Gizmodo.Com', 'Xmpp', 'Dell Jabber.Ccc.De']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/doj-attorneys-reportedly-ready-to-block-t-mobile-sprint-1834961808,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"
‘100%’ of illegal immigrant families released into U.S.: DHS,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/23/100-illegal-immigrant-families-released-dhs/,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Thursday that “100%” of illegal-immigrant families in the new border surge are being released into communities, rather than being held and deported.

He said within a month or two, they are also granted work permits, giving them a foothold to live and remain in the U.S. while their cases proceed through the immigration courts — a process that averages two years, and stretches even longer in some overwhelmed regions.

Mr. McAleenan said that system, rewarding unauthorized migrants who jump the border with exactly the thing they seek, is responsible for the record-breaking numbers.

“That is directly how smugglers are advertising,” he told the Senate Homeland Security Committee, adding that it applies not just to families seeking asylum.

The effects on the border have been stunning.

In 2012, only about 10,000 migrants traveling as families — meaning parent and child — were caught by Border Patrol at the border. Over the last two months alone, that number was 111,679 people.

Many of the families end up ignoring their immigration court proceedings, and remain in the U.S. illegally even after they have been ordered deported.

That was brought into stark view this week when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement revealed that an illegal immigrant teen affiliated with the violent international MS-13 street gang came into the U.S. as part of a family unit in 2015.

Josue Fuentes-Ponce and his family did not show up for their immigration hearing in 2017 and they were ordered deported in absentia — yet nobody ever went to look for the family.

The teen remained free in Maryland, where he was accused last year of attempted murder. ICE sought to deport him, but he was released from custody after local authorities did not honor a detainer request.

He now stands accused of the horrific murder of a 14-year-old girl in Maryland last month. Prosecutors say he and another illegal immigrant, 17-year-old Joel Ernesto Escobar, who arrived in the U.S. as an Unaccompanied Alien Child, used a bat to bash the girl and a machete to chop at her, suspecting she was going to rat them out over a gang-related robbery.

How Much Political Experience Does It Take to Be Elected President?,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Astor', 'Alicia Parlapiano']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/23/us/politics/presidential-experience.html,"Highest previous position 2020 candidates No. elected president Most recently elected Senator 7 2008 House member 2 1880 Governor 10 2000 Mayor 0 (never) No political or military experience 1 2016 Cabinet member 6 1928 Vice president 5 1988 General officer 4 1952 Notes: Does not include the nine vice presidents who assumed the presidency after the death or resignation of the previous president. While some rankings are self-explanatory — senator is a higher position than representative, and governor is higher than mayor — others are somewhat subjective. From highest to lowest, we ranked the positions as follows: vice president, cabinet member, governor or senator, House member, mayor. No tiebreakers were needed between governor and senator.

You’ve never seen a House member elected president. Neither have your parents — nor, in all likelihood, their parents. The last time it happened, there were 38 states and electricity was a novelty.

The year was 1880, the congressman James Garfield. The 14 decades since are littered with the failed campaigns of candidates who thought they could replicate his feat.

But that hasn’t stopped six current and former House members from trying this year, a full quarter of the Democratic field.

As for what Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, the most recent addition to the candidate throng, is trying to do: Well, no one has ever done it. Never in American history has a sitting mayor been elected president, or even received a major party’s nomination. But three — Mr. de Blasio; Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; and Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla. — are running now.

The 2016 Republican field, which was almost as big as the Democratic field is now, included no House members or mayors. Of the 17 candidates, nine were sitting or former governors, and five were sitting or former senators.

But, of course, all those governors and senators lost to Donald J. Trump, who had no political experience at all. Before Mr. Trump was elected, no one had ever become president without a background in government or the military. Now, it’s harder to say what the bar is — or whether voters care.

The highest previous position of each U.S. president, by date of first election 1789 1900 2016 No government or military Trump, 2016 Obama, 2008 Senator Bush, 2000 Governor Vice president* Bush, 1988 Eisenhower, 1952 General officer Hoover, 1928 Cabinet Garfield, 1880 House member (never) Mayor 1789 1900 2016 No government or military Trump, 2016 Obama, 2008 Senator Bush, 2000 Governor Vice president* Bush, 1988 Eisenhower, 1952 General officer Hoover, 1928 Cabinet Garfield, 1880 House member (never) Mayor 1789 1900 2016 No government or military Trump, 2016 Obama, 2008 Senator Bush, 2000 Governor Vice president* Bush, 1988 Eisenhower, 1952 General officer Hoover, 1928 Cabinet Garfield, 1880 House member (never) Mayor 1789 1900 2016 No government or military Trump, 2016 Obama, 2008 Senator Governor Bush, 2000 Vice president* Bush, 1988 Eisenhower, 1952 General officer Hoover, 1928 Cabinet House member Garfield, 1880 (never) Mayor *Does not include those who assumed the presidency after the death or resignation of the previous president.

As the chart above shows, a small number of offices have produced the vast majority of our presidents. A governorship is the most common steppingstone. This year, though, only three of the 23 Democratic candidates are or have been governors, and all of them are trailing in polls.

While the vice presidency might seem the most obvious launching pad for the presidency, only five people have done what Joseph R. Biden Jr. is trying to do now: get elected after completing his vice presidency. Fourteen presidents were previously vice presidents, but nine of them took over when a president died or resigned. (Four of those nine went on to win a full term.)

Cabinet secretaries were elected president much more often in the early days of the republic than they are now. Hillary Clinton came close in 2016. But of the six presidents whose highest previous office was in the cabinet, four were elected before 1850, and the most recent, Herbert Hoover, was elected almost 100 years ago.

Senators occupy an interesting space in modern presidential history: frequently nominated but rarely elected. Since 1960, Americans have elected only two senators — John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama — to the presidency, but five more received their party’s nomination. This year, however, seven are running for the Democratic nomination, and most of the front-runners are among them.

By the time you get down to the House, the history is paper-thin, and thinner still for rank-and-file members. Garfield, the last House member elected, was a committee chairman.

But the six 2020 candidates in this category have one thing going for them: They are not the least experienced in the pack.

Two of their competitors, Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang, are following a path on which nobody but Mr. Trump has been successful: They are running for president with no political or military experience at all."
Trump’s EPA is ‘cooking the books’ to justify its attack on clean air rules,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-epa-is-cooking-the-books-to-justify-its-attack-on-clean-air-rules/,"Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to distort the way it measures the benefits of some of the agency’s most impactful policies, regulations that safeguard human health by limiting air pollution. The primary beneficiary of such distortion? The coal industry.

When the government evaluates the health and financial benefits of clean air, the calculation typically incorporates the number of lives saved and the scale of reduced health impacts thanks to reducing pollution — also known as “co-benefits.” Incorporating these factors into a cost-benefit analysis forms the very foundation upon which many environmental protections are based.

But now, experts warn the EPA is opening the door to industry challenges to these clean air rules by changing the way it evaluates the long-accepted science on the risk of particulate matter — microscopic particles polluting the air that are linked to increased heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory disease.

The agency may also be laying the groundwork, experts say, for using these “biased and misleading” calculations in other policy contexts. That fear was stoked by a new EPA memo released this week, ushering in a formal process to change the way the agency calculates its cost-benefit analysis across a slew of issues, from water pollution to pesticides.

It is well-established that reducing air pollution saves lives — a fact backed up by numerous scientific studies and government reports. In fact, a 2017 report from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) found that out of all federal rules, the EPA’s had the “highest estimated benefits as well as the highest estimated costs.” The costs and benefits capture everything from the new equipment required by power plants to the co-benefits from Americans’ reduced exposure to pollution.

What’s more, regulations designed to improve air quality accounted for over 95% of the benefits from EPA rules. When it comes to fine particle pollution, OMB said the benefits of regulation “far exceed” the costs.

Nonetheless, the EPA is now arguing that the calculation used to determine the costs and benefits of air pollution regulations needs to be changed. The agency is exaggerating the costs of these rules while downplaying their ecological, climate, financial, and health benefits so that it can more easily defend its sweeping rollback of environmental protections — changes that are often in line with industry demands.

The EPA’s proposed revisions to this math would reduce the number of lives at risk from repealing the Clean Power Plan and drastically downgrade the projected benefits of retaining the Mercury and Air Toxics standards (MATS) regulating power plant pollution. By eliminating the use of co-benefits, these policy changes don’t look as bad.

“Both approaches are means by which unscrupulous agency officials can cook the cost-benefit books and distort the debate about the value of health and environmental protections,” James Pew, a staff attorney at EarthJustice, told ThinkProgress. “They’re a way to rationalize rolling back these protections, or not establishing them in the first place.”

On Tuesday, the EPA released a memo directing four agency offices to “rectify… inconsistencies” regarding the process for calculating risks and benefits. This includes offices overseeing air pollution, water pollution, land contamination (including Superfund sites), and chemicals and pesticides.

The direction, issued to staff on May 13, codifies and expands an effort to effectively “cook the books” that was initiated by former Administrator Scott Pruitt. In April 2018, Pruitt told attendees at a meeting held at the Heritage Foundation – a think tank known for promoting climate science denial – that he would stop counting the co-benefits of environmental policies.

It is “potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits.”

This trend in fudging the numbers goes back to 2017, when the EPA under Pruitt made what appeared to be a few small changes to a metric known as the social cost of carbon – a figure that agencies use to determine the climate benefits of a particular regulation. In this case, the EPA argued it should only have to calculate how methane emissions reductions benefit the United States alone, a complete reversal from how these costs are typically calculated.

One of the main regulations currently in the agency’s cross-hairs is the MATS rule; introduced in 2011, it established federal limits on hazardous pollution from power plants. The regulation targets chemicals like mercury that can cause serious health impacts such as tremors, respiratory failure, and death. Coal plants are the biggest emitters of this toxic pollution.

The EPA’s own calculations show these regulations save upwards of 17,000 lives each year. Yet the agency is now arguing that the policy is too costly, claiming it costs industry $9.6 billion per year while only producing up to $6 million in benefits — significantly fewer benefits than what the Obama administration said the policy creates.

According the Obama-era calculations, the MATS rule would save $80 billion, in part due the co-benefits of costs avoided through fewer hospital visits and other health care spending resulting from poor air quality.

Among these benefits are ones that come from reducing pollution 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller (PM 2.5, for context, is 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair). While pollution standards set a limit on how much of this pollution is allowed, scientists argue there is no safe level, as even the tiniest particles in very small quantities are believed to impact the brains of unborn children.

But Trump’s EPA doesn’t see it that way, arguing these co-benefits are a stretch for what can be considered cost savings — and that regulating mercury from power plants is therefore not “appropriate and necessary.”

It’s a “biased and misleading estimate of costs and benefits,” Michael Livermore, associate professor of law at University of Virginia, said during a House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday regarding the proposed changes to MATS.

“The purpose of cost-benefit analysis is to understand consequences of agency decisions,” Livermore told lawmakers. “By excluding a large category… [you’re] turning a blind eye to an enormous category of consequences,” he said of the number of lives at risk from pollution.

Just hours later, the EPA released its memo to expand its cost-benefit revisions.

Meanwhile, regarding the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, the New York Times reported Monday that “the EPA plans to get thousands of pollution deaths off the books by changing its math.”

An EPA impact analysis released last August found that repealing the Clean Power Plan and replacing it with a new rule – the Affordable Clean Energy plan – would lead to an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.

The agency was ridiculed at the time for this admission, and now appears to be trying to reverse course. By adopting a different analytical method, according to the Times, the EPA will be able to reduce this number in order to defend its rollback of the Clean Power Plan.

Many experts, however, warn that there is no scientific basis to the EPA’s reported approach of assuming there are little to no health benefits from reducing pollution as much as possible. The methodology is expected to be made public in June as part of its Affordable Clean Energy rule roll-out.

“The EPA’s current agenda is to mislead and misrepresent the harms of the current Trump rollback agenda,” John Walke, clean air director and senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told ThinkProgress.

“But,” he added, “there’s also a future dimension – to handcuff the EPA and prevent them from protecting Americans and the environment.”

Targeting the science-based economics supporting air pollution regulations “would have very, very broad impacts,” Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, told ThinkProgress.

Revesz says the EPA is undercutting the science in three ways, under what he calls the “dirty trinity” — methods that are “extraordinarily flawed and inconsistent with what administrations [both Democrat and Republican]… have done for decades.”

The first method is by calling into question the co-benefits. “I see what the agency proposed in MATS as potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits,” he said, pointing to the EPA’s memo released this week calling on the four offices to reevaluate their cost-benefit analysis.

The next method is by calling into question the benefit of reducing particle pollution to below the national ambient air quality standards on PM 2.5. According to Revesz, the EPA’s logic espoused by the head of air quality, Bill Wehrum, is essentially to say there’s no extra benefit of reducing levels of PM 2.5 below what’s required under the national standards. This “flies in the face” of what previous administrations have done and what science has established, Revesz said.

Finally, he said the administration is trying to call into question previous studies on the harmful health impacts of particle pollution.

The impact of such a “comprehensive attack,” said NRDC’s Walke, is that “the outcome of the agency’s tortured analysis would indicate that greater protections are not justified.”

The proposed changes aren’t just opposed by scientists, environmentalists, and legal experts. They’re also, in the context of MATS, opposed by the utility industry, which has already spent billions of dollars to upgrade its facilities to be in line with the pollution rules. If MATS were to be halted, they would risk not recuperating the costs put into these upgrades.

So why do something so widely opposed? Janet McCabe, former acting EPA air chief, was posed this very question on Tuesday. “I don’t know, but I can think of two reasons why they would do this,” she told lawmakers during the MATS hearing. One of these is to “inaugurate this new way of looking at benefits, and devaluing the full range of benefits.”

The other, she said, is that “this administration has made very clear they will do everything they can to help the coal industry, and this rule is top of that list.”

While it’s hard to know exactly what is going through the minds of EPA officials when introducing these changes, the broader theme across their actions points to an industry-friendly agenda.

Given the widespread opposition to these proposed changes, Pew said, “it appears [EPA Administrator] Wheeler and Wehrum are acting in the interests of a very narrow group of companies, such as Murray Energy, Wheeler’s former client, that want the MATS rule to be withdrawn.”

In 2016, coal giant Murray Energy filed a lawsuit asking a federal appeals court to evaluate the EPA’s finding that it was “appropriate and necessary” to regulate power plants under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The lawsuit was seen as a way to challenge the EPA’s longstanding practice of considering co-benefits in its cost analysis for regulatory decisions.

As for the new math on the Clean Power Plan’s repeal, that too is tied to a former client of an EPA official.

In 2015, the Utility Air Regulatory Group — which is known for fighting clean air policies and lobbying against the Clean Power Plan — was represented by Wehrum, then a corporate lawyer at Hunton & Williams. The firm filed comments to the EPA on behalf of UARG, arguing that recognizing the benefits of saving lives and reducing PM 2.5 pollution below required levels “fail a common sense test.”

According to the Times this week, Wehrum echoed this logic, arguing that the premise that you can save billions by reducing pollution in areas that already meet the national standard “doesn’t make any sense.”

While the administration is taking the initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan, it claims it is not actually going to roll back MATS itself.

Some critics remain skeptical, however, and argue that by undoing the science that supports MATS, the EPA is opening the door for industry to challenge the rule all together — why have a rule if the agency’s own math says there aren’t many benefits?

Asked whether the EPA understands it is leaving this standard legally vulnerable, McCabe said she thinks it does. “If people think the EPA is not going to be asked to move forward to vacate the rule… they are mistaken,” she said. “The request will come immediately.”

It’s a “deeply cynical strategy,” Walke told ThinkProgress of the EPA’s attempt to undo the science while at the same time claiming it wants to keep MATS in place.

Doing this could “encourage litigation” by Murray Energy and others to undo the MATS rule, Pew said. “If that litigation were successful, there would be a race to the bottom for power companies to turn off or turn down their pollution controls.”

Coal company Peabody Energy has also indicated that the end result of the agency’s reevaluation to its cost calculations could be the entire undoing of the sweeping toxic pollution rule.

The chances of this type of lawsuit being successful, however, are hard to predict. But many expect it would be a long-fought battle — and that those fighting to keep the pollution controls in place would be able to point to the EPA’s questionable cost calculations and the established science to argue in support of the rules.

“I don’t think, in the end, they’ll be able to survive judicial scrutiny,” said Revesz, who believes the intention is designed to open the door to undermine co-benefits across policy areas rather than spur litigation.

The probability that the courts would uphold the EPA’s “flawed economic analysis” is “very low” he explained, because these actions are “inconsistent with regulatory practice, economics, science. They make no logical sense.”"
USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Quint Forgey', 'Burgess Everett', 'John Bresnahan', 'Nancy Cook']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/22/usda-agriculture-economists-trump-policies-1340168,"Following Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's announcement of a staff relocation within the department, employees have been wondering who would be able to stay in Washington. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo agriculture USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies Those who examine the impact of tariffs, climate change and taxes on rural America are among employees being relocated.

The Agriculture Department is moving nearly all its researchers into the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps – subjects of controversial Trump administration initiatives – outside of Washington, part of what employees claim is a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.

Since last year, employees in the department’s Economic Research Service have awaited news of which members of their agency would be forced to relocate, after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stunned them by declaring he was moving most of the agency to a location outside the capital. The announcement sparked claims that Perdue was trying to pressure economists into leaving the agency rather than move their families.

Story Continued Below

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington, but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person if they made the cut.

But current and former employees compiled one anyway, covering all 279 people on staff, 76 of whom are being allowed to stay in Washington.

The current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, say the specialties of those who are being asked to move corresponds closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with the president’s policies, including tax policies, climate change, and the farm economy. The list, shared exclusively with POLITICO, shows a clear emphasis was placed on keeping employees whose work covers relatively non-controversial issues like crop planting over those whose research focused on areas sensitive to the administration.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told POLITICO, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

A former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved put it this way: “You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS. They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

A USDA spokesman declined to directly address the employees’ allegation of political bias, but provided a written statement from Perdue saying that the moves were not prompted by the work being done by ERS

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our . . . employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government,” Perdue said. “These changes are more steps down the path to better service to our customers, and will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone. . .”

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run. And we are increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from land-grant universities.”

But employees claim the department’s leadership, including Perdue, turned against the research service after an estimate early last year suggested that the Republican-backed tax plan would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers.

Perdue’s decision to move ERS came several months after news outlets highlighted the USDA study on the Republican tax changes. In response to Perdue’s move, cities from all over the country submitted bids to host the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which will also move. The finalists, announced May 3, were the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Accompanying his announcement of a final selection, which is expected as early as this week, Perdue has promised to provide Congress with a cost-benefit analysis detailing why USDA says the move makes financial sense.

The impending announcement comes as pressure builds on Capitol Hill to stop the move. On Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider a spending bill that includes a provision barring the Agriculture Department from moving the two agencies out of the national capital zone. It also would block Perdue’s decision to put ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, a move that placed oversight of the agency closer to the secretary’s office.

Employees said that moving nearly all researchers out of Washington would have a clear impact on the agency’s work. Researchers said they usually draw on information from other USDA divisions, members of Congress and Washington-based stakeholder groups, which would be more difficult from a remote location. Allowing 76 members of the agency to stay in Washington while the other left also impacts morale, they said, and limits collaboration.

Among the employees staying in Washington are senior analysts who conduct global market and crop-outlook estimates and administrative personnel. According to the list, approximately 49 percent of agricultural economists will be allowed to remain in Washington, compared with 14 percent of researchers.

Rumors had been swirling among staff for months about who would be allowed to remain in Washington when all ERS employees were called into an auditorium in March to be briefed by Acting Administrator Chris Hartley. He then read aloud the names of those who qualified to stay. But it wasn’t until employees compiled a full roster of who was staying and going that they got a clear picture of how the agency would be split up.

Decisions on who would stay in Washington were made by ERS leadership and approved by Perdue, according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” document distributed at the March meeting. The FAQ states that “every ERS employee had the ability to provide input” on the move. Senior managers “proposed critical ERS functions” that they believed needed to remain in Washington.

Some employees said that description of the decision-making process validates their concerns that Perdue was behind the move.

“They went in and handpicked who they wanted and called them ‘critical,’” said a current ERS employee.

Neil Conklin, a former senior administrator at ERS under the George W. Bush administration, said the agency stands to be fundamentally changed by the relocation.

Trump declares man he appointed secretary of state 'totally ill prepared and ill equipped' for the job,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Dylan Stableford', 'Yahoo News']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/05/23/trump-declares-man-he-appointed-secretary-of-state-totally-ill-prepared-and-ill-equipped-for-the-job/23733748/,"President Trump on Thursday lashed out at Rex Tillerson after the former secretary of state reportedly told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that Russian President Vladimir Putin out-prepared Trump during their first meeting in Germany.

Trump responded by calling Tillerson incompetent.

“Rex Tillerson, a man who is ‘dumb as a rock’ and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be Secretary of State, made up a story (he got fired) that I was out-prepared by Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Hamburg, Germany,” he tweeted. “I don’t think Putin would agree. Look how the U.S. is doing!”

If Tillerson was “totally ill prepared and ill equipped” to be the nation’s top diplomat, Trump himself would be to blame: He appointed the former ExxonMobil CEO to be secretary of state shortly after his inauguration after interviewing multiple candidates, including now-Sen. Mitt Romney. Tillerson was confirmed by the Senate eight days later.

In December 2016, when Trump was considering Tillerson for the position, the then-president-elect tweeted about him glowingly.

“Whether I choose him or not for ‘State,’” Trump wrote, “Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker.”

Tillerson's' 14-month tenure — ending when Trump fired him last March — was fraught. In October 2017, he issued a public statement complimenting the president after multiple reports said that he had privately called Trump “a moron.” Shortly after taking the job, Tillerson told an interviewer that he never wanted the job as secretary of state and didn’t seek the post.

“My wife told me I’m supposed to do this,” Tillerson when asked why he had accepted the position as America’s top diplomat.

Trump also called Tillerson “dumb as a rock and lazy as hell” in a December tweet.

The Justice Department remains open to the $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile and Sprint despite reports that it was leaning toward rejection, sources told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Makan Delrahim, head of the DOJ's antitrust division, is still talking with the companies and may be trying to find a way to support a deal despite his staff's opposition, the sources said.

Discussions about possible remedies are ongoing. But what kind of remedies — beyond what the companies committed to as part of a deal with the Federal Communications Commission — remain unclear.

Shares of Sprint jumped 4.6% in Thursday's premarket following Sorkin's report. T-Mobile shares were up nearly 1%.

Earlier this week, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, elevated to the top post by President Donald Trump in 2017, said he plans to recommend his agency approve the merger after the companies committed to not raising prices for three years.

It's possible, according to Sorkin's reporting, that the DOJ could push for more years on no price hikes, for example.

The Obama administration rebuffed earlier efforts by the companies to merge, as well as an attempted deal between AT&T and T-Mobile, on concerns that such deals would hurt competition in the wireless industry.

Northport VA hospital gets new director,https://www.newsday.com,['Martin C. Evans'],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.newsday.com/news/health/northport-va-medical-center-director-antonio-sanchez-1.31504710,"The Northport VA Medical Center is getting a new director after nearly a year under the leadership of an interim chief.

Dr. Antonio Sanchez, 51, is an 18-year employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs and currently is chief of staff of the VA Caribbean Healthcare System based in Puerto Rico, the agency said Friday. He served as acting director of the Caribbean system for roughly two years, from December 2016 to January 2019.

Sanchez, a psychiatrist, will take over Northport's top job from interim head Dr. Cathy Cruise in the next 45 to 60 days, said Dr. Joan E. McInerney, who oversees the VA's New York regional office.

He will be responsible for everything, from managing 1,800 employees and a multimillion-dollar budget to ensuring the care of more than 30,000 patients a year and running a string of satellite clinics that stretch from Valley Stream to Riverhead.

In the past few years, the medical center has been dogged by crumbling infrastructure and high turnover in virtually all its key administrative roles.

In an interview from San Juan, Sanchez talked about the many challenges of Long Island's only veterans hospital.

“That is part of the excitement of arriving there,” Sanchez said. “There are issues we need to address … so I’ll be pretty busy.”

Sanchez said he spent four or five days at the medical center a few weeks ago, meeting with McInerney and other regional leaders.

McInerney praised Sanchez, pointing out what she described as his ""sound leadership qualities and proven experience.""

Two members of Long Island's congressional delegation didn't comment on Sanchez directly but did speak about the medical center and the VA broadly.

“Northport has had a lot of turnover in the last two and a half years,"" said Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove). ""The Northport VA historically has been one of the best VAs in the country. It’s had a rough few years, and I hope this new leadership can turn it around.”

Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) criticized VA leaders for not keeping members of Congress up to speed on developments at Northport. He said he hadn't been told that Cruise was going to be replaced.

“Obviously there have been real problems there, so I think it would help them to contact us early and bring us in,” King said. “It would have been a show of good faith to let us know beforehand.”

King pressed for a meeting between the Long Island delegation and the incoming director as soon as possible.

Sanchez has a New York connection: He did his undergraduate studies at SUNY Brockport upstate. He received both a medical degree and a master's degree in Healthcare Services Administration from the University of Puerto Rico's School of Medicine. He is a fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives and a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.

Sanchez joined the VA in August 2000 as a staff psychiatrist at the Caribbean system. He served as the system's chief of psychiatry service from June 2006 to July 2009, according to the VA.

As psychiatry service chief, Sanchez improved access to mental health care and established a foundation to expand more programs for veterans.

Sanchez's next VA position was interim chief of staff. He then was chief of staff until he began his time as acting director.

Cruise, a Huntington native, became Northport's acting director in July after director Scott Guermonprez resigned a year into his tenure, citing personal and family reasons. She also holds the title of chief of staff.

Since 2016, when Cruise arrived from the VA’s New York regional office, the medical center has had four medical center directors, three chiefs of staff and three nursing department directors, as well as the heads of the human resources department and physical plant.

And the 91-year-old medical center is showing its age. Last year brought two crises, for example. In January 2018, Northport had to close a homeless shelter on its campus after the heating system went out. A month later, the hospital had to shut down all five of its operating rooms to repair the air conditioning. The homeless shelter is still closed and isn't expected to open until at least October.

In September, three months after Cruise took over, the VA's independent watchdog released the findings of a yearlong investigation into nursing shortages at the medical center. Northport’s senior leaders, the report said, knew about the staffing shortages, mismanaged the nurses to fill the gaps and allowed overtime costs to balloon to $1.5 million in 2017, a nearly $750,000 increase from the year before.

In an addendum to the report, Cruise told the VA's Office of the Inspector General that she agreed with the findings and would address the staffing shortages.

One project that Cruise will turn over to Sanchez is the consolidation of more operations into the hospital, one of nearly two dozen buildings on the 268-acre campus.

A consolidation will improve communication between employees and their supervisors and will limit the need for patients with several medical conditions to go to several buildings for care, Cruise said.

In an interview in late December, Cruise had made it clear that she wanted the job of director.

The new director will face other challenges.

Health analysts warn that growing pressure to increase the privatization of VA health care — allowing more veterans to see private doctors paid for by federal dollars — could divert resources during a time when the agency is already stressed by staffing shortages and squeezed to keep up with the latest technology.

Already, more than 2 million veterans have used VA health dollars to schedule 41 million appointments under the Veterans Choice Act, signed by President Barack Obama in 2014. Under the program, for example, a veteran could see a private doctor if the nearest VA hospital was too far away or if the VA couldn't provide care within 30 days of requesting an appointment.

And that outsourcing is expected to increase under the VA Mission Act of 2018, which President Donald Trump signed in June to replace the Veterans Choice Act. Many of the new law's provisions build on the 2014 legislation, especially on the timeliness of appointments and distance of travel."

The USDA encourages the public to double check meat products before Memorial Day grilling begins.

Here are some things to keep in mind when checking labels:

The meat was shipped nationwide but originated and packaged at the Aurora Packing Company, Inc in North Aurora, Illinois on April 19

According to the USDA’s announcement, the products being recalled have the establishment number “EST. 788” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The recall includes more than 40 products, most of which are cuts of steak, like ribeyes, as well as ribs and brisket cuts.

U.S. Treasury backs away from plan for Harriet Tubman on $20 bill next year,https://www.reuters.com,"['Makini Brice', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-currency-tubman/us-treasury-backs-away-from-plan-for-harriet-tubman-on-20-bill-next-year-idUSKCN1SS2ZK,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury will not introduce a redesigned $20 bill picturing escaped slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman next year as planned, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday.

In 2016, the Treasury Department said it would replace former President Andrew Jackson’s image on the front of the bill with that of Tubman by 2020, along with redesigns of the $5 and $10 bill.

President Donald Trump has called the inclusion of Tubman on the $20 bill an example of “pure political correctness.”

As a presidential candidate, Trump suggested Tubman would be better-suited for the $2 bill, a note that is not widely circulated.

Mnuchin said during a hearing with the House Financial Services committee he was focused on redesigning the bills to address counterfeiting issues, not making any changes to their imagery.

“We will meet the security feature redesign (goal) in 2020. The imagery feature will not be an issue that comes up until most likely 2026,” Mnuchin told lawmakers.

“It is not a decision that is likely to come until way past my term, even if I serve a second term for the president, so I am not focused on that at the moment,” Mnuchin added.

He declined to tell lawmakers in the hearing if he supported putting Tubman on the bill.

Tubman was born into slavery and grew up on a Maryland plantation, escaping in her late 20s. She returned to the South to help hundreds of slaves to freedom and later worked as a Union spy during the Civil War. She died in 1913.

The decision to put Tubman on the $20 bill followed months of outreach from the Treasury Department on which woman should be featured on the note.

There have been no women depicted on U.S. bills since former first lady Martha Washington, who was featured on the $1 silver certificate from 1891 to 1896, and Native American woman Pocahontas, who was included in a group image on the $20 bill from 1865 to 1869.

Other women, including Native American interpreter Sacagawea, suffragist Susan B. Anthony and author and activist Helen Keller have been featured on coins.

Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, has been criticized for his ownership of slaves and treatment of American Indians. In the redesign announced in 2016, he would have remained on the back of the $20 bill."
DHS press secretary to leave post for position at State Department,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/22/politics/dhs-press-secretary-leaving-for-state-department/index.html,"(CNN) Department of Homeland Security press secretary Tyler Q. Houlton is leaving his position at the end of the week after nearly two years delivering the public message for a department that has been at the center of the Trump administration's focus on immigration and many of its controversial policies.

Houlton's last day at DHS is Friday and he is expected to remain in the administration, taking a position as a senior adviser at the State Department. CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.

His departure from the department is the latest in a wave of changes at DHS headquarters, including at top leadership positions, stemming from the forced resignation last month of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

The departures included the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as a leadership shakeup at US Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration.

After Nielsen left the department, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan was appointed as acting secretary, bringing a number of CBP staff with him to headquarters.

The Energy 202: EPA blocks a dozen products containing pesticides thought harmful to bees,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/22/the-energy-202-epa-blocks-a-dozen-products-containing-pesticides-thought-harmful-to-bees/5ce46c34a7a0a46b92a3fd6a/,"THE LIGHTBULB

The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.

The Trump administration's action was welcome news to some environmentalists. “Certainly we have a ways to go,” said George Kimbrell, legal director at the nonprofit advocacy group Center for Food Safety, whose lawsuit prompted the EPA’s action. “But it's an important first step in acknowledging the harm they cause.”

The EPA has pulled other neonics from market before, agency spokesman John Konkus said in an email. But close observers of the agency say such actions are rare.

“For the EPA to pull a previously registered pesticide is a pretty major step,” said Mark Winston, a professor of apiculture and social insects at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C. “It’s not something they do very often.”

The decision follows five years of litigation in which the beekeepers and environmentalists pressed the agency to mount a response to the use of neonics as regulators in Europe and Canada have taken steps toward banning the chemicals.

Finally, at the end of 2018, three agribusinesses — Bayer, Syngenta and Valent — agreed to let the EPA pull from shelves the 12 pesticide products used by growers ranging from large-scale agricultural businesses to home gardeners. The legal settlement also compels the EPA to analyze the impacts of the entire neonic class on endangered species.

Two of the pesticide makers, Bayer and Valent, say their products are tested and safe to use, noting that the environmentalists and beekeepers won their case on the technical grounds that the EPA did not follow the right steps under the Endangered Species Act when registering their products.

“Neonicotinoids are rigorously tested before going to market to ensure they can be used safely and effectively,” said Steve Tatum, a spokesman for Valent, which makes four of the delisted products.

Bayer noted its two products targeted by the EPA action are not sold in the United States. But spokesman Darren Wallis added: “Growers rely on these critical pest-management tools because of their performance against destructive pests, as well as their favorable human and environmental safety profile.”

Concern over neonics has grown since 2006, when beekeepers first started witnessing the sudden and mysterious collapse of honeybee hives across the nation.

Researchers have shown the compounds to be harmful to bees in laboratory tests. But they have had less luck pinning down the pesticides’ effects on beekeepers’ colonies when they go about their work pollinating apple orchards and other farms.

In his second term Barack Obama, who had earlier approved installing a beehive on the South Lawn of the White House, launched an initiative to promote the health of honeybees and other pollinators.

But Rebecca Riley, legal director of the nature program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that the agency has failed often in the past to adequately consider the potential impact of its pesticide approvals on endangered animals — something every federal agency is supposed to do.

“EPA for years has been ignoring this requirement of the law,” she said.

That has led to a number of lawsuits, such as one the NRDC filed in 2017, asking a federal court to vacate the registrations of nearly 100 products that contain one of several insecticides that are harmful to various bees, butterflies, birds and insects. That case remains unresolved, even as the separate Center for Food Safety case led EPA to pull some pesticides from the market.

“This is a win for both the rule of law and also for bees, birds and other wildlife impacted by these pesticides,” Riley said of the latest case. “But the reality is there are hundreds of pesticide products on the market. So, this is important … but it does not get rid of the danger.”

— EPA doesn't send rep to hearing: Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to send a representative to testify during a hearing about a Trump administration proposal to roll back Obama-era mercury regulations. “I am continually frustrated and surprised by the administration's refusal to send witnesses to Congress,” she said. “And the EPA's refusal to show up today is just another example of the efforts to block Congress from performing its oversight functions. And so we're going to have to move forward, but it would be really helpful if we had the agencies here to help us.”

Jorjani advanced despite objections from Democrats including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who criticized the nominee during Tuesday’s panel meeting. “It concerns me Mr. Jorjani has spent the past two years he served as acting solicitor overturning prior interpretations of our public lands laws in a manner that is out of step with the congressional intent,” Manchin said in a statement. “The Solicitor must uphold the law above all else—above party, politics, and ideology. That was not the sense I got from Mr. Jorjani’s responses to our questions.”

Among the charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images legal DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

Story Continued Below

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez target Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over Sears bankruptcy,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Kevin Breuninger Lauren Hirsch', 'Kevin Breuninger', 'Lauren Hirsch']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/23/warren-aoc-target-treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin-over-sears-bankruptcy.html,"Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren gestures as she speaks during a campaign stop at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia on May 16, 2019.

Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., are targeting Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, raising questions about his time on Sears Holdings' board of directors and his relationship with the troubled company's former CEO, Eddie Lampert.

Mnuchin, who was Lampert's roommate at Yale University, was on the Sears board until December 2016, after President-elect Donald Trump picked him to join the incoming Cabinet.

Under Lampert, who led Sears from 2013 to 2018, the company closed more than 3,500 stores, shed some of its most valuable assets, including Lands' End, and laid off thousands. Sears filed for bankruptcy in October. Lampert bought Sears through an affiliate of his hedge fund ESL Investments, saving it from total liquidation.

In a four-page letter sent Thursday morning, Warren and Ocasio-Cortez asked Mnuchin a series of questions about his advisory role in Lampert's decisions.

In a video on Twitter announcing the letter to Mnuchin, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the secretary as ""a walking example of what happens when rich and powerful people put other rich and powerful people into power.""

Workers ""deserve a Treasury secretary who fights for them,"" Warren said in the video, ""not someone who spent a decade raking in cash for himself at the expense of hundreds of thousands of Sears employees.""

The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the letter from Warren and Ocasio-Cortez. ESL declined to comment."
Veterans Affairs is changing for the better,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/veterans-affairs-is-changing-for-the-better,"President Abraham Lincoln once said, “I am not concerned that you have fallen — I am concerned that you arise.”

Like any large organization, the Department of Veterans Affairs has seen its share of problems.

But under President Trump’s leadership, the VA is living up to Lincoln’s ideals by finding ways to fix those problems from past administrations.

When we realized our claim-appeals process was complex and inefficient, we worked with veterans service organizations, Congress, and the president to draft and pass a new law designed to fix it and put veterans first.

We launched a 24/7 White House VA hotline to help veterans cut through red tape and serve as an important feedback mechanism that lets agency leaders identify trends, spot problems more quickly, and drive improvements across the department.

And after Trump promised to give veterans more healthcare choices, we worked with Congress to do just that by passing the Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks, or MISSION, Act, which will consolidate our community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that puts veterans at the center of their healthcare decisions.

But perhaps the best example of VA’s continuous improvement on behalf of veterans is the progress we’ve made in expanding accessibility to, and quality of, the healthcare we deliver.

When it comes to access, a January study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that by 2017, VA had significantly shorter wait times for primary care, cardiology, and dermatology than private doctors. The study said the data it collected is “further supporting the finding that access to care has improved over time within the VA.”

That improvement came even as the VA was steadily seeing more patients.

In December, a Dartmouth study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that care at the VA was “significantly better” than the care found in non-VA facilities in 14 of 15 categories. “We found that VHA hospitals provided the best care in most referral regions and rarely provided the worst care,” the study found.

Our focus on customer service is part of the reason for these improvements. Our Veterans Experience Office is constantly assessing our performance and giving us the feedback we need to identify and resolve problems.

That office has been so successful that the Trump administration is using it as a model to develop customer service strategies across the entire government. This summer, lessons learned at the VA will be used to develop customer service plans at more than two dozen major federal agencies.

The cornerstone of our commitment to improving customer service is our willingness to acknowledge that things aren’t perfect and that change is a good thing. That’s the attitude we have as we prepare to undergo the biggest transition in our history: implementing the MISSION Act.

Under that law, which we’ll start implementing on June 6, our community care programs will be streamlined into a single program, and veterans will be able to more easily access outside care when necessary or when VA care is simply too far away.

This landmark change won’t supplant VA or cause the quality of its care to diminish. It will support our mission by improving its ability to get veterans the care they need when and where they need it.

This Memorial Day, I urge all Americans to remember the more than 1 million service members who gave their lives for our freedom in the several wars we’ve fought during the history of this country. At the VA, we are undergoing change at a rate that hasn’t been seen since the end of World War II to improve the lives of our living veterans.

We are welcoming these challenges as the best way to live up to the charge Lincoln laid on the nation after the Civil War — that we continue “to care for him who shall have borne the battle.”

He jokingly tells business leaders at a reception in Tokyo: ""Maybe that's why you like me so much.""

Trump also is promoting the U.S. under his leadership. He says ""there's never been a better time"" to invest or do business in America, and he urges corporate leaders to come.

What stands nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall and weighs between 60 and 70 pounds (27 and 32 kilograms)?

It's the much-ballyhooed trophy that President Donald Trump plans to present to the winner of a championship sumo wrestling match in Tokyo on Sunday.

The White House says the ""President's Cup"" is about 54 inches (137 centimeters) tall and weighs 60-70 pounds (27-32 kilograms).

Trump arrived in Japan on Saturday on a state visit as the guest of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is taking Trump to the sumo match on Sunday.

The president has said that he finds sumo to be ""fascinating"" and that the trophy will be U.S.-made.

Trump will also meet Japan's new emperor on Monday, becoming the first head of state to do so.

President Donald Trump is needling Japan over the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance as he kicks off a state visit to the country.

Trump is speaking at a reception with Japanese and American business leaders at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tokyo after arriving in the country.

He says the U.S. and Japan ""are hard at work"" negotiating a bilateral trade agreement, but is pointing to the gap.

He says: ""I would say that Japan has had a substantial edge for many, many years, but that's OK ... maybe that's why you like us so much.""

Trump is also making a pitch to the business leaders to invest more in the U.S.

And he says the relationship between the two countries has never been better.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump were greeted by Japan's minister of foreign affairs, the U.S. ambassador to Japan and other officials Saturday at Tokyo's Haneda Airport.

Trump was busy tweeting as Air Force One neared Japan for the four-day visit.

He declared the dawn of a new ""Age of Enlightenment"" as he talked up his escalating trade dispute with China.

He said that: ""The real trade war began 30 years ago, and we lost. This is a bright new Age, the Age of Enlightenment. We don't lose anymore!""

President Donald Trump has arrived in Japan for a state visit that will make him the first world leader to meet the country's new emperor.

Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived aboard Air Force One after a 14-hour journey.

The visit is part of a continuing charm offensive by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that analysts say has spared Japan from far more debilitating retaliatory action by Trump.

The president has refused to lift the threat of slapping potentially devastating U.S. tariffs on imports of Japanese autos and auto parts on national security grounds.

U.S. tariffs against Japanese aluminum and steel remain.

A relatively strong earthquake rattled Tokyo just before President Donald Trump's arrival Saturday but there was no danger of a tsunami.

Japan's Meteorological Agency said the quake, registering magnitude 5.1, struck in Chiba, just south of Tokyo, at 3:20 p.m., about 40 kilometers (24 miles) underground. Trump was to arrive two hours later.

The agency said there was no danger of a tsunami from the inland quake.

The earthquake rattled dozens of cities, including Tokyo, where many reporters who arrived before the president's visit felt the movement.

Japan is ready to roll out the newest phase of its charm offensive targeting President Donald Trump as it welcomes him on a state visit tailor-made to his whims and ego. This comes as Japan remains under the threat of potentially devastating U.S. tariffs on autos

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is offering high honors, golf and the chance to present a ""Trump Cup"" at a sumo wrestling championship. Abe, arguably Trump's closest friend on the world stage, will continue a yearslong campaign that so far appears to have spared Japan from far more debilitating U.S. actions.

The stakes are high. U.S. tariffs could cripple Japan's auto industry, while North Korea remains a destabilizing threat in the region."
GOP lawmakers lay out border security proposals for DHS,https://thehill.com,[],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/445336-gop-lawmakers-lay-out-border-security-proposals-for-dhs,"A group of House conservatives sent a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan Thursday that outlined border security policies they hope the department will enact.

“Recent DHS statistics on the number of arrivals at our southern border are clear proof that what is currently being done, is not enough,"" the group wrote.

The letter noted that two weeks ago U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost told the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration that, ""as of March 31, 2019, 361,087 migrants have been apprehended between the points of entry (POEs) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, representing a 108 percent increase over the same time in FY 2018.”

“Current projections are that more than 1 million people will have crossed our southern border illegally this year. Our constituents, the American public, are confounded as to why more is not being done by your Department,” the letter said.

Proposals include expanding a training program for border patrol agents to conduct fear interviews, where an undocumented immigrant is referred to an asylum officer if they express fear of returning to their home country.

Other proposals include limiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement's parole policy, limiting work authorization to only those whose asylum applications have been approved, increasing asylum fees and terminating the Flores settlement agreement.

“As the President continues to show leadership on this issue, we strongly encourage you to exercise the same manner of enthusiasm for fixing this crisis,” the letter says. “Included in this letter are proposals that would undoubtedly slow the surge at the border and provide context for long term immigration solutions.”

The group of immigration hard-liners also called for a third country agreement to be negotiated to allow undocumented immigrants to be relocated to another country that didn’t pose a threat in addition to enforcing “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which would require individuals from Central America to remain in Mexico while they await their immigration hearings."
Treasury Department says IRS memo doesn’t actually mean anything,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/treasury-department-says-irs-memo-has-nothing-to-do-with-trumps-taxes-ccd5ed755912/,"The Treasury Department said Wednesday that a leaked IRS memo interpreted by some as saying that the agency must release President Donald Trump’s tax returns to Congress has been misinterpreted, and that previous guidance barring making the documents public remains in force.

The existence of the memo was first reported by The Washington Post, which published it online Tuesday night. It states that the law “does not allow [Treasury Secretary Mnuchin] to exercise discretion in disclosing the information provided the statutory conditions are met” and specifies that his argument that Congress has no legislative reason for demanding the returns is flawed.

“[The] only basis for the agency’s refusal to comply with a committee’s subpoena would be the invocation of the doctrine of executive privilege,” it reads.

On Wednesday, a Treasury spokesperson said in an email that the department had not “seen any such memo” but maintained the analysis therein would not undermine previous guidance from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).

“Neither the Secretary nor senior Treasury leadership has seen any such memo,” the spokesperson said. “Regardless, the analysis described to us does not appear to address the constitutional impediments preventing Treasury from disclosing the requested tax information. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has reviewed those Constitutional issues and advised the Treasury that it may not produce the requested private tax return information.”

The department issued a similar response to the Post on Tuesday, stating that Mnuchin was not beholden to the newly unearthed memo and was simply “following a legal analysis from the Justice Department that he ‘may not produce the requested private tax return information’.”

Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, previously requested the Treasury Department turn over six years of Trump’s tax returns as part of a larger inquiry into the president’s finances, giving officials an initial deadline of April 10 to produce the documents. Mnuchin failed to meet that and all subsequent deadlines, most recently ignoring a subpoena for the documents.

According to Mnuchin, the Treasury Department conferred with Justice Department lawyers on the issue, and was instructed that the committee “lacked legitimate legislative purpose” to request the returns.

“[The] Department is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information,” Mnuchin wrote.

During a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee earlier on Wednesday, the secretary addressed that OLC guidance once more, reiterating the Treasury Department’s stance that the recently discovered IRS memo — which he maintained he had not seen — did not invalidate the previous instruction.

“To the best of my recollection I don’t ever recall seeing this memo. The first I heard of this was when we got an inquiry from The Washington Post,” he said.

“What I’ve been briefed on … is this issue is different than the legal analysis that we’ve done,” he continued. “Of course we will look at it and make sure, but there’s no smoking gun here. We did a very thorough legal analysis with the Department of Justice. This goes to the courts, the courts will decide and determine.”

Legal experts have said the OLC’s claim that Mnuchin has no reason to release Trump’s taxes is shaky at best, and that the arguments outlined in the memo are strong.

“The memo writer’s interpretation is that the IRS has no wiggle room on this,” Daniel Hemel, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, told the Post on Tuesday. “Mnuchin is saying the House Ways and Means Committee has not asserted a legitimate legislative purpose. The memo says they don’t have to assert a legitimate legislative purpose — or any purpose at all.”

Instead, Hemel told the Post, the memo “suggests a split over Trump’s returns between career staffers at the IRS and political appointees at that agency and the Treasury Department.”

It’s unclear whether the memo will sway Treasury’s top brass on the issue, or if it will cause Trump to invoke executive privilege, as the memo states, to keep his returns private.

During Wednesday’s hearing Mnuchin said he hoped the courts would rule on the issue correctly.

“I would hope — we all hope — that we get to the right conclusion on what the right law is here,” he said."
EPA Moves to Set Limit for Rocket Fuel Chemical in Water at Rate Scientists Say Is Unsafe,https://www.usnews.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-05-24/trumps-epa-moves-to-set-limit-for-rocket-fuel-chemical-in-drinking-water-at-rate-scientists-say-is-unsafe,"The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday for the first time proposed an enforceable drinking water standard for a chemical found in rocket fuel, but the suggested limit is significantly higher than what the agency previously determined to be safe.

It suggested a maximum contaminant level of 56 parts-per-billion for perchlorate, which would be the first legally-binding drinking water standard set by the EPA since 1996.

Perchlorate is commonly used in rocket fuel and fireworks. It has been linked to thyroid problems by a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said that more research on the health effects of the chemical is needed.

In 2009, EPA established a non-enforceable lifetime health advisory for perchlorate at 15 parts-per-billion, ""which is a concentration of perchlorate in drinking water that is not expected to cause any adverse noncarcinogenic effects for a lifetime of exposure,"" the agency said at the time.

Two years later, EPA determined that perchlorate needed to be regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

Now, however, EPA is leaving open the option to reverse course and not regulate the chemical at all.

The agency is also taking public comments on three other regulatory options – one that would set a higher limit, one that would set a lower limit and one that would say the chemical doesn't need a limit at all.

Erik Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said the proposed limit of 56 parts-per-billion ""is enough to make you sick – literally.""

If the standard is adopted, ""millions of Americans will be at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of this toxic chemical in their drinking water,"" he said in a statement.

NRDC previously sued EPA to set a standard on perchlorate, which the group said has been detected in the drinking water systems of up to 16.6 million Americans.

""This is another Trump administration gift to polluters and water utilities that have lobbied to be off the hook for cleaning up the problem,"" Olson said.

Environmental Working Group, a public health advocacy organization, echoed Olson's comments, noting that children and fetuses can be particularly vulnerable to the chemical.

""The science on perchlorate is very clear: It harms infants and the developing fetus,"" said Olga Naidenko, a senior science advisor for children's environmental health at the Environmental Working Group. ""Perchlorate can cause irreparable damage to both cognitive and physical development.""

Several states have advisory levels or health-based goals for perchlorate, and at least two have enforceable limits. Massachusetts set the first drinking water standard for the chemical at 2 parts-per-billion, and California set another at 6 parts-per-billion.
