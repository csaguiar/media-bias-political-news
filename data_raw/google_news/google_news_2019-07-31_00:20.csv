California Requires Trump Tax Returns Under New Election Law,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Jennifer Medina', 'Annie Karni']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/politics/california-trump-tax-returns.html,"“The Constitution is clear on the qualifications for someone to serve as president and states cannot add additional requirements on their own,” Mr. Murtaugh said. “The bill also violates the First Amendment right of association since California can’t tell political parties which candidates their members can or cannot vote for in a primary election.”

The Trump campaign, which has been closely tracking ballot access issues for months and coordinating with the White House Counsel’s Office, is likely to respond with a lawsuit, according to an official with the campaign. That suit could potentially include a number of plaintiffs, including the Republican National Committee, the California Republican Party and the Trump campaign, but the official warned that nothing about a suit had been finalized.

Nearly a dozen similar bills are active in other states, including New York, New Jersey, Washington and Pennsylvania, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The vast majority of presidential nominees in the last several decades have released their tax returns, with the exception of Gerald Ford in 1976. Mr. Brown and his Republican opponents declined to release their returns during the governor’s races in 2010 and 2014.

Mr. Brown warned in his veto message that such legislation would be a slippery slope.

“A qualified candidate’s ability to appear on the ballot is fundamental to our democratic system,” he wrote. “For that reason, I hesitate to start down a road that well might lead to an ever escalating set of differing state requirements for presidential candidates.”

After Democratic state senators introduced the same legislation this year, aides to Mr. Newsom asked the sponsors to add the requirements for candidates for governor as well.

“This is a huge step forward for financial transparency from people who are trying to become the most powerful person in the world,” said Scott Wiener, the state senator from San Francisco who sponsored the bill. “It is absolutely not just written for Donald Trump. This is for every Democratic and Republican and presidential candidate until the end of time.”"
Dem lawmaker who disrupted Trump speech has history of anti-Israel remarks,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-lawmaker-who-disrupted-trump-speech-has-history-of-anti-israel-remarks,"The Virginia Democratic lawmaker who disrupted President Trump’s speech in Jamestown on Tuesday has a history of making anti-Israel remarks on social media.

Ibraheem Samirah, a Virginia state delegate, interrupted Trump’s event commemorating the 400th anniversary of the first legislative assembly in the U.S. by shouting: “You can’t send us back! Virginia is our home!”

TRUMP CLAIMS BALTIMORE RESIDENTS 'THANKING' HIM FOR TAKING ON CUMMINGS, EXPOSING 'CORRUPTION'

Samirah’s protest was apparently in response to Trump’s comments about the “Squad” earlier this month, when he suggested that Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,” and then return to show how it's done.

But Samirah, a Palestinian-American, has his own history of controversial comments—specifically related to Israel.

The Washington Post, in February, reported on a series of Samirah’s social media posts from 2014 that have since been deleted.

In one Facebook post in 2014, Samirah shared an angry letter by musician Brian Eno who claimed that funding Israel was like supporting the Ku Klux Klan.

“I’d say worse,” Samirah wrote, sharing the letter. “But I’ll go along with Eno on this one.”

In another post from 2014, after former Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon died, Samirah wrote: “Ariel Sharon, burn. Burn a million times for every innocent soul you killed. Hell is excited to have you.”

Samirah also reportedly posted comments about Israeli teenagers, sharing an article about how Israel uses social media and dating apps to “legitimize murder,” writing: “Most Israeli teenagers not only want to cover up the murders in their name, but they have young urges that need to be released somehow! Tinder’s perfect for that.”

Samirah, who was a former volunteer for Tlaib, also is reportedly connected to multiple anti-Semitic organizations.

After disrupting the president’s speech on Tuesday, Samirah tweeted a statement, saying that he interrupted because “nobody’s racism and bigotry should be excused for the sake of being polite.”

“The Man is unfit for office and unfit to partake in a celebration of democracy, representation, and our nation’s history of immigrants,” Samirah tweeted, attaching a full statement.

Meanwhile, the president blasted the mainstream media for focusing “100 percent of the time” on the protester, rather than his speech.

“You gave the protester 100 percent of the time, not one word of the speech—that’s why we were there,” Trump said when he returned to the White House Tuesday. “He didn’t look so good to me, but you gave him 100 percent—you often do that, okay.”

'SQUAD' MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB ONCE CALLED FOR TRUMP'S DEPORTATION

The president’s speech focused on the first legislative assembly founded in 1619 in Jamestown, Va.

“That is why, after 400 years of glorious American democracy, we have returned here to this place to declare to all the world that the United States of America and the great Commonwealth of Virginia are just getting started,” Trump said in his speech. “Our future is bigger, bolder, better, and brighter than ever before.”"
"Fact check: No, African Americans are not happy with Trump",https://www.cnn.com,['Daniel Dale'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/politics/fact-check-african-americans-trump-approval/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that African Americans are so delighted with his attacks on the city of Baltimore and US congressman Elijah Cummings, an African American, that they are calling him at the White House in large numbers to thank him.

He also claimed that African Americans are generally happy with his performance as president.

""What I've done for African Americans, no president, I would say, has done. Now, I'll say this: they are so happy, because I get the calls,"" he told reporters as he left for a speech in Virginia that was boycotted by black state lawmakers. ""They are so happy at what I've been able to do in Baltimore and other Democratic-run, corrupt cities.""

He continued later: ""The African American people have been calling the White House. They have never been so happy as what a president has done. Not only the lowest unemployment in history for African Americans, not only opportunity zones for, really, the biggest beneficiary the inner city, and not only criminal justice reform. But they're so happy that I pointed out the corrupt politics of Baltimore. It's filthy dirty. It's so horrible. And they are happy as hell.""

Since the controversy over Trump's comments about Baltimore and Cummings is too new to be captured by most of the available polling data, we can't definitively fact-check Trump's claim about African Americans' views on these remarks -- though it's worth noting that Trump has a history of inventing nonexistent phone calls and making dubious claims about people expressing gratitude him in private conversations.

Trump Goads China and Plays Down Chances of a Trade Deal Before 2020,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Ana Swanson', 'Jeanna Smialek']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/business/trump-china-trade.html,"Negotiators from the two countries will try to bridge their divisions as talks begin in earnest in Shanghai on Wednesday. But the deep divisions between the countries suggest another protracted round of talks may be needed before any agreement can be reached.

The text that the two countries have been negotiating is highly secret. But American and Chinese negotiators appear to still have significant differences of opinion over how China should enshrine changes, including new protections for American intellectual property in its laws and regulations, how many American products China would agree to buy as a result of the deal, and how many of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods would remain in place after an agreement is struck.

The president continues to insist that he faces no immediate deadline to reach an agreement. On Tuesday, he repeated his claim that the United States economy is benefiting from the billions of dollars his tariffs are generating and that all the pain of the trade war was being felt on the Chinese side. That view is not supported by businesses and economists, who say Mr. Trump’s trade war is starting to take a toll on the United States economy.

Chinese leaders have also insisted that the country can withstand the pressure of the trade war as it waits for a better deal from the Trump administration, or another president.

In reality, both economies are presenting more of a mixed picture, with the effects of the trade war clearly being felt, but not so intensely that their leaders can’t ignore it.

The Chinese economy is decelerating gradually, but further increases in the country’s already giant infrastructure spending have cushioned the shock. Chinese exports to the United States have fallen 8.5 percent in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, while exports to the rest of the world have been up slightly.

Sales of cars and other big-ticket purchases in China had tumbled sharply last autumn when Mr. Trump broadened his tariffs to $250 billion a year of goods from $50 billion. But Chinese consumer confidence now seems to have flattened at a level best described as still very glum, but not rapidly deteriorating further."
If we had a normal US President...,https://www.cnn.com,['Frida Ghitis'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/opinions/if-we-had-a-normal-us-president-russia-china-ghitis/index.html,"Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist.

(CNN) In another time, the President of the United States might have called an urgent press conference on Monday morning -- making sure he could command the world's attention -- and issued a stern warning that violent repression of peaceful protesters is intolerable.

After all, what we saw this weekend in Moscow and Hong Kong were alarming signs that a wave of more brutal repression is looming. The regimes in Moscow and Beijing have sent notice that they are about to crush peaceful, popular movements. This should alarm the US president and produce an urgent response.

Instead, President Donald Trump woke up Monday morning prepared to stoke racist sentiment across the United States, tweeting a new barrage of inflammatory messages against prominent African American figures in what has become a familiar pattern : racist tweets from the President, widespread condemnation by the public, doubling down by the President. Trump is making racism his trademark, spending his time energizing racists while decisively removing America from the moral high ground.

Perhaps not coincidentally, this is happening at the time when democracy activists most desperately need a show of support. They could use a strong statement from Washington telling the leaders in Russia and China that the world is watching. That their actions could have consequences. That, at the very least, their position on the global stage is teetering. That the American people stand on the side of those demanding justice.

Consider what happened in Russia, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting for the right to vote after authorities brazenly disqualified opposition candidates for an upcoming municipal election. President Vladimir Putin's approval has been sliding, discontent growing, and the largest protests in years have taken place, even though Russian law now makes it nearly impossible to obtain a protest permit.

This weekend, police sent rows of menacing riot police to break down a peaceful protest, arresting more than a thousand people in Moscow.

Most alarming is what happened to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose very life may well depend on whether the rest of the world makes it clear to the Kremlin that, if he is killed, there will be consequences.

Navalny was arrested earlier in the week after calling for a demonstration. Then, suddenly, on Sunday, he was rushed to a hospital with what the hospital called an ""acute allergic reaction."" He does not suffer from allergies. The news immediately brought to mind the fate of other Kremlin critics who have faced, shall we call it, biochemical issues.

Recall the horrific disfigurement of former Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian politician who dared to challenge Putin's preferred candidate in 2004. He narrowly escaped death after being poisoned with dioxin. He believes the Kremlin was behind the assassination attempt.

The Kremlin stands accused of poisoning other Putin critics, even exiled ones, including Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium poisoning blamed on Putin by a UK inquest, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter, poisoned in Salisbury, England. British authorities have accused two Russian men of carrying out the hit, saying they belong to Russian military intelligence. The men say they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury.

Other Kremlin critics have died mysterious deaths. The popular politician and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, shot in front of the Kremlin, former ally Boris Berezovsky, who supposedly killed himself, and many, many courageous journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists counts 28 Russian journalists killed since 2000, the year Putin rose to power.

Navalny's personal doctor says he has been taken back out of the hospital into prison against her advice. She thinks he has been poisoned. Perhaps it was a warning, perhaps an attempt on his life. Navalny, back in prison on Monday, suggested he may have been poisoned while in police custody.

A well-articulated warning from Washington might just save him and others.

A warning to Beijing is just as urgent. For weeks the people of Hong Kong have waged peaceful protests against a government that is supposed to be independent of China under the ""one country, two systems"" model agreed when the territory reverted to China from the UK.

Protests started against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, where the legal system is beholden to the Communist Party-controlled regime. The protests have been massive, bringing out as many as two million people in a territory of just seven million, underscoring how widespread and intense the distrust of China is.

Beijing has been growing impatient, and the signs are nothing short of ominous.

Last week, the spokesman for the Chinese military, Wu Qian, issued a chilling reminder that China's military forces could be quickly deployed inside Hong Kong if the territory's authorities request it. Then he described the protests in a way that made very clear Beijing is running out of patience. The protesters' behavior, Wu declared, ""is intolerable.""

That was Wednesday. On Sunday, Hong Kong police clad in riot gear launched a harsh crackdown against demonstrators. CNN's Anna Coren, in the midst of the mayhem , was visibly horrified. The protesters were completely peaceful, she said.

On Monday, China issued its sternest warning yet, accusing pro-democracy protesters of committing "" evil and criminal acts .""

One shudders to think what might come next at the hands of the regime that massacred protesters at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.

When the tanks rolled in Tiananmen, then-President George H.W. Bush wasted no time publicly condemning the regime, as have other American presidents who spoke firmly and decisively against repression.

Sure, America has failed many times, and its own history is far from immaculate, but the words of a credible American president can help draw the moral lines. It may or may not stay the hand of a tyrant, it may or may not prevent a massacre. But at the very least it helps clarify what is and is not legitimate conduct in our time. Even if it fails to stop a catastrophe in progress, it may give second thoughts to another tinpot tyrant watching from a distance.

How tragic for America and for the world that Washington today is dominated by a President who thinks nothing matters more than his personal fate and believes inciting racist hatreds at home tops the national agenda."
EPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455386-epa-proposal-scraps-limits-on-coal-plant-waste,"The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed scrapping restrictions on arsenic-laden waste from coal-fired power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lifting some regulations on coal ash, the residue left after burning coal, which is filled with hazardous substances that can leach into the water supply and cause health problems.

“I can say without hesitation that this is an extremely dangerous proposal that will do lasting harm to communities near coal ash reuse sites and coal ash waste piles,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice.

Coal ash is used in a variety of ways, largely as a replacement for soil. It can be used to create level ground for construction projects or sprinkled over landfills as a protective cover.

But coal ash has been deemed responsible for contaminating water with arsenic, which is linked with some types of cancer.

The latest proposal from the EPA would eliminate restrictions from 2015 that limited coal ash use to 12,400 tons per site.

The Trump administration proposal would allow projects to use as much coal ash as they want but would have to file a demonstration that shows the project won’t cause harm if it’s close to certain features like groundwater or wetlands.

But Evans said that’s not a realistic safeguard.

“That demonstration doesn’t have to be defended to any regulatory agency or be posted for public notice or be written by any engineer or environmental professional,” Evans said. “You’ve got a fairly meaningless demo having to be created.”

The EPA said the regulations would help spur “beneficial use” — the term for new uses for what would otherwise be industry waste.

“Today the Agency is proposing sensible changes that will improve the coal ash regulations and continue to encourage appropriate beneficial use,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerJudge cuts Roundup cancer case payout from billion to million Automakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California Watchdog to probe potential interference by Interior officials in releasing public records MORE said in a statement. “These proposed changes will further responsible management of coal ash while protecting human health and the environment.”

The proposal includes some features that would make reporting requirements more accessible to the public, but environmentalists ultimately see the move as a bow to industry.

“Despite compelling and damning scientific evidence highlighting the harm to groundwater from coal ash, and court victories by community groups requiring the EPA to strengthen the 2015 rule, Wheeler is giving this gift to his former employers at the cost of public health,” Earthjustice and the Sierra Club said in a statement. “It is a disgrace to everything the EPA stands for, and we will do everything in our power to stop it.”"
US Defense Department to Develop Blockchain Cybersecurity Shield,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/us-department-of-defense-is-developing-a-blockchain-cybersecurity-shield,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is looking to forge a blockchain cybersecurity shield.

In a report published on July 12 titled Digital Modernization Strategy, the DoD outlined several ways to advance the nation’s digital defenses. This includes the integration of cloud and quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and improved communications through distributed ledgers.

In fact, DARPA, the research wing of the Department is already experimenting with the technology “to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform,” to secure messaging and process transactions, reports Decrypt.

Specifically, blockchain may be deployed between units and headquarters as well as intelligence officers and the Pentagon. As part of the Digital Identity Management program, the agency may also issue a digital token that authenticates an agent’s identity.

The DoD is also experimenting with the technology to facilitate the creation of an unhackable code to secure its databases.

As part of the second Cryptographic Modernization program, in effect since 2000, the Department is replacing old hardware and cryptographic systems to meet the challenges of the improved computing power of the nation’s adversaries.

Citing the trustless, transparent, and immutable attributes of blockchain the Department writes:

“Blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.”

The shift from “low value to high-value work” is also part of the DoDs’ Big Data Platform (BDP), which will handle petabytes of data involved in a number of cross-agency projects. The platform “provides the ability to perform aggregation, correlation, historical trending,” and may perform pattern recognition to “predict attacks.”

Former State Dept. analyst says White House is 'undercutting evidence' by blocking climate change warning,https://www.cnn.com,['Devan Cole'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/politics/state-department-intelligence-official-white-house-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A State Department official who quit after he says the White House blocked his written testimony on climate change from being delivered to Congress says the Trump administration is ""undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions.""

""I take great pride in the many positive and productive interactions I had with senior officials in my 30 months in the Trump administration,"" Rod Schoonover wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday. ""But the decision to block the written testimony is another example of a well-established pattern in the Trump administration of undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions.""

Last month, the White House office of Legislative Affairs blocked Schoonover, who worked as an intelligence analyst for the department, from submitting written testimony to the House Intelligence Committee that offered major warnings ""on the national security implications of climate change,"" according to a report from The Washington Post citing several senior administration officials.

The written testimony Schoonover was prepared to submit, which warned that human-caused climate change could be ""possibly catastrophic,"" according to the Post, stood in marked contrast to the generally dismissive tone President Donald Trump has taken towards climate change and to recent remarks from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Tuesday.

State Department analyst who resigned in protest defends climate change research in op-ed,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/455352-state-department-analyst-who-resigned-in-protest-defends-climate,"A State Department analyst who resigned in protest earlier this month after the Trump administration blocked his written testimony on climate change, is defending the scientific evidence he said the administration didn’t want him to address.

The analyst, Rod Schoonover, wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday that the White House only permitted him to give a five-minute verbal summary on his 11-page testimony — which was not entered into the official record.

“In blocking the submission of the written testimony, the White House trampled not only on the scientific integrity of the assessment but on the analytic independence of an arm of the intelligence community. That’s why I recently resigned from the job I considered a sacred duty, and the institution I loved,” he added.

Schoonover uses the op-ed to explain his resignation, on which he had previously not commented publicly.

Moreover, he uses the platform as a chance to highlight the impending threat of human-induced climate change.

“The bottom line of written testimony was this: ‘Climate change will have wide-ranging implications for U.S. national security over the next 20 years.’....This conclusion was hardly new,” Schoonover said in the op-ed.

He cites “decades of scientific measurements” showing global temperatures rising and ocean water acidifying, leading to “well known” changes including increased frequency of heatwaves and rising sea levels and lesser-known impacts such as decreasing oceanic oxygen levels and the redistribution of species.

“These events do not arise in isolation but combine with existing social and political conditions and can disrupt societies and nations. They harm people directly or degrade the social, political, economic, agricultural, ecological or infrastructural systems that support them,” Schoonover said.

He said he welcomed the chance to present findings at the congressional hearing, especially to engage Republicans “because of the party’s historically strong support of other science and technology issues.”

“Previous closed-door discussions persuaded me that at least some Republican lawmakers were open to the argument that climate change was a national security concern. I believe that once one accepts that global temperatures are increasing, a fact that only the most ardent climate disbeliever rejects, the case for that fact’s relevance to nation security directly follows,” he said.

He said blocking the written testimony is “another example of a well-established pattern in the Trump administration of undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions.” Before the Trump administration, politics seldom interfered with Schoonover’s line of work and he said he appreciated the “apolitical” nature of his job.

“The intelligence community tries to deliver objective truth to decision makers — truth that persists irrespective of who occupies the White House,” he said.

Schoonover said the White House said the reason for blocking his testimony was because the “scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.”

In 2017, Trump pulled the country out of the international Paris climate accord. The U.S. is now the only nation not signed onto the landmark agreement.

Most 2020 candidates have made climate change a focus in their primary campaigns, and it will likely be a debated topic in the general election no matter who faces Trump.

Schoonover said grappling with the impacts of climate change “is too important to me to wait around for a possible change on these issues in a future administration.”

“We need to better understand and anticipate the challenges facing the nation and its partners,” he said. “Whatever my next step might be, I believe these issues remain critical, and I will try to continue this work going forward.”

Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

While DHS does not comment on specific employee personnel actions, a DHS official provided the following information.

""Over 20 years ago, we can confirm that there was an allegation and subsequent full investigation,"" the official said. ""The employee was afforded due process and since then, the employee has had an exemplary record being promoted throughout the ranks without ill effect.""

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day after the incident. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

""The United States Border Patrol often conducts reviews and assessments of programs and personnel assignments. During Chief Kevin Oaks’ tenure, the United States Border Patrol restructured several programs and divisions within the Headquarters element, resulting reassignments of multiple personnel and program responsibilities,"" the DHS official said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

“The Department is proud to include a member of the United States Border Patrol within the Department’s Office of Public Affairs,"" said Andrew Meehan, Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. ""Border Patrol agents have a unique and first-hand knowledge of the impact of the crisis on the southern border and continue to provide thoughtful guidance on how to communicate those challenges to the public.”"
EPA kills proposed Obama-era Pebble mine 'veto',https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455368-epa-kills-proposed-obama-era-pebble-mine-veto,"The Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday it will reverse an Obama-era decision to block a controversial Alaska mine project.

“After today’s action EPA will focus on the permit review process for the Pebble Mine project” Region 10 Administrator Chris Hladick said in a statement.

“The agency has worked closely with the Army Corps to engage with stakeholders and the public on this issue, which has resulted in an expansive public record, including specific information about the proposed mining project that did not exist in 2014,” Hladick added.

While the EPA is withdrawing the 2014 determination, which it wrote “was issued preemptively and is now outdated,” the withdrawal does not constitute an approval of the permit application or a determination in the permitting process.

“Instead, it allows EPA to continue working with the Corps to review the current permit application and engage in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process,” the statement reads.

"500K students could lose free meals to USDA food stamp changes, Rep. Bobby Scott says",https://www.cnn.com,"['Kate Sullivan', 'Lauren Fox']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/students-free-meals-usda-food-stamps-bobby-scott/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Rep. Bobby Scott says the US Department of Agriculture concealed data showing that its recent proposed changes to the food stamp program could result in more than 500,000 low-income students losing free meals.

In a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue , Scott, a Virginia Democrat who's the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, writes that the impact on school meal eligibility was not included in the Trump administration's formal proposal revising who qualifies for the food stamp program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Scott writes that ""the proposed rule will impact not only SNAP eligibility, but will also affect children's eligibility for school meal programs."" The program, Scott noted, ""allows schools to provide free meals to all students in high-poverty communities.""

The congressman writes that his committee's staff learned about the impact on school lunches in a phone briefing with USDA staff and requested that the department revise its proposal to include the estimate and restart the 60-day comment period.

He notes the USDA is required by law to include ""relevant scientific and technical findings"" in proposed rules and says the effect on school meals is an ""important technical finding that must be made public.""

Update: Border personnel taking 80 migrants to hospitals daily: DHS official,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-personnel-taking-800-migrants-to-hospitals-daily-dhs-official,"Federal law enforcement assigned to the U.S.-Mexico border are transporting approximately 80 sick migrants in federal custody to hospitals for medical care each day, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, incorrectly told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday morning Border Patrol agents and Office of Field Operations officers are transporting ""800"" people daily. A previous version of this story reflected Morgan's mistake.

A CBP spokeswoman who followed up with the Washington Examiner Tuesday afternoon said Morgan ""meant to say 80 people per day on average to the hospital"" after misspeaking during the hearing.

Morgan said the need for transportation, drivers, and law enforcement to stay with migrants while they are in a medical facility has affected the Department of Homeland Security agency's ability to patrol between the ports of entry.

""We are looking at $63 million dollars for continued medical assets and high risk support across the southwest border. That was included in the supplemental,"" Morgan said during a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday.

In March, the Washington Examiner reported CBP personnel had spent more than 49,000 hours facilitating medical trips and watching patients while they are in hospitals since January. The loss of agents working in law enforcement roles is equivalent to the 2,000 hours worked by 25 Border Patrol agents in a year.

DHS has diverted $45 million in operational funds to go toward medical costs over the past five years, according to data obtained by the Washington Examiner.

As of March, the U.S. Border Patrol had diverted $9 million in operational funding in fiscal year 2019, as it has done in each of the four previous years, to instead cover medical screenings and related services for thousands of immigrants.

CBP said it had “seen an increase in the numbers of apprehended individuals requiring medical assistance,"" but Morgan did not provide an update to the total number of hospital referrals Tuesday.

Anti-Tech Wave Grows with New Justice Department Antitrust Efforts,https://reason.com,"[""Andrea O'Sullivan"", 'Billy Binion', 'Lenore Skenazy', 'Mike Riggs', 'Scott Shackford', 'Jacob Sullum', 'Shikha Dalmia', 'Elizabeth Nolan Brown']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://reason.com/2019/07/30/anti-tech-wave-grows-with-new-justice-department-antitrust-efforts/,"The U.S. is moving against big tech in a big way. Last week, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a broad antitrust investigation into whether unnamed technology companies have engaged in anti-competitive activities. This is in addition to DOJ's joint antitrust efforts with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC); DOJ is tackling Apple and Google, while the FTC has Amazon and Facebook. The FTC formed a separate task force to monitor competition in the technology industry earlier this year. Oh yeah, and the House Judiciary Committee is sniffing around for Silicon Valley shenanigans, too.

So far, the DOJ has not named names. Since ""search, social media, and some retail services online"" were specifically mentioned, it's a good bet that Google, Facebook, and Amazon are among the targets. We can probably throw in the Apple App Store, as well.

We also don't know whether the investigations will be voluntary, or if DOJ will exert authority to compel discovery on heretofore unknown dirty deeds. So it's hard to say exactly what DOJ has up its sleeves.

But if the Trump administration's posture towards big tech is any indication, we should expect a fairly aggressive examination of possible anti-competitive actions.

During his nomination hearing, Attorney General Robert Barr stated that he wondered ""how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers"" and advocated for ""vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws to preserve competition."" In particular, Barr worries that large platforms enjoy network effects so substantial that ""particular sectors could essentially be subsumed into these networks.""

The writing was always on the Facebook Wall. It's true that until fairly recently, most technology companies had something of a neon halo about them. We used and enjoyed social media platforms every day, those harmless and amusing outlets for comradery and cat-posting. Amazon gave us great cheap junk, Apple had the coolest products. Google gave us, well, everything else.

But how the mighty fall. After a few bonkers elections and a mass awakening to just how all those ""free"" services make money, America now calls for tech companies' heads.

It's an illustration of general U.S. attitudes to antitrust. On paper, enforcers like the DOJ and FTC are only supposed to intervene when a firm restricts output and raises prices, or when it possesses an ""essential facility"" available nowhere else. In other words, officials should get involved where consumers are demonstrably harmed, as gauged by measurable economic outcomes like price increases or output restriction.

In practice, however, many call for firms to be broken up anytime we feel they are getting too big. We forget today, but at one point, the hot talk in tech was that MySpace and AOL were due for the antitrust treatment. Today, these names do not conjure images of anti-competitive activity because they were successfully competed against—by Facebook and Google. Yet their actions remain the same.

Under the ""market structure"" conception of antitrust, it's not so much about protecting consumers as it is about protecting competition—that is to say, protecting current and future competitors.

It's hard to argue, for instance, that Windows users were harmed by the free Internet Explorer browser that came preinstalled on their computers. Microsoft's aggressive behind-the-scenes campaign to convince vendors to snub alternative browsers didn't really affect user experience. If you wanted a different browser, you could just use IE to download another browser. But competitors like Netscape clearly were harmed by such structural defaults, which is why DOJ eventually intervened.

Microsoft was big and seemed unassailable. Of course, it wasn't, but not along the dimensions over which '90s antitrust regulators so agonized. The fall came, to regulators at least, out of nowhere: Apple's streamlined strategy and the open source operating system Linux dealt major blows to Microsoft's seemingly untouchable positions in the personal computing (hello, iPhone) and server markets. Browsers were the wrong battle—dirty as the fight may have been for poor Netscape—and today Microsoft browsers are considered a bit of a joke.

In a similar way, successes spelled trouble for tech titans. It was only a matter of time until they got big enough and unpopular enough to draw antitrust scrutiny. It's almost tautological: The most competitive companies in hindsight become the most ""anti-competitive."" (Is there a major company who got there by playing nice?) You can always find something to point to as an unfair and unbreakable barrier to competition.

It doesn't sound great to say you are breaking up firms to benefit other companies. Today, aggressive antitrust enforcement is couched in terms of ""innovation."" It's not that we are shoring up businesses that couldn't keep up. We are taking down today's titans so that they little guys can get a crack at them. With more breathing room, tomorrow's paradigm shifts can sooner take flight today. Some go so far as to claim that without the DOJ's antitrust case tying up Microsoft, Google would have never taken off.

The Justice Department's statements on their investigations hew to this new conception of antitrust as a harbinger of tomorrow's innovation. Its press release singles out practices that have ""reduced competition"" and ""stifled innovation"" for scrutiny. Last on that list, by the way, are activities that ""otherwise harmed consumers.""

We'll have to wait and see what the DOJ will dig up as evidence of anti-competitive behaviors. Perhaps they will discover some truly heinous deeds. Or maybe something fairly benign will be touted as proof that online platforms' gains were ill-gotten, or that their very size is on its face is bad for competition. After all, antitrust regulators will want to come up with something.

They walk a fine line. It's not hard to imagine scenarios where actions that are bad for competitors are also bad for consumers. Let's say Microsoft's browsers blocked users from downloading alternative options. That would clearly limit choice and competition, and would probably stall browser innovation as well. But it's not always the case that what makes competitors' jobs harder makes consumers' lives worse. Regulators should keep the distinctions clear.

The big guys are ready for a fight, and their lawyers are surely fashioning preemptive rebuttals to defend their most notorious business practices from antitrust affronts. It's how the game is played.

Should we expect these antitrust efforts to do much for innovation? If the past is any guide, the Davids that will take down our Goliaths are probably putting together their slingshots as we speak, far from the eyes of antitrust regulators. And then the next decade's Justice Department will puzzle over just how those new giants got where they are in the first place. After all, if they had actionable information on what the next major markets will be, they might be in a different line of work."
"Trump's trip to his Turnberry resort cost the State Department at least $233K, review finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/trump-turnberry-resort-cost-state-department-oig/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department spent at least $233,732 on President Donald Trump's July 2018 trip to his Turnberry resort in Scotland, according to a letter from the department's inspector general obtained by CNN.

The July 22 letter from Inspector General Steve Linick to Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland details only the costs that were paid by the State Department and not reimbursed. Among the costs were more than $42,000 in overtime, more than $111,000 in hotels, more than $28,000 in rental cars and more than $51,000 in temporary duty costs, according to the letter.

The OIG review was not able to determine how much the resort gained in profit from the visit. The State Department spent $728 on three rooms for two nights at the Trump-owned property. According to the letter, the department said they were used by the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, his wife and his chief of protocol. The department said that the Trump Turnberry's rate was ""the lowest of all the hotels being utilized for this VIP visit"" and offered ""a fair and reasonable rate to the Government,"" according to document cited in the letter.

The Hill was the first to report on Linick's letter.

The State Department OIG review was prompted by a call for investigation made by the three Democratic lawmakers shortly after the President's trip. They also requested an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. The department OIG did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Monday.

Is It Time to 'Pass the Torch?' The Generational Dilemma of the 2020 Democratic Primary,https://time.com,['Chris Wilson'],,,,https://time.com/5618238/democrats-age/,"About 15 minutes into the second night of the first Democratic Presidential Debate, as decorum was rapidly fraying, 38-year-old California Rep. Eric Swalwell, who has since left the race, slipped in the first jab in what became an extended pummeling of former Vice President Joe Biden:

I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said, “it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans.” That candidate was then-Senator Joe Biden. Joe Biden was right when he said it was time the pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago. He’s still right today.

If one of the 20 candidates who will appear in the second round of Democratic debates Tuesday and Wednesday wins the presidency next November, the hand-off of that torch could be anything from a backward pass to a flaming slingshot across the decades. More than 40 years separate the youngest candidate, 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, and the eldest, 77-year-old Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (who, along with Biden, 76, is older than President Donald Trump and every living president except Jimmy Carter.)

Even if one agrees that it is time for a new generation to assume power, the question remains: Which generation?

Here’s a lineup of how the 20 candidates cluster by age compared to one another and to past presidents, spanning four generations by the common definitions from the Pew Research Center.

What stands out most is that Trump and former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush look like fraternal triplets. They are separated in age by only 66 days, all born in the late spring or summer of 1946, the first year of the Baby Boomer generation. Likewise, if you scroll down the chart a bit, you’ll see Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush were born 111 days apart in 1924. Meanwhile, no one born in the “Silent Generation,” between 1928 and 1945, has ever been elected. Americans purchase our presidents in bulk.

We just don’t elect them in order of age. When George W. Bush passed the torch to Barack Obama, 15 years his junior, it turned out to be less of a pass-off than a loan, given that Trump reclaimed the beacon for the earliest Boomers eight years later.

There is a similar clustering among the Democratic hopefuls, particularly when one looks past the artifice of formal generation definitions. While Obama is technically a late-blooming Boomer, born in 1961, it doesn’t feel as if he was born into the same tranche of American history as Trump. Nor do Biden and Sanders seem dramatically more seasoned than Trump, even though they represent the last, best hope for a Silent President, putting aside “Silent Cal” Coolidge, of course.

So traditional generational definitions can be limiting. For our purposes, a better set of political generations in the 2020 election cycle might look something like this:

“The Grandparents,” born between 1940 and 1959

Six candidates fall into this cohort, at least three of whom actually have grandchildren: Sanders, Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Jay Inslee, John Hickenlooper and Marianne Williamson. This encompasses the last of the Silent Generation and the heart of the Baby Boomers. Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush and Trump also fall in this range.

“The Obama Decade,” born between 1960 and 1970

This 10-year span includes the octet of Amy Klobuchar, Bill de Blasio, John Delaney, Kamala Harris, Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker.

“The Second-Gen Boomers,” born between 1971 and 1982

The final six: Beto O’Rourke, Tim Ryan, Julián Castro, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard and Buttigieg are all of the age that they could plausibly have Baby Boomer parents. The last two are technically Millennials, but only by a year or so. And if they’re anything like my fellow Millennials born in the early 1980s, they don’t terribly appreciate being lumped into a generation of 1996 babies who are not intimately familiar with Mark-Paul Gosselaar and Tiffani Amber Thiessen. Look them up, if you must.

At present, the largest age differential between two consecutive presidents is that of Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, who were 26.6 years apart — a fact that Kennedy deliberately mentioned in his inaugural, declaring that “the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans — born in this century.” (Eisenhower was born in 1890.) There were four other presidents born between 1900 and 1920: Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford (though never elected) and Ronald Reagan, all of whom were older than Kennedy.

Any of the six members of the “Second-Gen Boomers” would shatter the Eisenhower-Kennedy record, and Cory Booker, the youngest of the “Obama Decade” cadre, would also narrowly outpace that gap since he is about 23 years younger than Trump. But breaking that record is far from certain, even if one presupposes that any one of the 20 Democrats wins the presidency. The trail of the Oval Torch has wound its way through the generations in what mathematicians call the “Drunkard’s Walk,” ricocheting back and forth in time. But occasionally it does leapfrog over decades — or even entire generations. The younger Democratic contenders are banking on it being overdue for such a leap.

DHS warns of cybersecurity vulnerability in small airplanes,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/455319-dhs-warns-of-cybersecurity-vulnerability-in-small-airplanes,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) cybersecurity agency issued a security alert on Tuesday warning of a cyber vulnerability in small aircraft that could enable malicious actors to change key readings on the planes.

The alert was issued after cybersecurity group Rapid7 reported to DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) that an aircraft’s Controller Area Network (CAN) bus system can be exploited by a cyber attacker if the hacker has physical access to the plane.

CISA warned that the hacker could attach a device to the aircraft’s CAN bus system that could “inject false data,” leading to incorrect readings.

Attackers could manipulate the plane’s altitude, airspeed and angle of attack data, CISA noted, adding that pilots would not be able to “distinguish between false and legitimate readings” and could lose control of the airplane.

In order to prevent this type of attack, CISA recommended that aircraft owners restrict physical access to the planes, and that aircraft manufacturers review the implementation of CAN bus networks to increase security.

Rapid7 also put out a paper on its findings on Tuesday, with the group's Patrick Kiley writing that the perception that airplanes are kept in secure environments could be “making them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, not less.”

Kiley added that “while physical restrictions are great, we really feel like avionics, in particular, need to implement defense-in-depth.”"
US Justice Dept. can't find files on investigation into Rocky Flats nuclear arms plant,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/us-justice-dept-cant-find-files-on-investigation-into-rocky-flats-nuclear-arms-plant,"DENVER (AP) — The U.S. Department of Justice has lost track of more than 60 boxes of documents from a 27-year-old criminal investigation into safety and environmental violations at a former nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, officials said Tuesday.

The files were gathered in a two-year grand jury probe of the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, which manufactured plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and had a history of fires, leaks and spills.

The files have remained secret since the investigation ended with criminal charges in 1992.

Seven groups representing environmentalists, former nuclear workers, nearby residents and public health advocates filed a motion in federal court in January asking that the files be made public. The groups say the documents could show whether the government did enough to clean up the site before turning part of it into a wildlife refuge and opening it to hikers and bicyclists.

Government attorneys are fighting the request.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Denver told the activists in a July 24 email that it cannot find the files.

Kevin Traskos, chief of the U.S. attorney's civil division in Denver, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that officials have done only an initial search so far. ""The search was preliminary and is continuing,"" he said.

The activists plan to ask a federal judge on Wednesday to order the Justice Department to find the documents within 30 days.

Rocky Flats, perched on a windy plateau about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of downtown Denver, operated from 1952 to 1989. It shut down amid the grand jury investigation.

Rockwell International, the contractor that operated the plant, pleaded guilty to criminal charges that included mishandling chemical and radioactive material. The company was fined $18.5 million.

The government spent $7 billion cleaning up 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) at the center of the site where the plutonium triggers were built. The former buffer zone around the plant, covering 8 square miles (21 square kilometers), became Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge and opened to the public last fall.

In a separate case, another group of activists filed a federal lawsuit saying the government did not do enough to make sure the refuge is safe. That lawsuit is pending.

This story has been corrected to show the activists have not yet asked a judge to order the Justice Department to find the files but plan to submit the request Wednesday.

The data came in about the same as the trade expected.

Corn

In 2019, the U.S. farmers planted 91.7 million acres of corn, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). That equates to roughly 69 million football fields of corn and 3% above last year's acreage, according to NASS estimates.

The overall condition of the corn crop is rated at 58% good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states, compared to 57% a week ago.

The USDA pegged 58% of the corn crop was in the silk stage, compared with a 83% five-year average.

Also, 13% of the corn has entered the dough stage vs. a 23% five-year average.



Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, equal to a week ago.

Also, 57% of the soybean crop is blooming vs. a 79% five-year average.

The USDA pegged the amount of soybeans setting pods at 21%, well below a five-year average of 45%.



Wheat

The U.S. winter wheat harvest is 75% complete vs. a 79% five-year average.

Meanwhile, the U.S. spring wheat crop is rated as 76% good to excellent, equal to last week’s rating."
Justice Department appeals court order blocking asylum restrictions,https://www.cnn.com,['Priscilla Alvarez'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/asylum-rule-appeal/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration appealed a ruling in California blocking its new asylum restrictions to a federal appeals court Monday.

Last week, a federal judge in California late blocked the Trump administration's new asylum rule dramatically limiting the ability of Central American migrants to claim asylum if they enter the US by land through Mexico.

The administration also filed an emergency motion in the Northern District Court of California to allow the asylum restrictions to go into effect while the appeal to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals plays out. The Justice Department asked Judge Jon Tigar to decide whether he would stay his order blocking the rule by Friday.

The move puts yet another of President Donald Trump's immigration policies before the 9th Circuit, which has ruled against some of the President's policies.

The ruling from Tigar, a Barack Obama nominee, came the same day that a federal judge in Washington, DC, an appointee of President Donald Trump, had declined to block the rule. Tigar's decision, which affects the entire country, took precedence.

Daycare Owner’s Son Arrested By Feds In Homeland Security Raid,https://miami.cbslocal.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/07/29/homeland-security-raid-miami-daycare-center/,"SOUTHWEST MIAMI-DADE (CBSMiami) – The son of a Southwest Miami-Dade day care center owner is under arrest, however, his name and the charges have not been released.

The Department of Homeland Security served a warrant around 4:30 a.m. at the Little Seeds Academy Child Care and Learning Center at 10470 Bird Road.

Once inside, cyber agents were looking at computers. H-S-I said computers and telephones were being removed from the home early Monday afternoon. A CBS4 crew captured a computer tower being loaded in to a federal vehicle.

HSI says it can neither confirm nor deny reports that they were looking into whether there was child pornography that had been downloaded onto at least one of the computers in the home.

That is what worried parents heard.

“You see these people every day you just don’t expect these things to happen especially here in a facility where children are,” said parent Zaira Perez. “I have three kids here. I have my baby, a 4-year-old and another who used to go to school here so our main concern is that they are all okay and none are involved in this situation. This is the worst nightmare for any parent.”

Perez told CBS4’S Peter D’Oench “My heart aches for what happened. We just don’t know. These are my little babies. Just to know that that person had contact with the kids. It is disgusting.”

Another parent, Ana Hernandez, said, “We just want to know what happened to our kids. We want to know if any of the pictures on the computers are of our kids. My want to clear up the situation.”

Sophia Ramirez, another parent, was near tears when she said, “How do you take this news? There are no answers at all. I don’t have words for this. You put your trust in people here with the kids.”

Another parent, Mirna Gomez, another parent, said, “My daughter is the last one out of the day care every day and she leaves when the man who was arrested is there. She was there when no one else was there and I worry about her being in contact with him.”

Gomez also said he had spoken with the daughter of the owner and said, “She said these allegations are not true, what’s being reported. She said it only has to do with something personal and not something with the day care.”

Gomez said she was told the daycare was going to voluntarily shut down for a week.

“They’d don’t have to,” said Gomez. “They are going to do this on their own.”

D’Oench also caught up with the daughter of the daycare owner, who was identified as Julietta. She was speaking with the concerned parents.

“What are you telling them about the day care?” Julietta was asked.

“I am telling them that I am like them, that I just don’t know what is going on,” he said.

“Are you telling them if they were impacted?” Julietta was asked.

“They haven’t been,” she said. “This was just something to do with computers and something personal and not the day care.”

DCF, the Department of Children and Families, is investigating.

A neighbor named Carmen is also concerned.

“They should be arrested and put in jail for the rest of their life. I have kids and I’m against child pornography all kinds, but when it’s about children I’m 100% against it. ”

Another neighbor, Yulio Lledias, said “I am sorry about this. This is so close to home. This is really bad. I mean I have a 7 year old daughter.”

Homeland Security says the man taken into custody Monday is expected to appear in federal magistrate’s court Tuesday."

EIS gives federal agencies the flexibility and agility to migrate to modern communications and IT services that meet government security standards. Earlier this year, CenturyLink announced it was the first supplier to receive authority to operate under the EIS program.

RELATED: CenturyLink garners authority to operate under GSA's EIS program

EIS is GSA's 15-year, $50 billion program that was designed to award various contracts to vendors that help federal agencies to buy and update their IT and telecommunications infrastructure services.

Under the new contract, AT&T will offer the DoJ network function virtualization (NFV), SD-WAN, managed IP voice services and cloud connectivity across the major cloud providers and other capabilities.

AT&T was the incumbent providing DoJ data services under the predecessor procurement program known as “Networx.” The incumbents that were providing voice services to the DoJ under the Networx program were Verizon and CenturyLink.

In the transition to EIS, AT&T will continue to provide data services and adds managed IP voice services. Work on the new contract is underway, according to a spokesman.

The new AT&T solutions will help simplify cloud adoption across 43 component organizations and support the DoJ's Joint Cloud Optimized Trusted Internet Connection Service (JCOTS), which will accelerate the path for DoJ to access multiple cloud environments.

The services and applications will be used across the Justice Department's more than 120,000 employees that are spread across more than 2,100 locations.

The deal also includes access to the AT&T mobility network and FirstNet, which is the nationwide, dedicated communications platform purpose-built for public safety and first responders. As of early May, AT&T FirstNet had more than 600,000 connections, according to a story by FierceWireless.

It's not just Trump's comments. Presidents have made racist gestures throughout US history,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Associated Press', 'Published A.M.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — When President Donald Trump drew widespread condemnation for describing a majority-black congressional district as a ""rat and rodent infested mess"" and for tweets targeting four Democratic congresswomen of color, it was not the first time a U.S. president attracted such attention.

Throughout American history, presidents have uttered comments, issued decisions and made public and private moves that critics said were racist, either at the time or in later generations. The presidents did so both before taking office and during their time in the White House.

Many of the early presidents, George Washington to Zachary Taylor, owned black slaves and held power when African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos did not have the right to vote or serve on juries and could be refused service in public accommodations. They often repeated commonly held racist views, even when challenged by scholars or civil rights leaders.

Before he became the nation's third president, Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence that ""all men are created equal."" But in his only book, ""Notes on the State of Virginia,"" published in 1785, the future president expressed a series of beliefs about African Americans that would be seen today as racist.

This Feb. 17, 2016 file photo shows statue of Thomas Jefferson greeting visitors in the main lobby of the Jefferson Hotel in Richmond, Va. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)

He wrote that blacks were cursed with ""a very strong and disagreeable odor"" and were incapable of producing art and poetry. And though he said he believed slavery was immoral, he owned slaves and, historians say, carried on a sexual relationship with at least one of them, Sally Hemings. If every black slave were ever freed, he wrote, they should be deported since he believed blacks and whites could not live together peacefully.

Andrew Jackson, the nation's seventh president, was also a slaveholder from the South. Before he became president, he offered in an 1804 advertisement $50 for the return of a runaway slave and $10 extra ""for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of 300."" In Jon Meacham's 2008 book ""American Lion: Andrew Jackson and the White House,"" Meacham wrote that Jackson owned around 150 slaves and freed none in his will.

As president, Jackson allowed his postmaster general to let Southerners seize anti-slavery publications in direct violation of the First Amendment. He called the abolitionist pamphlets urging black equality ""unconstitutional and wicked.""

Jackson is widely vilified today among Native Americans for his role in forcibly removing indigenous people from their land, especially for the Trail of Tears. The removal of the Cherokee people from Georgia led to thousands of deaths.

""The philanthropist will rejoice that the remnant of that ill-fated race has been at length placed beyond the reach of injury or oppression,"" Jackson said in his farewell address.

The Virginia-born Woodrow Wilson worked to keep blacks out of Princeton University while serving as that school's president. When he became president of the U.S., the Democrat refused to reverse the segregation of civil service, though he had won the White House with the support for some African American men.

In 1915, Wilson sparked outrage by screening the racist film ""The Birth of a Nation"" at the White House. The silent movie was the retelling of Reconstruction through the eyes of the Ku Klux Klan. The movie portrayed the KKK as heroes and African Americans as uncivilized.

""No explanation or apology followed"" after the screening, Patty O'Toole wrote in ""The Moralist: Woodrow Wilson and the World He Made.""

Wilson appeared oblivious during the ""Red Summer"" of 1919 — a time when communities across the country saw white mobs attack African Americans, resulting in hundreds of deaths. He spoke out against lynching but did not use the federal government's resources to stop the violence.

Democrat Lyndon Johnson assumed the presidency in 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and sought to push a civil rights bill amid demonstrations by African Americans. Johnson famously convinced skeptical lawmakers to support the measure and gave a passionate speech about his days as a teacher in Mexican American schools to urge Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act.

But according to tapes of his private conversations, Johnson routinely used racist epithets to describe African Americans and some blacks he appointed to key positions.

Johnson, left, munching on a cookie, and George Meany, president of the AFL-CIO, laugh at a speaker's remark during the first annual Jewish Labor Committee Human Rights Awards dinner at the Sheraton in New York City.

His successor, Republican Richard Nixon, also regularly used racist epithets while in office in private conversations.

""We're going to (place) more of these little Negro bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family,"" Nixon once said about what he saw as lax work requirements. Nixon also made derogatory remarks about Jews, Mexican Americans, Italian Americans and Irish Americans.

Like Johnson, many of Nixon's remarks were unknown to the general public until tapes of White House conversations were released decades later.

Papadopoulos wants DOJ to examine $10K given to him by CIA or FBI,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/papadopoulos-wants-doj-to-examine-10k-given-to-him-by-cia-or-fbi/,"Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos on Sunday said he is returning to Greece to get $10,000 given to him as part of a CIA or FBI setup to entrap him – and he now wants the Department of Justice to examine the cash.

Papadopoulos said he was given the money in Israel during the summer of 2017 from a guy he believes was a spy but turned the moolah over to his attorney for safekeeping in Greece.

“A man named Charles Tawil gave me this money under very suspicious circumstances. A simple Google search about this individual will reveal he was a CIA or State Department asset in South Africa during the ’90s and 2000s. I think around the time when Bob Mueller was the director of the FBI,” he told “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News.

Papadopoulos, who served 12 days in federal prison for lying to investigators about contacts with Russian-connected officials during the 2016 campaign, said he has a theory about why he was given the cash.

“The money, I gave it to my attorney in Greece because I felt it was given to me under very suspicious circumstances. And upon coming back to the United States I had about seven or eight FBI agents rummaging through my luggage looking for money,” he told Mario Bartiromo.

He believes it was part of a setup by the FBI or the special counsel Robert Mueller’s office to “bring a [Foreign Agent Registration Act] violation against me.”

He wants Attorney General William Barr and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to take a close look at the paper trail.

“Because I still have the bills and I think they are marked,” Papadopoulos said. “These bills that are still in Athens right now must be examined by the investigators because I think they are marked and they’re going to go all the way back to DOJ, under the previous FBI under Comey, and even the Mueller team.”

“If the Mueller team is going around entrapping campaign associates and Trump associates, the way they did to me — I am sure it wasn’t just me they did it to — it’s going to open up a massive can of worms,” he added.

Papadopoulos met with Joseph Misfud, a Maltese professor in London in early 2016 in London.

Misfud told him months before the Wikileaks published Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Committee emails that the Russians had dirt on the Democratic candidates.

Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat John Downer about Misfud’s assertions, and Downer forwarded the information to the FBI."

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

Homeland Security issues hacking security alert for small planes,https://kdvr.com,['Dara Bitler'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://kdvr.com/2019/07/30/homeland-security-issues-hacking-security-alert-for-small-planes/,"× Homeland Security issues hacking security alert for small planes

WASHINGTON— The Department of Homeland Security issued a security alert Tuesday for small planes, warning that modern flight systems are vulnerable to hacking if someone manages to gain physical access to the aircraft.

An alert from the DHS critical infrastructure computer emergency response tea m recommends that plane owners ensure they restrict unauthorized physical access to their aircraft until the industry develops safeguards to address the issue, which was discovered by a Boston-based cybersecurity company and reported to the federal government.

Most airports have security in place to restrict unauthorized access and there is no evidence that anyone has exploited the vulnerability. But a DHS official told The Associated Press that the agency independently confirmed the security flaw with outside partners and a national research laboratory, and decided it was necessary to issue the warning.

The cybersecurity firm, Rapid7, found that an attacker could potentially disrupt electronic messages transmitted across a small plane’s network, for example by attaching a small device to its wiring, that would affect aircraft systems.

Engine readings, compass data, altitude and other readings “could all be manipulated to provide false measurements to the pilot,” according to the DHS alert.

The warning reflects the fact that aircraft systems are increasingly reliant on networked communications systems, much like modern cars. The auto industry has already taken steps to address similar concerns after researchers exposed vulnerabilities.

The Rapid7 report focused only on small aircraft because their systems are easier for researchers to acquire. Large aircraft frequently use more complex systems and must meet additional security requirements. The DHS alert does not apply to older small planes with mechanical control systems.

But Patrick Kiley, Rapid7’s lead researcher on the issue, said an attacker could exploit the vulnerability with access to a plane or by bypassing airport security.

“Someone with five minutes and a set of lock picks can gain access (or) there’s easily access through the engine compartment,” Kiley said.

Jeffrey Troy, president of the Aviation Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry organization for cybersecurity information, said there is a need to improve the security in networked operating systems but emphasized that the hack depends on bypassing physical security controls mandated by law.

With access, “you have hundreds of possibilities to disrupt any system or part of an aircraft,” Troy said.

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that a scenario where someone has unrestricted physical access is unlikely, but the report is also “an important reminder to remain vigilant” about physical and cybersecurity aircraft procedures.

Aviation cybersecurity has been an issue of growing concern around the world.

In March, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s inspector general found that the FAA had “not completed a comprehensive, strategy policy framework to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks.” The FAA agreed and said it would look to have a plan in place by the end of September.

The UN’s body for aviation proposed its first strategy for securing civil aviation from hackers that’s expected to go before the General Assembly in September, said Pete Cooper, an ex-Royal Air Force fast jet pilot and cyber operations officer who advises the aviation industry.

The vulnerability disclosure report is the product of nearly two years of work by Rapid7. After their researchers assessed the flaw, the company alerted DHS. Tuesday’s DHS alert recommends manufacturers review how they implement these open electronics systems known as “the CAN bus” to limit a hacker’s ability to perform such an attack.

The CAN bus functions like a small plane’s central nervous system. Targeting it could allow an attacker to stealthily hijack a pilot’s instrument readings or even take control of the plane, according to the Rapid7 report obtained by The AP.

“CAN bus is completely insecure,” said Chris King, a cybersecurity expert who has worked on vulnerability analysis of large-scale systems. “It was never designed to be in an adversarial environment, (so there’s) no validation” that what the system is being told to do is coming from a legitimate source.

Only a few years ago, most auto manufacturers used the open CAN bus system in their cars. But after researchers publicly demonstrated how they could be hacked, auto manufacturers added on layers of security, like putting critical functions on separate networks that are harder to access externally.

The disclosure highlights issues in the automotive and aviation industries about whether a software vulnerability should be treated like a safety defect — with its potential for costly manufacturer recalls and implied liability — and what responsibility manufacturers should have in ensuring their products are hardened against such attacks. The vulnerability also highlights the reality that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to separate cybersecurity from security overall.

“A lot of aviation folks don’t see the overlap between information security, cybersecurity, of an aircraft, and safety,” said Beau Woods, a cyber safety innovation fellow with the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. “They see them as distinct things.”

The CAN bus networking scheme was developed in the 1980s and is extremely popular for use in boats, drones, spacecraft, planes and cars — all areas where there’s more noise interference and it’s advantageous to have less wiring. It’s actually increasingly used in airplanes today due to the ease and cost of implementation, Kiley said.

Given that airplanes have a longer manufacturing cycle, “what we’re trying to do is get out ahead of this.”

The report didn’t name the vendors Rapid7 tested, but the company alerted them over a year ago, the report states."
New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."
U.S. Presidents Relied on This Innovative Alarm Watch,https://gearpatrol.com,['Zen Love'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://gearpatrol.com/2019/07/30/watches-you-should-know-vulcain-cricket/,"Welcome to “Watches You Should Know,” a bi-weekly (the once-every-two-weeks kind) column highlighting little-known or notable watches new and old that have interesting stories or have had a surprising impact on the industry.

It’s hard to imagine today that the rattly buzzing sound of a mechanical wristwatch alarm was once cutting-edge gadgetry. This was in the 1940s, however, and when the Vulcain Cricket was introduced, it overcame a number of technical hurdles to be loud enough, compact enough, and reliable enough to be a viable product. The first of its kind, an alarm was a genuinely useful function to have on the wrist. So much so that it found fame and took on a whole other level of status after being worn by multiple US presidents and becoming known as the “president’s watch.”

Firsts in watchmaking are always notable, but almost always require some qualification. The utility of an alarm on one’s wrist was recognized long before the Cricket, and a couple companies had produced alarm watches, but each had fatal flaws with alarms that weren’t loud enough or vibrations that adversely affected the movement. The Vulcain Cricket was not technically the first alarm watch when it was introduced in 1947, but the first to be practically successful (pocket watches notwithstanding).

Vulcain had to develop a special movement with multiple unique features in order to make the Cricket viable, let alone interesting and cool. The Caliber 120 featured one mainspring barrel to power timekeeping, as most mechanical wristwatches do, but also a separate one solely for the alarm due to its heavier power demands. The hand-wound movement offered 42 hours of power reserve for the timekeeping, and allowed the alarm to sound for around 25 seconds. Particularly clever is how clean and simple the watch remained despite its complex functionality: turn the crown one direction to wind the time’s mainspring and the other direction to wind the alarm’s mainspring.

The volume needed to be at least sufficient to wake you up, and this was achieved with a combination of solutions. The sound itself comes from a tiny hammer striking a metal “membrane.” It is then amplified via a cover which fits over the movement and, to let the sound resonate and escape, the case back is acoustically designed with holes similar to those seen in some string instruments. The hammer strikes around 1,300 times in the roughly 25 seconds of its loud, continuous ring until it audibly winds down — and it further vibrates palpably on the wrist.

All this results in a watch that looks pretty traditional, with only the addition of another hand on the dial for the alarm and a pusher at 2 o’clock that distinguishes it from time-only watches. The pusher is used to activate the alarm, stop it (important), and put the watch into alarm setting mode. One notable caveat is that the alarm can be set in ten-minute increments, but not down to an exact, individual minute.

The Cricket was successful and was followed by other notable alarm watches like the Jaeger-LeCoultre Memovox and the Tudor Advisor. The Cricket itself also evolved with additional functions and more versions. One of the most notable such Vulcain watches was the Cricket Nautical released in 1961, a dive watch rated to 300m with an alarm that would be audible to the wearer underwater.

The office of president of the United States is full of rituals and traditions, and Vulcain was lucky enough to become part of one. After the White House Press Photographer’s Association chose a Cricket to gift Harry S. Truman a 14k gold Cricket in 1953 as he was leaving office, the alarm watch continued to be associated with US presidents. Vulcain has been clever enough to send Cricket watches to US presidents as well, but this wasn’t a simple case of product placement — Nixon, it is said, got his as a gift from the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors.

Lyndon B. Johnson clearly appreciated fine watches, as he is associated with both the Cricket and the other famous “president’s watch,” the Rolex Day Date. Johnson bought his Cricket himself in Geneva, the story goes, and had his initials, LBJ, put right on the dial. He later also bought 200 Cricket watches in bulk to give out as gifts during his time in office. There are (unsubstantiated) stories that the sound would alarm his security detail, and that he would set it to go off during meetings as an excuse to leave early. Up to the present day, presidents have been known to receive Cricket watches whether or not they are worn.

If these interesting features and stories weren’t enough to make the Cricket downright legendary, it was also the watch chosen by notable adventurers and mountain climbers. The modern Vulcain company, restarted in 2001 after the original company succumbed to the Quartz Crisis, boasts that the original Cricket’s assembly line survives. Modern versions are available today in various forms, some quite faithful to early models, and they represent a very rare current example of a mechanical alarm in a wristwatch."
T-Mobile and Sprint merger approved by Justice Department,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/6646158/t-mobile-sprint-merger-justice-department-approves-26-billion-fcc,"The United States Justice Department has approved the $26 billion merger deal between T-Mobile and Sprint. After over a year in regulatory limbo, the merger received the green light from the last federal agency to hold out, with the Federal Communications Commission already signaling that it will approve the deal.

The Justice Department finally approved the deal after Dish reached an agreement with the carriers to acquire Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, Sprint’s prepaid business, and “certain” spectrum assets. This will position Dish as the replacement fourth major US carrier that will be lost once T-Mobile and Sprint merge. The two companies will be required to provide at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations to Dish, and the satellite TV provider will also get unfettered access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years as it works to build out a mobile network of its own using the newly acquired assets and spectrum that Dish has held on to for years. Dish has publicly remained silent on its plans throughout this entire process, but that is likely to change starting today.

“We are expanding output significantly”

“With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amount of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,” Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division, said.

T-Mobile and Sprint announced their intention to merge last April, claiming that their combined assets would make them a more viable competitor to AT&T and Verizon. The companies said they would be able to lower prices for consumers and more quickly deploy next-generation 5G networks across the country, which are arguments that have faced harsh criticism from consumer advocates and some experts.

Both the FCC and the Justice Department are required to approve the deal before it can move forward. The deal is likely to be approved by the FCC, although the official vote has yet to take place. In May, FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced that he would be voting to approve the deal after the companies made new promises to provide greater wireless and broadband access to rural areas.

“In light of the significant commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint as well as the facts in the record to date, I believe that this transaction is in the public interest and intend to recommend to my colleagues that the FCC approve it,” Pai said. “This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G throughout the United States and bring much faster mobile broadband to rural Americans. We should seize this opportunity.”

T-Mobile and Dish will also be required to support e-sim technology to make switching carriers easier in hopes of spurring competition.

“This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G”

Shortly after Pai’s comments, the other two Republican commissioners voiced support for the deal as well, despite never seeing any documents related to the new promises. At a congressional hearing last month, commissioners Brendan Carr and Mike O’Rielly confirmed that they had yet to see the specifics of the agreement.

T-Mobile’s connections to the Trump administration have come under heightened scrutiny as the deal has progressed. In March, The Washington Post reported that the company had spent over $195,000 at the Trump Hotel in Washington, DC while lobbying for the merger.

Congress has held a number of hearings on the proposed merger, with many top Democrats (and even presidential candidates) criticizing it for shrinking the US’s major wireless carrier pool down from four to three providers. Lawmakers like Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) all signed letters to Pai and Delrahim, citing threats to market competition that could harm the US’s ability to lead in 5G.

“The best way to achieve the goal of high-quality, affordable, nationwide 5G is through competitive markets,” the senators wrote. “This merger moves us further away from the sort of competition we need to accomplish this aim. It will lead to excessive consolidation and undermine innovation.”

T-Mobile and Sprint’s main counterargument to those concerns was a proposed deal selling off Boost Mobile and a portion of their combined wireless spectrum. Dish will acquire the assets, a move that could supercharge the network into replacing the two companies as the fourth major carrier. Charter and Altice were also reportedly bidding for the spectrum, but Dish became the winner for both the spectrum and the additional assets.

T-Mobile has sought to merge with other major carriers in the past. In 2011, AT&T said that it would purchase T-Mobile for $39 billion, but a few months after the announcement, the DOJ nixed the deal. In 2012, T-Mobile reached an agreement with MetroPCS to take over the smaller company. The Sprint acquisition is now the company’s largest successful purchase.

The merger has one more hurdle to cross before the companies get the all-clear to finalize. Last month, over a dozen state attorneys general filed a multistate lawsuit to block the deal, headed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California AG Xavier Becerra. “When it comes to corporate power, bigger isn’t always better,” James said. “The T-Mobile and Sprint merger would not only cause irreparable harm to mobile subscribers nationwide by cutting access to affordable, reliable wireless service for millions of Americans.”

In today’s announcement from the Justice Department, five states have agreed to settle including Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. New York and California are still pushing the lawsuit opposing the deal.

“We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide,” Becerra said.

Now that the DOJ has approved the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint can move ahead. But if the states’ suit wins out in the end, the whole deal will have to be unwound."
DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
DOJ tightens asylum rules for people fleeing violence,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/29/doj-tightens-asylum-rules-people-fleeing-violence/,"Being part of a family that’s harassed by a gang isn’t enough on its own to qualify for asylum, Attorney General William P. Barr ruled Monday, in the latest effort by the administration to put a cap on the expanding universe of asylum claims.

Mr. Barr overturned a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which had ruled that being part of a targeted family could qualify as a distinct social group, which is a key element of valid asylum claims.

In his new decision, Mr. Barr said that was far too broad a claim.

He said there are situations where being part of a prominent family could satisfy the law, but it can’t be automatic.

“If this were the case, virtually everyone in that society would be a member of a cognizable particular social group,” he wrote.

To get asylum, claimants must prove they are part of a targeted social group, and it’s because of membership in that group that they face persecution sponsored by a government, or to which the government is so indifferent that it’s essentially the same.

The case before Mr. Barr involved a Mexican man who said his father’s store was harassed by a local cartel that wanted to sell drugs there. The man said he himself was then targeted by the cartel, including a failed drive-by shooting and a failed kidnapping attempt.

The man, identified in the case by initial L.E.A., said it was his membership in his family that made him a target.

The Board of Immigration Appeals had ruled that the man’s family was a recognizable social group — though it ultimately denied the asylum claim, saying it may have been the man’s work at the store, rather than his relationship as son of the owner, that made him a target.

Mr. Barr overturned the first part of the ruling.

Acting DHS boss McAleenan praises Supreme Court 'victory' sanctioning use of Pentagon funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mcaleenan-dhs-supreme-court-victory-pentagon-funds-border-wall,"Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, told Fox News on Sunday it's a “big victory” that the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to tap billions of dollars in Pentagon funds to build sections of a border wall with Mexico.

“There was a big victory at the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Defense to move forward with that $2.5 billion to really accelerate the progress on the wall, and kind of double what we're doing with the congressionally appropriated funding, which is going well, as you noted up to 54 miles since we talked,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The court’s five conservative justices gave the administration the green light on Friday to begin work on four contracts it has awarded using Defense Department money. Lower courts had frozen funding for the projects while a lawsuit over the money proceeded. The court’s four liberal justices wouldn’t have allowed construction to start.

The Supreme Court’s action reversed the decision of a trial court, which initially froze the funds in May, and an appeals court, which kept that freeze in place earlier this month. The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.

The case in which the Supreme Court ruled began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. The shutdown ended in February after Congress approved approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion Presiden Trump was seeking. The president then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.

KIDNAPPED AUSTRIAN TRIATHLETE SWEET-TALKS CAPTOR INTO LETTING HER GO: REPORT

The money Trump identified included $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.

The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration said would be used to build more than 100 miles of fencing.

One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona were smaller.

The other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds so far have survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds was awaiting approval from the defense secretary.

McAleenan told Bartiromo that “building every day down there in the border … that's already providing significant new operational capability, and helping us control some high traffic areas of the border.”

He said that he did believe the situation at the border has been improving by “almost every measure,” but the only way to eradicate the immigration crisis completely would be through congressional action.

EPA now involved in giant trash pile investigation,https://www.wsav.com,"['Andrew Davis', 'Katie Campione', 'Associated Press', 'Alex Bozarjian']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.wsav.com/news/epa-now-involved-in-giant-trash-pile-investigation/,"RIDEGLAND, S.C. (WSAV) – Health officials have called in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help understand and investigate a giant debris pile in Ridgeland.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) tells News 3 it’s working with Jasper County, S.C. Emergency Management Division and the EPA to determine the best path forward for the response to the fire.

Last week, the day after WSAV first reported on the pile, business owners in the area witnessed heavy smoke and an even stronger smell coming from the heap of debris.

DHEC says their priority is the protection of public health.

The agency has an air sensor for fine particulate matter, which is the size consistent with smoke particles, in the area. The sensor provides concentration data every 15 minutes. Click here for real-time data from the air sensor.

So far, that air sensor has not picked up unsafe levels of particulate in the air, according to DHEC.

Carina Curel lives next door to the Able Contracting business and 65-foot pile. She’s not buying that.

“There’s more to it. There has to be if we are feeling like we are feeling, there’s more in that air. I feel exposed to something dangerous, it’s not something good, its dangerous and we are breathing it,” said Curel. “We have headaches, we can’t breathe, my mom is on oxygen. It’s like a daily struggle to say are we going to have a good fresh air day.”

DHEC says in general, smoke from an uncontrolled fire (e.g. campfire, wildfire or other types of fire) can result in increased amounts of particulates and other chemicals in the air. This can be a nuisance even for healthy people, but it can also make some pre-existing health conditions, like asthma and some heart or lung conditions, worse.

DHEC is encouraging anyone who experiences symptoms to seek advice from their normal health care provider.

If smoke is visible, even if the source of the smoke is not, DHEC recommends following these precautions:

Avoid spending extended amounts of time in smoky conditions.

Don’t walk, run, do yard work or participate in outdoor activities on days when smoke is visible at ground level.

People who have trouble breathing, experience an increase in coughing episodes, or have tightness in their chest should seek medical attention from their doctor or health care provider.

People with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema are more likely than others to have these symptoms and should, when possible, not stay in smoky environments for long periods of time.

Jasper County Fire now has a truck stationed at the site and water lines down and ready for the next time firefighters have to come in. They have been on the scene a half dozen times or more in the past two weeks.

DHEC calls these types of fires “complex,” saying they will likely continue to burn even when flames are not visible on the surface.

Because the facility continues to burn, DHEC has asked the EPA to assist with air, soil and water sampling to characterize site conditions. The data generated will be used to determine the path forward.

Curel hopes that path is right out of her neighborhood for all that smelly debris.

“I hope he gets shut down and all that stuff gets hauled out fo there, every drop of it,” she said. “That means I could get my life back in order.”"

Only three federal executions have taken place since 1988, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. All five of the death-row inmates named in Thursday's release were convicted for the murders of children.

“Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding. The Justice Department upholds the rule of law—and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

Several states currently have a moratorium on the death penalty or have suspended the practice due to recent past wrongful convictions brought to light by groups such as the Innocence Project, which have secured the release of a number of death-row inmates in recent years. The total number of executions has declined over the last decade, in part, due to concerns that capital punishment disproportionately affects African Americans.

The death penalty has been abolished in about 70 percent of countries, including many democratic, industrialized nations similar to the U.S."
U.S. Satellite Operators Urge Commerce Department to Revise Proposed Commercial Remote Sensing Regulations,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-satellite-operators-urge-commerce-090000762.html,"WESTMINSTER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Proposed regulations would be a step backward for U.S. industry, giving foreign firms a competitive advantage

U.S. satellite operators Maxar Technologies (MAXR) (MAXR.TO), Planet Labs, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global today urged the U.S. Department of Commerce to revise its proposed commercial remote sensing regulations, which as drafted would put U.S. firms at a significant disadvantage in the global marketplace.

Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global recently submitted a joint response to the Commerce Department’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking objecting to the newly proposed rules. While U.S. satellite operators appreciate the Department’s recognition of the risk to American leadership in space that comes from overly burdensome regulation, the proposed regulations would undermine U.S. competitiveness, impair U.S. innovation and deter investment in the U.S. commercial space industry. Commenters urged the Commerce Department to significantly revise the proposed regulations to take a more narrowly tailored approach to ensure the pressing need for continued U.S. leadership in commercial space is more appropriately balanced with other regulatory interests.

The U.S. commercial space industry provides critical products and services that support disaster and humanitarian crisis response, national and global security interests and enhance the location-enabled services that billions of people around the world use every day. Addressing the lack of transparency, operational uncertainty and institutionalized delays that impair the ability of the U.S. industry to bring innovative products and services to market should be the primary focus of the Commerce Department’s efforts. For example, license requests to bring new commercial satellite imagery capabilities to market can take years to approve, operators have little visibility into the decision-making process and operating licenses are subject to retroactive modifications after investment has already been made and systems are operating. By failing to address these issues, the proposed regulations put at risk continued U.S. leadership in the global commercial space industry, including the satellite imagery market, which is alone projected to reach $3 billion by 2020.

“The U.S. commercial space industry needs smart regulations that promote innovation, encourage competitiveness and bolster national security, and unfortunately the Commerce Department’s draft regulations fall far short of these goals,” said Dr. Walter Scott, Maxar CTO. “Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global urge U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the National Space Council to intervene and ensure that new regulations allow American space firms to continue to lead in this dynamic global industry.”

“The draft regulations represent a three-decade step backward,” said Robbie Schingler, Planet’s Co-founder. “This is cold water thrown onto a thriving ecosystem with rapidly changing space architectures, many new entrants and novel business models. We strongly urge regulators to take a strategic view and create a forward-leaning environment that opens up near-Earth space to efficient, secure and trusted commercial enterprise. Building new industries bolsters American competitiveness and grows the economy, which fuels national security. Should this rule progress without significant modification, it will represent a direct threat to 21st century U.S. national security.”
