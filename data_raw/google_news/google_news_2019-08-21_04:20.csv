Trump postpones Denmark trip after Prime Minister refuses to discuss sale of Greenland,https://www.cnn.com,['Betsy Klein'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/trump-cancels-copenhagen/index.html,"(CNN) Less than two weeks before his scheduled trip to Denmark, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he has postponed his visit to Copenhagen after the Danish Prime Minister disputed his interest in buying Greenland as ""absurd.""

""Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time,"" he wrote Tuesday night.

He continued, ""The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!""

A White House official confirmed to CNN that the entire trip to Denmark is being scrapped.

Trump has on multiple occasions brought up buying Greenland from the Danish government and the White House counsel's office has looked into the possibility, two sources told CNN last week.

"Trump Says He’s Exploring ‘Various Tax Reductions,’ and the Economic Data He Loves Shows Why",https://www.nytimes.com,['Jim Tankersley'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/politics/trump-economy-recession-data.html,"The indicators suggest that the effects of Mr. Trump’s trade fights with China and Europe and a slowdown in global growth are dragging on the American economy and eroding the short-term boost from the president’s 2017 tax cuts.

Economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, say uncertainty from Mr. Trump’s trade policies and the impact of higher tariffs are the biggest threat to the American economy. Mr. Trump is prepared to impose new rounds of tariffs on imports from China in September and December, which would affect a large batch of consumer goods, and he has threatened to impose tariffs on imported automobiles next year.

Mr. Trump suggested on Tuesday that his fight with China would be worth some economic pain — including a brief recession — if it helped reduce America’s $500 billion trade deficit in goods with China.

“Whether it’s good or bad, the short term is irrelevant,” he said. “We have to solve the problem with China because they’re taking out $500 billion a year plus. And that doesn’t include intellectual property theft and other things. And also, national security, so I am doing this whether it’s good or bad for your statement about, ‘Oh, will we fall into a recession for two months?’”

It is unclear when — or if — the economy will tip into recession, but much of the economic progress that the White House has cited has already lost steam.

Last September, administration officials walked reporters through charts that they said showed the economy, under Mr. Trump, outperformed what had been its trend in Mr. Obama’s second term.

“I can promise you that economic historians will 100 percent accept the fact that there was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump and that a whole bunch of data items started heading north,” Kevin Hassett, then the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters."

Trump was speaking to the press in the Oval Office about two Democratic congresswomen barred from entering Israel over their involvement in the movement to end international support for the country because of its policies toward Palestinians.

""Five years ago, the concept of even talking about this -- even three years ago -- of cutting off aid to Israel because of two people that hate Israel and hate Jewish people -- I can't believe we're even having this conversation,"" Trump added. ""Where has the Democratic Party gone? Where have they gone where they're defending these two people over the State of Israel?""

He added, ""I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat -- it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.""

The remark led critics to argue the President was dabbling in the anti-Semitic trope of ""dual loyalty,"" which questions the loyalty of Jewish citizens.

Scaramucci launching PAC to 'dismantle' Trump: I can possibly move 'eight percent' of his voters,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scaramucci-launching-pac-dismantle-trump,"Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci is launching a PAC in order to ""dismantle"" President Trump and claims he could potentially sway as much as eight percent of his voters.

During a Tuesday interview on the ""Hacks on Tap"" podcast, Scaramucci casually mentioned that he was going to be ""running advertisements"" from his own political action committee featuring him and his wife describing what the president ""does to people"" in hopes of swaying white suburban women.

""Hold on a second, tell me about your political action committee,"" podcast co-host David Axelrod interrupted.

SCARAMUCCI PREDICTS THAT 'DEMAGOGUE' TRUMP WON'T BE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN 2020

""I haven't formed it yet, but I will,"" Scaramucci said. ""I'm in the process of doing it. It's going to be The Committee to Dismantle Trump, but I'll come up with a much more clever thing than that. I'm gonna throw in my own dough, ask others to put their dough in there and we're going to explain to the people what he's doing.""

Scaramucci suggested that the reason he gets ""under Trump's skin"" is because he himself isn't a politician and that his insults are ""a reflection of him.""

""At the end of the day, you know, I can grab ahold of five, six, eight percent of the people that know he's nuts and possibly move them,"" Scaramucci added.

On Monday, Trump blasted Scaramucci and referenced Scaramucci's wife, Deidre Ball, on Twitter.

Former VA physician charged with the deaths of three veterans,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'August At Pm']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-va-physician-charged-with-the-deaths-of-three-veterans/2019/08/20/0119ea16-c345-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html,"Federal prosecutors on Tuesday charged a former Veterans Affairs pathologist with the deaths of three veterans and a scheme to cover up years of drug and alcohol use on the job that caused him to misread thousands of fluid and tissue samples of ill patients.

Robert Morris Levy was indicted on three counts of involuntary manslaughter and 28 counts of mail fraud, wire fraud and false statements to law enforcement officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs has told members of Congress and investigators that Levy’s misdiagnoses, which amounted to more than 3,000 cases, were responsible for at least 15 deaths.

During 12 years as chief pathologist here and in leadership roles on multiple oversight boards and medical committees, Levy, 53, read almost 34,000 pa­thol­ogy slides from aging veterans. He had their lives in his hands, prosecutors said in unsealing their indictment.

But his addiction and attempts to cover it up with lies and dangerous practices — even after VA paid for a lengthy inpatient treatment program — led to multiple deaths and other life-threatening trauma for veterans, they said.

“I don’t think anyone would ever have imagined that a pathologist would use his knowledge and expertise in order to do something like this,” Duane Kees, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said at a news conference after unsealing the criminal indictment.

The charges unsealed Tuesday mark a rare criminal case against a physician, in or out of government, in a profession where mistakes or incidents of negligence are most often addressed in civil court through malpractice claims, authorities said.

VA officials on Tuesday called Levy’s alleged misdeeds an isolated case. But they are already prompting a reckoning and questions of oversight from investigators, veterans groups and Congress for the country’s largest medical system — a sprawling, decentralized network of 1,200 hospitals and smaller clinics that serve 9 million veterans a year.

Kees, a veteran, said he brought a limited number of manslaughter charges “in order to bring the most serious and prosecutable case.”

VA Inspector General Michael Missal, whose office in 2018 began an investigation of Levy’s actions and of agency missteps in overseeing and addressing his behavior, said Levy betrayed veterans’ most basic trust.

“When veterans go to VA for their health care, they expect to be helped and not harmed,” said Missal, whose office brought the criminal case with Kees.

To avoid detection of his severe substance abuse problem, Levy used his knowledge of toxicology and the science of blood testing and urinalysis to devise a dangerous solution, prosecutors alleged.

Levy routinely took a substance called 2-methyl-2-butanol (known as 2M2B) to mask the alcohol level in his blood. The substance, not approved for individual use, cannot be detected in routine tests for drugs and alcohol. And it can be lethal if too much is taken, Kees said.

In this way, Levy intentionally misled the Mississippi state medical license board into believing that he was clean, the indictment said.

“He knew exactly how much to use for it not to be fatal,” Kees said.

Levy, an Air Force veteran whose VA salary was $225,000 a year, was fired from VA last year.

[VA is gearing up for a massive shift of health care to the private sector. But Democrats are fighting back.]

Levy’s diagnoses and the information he entered in patients’ medical records “largely influenced decisions about their course of treatment,” prosecutors said. From 2005 to 2017, Levy read slides and assisted radiologists, surgeons and other physicians during procedures called “needle biopsies,” rendering clinical diagnoses for about 24,000 veterans.

They were patients from rural and often low-income communities of northwest Arkansas, southwest Missouri and eastern Oklahoma. Levy did not treat veterans in person, working in his pa­thol­ogy lab on the third floor of Specialty Building 21 in the back of a medical center’s campus.

He was tasked with a crucial medical role — diagnosing cancer and other diseases in aging veterans who fought in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq and Afghanistan, and those who served but did not see combat.

Many of these veterans rely solely on VA for their medical care, lacking private insurance.

An 18-month review of Levy’s cases found that almost 10 percent of his diagnoses involved clinical errors, more than 10 times the normal misdiagnosis rate of 0.7 percent for pathologists.

Hundreds of the misdiagnoses were not serious, VA officials said. But the mistakes led to at least 15 deaths, authorities said, and other serious illnesses for veterans whose cancers or other illnesses were not diagnosed or were diagnosed when they should not have been, leading to unnecessary treatment.

Levy, appearing at his arraignment Tuesday in a federal courtroom in a gray striped prison jumpsuit, pleaded not guilty. He awaited his turn on a crowded docket, slouched over and solemn, his hands shaking from time to time. Occasionally he glanced to the bank of prosecutors and investigators seated in the room.

Levy stood out: The other defendants, most facing drug charges, told the judge they had completed high school. When asked for his level of education, the pathologist, trained at UCLA and Emory University with a sub-specialty in hematopathology, responded, “MD.”

Levy told Judge Erin Wiedemann he had secured an attorney only Monday. She set a trial date for Oct. 7, and Levy was returned by a U.S. marshal to the county jail in Fayetteville, where he has been since his arrest late last week.

Prosecutors described a sinister disregard for veterans’ lives as Levy knowingly entered false diagnoses for three veterans whose biopsies he read, one in 2009 and two in 2014.

One patient wrongly diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer he did not have, received the wrong treatment and died in months. Another patient died of squamous cell carcinoma that spread after Levy entered a wrong diagnosis of small-cell carcinoma in his record.

The third patient received a benign test result for prostate cancer and as a result was not treated; he died in 2016 after the disease spread.

In two of the cases, Levy falsified records to claim that his deputy had concurred with his diagnosis, a required peer review for first-time malignancy cases.

VA fired Levy last year after an arrest for driving under the influence. But his termination followed a tumultuous tenure, particularly in recent years, during which his colleagues in the pa­thol­ogy lab complained that they witnessed erratic behavior from him while on the job. Their complaints went unheeded, the indictment alleges.

Following an incident of erratic behavior, Levy entered a VA program for impaired physicians in Mississippi in 2016 and returned to work. But a year later he appeared at a meeting of fellow pathologists and oncologists that he was chairing and was unable to stand and slurred his words, according to documents and interviews.

His medical privileges were suspended, but he continued to perform administrative work until the DUI arrest and was fired in April 2018.

[Whistleblower says there’s a secret VA wait list for care. The department says that’s not true.]

At the heart of the case, say investigators, former employees and VA patients in northwest Arkansas interviewed by The Washington Post, is how years of missed diagnoses, many of them of fatal diseases, went undetected and why distress calls from employees went unheeded.

VA has long struggled with issues of access to patient care and whether its physicians are vetted carefully enough for misconduct and mistakes that could endanger patients, when they are hired or on the job. Some said Levy’s impaired behavior on the job was well known for years but little was done to stop him.

Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), who with his colleagues in Arkansas’s delegation to Congress has aggressively monitored VA’s outreach to veterans affected by the case, said he is furious at what he described as a “lack of oversight.”

“Of all the medical professionals, the person you really don’t want messing up is a pathologist,” Westerman said in an interview. “There were poor procedures in place, or they weren’t followed like they should have been. Levy had a record of being impaired on the job and continued to evaluate cases.”

In a statement before Levy was charged, Kelvin Parks, director of the Fayetteville VA medical center, offered his “sincerest apology to the Veterans and family members negatively impacted by this now-fired former employee.”

“In instances where his conduct did not meet the high standards Veterans and taxpayers expect from us, we are holding ourselves accountable, letting Veterans and families know their options and keeping the community informed,” the statement said.

Darren O’Quinn, a Little Rock attorney and pharmacist retained by Levy to represent him, said in an interview that he is advising Levy on a legal strategy and was driving to Fayetteville late Tuesday to meet with his client.

A VA spokeswoman, Jessica Jacobsen, called the case “an isolated incident” in an email and said the agency has “strengthened internal controls” to ensure that errors are “more quickly” identified and addressed. She declined to describe the changes.

Parks has said there was a “vulnerability” in the internal case review process that sometimes allowed supervisors to review their own cases. He said the hospital now will have someone from the quality-control department manage and oversee all case reviews."
Trump Expected to Nominate Pompeo Deputy to Be Ambassador to Russia,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Michael Crowley']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/politics/john-sullivan-trump-russia-ambassador.html,"At his 2017 Senate confirmation hearing, Mr. Sullivan took a tough line toward Russia’s 2016 election interference and aggression toward its neighbors, such as its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

“I believe we have to be robust in our response to this intrusion into our democracy,” he said. “Interference with our political processes is simply unacceptable. It’s a profound threat to our way of life, and we have to respond as robustly as possible with all the means we have at our disposal.”

Russia has not been a central part of Mr. Sullivan’s portfolio, but last month he led a delegation of Trump administration officials who met with his Russian counterpart, Sergei A. Ryabkov, in Geneva to discuss arms control and other security issues. In December, Mr. Sullivan toured Central and Eastern Europe, where he pressed officials on Russia’s “destabilizing” and “malign activities,” according to a State Department news release about the trip.

As ambassador since October 2017, Mr. Huntsman maintained a low profile in Moscow. But he made quiet, if largely futile, efforts to thaw relations between Washington and Moscow before submitting his resignation this month. It is effective on Oct. 3.

During a meeting on June 28 with Mr. Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Mr. Trump spoke in warm terms about the Russian leader. “We have had a very, very good relationship,” he said. “A lot of very positive things going to come out of the relationship.”

Although the report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, did not find that Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign had conspired with the Kremlin, members of both parties in Congress are determined to maintain stiff sanctions on Moscow over its election interference detailed by Mr. Mueller and for Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

Mr. Sestanovich said that Mr. Putin’s government is frustrated by the continued hostility it faces in Washington, as well as by mixed signals from Mr. Trump’s own administration, where Russia hawks have resisted the president’s efforts to improve relations. He said the Kremlin is likely resigned to regrouping after the 2020 presidential election and waiting out the remainder of Mr. Trump’s administration, if needed."
DOJ to Supreme Court: Trump decision to end DACA was lawful,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/latino/458102-doj-to-supreme-court-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful,"In a late-night filing ahead of a case scheduled for oral arguments in November, Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued the Trump administration had the legal authority to rescind DACA in 2017.

The case under review by the Supreme Court is about the legality of the president's order to end DACA, not the legality of the Obama-era program that allows hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as minors — to temporarily live and work in the United States without risk of deportation. ""At best, DACA is legally questionable; at worst, it is illegal,"" wrote Francisco.The case under review by the Supreme Court is about the legality of the president's order to end DACA, not the legality of the Obama-era program that allows hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as minors — to temporarily live and work in the United States without risk of deportation.

The court is likely to issue its decision in the case in June or July, just months ahead of the presidential election. The final ruling could have profound implications for the 2020 race and thrust immigration back into the spotlight as a central campaign issue.



Trump in 2017 prompted litigation with his order to strip the benefits granted to Dreamers by his predecessor.

That order was blocked by federal judges, and the 9th Circuit affirmed those decisions on the grounds that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enacted Trump's rescission of DACA based solely on ""a belief that DACA was unlawful."""

Trump's wrong about Putin: We need to keep Russia out of the G-8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trumps-wrong-about-putin-we-need-to-keep-russia-out-of-the-g-8,"Did Vladimir Putin outsmart President Barack Obama?

Yes, in Ukraine, in Syria, with his election interference, and with his fraying of U.S. order in the Middle East.

But did Obama push Russia out of the G-8 international forum because he was upset at being outsmarted? No.

Instead, Obama rightly pushed Russia out of the G-8 (turning the forum into the G-7) because of Putin's seizure of Crimea. Supporting Russia's restoration to the forum, Trump is matching the worst of Obama's foolishness vis-a-vis Russia.

After Trump on Tuesday suggested that Obama excluded Putin from the G-8 because he was upset at being ""outsmarted"" by the Russian president, Trump added ""I think it's much more appropriate to have Russian in, it should be the G-8.""

Both suggestions are delusional.

Again, the Russians were chucked out of the G-8 because they decided to steal European territory. That overt breach of international norms, norms so carefully maintained since the end of the Second World War, required a robust international response. While Putin should have been punished more severely, the G-8 exclusion was warranted and necessary. On this point at least, Obama made the right call.

To now restore Russia to the G-8 would be weak and idiotic. Just look at a map: Russia continues to occupy Crimea and areas of south-eastern Ukraine.

It amazes me that Trump goes on these random tangents sometimes. The president's policy toward Russia is generally excellent. That includes U.S. policy in Ukraine. Trump's national security team is also far better than its predecessors in dealing with Putin and his cronies. But for some inexplicable reason, Trump's rhetoric regards the Russian leader as a friend who wants greater friendship rather than what Putin is: an enemy.

Trump should pay more attention in his intelligence briefings."
Crop Tour: Nebraska Expected to Out Yield Indiana Corn and Soybeans,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/crop-tour-nebraska-expected-out-yield-indiana-corn-and-soybeans,"In an unpredicted turn of events, Nebraska crops are expected to out-yield Indiana—by a margin of more than 10 bu. per acre on corn and nearly 300 soybean pods per 3x3 square.

Despite all challenges, Nebraska looks to be coming in at or just below average in corn and soybean yields. Indiana, on the other hand, is looking at depressed yields compared to previous Pro Farmer estimates.

Indiana corn took a hard fall to 161.46 bu. per acre and soybeans diminished to 923.94 pods per 3x3 square. This means soybeans plunged nearly 400 pods per 3x3 square when compared to last year’s Pro Farmer number and corn plummeted more than 20 bu. per acre. However, last year corn and soybeans had remarkable estimates at 182.33 and 1,311.87, respectively.

It’s clear Indiana farmers had to battle to get crops in the ground—and Mother Nature fought back just as hard. Compared to last year’s Pro Farmer estimates, Indiana corn yields sank nearly 12% and soybean pod counts tumbled nearly 30%.

“When we look at some of the factors involved down the corn side of things that drove the lower yield estimate.” says Brian Grete, Pro Farmer editor and lead for the eastern leg of the tour. “Average ear counts came in at 93.7—that’s down from 102 last year Kernel rows weren’t much above 16 and grain length was down to 6.5 inches compared to 6.7 last year.”

The soil is drier than it was last year—when it rated at 5.1—this year it’s only at 3.8.

“The immaturity of both the corn and soybean crops is the overriding story and one that we knew but looking at the data that we’ve seen through Ohio and Indiana so far, it definitely is the soybean pod counts more than the corn yields that are the surprise,” Grete continues.

Crop Tour scouts pulled 191 soybean samples and 188 corn samples, total, to reach these estimates.

Corn District 1: 26 samples Yield 163.31 District 2: 19 samples Yield 161.13 District 3: 23 samples Yield 170.12 District 4: 32 samples Yield 168.84 District 5: 54 samples Yield 156.89 District 6: 34 samples Yield 154.71

Nebraska corn yield estimates champion 172.55 bu. per acre and soybean pods per 3x3 square hit 1,210.83. Each crop is just slightly below last year’s estimates of 179.17 bu. per acre in corn and 1,299.08 pods per 3x3 square. That’s only down 3.7% from last year’s corn estimates and 3.1% from last year’s Pro Farmer soybean estimates.

“We’re actually up 2.9% from the three-year average,” says AgriTalk Host Chip Flory. “David Michaelson made a great observation this morning. It feels like last year was just a great year and this year all we’re doing is coming back to average [in Nebraska].”

Yields varied from 50 bu. per acre to 224 bu. per acre, according to western leg Crop Tour lead Jeff Wilson.

“Dry land crop is in relatively good shape,” Wilson says. “It’s gotten rains when it needed it and it got planted.”

Compared to some neighboring states, Nebraska had fewer prevent plant acres at about 800,000 acres total. All in all, soybeans are average.

“It’s a variable crop as well, but it works out to be average,” Wilson explains. “There’s not a lot of pods or a lot of blooms out there for us to gain much more than what we’re seeing today.”

Western Crop Tour scouts pulled 307 corn samples and 300 soybeans samples in the Husker state.

Corn District 2: 5 samples Yield 169.72 District 3: 65 samples Yield 178.10 District 5: 19 samples Yield 183.91 District 6: 105 samples Yield 182.66 District 8: 17 samples Yield 149.55 District 9: 96 samples Yield 159.71

The Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday filed a motion in federal court in Washington, D.C., for summary judgment, asking Judge Trevor McFadden to direct Treasury and the IRS to comply with the committee's requests and subpoenas for six years of the president's federal tax returns.

The committee also asked McFadden, a Trump appointee, to consider the case on an expedited basis, proposing a schedule under which briefs on relevant issues would be filed by Oct. 25 with oral arguments taking place ""as soon as practicable"" after that.

In its own court filing Tuesday, Treasury and the IRS asked that the committee's summary judgment motion be put on hold until after McFadden resolves the administration's own forthcoming motion to dismiss the House lawsuit.

In arguing on Tuesday that the judge should direct the administration to provide the tax returns, the committee said that the ""defendants’ defiance is an extraordinary departure from established principles of law.""

The committee said that its subpoenas are valid, and that the section of the tax code under which it requested Trump's tax returns doesn't give Treasury and the IRS any discretion.

Treasury has said that it thinks the committee's requests and subpoenas for Trump's tax returns lack a ""legitimate legislative purpose,"" and that Democrats' real purpose for seeking the documents is to expose the tax information of a political rival.

But the committee argues its requests and subpoenas do have a legitimate legislative purpose, because the panel is conducting oversight and considering legislative proposals relating to how the IRS enforces tax laws against a president.

The committee revealed in its new court filings that on July 29, it received an unsolicited communication from a federal employee it claims made credible allegations of possibly inappropriate efforts to influence the IRS's mandatory audit program of presidents.

The administration argued that it plans to file a motion to dismiss the case that will raise issues about ""whether political conflicts between the elected Branches fall within the sphere of authority that the Constitution assigns to the Federal courts."" It asked McFadden to stay the committee's motion until the judge rules on its motion to dismiss.

The administration argued that its motion and the committee's motion will require the court to consider different issues. The administration is proposing a schedule under which oral arguments on its motion to dismiss would be held the week of Oct. 16 or soon after that.

But the committee, which argued that it has standing to sue, thinks that the judge should consider the administration's expected motion to dismiss and the panel's summary judgment motion concurrently, arguing the motions are likely to raise overlapping issues.

The House panel argued that ""time is of the essence"" in resolving the case, since the current Congress will end in January 2021.

""The Committee must obtain a prompt resolution of the issues in this case if it is to have enough time to investigate the tax issues implicated by President Trump’s tax returns and return information and propose and pass any legislation that it may deem appropriate in response,"" the panel argued.

The administration, however, said that the committee's concern about the speed of the case ""rings hollow,"" since Neal didn't request Trump's tax returns until several months after he became chairman, and the lawsuit wasn't filed until weeks after Treasury and the IRS rejected Neal's subpoenas.

Trump and several of his business entities also are being heard in the case as defendant-intervenors. They argued on Tuesday that the committee's motion for summary judgment should be postponed until after they can request information about Democrats' true motives for requesting Trump's tax returns.

Former US attorney expects 'blockbuster' FISA abuse report from DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-us-attorney-expects-blockbuster-fisa-abuse-report-from-doj-inspector-general,"Former U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis predicted the Justice Department inspector general's report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will be ""hard-hitting,"" with multiple recommendations for prosecution.

During an interview Monday on Fox News, Lewis said he used to work with Inspector General Michael Horowitz at the Justice Department and called him as ""tough as a nail."" Lewis added, ""He’s tough, he is smart, and I think the report will be a blockbuster."" He expects Horowitz's findings to make special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election ""look like a sixth grade book report.""

Asked to explain why, Lewis said, ""It’s going to come out. It’s going to be hard-hitting. [Horowitz] spent almost two years interviewing various people — witnesses. Looking at what he describes [as] almost a million documents. And I think he’s going to make recommendations regarding prosecution and turn this whole FISA — this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — the submissions, I think he will turn them on their head.""

British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

[Analysis: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover]

Although some Trump allies have expressed high expectations for Horowitz's report and Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation, others are preaching caution. ""Republicans usually set the bar so high that when we don't meet it, the media narrative then becomes Republicans don't even own their promises. Just promise a fair investigation that goes wherever the facts take us,"" former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News last month.

Lewis, who served with Barr at the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush, was reacting to an interview Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham did over the weekend in which he said he believes the IG report would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ and its handling of the Russia investigation.

Graham said he wants ""as much as possible"" declassified from Horowitz's report as possible, but former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu warned former FBI Director Christopher Wray might fight to keep its contents classified because he has been ""co-opted by the FBI bureaucracy.""

Lewis said he does not agree with Sununu's assessment, calling Wray a ""good, honest broker,"" but advised the FBI chief to ""err on the side of transparency"" because he suspects the FISA Court may have been used by the FBI to target President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Asked where the investigation is headed, Lewis said former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe ought to be ""worried"" about submissions that were made to the FISA Court. Both Strzok and McCabe filed separate lawsuits against the DOJ and FBI claiming they were subject to politically motivated firings last year.

He also said former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn should be be ""sort of happy"" because Horowitz's report might be used to help them overturn their convictions, stemming from Mueller's investigation, for lying to FBI investigators."

USDA cuts payments promised to researchers as agency uproots to Kansas City,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458129-usda-cuts-payments-promised-to-researchers-as-agency-uproots-to,"A union for employees at the research wings of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says the agency has reneged on payments promised to employees, rolling back assistance to those who will be forced out of the agency if they do not agree to move to the Kansas City area.

“Due to the volume of applications and in an effort to afford all employees who applied the opportunity to receive the incentive payment, the amount approved for all applicants has changed from $25,000 to $10,000,” the USDA wrote on a form for employees applying for the assistance.

USDA announced in June that it would be moving its two research agencies to Kansas City.

Employees at both the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) unionized in the wake of the agency's relocation plans, and the USDA has been heavily criticized by lawmakers for the short timeline and chaos surrounding the decision.

Two-thirds of staff at the two agencies said they would face termination from the agency rather than uproot.

Those departing employees were expecting buyouts of $25,000, only to learn from the USDA that they’d be reducing the payout in light of the number of employees fleeing the agency.

“Employees now have less than a week to decide whether to accept the reduced buyout, which also bars them for working at another federal agency for five years. Many of these employees have spent their careers devoted to agricultural research and furthering their agencies’ missions, and they deserve to be treated better than this,” American Federation of Government Employees President J. David Cox Sr. said in a statement. “It’s hard to imagine USDA management finding more ways to demoralize the workers at these two agencies, yet they continue to top themselves at every turn.”

USDA did not agree with the union's contention that the payments were promised. The department is not required to offer Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments (VSIP) nor must the payments be a certain amount, a spokesperson said.

The agency attributed the change in the payment to an effort to make sure all employees would be able to get a payout.

“In keeping consistent with the Secretary’s commitment to “Do Right” by our employees, the Department’s priority was to offer a standard VSIP to every eligible employee who applied, instead of on a first come first serve basis,” an agency spokesperson said in an email to The Hill. “The Department has made it a priority to treat all employees fairly and consistently, and offering VSIP to every employee who applied aligns with that commitment and ensures all eligible employees have access to available options.""

The agency has previously said the move is designed to move employees closer to stakeholders — an argument ERS and NIFA employees say makes no sense as they work primarily with lawmakers and universities across the country.

The agency has been heavily criticized for poor planning tied to the move.

Numerous lawmakers have spoken out against USDA’s plans, viewing it as a brain drain that would harm the agencies' missions.

The 6 things you most need to know about Trump’s new climate plan,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/19/20812243/trump-epa-climate-plan-ace-cpp-6-things,"In June, the Trump administration unveiled its proposed replacement for the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. Last week, a coalition of 29 states and cities filed a lawsuit to block the rule, claiming that it violates Trump’s obligations under the Clean Air Act.

And on Sunday, nonpartisan research firm Resources for the Future, along with researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Syracuse University, and the Boston University School of Public Health, released new research showing that even Environmental Protection Agency’s meager projected pollution reductions from its rule are likely overestimated.

The story of EPA carbon regulations is long and tangled, but if you’re in a hurry, here’s the short version: The president’s plan is the bare minimum the EPA thinks it can get away with. It won’t reduce emissions much; in fact, it is likely to increase both carbon dioxide and local air pollutants, along with their health impacts, in more than a dozen states. (Seriously.) And the EPA is going to have a hell of a time justifying it to a court.

Now let’s walk through the longer version of the story. Most coverage so far has focused on the plan’s striking weakness (for obvious reasons), but there are several other aspects of the fight over power plant emissions that are worth understanding. How these policy and legal questions get resolved will have enormous influence on what the next administration — if we ever make it to another administration — can do to address climate change.

So, with that in mind, here are the six things you need to know about Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) plan.

1) Trump’s EPA is regulating carbon because it has to, not because it wants to

The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed skepticism toward climate change, hostility toward regulation, and an all-consuming hatred for anything with former President Barack Obama’s fingerprints on it. If it had its druthers, it wouldn’t regulate carbon emissions at all.

But it has to. In 2007’s Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that if the EPA finds that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health, it must regulate them as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. In 2009’s Endangerment Finding, the EPA found that, yes, greenhouse gases are a danger to public health.

Those twin developments created a set of legal obligations for the agency. It must:

regulate mobile sources of greenhouse gases, i.e., vehicles — that was Obama’s fuel economy standards, which Trump is busy gutting;

regulate new stationary sources of greenhouse gases, i.e., power plants and refineries — that was Obama’s 2013 limits on new sources, which Trump is busy gutting;

regulate existing stationary sources of greenhouse gases — that was the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which Trump is now gutting.

Some of the wackier denialists in the conservative coalition were pressing the EPA to challenge the endangerment finding (and former Administrator Scott Pruitt considered it). If successful, that would negate all these obligations. But, perhaps perceiving how futile and silly such an effort would be, the EPA elected not to.

So it was forced to replace, not just cancel, Obama’s fuel economy standards, replace, not just cancel, Obama’s regulations on new power plants, and replace, not just cancel, the Clean Power Plan. Thus, ACE.

2) The legal question at the heart of the dispute over CPP has never been decided by courts

The Clean Air Act (specifically, Section 111) calls upon the EPA to set air pollution standards by determining “the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction … adequately demonstrated.”

Just what constitutes the “best system of emission reduction” is at the heart of the dispute between CPP proponents (environmentalists and Democrats) and critics (polluting industries and Republicans).

After studying the issue for several years, Obama’s EPA realized a few things. First, power plants do not operate in isolation; they are parts of a large, interconnected grid, a single machine, and their operations are determined by its needs. And second, states are already busy reducing greenhouse gas emissions using a variety of policy tools connected to grid operations — fuel-switching from coal to natural gas, adding renewables, energy efficiency, etc.

The EPA concluded that the “best” (most efficient and economical) way to reduce power plant emissions is to support those efforts by requiring states to reduce the average carbon intensity of their overall power sectors. They could reduce the emissions of individual plants, or increase energy efficiency, or build more renewables, or replace coal plants with natural gas. In the argot, the plan allowed emission reductions “beyond the fenceline” of individual power plants.

By setting targets at the aggregate level, rather than at the level of individual power plants, the CPP gave states maximum flexibility (something conservatives ostensibly support in general). It left them more than one tool for compliance.

The alternative — requiring only emission reductions “within the fenceline,” at individual plants — was seen as untenable. The fact is, an individual fossil fuel power plant just doesn’t have the capacity to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions much (absent carbon capture and sequestration, which is still wildly expensive). It can operate more efficiently, getting more power per unit of fuel, but those are improvements at the margin. The only practical way to get substantial reductions from the power sector is to require aggregate reductions.

As soon as the CPP was proposed, a large coalition of 24 states, along with several companies and other groups, sued. (There were actually multiple suits that eventually got consolidated into one.)

The main legal critique was simple: By regulating beyond the fenceline, the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority. (For an in-depth look at the fenceline question, you can read this post.)

In January 2016, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals denied a motion to stay the CPP while it was under legal consideration. Just a few weeks later, in February, the Supreme Court overrode that decision with a 5-4 decision of its own, issuing a stay on the CPP until the litigation was settled.

Although both sides had already made their case in circuit court, the court agreed to the EPA’s request that it withhold judgment until EPA issues a replacement plan. Since, as was inevitable, that replacement plant has sparked a lawsuit, it will end up in court anyway.

Long story short: Despite what you’d think from listening to Trump administration rhetoric, no court has yet ruled on the fenceline question. And a court eventually must.

Obama’s EPA did its homework, and beyond-the-fenceline proponents are confident of their case, at least in circuit court. But the case is likely to go back to the Supreme Court, and, well, we all know how that’s going.

If courts end up rejecting the Trump EPA’s inside-the-fenceline interpretation, it would throw the agency into chaos. But it would give a Democratic successor administration free rein to issue a new, stronger CPP (which the Resources for the Future analysis says could reduce electricity sector emissions 37 percent above the baseline case by 2030).

If courts accept the narrow interpretation, it would be an enormous blow to Democratic efforts on climate change going forward, putting the Clean Air Act, at least Section 111, out of reach as a carbon reduction tool.

3) ACE is so weak, it could potentially lead to higher emissions

Trump’s EPA accepted the inside-the-fenceline restriction that Obama’s EPA found untenable, so ACE only applies to individual plants. Consequently, it won’t reduce carbon emissions much.

The CPP did not set mandatory carbon reduction targets, but the EPA calculated that if states opted for the most stringent pollution control plans, the CPP would yield electricity sector emission reductions of 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. (Since EPA’s 2015 analysis, progress on clean energy has been incredibly rapid. We now know that most of the emission reductions CPP targeted were going to happen anyway. Thus the need for an updated CPP.)

ACE, on the other hand, might not reduce emissions at all relative to baseline. It might even raise them. Yes, you read that right: Trump’s pollution rule might produce more pollution than no rule at all.

How is that possible? Well, remember, ACE applies only to individual power plants (coal plants, mostly), and the only way to improve the emissions performance of individual power plants is through efficiency upgrades. But efficiency upgrades — heat rate improvements (HRI), in the lingo — make those plants cheaper to run.

If they’re cheaper to run, utilities will run them more often. That will increase their net emissions. Resources for the Future refers to this as “rebound” and says the EPA underestimates it in several ways.

First, the agency plans changes to New Source Review — pollution standards that must be met by new or upgraded plants — to make it easier to upgrade coal plants without triggering new standards. (See No. 4, below.) That will have the effect of boosting HRI. In the initial draft release of ACE, those standards changes were included. But in the final rule, they were left out, enabling the EPA to lowball HRI.

But the agency still plans to make those changes to New Source Review; by failing to include them in its analysis of ACE, it is deliberately hiding the ball.

Second, in its analysis, the EPA excluded two of the best technologies for HRI (blade path upgrades and redesign/replace economizers — don’t ask). And third, the agency’s analysis excludes the Section 45Q tax credit passed by Congress, which would offer tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration.

Long story short, even the administration’s paltry project carbon emission reductions from ACE — between 0.7 and 1.5 percent lower than baseline — are likely overstated. In fact, coal plants are likely to run more than EPA estimates, will means CO2 will fall less (or not at all) and other local air pollutants will increase in many states, with all their concomitant health effects.

A final note: reductions of 0.7 to 1.5 percent are basically a rounding error and they hinge entirely on the market fate of coal plants. Resources for the Future ran an analysis of several different market scenarios and found that even small changes in market assumptions — demand, the price of natural gas, etc. — could wipe out those gains.

Basically, ACE isn’t a serious plan to reduce carbon emissions. It’s more of a statement by Trump’s EPA that it doesn’t have the power to reduce power sector carbon emissions.

4) Gutting New Source Review (which goes along with ACE) could also raise emissions

From an environmental perspective, the original sin of the Clean Air Act (at least the 1970 and 1990 amendments to the CAA) was grandfathering.

The presumption was that new power plants would be built with modern pollution controls and old plants would gradually phase out and close down. So existing plants were grandfathered in — they didn’t have to meet the new standards.

To ensure that existing plants didn’t increase their pollution in the meantime, the CAA standards applied not only to new plants but to existing plants that made substantial upgrades that would increase their pollution. More specifically, “any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted” would trigger the standards.

Any utility planning a new plant or a plant upgrade has to submit to the New Source Review to ensure they’re meeting pollution standards.

So if utilities built new plants, they had to meet modern pollution standards. If they upgraded old plants, they had to meet modern pollution standards. But if they just kept their polluting old plants running and running forever, without upgrades, they didn’t have to meet modern pollution standards. And so that’s what they did.

Consequently, the US has been saddled with a large, old fleet of dirty coal plants for decades, with utilities making just enough repairs to keep them in operation but not enough modifications and upgrades to trigger New Source Review. The average age of a US coal plant is 39 years — roughly its rated life span.

Environmentalists have complained about these plants for ages, saying that utilities should shut them down. Utilities have also complained, saying the prohibitive costs of NSR are preventing them from upgrading their fleets.

Obama’s CPP was supposed to finally get at those old plants. Given the way NSR has traditionally worked, ACE would have too. It would have forced plants to make efficiency improvements, which would have triggered NSR, which would have triggered tighter standards. (By EPA’s own estimate, 80 percent of coal-fired power plants do not meet current NSR standards for local air pollutants.)

Trump’s EPA doesn’t want utilities to face the terrifying prospect of being forced to clean up their old fleets (“enormous new permitting burdens”), so it plans to “reform” New Source Review. It will no longer be an increase in total emissions that triggers the review — only an increase in a plant’s hourly emissions rate. If a plant reduces its hourly emissions rate, increases its total runtime, and thus increases its total emissions, no problem.

New Source Review is one of the very few regulatory tools available to reach these existing, dirty plants, and EPA wants to take it off the table. Long-term, that could free lots of utilities to update their dirty old coal plants (to comply with ACE) and keep them running even longer.

5) Even after torturing the numbers, the EPA couldn’t make ACE look like a good deal

The awkward fact for Republicans has always been that air quality regulations work. They produce social, economic, and health benefits well in excess of their compliance costs. There is a robust literature and a long practical history showing as much. (See here for the EPA’s cost-benefit analyses on the CAA, which links to dozens of independent sources.)

At every new round of regulations, conservatives and polluting industries complain that they are too onerous, that they will destroy the economy, cost jobs, raise energy prices. And every time, it doesn’t happen. Compliance proves cheaper than expected, the economy continues growing, and public health improves.

Republicans have not responded to this reality by accepting that they were wrong about air quality regulations. Instead, they’ve responded by trying to game the numbers, massaging cost-benefit calculations to give more amenable outcomes.

That continues in the ACE proposal. As Brad Plumer reported in a great New York Times piece, the EPA no longer counts climate benefits that occur outside US borders, which is both morally and atmospherically daft.

But even more daft, rather than the Obama administration’s 3 percent discount rate, Trump’s EPA is using a discount rate of 7 percent.

Discount rates refer to how much future benefits are “discounted” when expressed in today’s dollars — or more colloquially, how highly we value future benefits. (A higher rate means we value them less; a lower rate, more. A rate of zero means we value them equally as much as present benefits.)

A 7 percent discount rate is at the high end of what markets and governments use for personal investments, i.e., how much individual investors value their future profits. But applied to intergenerational investments, i.e., how much sacrifice we’re collectively willing to impose on future generations, it is sociopathic.

“If you use a rate above 5 percent,” Maureen Cropper, an economist at the University of Maryland, told Plumer, “you’re essentially saying that we shouldn’t worry today about anything that happens 100 years from now.” (If you want to dig deeper, here is a post I once did on discount rates, using otters.)

Using these tricks and others, all of which make the rule more legally vulnerable, EPA cut its estimate of the “social cost of carbon” — the total societal value of a ton of GHG emission reductions — from around $50 (the Obama administration’s median number, arrived at after an extensive interagency process that Trump has tried to cancel) to between $1 and $7 (a value rectally extracted by Trump’s EPA over the course of months).

Naturally, that makes cutting greenhouse gases look a lot less attractive. But here’s the first twist.

Even if the climate benefits of the CPP are cut close to nothing, the other benefits, primarily in reductions of local air pollutants like SO2 and NOx, still more than pay for it. That’s true even though the EPA ignored many benefits it claimed to be unable to quantify.

EPA says they are ""unable to quantify the economic value of changes in exposure to mercury, carbon monoxide, SO2, and NO2, ecosystem effects or visibility impairment"" in regulatory impact analysis https://t.co/YDFACjisfg — ⚡Taylor Kuykendall (@taykuy) August 21, 2018

EPA just couldn’t make the numbers work for it.

And so, as Lisa Friedman first reported for the New York Times, according to the EPA’s analysis, “the new rules could also lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030 from an increase in the extremely fine particulate matter that is linked to heart and lung disease, up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems, a rise in bronchitis, and tens of thousands of missed school days.” (And the Resources for the Future analysis shows that those numbers are almost certainly conservative.)

Yes, the EPA is proposing a policy that it concedes will lead to 1,400 premature deaths, 48,000 new cases of “exacerbated asthma,” and at least 21,000 new missed days of school every year, through 2030. That should be fun to justify to a court.

And as Nathanael Johnson noted in Grist, EPA’s analysis shows that ACE’s net costs outweigh its net benefits:

EPA’s press officers aren’t exactly highlighting the findings that the proposal would leave Americans worse off. In a fact sheet, for example, the EPA trumpets its finding that ACE could save power plants up to $6.4 billion in compliance costs. But wade into the details to look up that scenario (check out table 18 on page 165), and you see that the EPA weighs that $6.4 billion against health costs that run between $16.6 billion and $75 billion.

“When an agency wants to do something that’s harmful to the American people, it typically tries to hide it,” Richard Revesz of the Institute for Policy Integrity told Johnson. “What’s unusual here is that the EPA just comes out and says it.”

However — and here’s the second twist — Trump’s EPA is currently working to rectify the situation.

As Friedman smartly notes, the massive study upon which EPA bases much of its work on the health effects of particulates (the famous Harvard “Six Cities” study) would be excluded from EPA consideration if the administration’s daffy “secret science” proposal goes through.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan reported, the proposal would exclude from EPA analysis any study in which participants’ identities are concealed — which is most big public health studies, for obvious reasons. Experts are almost unanimously horrified by the proposal, including the EPA’s science advisers, but it appears to be moving forward.

So enjoy this particular EPA analysis (yet another triumph of career staff over their political hack bosses). The next time EPA runs cost-benefit analysis on an air rule, it won’t include many of the health benefits of pollution reductions, because it will have consciously prevented itself from knowing about them.

6) We may have already reached the CPP’s 2030 goal; it’s time for more ambition, not less

According to the Sustainable Energy In America Factbook, US power sector emissions are down 28 percent from 2005 levels. The researchers at Rhodium Group estimate that they will be down 37 percent by 2025.

That means the CPP reach target for 2030 — 32 percent reduction — will likely be achieved in the next few years, just based on current market trends.

This extraordinary progress has been hard-won, utility by utility, and the CPP — even though it never went into effect! — was a big part of that. The tangible prospect of federal regulations got every state and utility, even those with no interest in climate change, thinking, talking, and planning around carbon reductions. And guess what? When utilities start looking around in earnest, they find that cutting carbon is pretty easy.

Reducing electricity sector emissions has proven much cheaper and easier than envisioned even by the optimists at Obama’s EPA. The sensible thing to do in this situation is to boost the plan’s ambition.

In comparing the ACE to the CPP, remember that the emissions baseline has changed a lot since 2014 thanks to cheap renewables and natural gas. @EPA could have responded to this by raising the ambition bar. Instead, they lowered it. pic.twitter.com/REdDtPiy9x — Trevor Houser (@TrevorGHouser) August 21, 2018

It is difficult to know just how much the weakening of CPP into ACE will blunt that progress — how much progress still depends on policy and how much it has taken on a market momentum of its own. (One thing upon which virtually every expert agrees: US coal is going to continue dying.)

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University took a look at prospects for the electricity sector hitting Paris climate targets without the CPP. They found that it basically depends on natural gas prices. If they stay low or fall further, there’s a chance of hitting 2025 and 2030 Paris targets. Even if they rise a bit, Paris targets are still within reach, though “it becomes essential for many of the existing regulatory and tax inducements to be retained, and perhaps enhanced.” (In particular, they mention renewing federal renewable energy tax credits, which are set to expire.)

But there is broad consensus in the energy community that even if the electricity sector can limp past the 2030 finish line without (much) supportive federal policy, there’s no way the US will get on track for its longer-term carbon targets (80 percent reductions by 2050) without concerted policy support.

Depending on how courts rule on the fenceline issue, it’s possible that a Democratic administration that takes power in January 2021 could almost immediately issue a strengthened CPP, targeting, say, 80 percent electricity sector reductions by 2030, which will definitely wipe out all the coal and rein in natural gas.

Alternatively, if a Supreme Court decision with Brett Kavanaugh restricts the EPA to inside the fenceline, the prospect of substantially reducing carbon emissions using EPA regulations will basically be off the table, leaving federal legislation — or action at the state and local level — the only road forward on climate change.

Even more alternatively, if Trump wins reelection, the EPA by 2024 is likely to be a thoroughly degraded agency, its rules and staff stacked in favor of industry and most of its institutional memory and expertise lost. And the US will be out of the global climate effort entirely, a rogue actor lurching in the direction of myopic greed during the years the world most needs solidarity."

While Pompeo says he will remain as the top U.S. diplomat for as long as Trump wants, many supporters and critics see the 55-year old former congressman and CIA director as charting his own political future that will likely include a presidential campaign of his own down the road.

In 2016, Pompeo was a Tea Party conservative serving in the House of Representatives, known best for his pugnacious role sparring with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the Benghazi hearings. He was also an ardent opponent of Trump and a supporter of Sen. Marco Rubio.

His stance was widely known. But in a March 2016 video published by the New Yorker magazine Monday, Pompeo is seen blasting Trump ahead of the Kansas primary and comparing him to President Barack Obama: ""We've spent seven and a half years with an authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution. We don't need four more years of that.""

Pompeo laughed off the comments Tuesday, saying, ""It was a tough political campaign and when I'm on your team, I am all in, as I was, and when my candidate left, I was all in for President Trump then as well.""

He pledged loyalty to serving in Trump's administration for ""as long as President Trump continues to want me to be his Secretary of State."" Despite again ruling out a run for Kansas's open Senate seat next year, speculation that he will jump in the race late continues. The latest tea leave to some analysts is a meeting he had Tuesday in New York with the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, a conservative economic advocacy group.

President Trump ""is my leader ... I would love to serve for him just as long as I can,"" Pompeo said on ""CBS This Morning"" Tuesday.

But to critics, that loyalty has gone too far at times. Pompeo is known to be sensitive to any remark or question about differences between him and Trump and in private is reportedly ""among the most sycophantic and obsequious people around Trump,"" a former senior White House official told the New Yorker.

One anonymous former ambassador went further, comparing Pompeo to a ""heat-seeking missile for Trump's"" rear end, according to the New Yorker, although the official used a slang word.

Pompeo dismissed that as ""offensive"" language and a ""ludicrous"" statement, and he said he shares his disagreements with Trump ""with great frequency.""

""But when he makes a decision, and it's legal, it is my task to go execute that with all the energy and power that I have,"" Pompeo added.

Pompeo's predecessor has said Trump repeatedly asked for things that were illegal.

""So often, the president would say here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it and I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law,"" former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in December, nine months after he was fired by Trump over their many disagreements on foreign policy.

After Tillerson made those comments, Trump tweeted that he was ""dumb as a rock"" and that Pompeo was ""doing a great job, I am very proud of him."""
EPA sued for allowing use of pesticide harmful to bees,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458094-epa-sued-for-allowing-use-of-pesticide-harmful-to-bees,"An environmental group is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its decision to expand use of a pesticide the agency considers toxic to bees.

In July the EPA said it would allow sulfoxaflor to be used in ways barred during the Obama administration as well as on new crops where the pesticide had not been used before.

“Even for Trump’s EPA, which seems to measure success by pesticide-company profits, it’s stupefying to OK spraying a bee-killing poison across millions of acres of crops frequented by bees,” Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s environmental health program, said in a statement. “While leading scientists and countries across the globe are calling for eliminating harmful bee-killing pesticides like sulfoxaflor, Team Trump is cheerfully promoting its use like a corporate PR firm. It’s nauseating.”

Burd said the pesticide will harm not just bees and butterflies but also plants that rely on them for pollination.

The EPA would not comment on the lawsuit but said the pesticide ""provides benefits to growers and is supported by strong science that shows minimal risks for pollinators.""

In previous documents, the EPA described sulfoxaflor as “very highly toxic” to bees, and a study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

In a July call with reporters to announce the decision, a top EPA official emphasized the agency’s research on the pesticide's effects on bees and said the rule was designed with pollinators in mind.

“To reduce exposure to bees, the product label will have crop-specific restrictions and important pollinator protection language,” including limits on how close to bloom sulfoxaflor can be sprayed, the official said.

But it may be difficult to monitor whether the regulations spare bees as intended. Just before EPA’s decision on sulfoxaflor, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it was suspending one of the few remaining government data sets that monitor bee populations and loss.

The center’s suit, filed in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, argues the EPA failed to compile “substantial evidence” as required under law before approving sweeping new uses of sulfoxaflor. They say the EPA also failed to consult with other agencies to ensure the new regulation wouldn’t harm endangered species.

The suit is not the first on the pesticide.

It was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, pushing the EPA in 2016 to change its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the harm to bees.

EPA said it was spurred to reconsider uses of sulfoxaflor following numerous emergency requests from states — many of which the agency granted — to allow the use of the pesticide on certain crops. It contends sulfoxaflor is safer than the alternatives.

The regulation allows farmers to once again use sulfoxaflor on citrus, cotton and types of squash, and the pesticide can now be used on alfalfa, corn, cocoa, grains and pineapple, among others, for the first time.

In some cases, farmers will not be able to spray sulfoxaflor within three days of bloom, but bee activists say the pesticide can remain in the soil and harm bees.

Bees are key in the production of almost a third of U.S. crops, spurring a commercial bee industry that brings colonies from field to field to pollinate farmers’ fields.

The EPA said the economic plight of farmers was a factor in its decision. The agency said growers could see net revenue losses of up to 50 percent if they aren't able to use the pesticide.

But Burd said pesticides like sulfoxaflor are dangerous to bees because they attack the nervous system, causing bees to get confused and diminishing their appetite.

“They don’t respond as well to predators ... cognitive loss is causing them to die as they get lost in the field,” she told The Hill previously.

Meet the man ready to battle Congress in support of Trump’s immigration strategy,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1667511/meet-tom-homan-trumps-immigration-hawk-up-for-top-role-at-dhs/,"Tom Homan officially retired after 34 years of government service last June, but it’s pretty hard to tell. He has been an upstate New York beat cop, a Border Patrol officer and, these days, he’s the acting head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Homan, 57, is also now one of the most vocal defenders of US president Donald Trump’s controversial immigration policies as a Fox News talking head and fiery op-ed contributor. His unyielding support was on full display at a bruising Congressional hearing in July, when Democrats attacked the administration’s continuing policy of family separation.

“I am thankful that we have a president that not only talks the talk about securing our border, but he walks the walk,” Homan said at the hearing. “No president has done more to try to secure our border, especially in a time of crisis, than president Trump.” He cited Trump’s executive orders, emergency declaration, and an agreement with Mexico that many immigration experts said was underwhelming.

In return, Homan is perpetually floated as a top candidate for any big Department of Homeland Security (DHS) job that comes up, including most recently the big one: Secretary. Trump even named Homan his “immigration czar” during a rambling Fox & Friends phone interview in June. He neglected to tell Homan, who has not formally been offered the job.

The Trump White House has not served as a smart career move for people of Homan’s age and experience. Well-established experts often leave with a worse reputation than when they arrived. There was Gary Cohn, the former economic advisor, whose reason for leaving earned him his own scathing Onion article. Rex Tillerson’s many years in the oil industry may forever be overshadowed by his firing as secretary of state while on the toilet.

Nonetheless, Homan is eager to serve, he told Quartz in a recent interview. He said he expects the president to nominate someone soon to be the permanent secretary of DHS. He’s not sure if it will be him, but whoever it is, he said, “has to be ready for a fight” with Congress.

Homan says democrats want “open borders” and to make “illegal immigration legal.” So whoever Trump nominates will need to withstand the likely political backlash.

“If your feelings are easily hurt, it’s not a job for you,” he said. He noted the time that the former secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, was booed in a Mexican restaurant in Washington after the administration launched its family separation policy.

As far as potential nominees go, Homan makes sense for Trump. He epitomizes the all-or-nothing approach of the president’s anti-immigration effort.

The White House’s current demands, as Homan stated in his Congressional testimony, include rewriting some of the current foundations of US immigration policy. The president wants Congress to eliminate the “Flores Settlement,” for instance, which limits the amount of time the government can detain families and provides immigrant children human rights protections. He also wants to alter the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPRA), which forces US officials to carefully screen children from Central America before deporting them, and tighten the standards by which asylum-seekers can claim they face a “credible fear” at home.

Back in 2016, when Trump was running for president, Homan was reluctant to share his thoughts on the candidate’s immigration policies. “I can’t say what I think,” he said at the time. Now, however, he is open about his support. “I don’t agree with everything he’s ever said, but he’s the first president who has ever tried to secure this border,” Homan told Quartz.

Homan says he fully supports the president’s efforts to make asylum laws more strict, for example. About 90% of asylum seekers pass the initial “credible fear” test that allows them to remain in the US and go through the process of applying for protections. The percentage of those who are actually granted asylum, however, has plummeted under the Trump administration. The process can take years, and the Trump administration wants to hold people in detention until they appear in court, resulting in overcrowded and unsanitary detention centers.

Immigration activists say there’s no reason to detain asylum-seekers in this way, and that offering immigrants a more humane option than detention, like assigning a case worker who shepherds them through the system, is a cheaper and more effective option.

“I understand the [credible fear] threshold is low on purpose because we don’t want to send people back to persecution and death. I get that,” Homan said. But it is “ridiculously low.”

On the controversial topic of “removals”—deporting people who have lived in the US for years and may not have committed any crime—Homan similarly has a cut-and-dry take.

“Everyone is having a fit right now,” he said, referring to public reaction to ICE raids. But, he explained, ICE sent out notices to thousands of people informing them they had been ordered to leave the country. He said these people were told to “turn themselves in” so immigration agencies could work with them to get them home. “They refused to show up,” Homan said. “So ICE has to go out and find them.”

“If they don’t do that there is no integrity in the entire system. We might as well take everyone off the border and get rid of all the judges, because there are no consequences.”

Supporting policies that aren’t working

Homan’s apparent allegiance to the Trump administration’s current immigration policy is a problem for the simple reason that the policies are so far not effective, experts say.

The nature of US immigration changed long before Trump became president. In the last two decades, the number of single men coming from Mexico for economic opportunity plummeted. In the same period, more and more families began traveling from Central America to find protection from violence back home.

It was only when Trump entered office, however, that the crisis reached its current level of urgency.

“The administration has repeatedly stated that the Congress is to blame for this situation at the border. But the legal framework in place today is the same that was in place, three, five, and 10 years ago,” said John Cohen, a veteran law enforcement officer and former acting under-secretary at DHS.

The problems at the border are “a direct result of the approach and programs put in place by this administration as it relates to border security,” he added.

Those policies and programs range from diverting funds to build a wall to reducing aid to Central America. The Trump administration also began a “metering” program, which limits the number of people who can apply for asylum. It has forced some asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico during their application process, and is putting more border-crossers in detention facilities. Overworked courts means those migrants could be in detention for months or even years.

“Everything they have done to restrict immigration has been misguided,” Cohen said. Instead of targeting Congress, Trump should be frustrated with the people at the White House who have “sold him an approach to border security and immigration that simply won’t work,” he added.

So Cohen doesn’t see how appointing Homan as secretary would have any positive result.

“My concern is that Homan is a one-trick pony,” Cohen said. “His career has been in a very narrow area of law enforcement…He believes the number one focus of the department and state and federal law enforcement should be immigration enforcement, and that is not a view shared by the overwhelming number of people in law enforcement.”

The DHS has a number of other responsibilities beyond immigration, including emergency response, aviation security and cybersecurity.

Cohen and other former officials argue that DHS needs someone who can simply right the ship, filling the numerous vacancies left by an administration that has removed anyone not on board with its vision. This will become especially important as the department soon faces the potential emergencies of another hurricane season, and tries to balance Trump’s demands to clamp down on legal immigration with the reality of US law, it’s own budget, and its many other responsibilities to the country.

Fighting for Trump

Trump has said he likes a fighter, however. And Homan showcased that kind of pugnaciousness at the House Oversight Committee hearing in July. House Democrats grilled him about the hundreds of kids separated from their parents at the border and the “subhuman” treatment that they faced.

“Do you have no shame about the fact that it’s all done in the shadow of the American flag?” asked a distraught Gerry Connolly, the Virginia Democrat.

Rep. Gerry Connolly to Tom Homan: “You’re not at the border right now! You’re in a hearing room! It’s my time!” https://t.co/PMMPrjVR8C pic.twitter.com/xVGo0FhQTs — The Hill (@thehill) July 13, 2019

Homan became furious after Jesus Garcia, the Illinois Democrat, accused him of ignoring the mistreatment of immigrant children because they were a different race:

In tense exchange, Rep. Jesús García spars with acting ICE Dir. Thomas Homan over child separation: “Is it because these children don’t look like children that are around you?” “Your comments are disgusting!” Homan responds. “This is out of control.” https://t.co/iDdAVvNOKm pic.twitter.com/TJh4StH1UL — ABC News (@ABC) July 12, 2019

Later, Homan told Fox he was so upset, he considered assaulting Garcia. So it seems he might be exactly what Trump is looking for in a new DHS head."
USDA: National THC test for hemp ‘as challenging as you think it is’,https://hempindustrydaily.com,['Et On'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://hempindustrydaily.com/usda-national-thc-test-for-hemp-as-challenging-as-you-think-it-is/,"Federal agriculture authorities are struggling to craft a nationwide THC testing standard so that state and local regulators can tell hemp from marijuana, complicating the release of standardized production rules, according to an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

William Richmond, head of the Specialty Crops Program in the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, told a group of dietary-supplement and CBD business owners last week the agency hoped to have hemp rules prepared by now.

But he said the agency is grappling with the Farm Bill‘s requirement for a national THC testing protocol “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“We need to have testing procedures in place,” he said. Coming up with reliable testing methods, he added, is “as complicated as you think it is.”

Richmond gave no timeline for the USDA finishing its work, but he said after his speech the USDA still plans to have rules done in time for the 2020 growing season,

The USDA has been “bombarded with questions” about hemp, he added, and is “working hard to issue the hemp regulations.”

He reminded the CBD companies that the USDA’s hemp regulations won’t be final until the industry has had an opportunity to see them and share feedback.

“Tell us what we got right – and, more important, tell us what we got wrong, because we have the opportunity to fix it,” Richmond said.

Which THC?

THC testing has proved a major challenge in moving the hemp industry to a standardized commodity.

Law enforcement authorities from Texas to Florida have said they don’t have tests that can differentiate between legal hemp and illegal marijuana, and the patchwork of testing standards is complicating the Farm Bill’s goal of allowing nationwide commerce for the new crop.

“What we grow in Oregon needs to be able to go to Colorado, to Kentucky, to whatever state and not run into issues with law enforcement,” said Sunny Summers, who coordinates hemp policy for the Oregon Department of Agriculture.

She also said during her talk at a CBD conference in Denver sponsored by the American Herbal Products Association that THC testing is “a big, big situation that as an industry we need to deal with.”

The Farm Bill’s direction, she said, doesn’t tell states how to prepare tests “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“This is the No. 1 issue that I have – what the heck does that mean?” Summers said. “What is THC? Which version?”

Industry fears

THC testing protocols coming from the USDA could dramatically shake up the growing hemp industry, growers say.

That’s because most U.S. hemp farmers are producing cultivars rich in cannabinoids other than THC – the same types of hemp most likely to violate THC limits depending how and when they are tested.

If post-decarboxylized tests are used, “most of the cultivars and most of the varieties that we’re currently using in the U.S. would no longer be defined as hemp,” said Matt Cyrus, who raises hemp along with hay and cattle in Sisters, Oregon.

Cyrus told Hemp Industry Daily that the USDA’s looming hemp rules could throw many entrepreneurs back to the black market, depending on the testing standard.

“In theory, everybody who has hemp biomass on hand anywhere in the U.S. … would suddenly be outside the law,” said Cyrus, who is also president of the Deschutes County (Oregon) Farm Bureau.

USDA wants to make it easy

Richmond of the USDA told dietary supplement manufacturers that the agency understands how complex it is to set a national THC testing standard, but he promised that federal authorities are scrambling to give farmers and state and local regulators a solution that simplifies interstate hemp commerce.

“Our goal is to provide a consistent, easy-to-follow regulatory framework around hemp production,” he said.

“I can’t speak to whether that means a hard, prescriptive set of requirements for everybody at this stage. But our goal is to provide consistent standards that make sense for growers and for the industry.”"
Byron Allen Rips Comcast & Donald Trump’s DOJ For “Institutionalized Racism” As SCOTUS Showdown Looms,https://deadline.com,"['Dominic Patten Mike Fleming Jr', 'Dominic Patten', 'Mike Fleming Jr']",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://deadline.com/2019/08/byron-allen-comcast-civil-rights-lawsuit-supreme-court-filing-reaction-doj-donald-trump-1202671369/,"With the nation's highest court aiming to look at the ongoing lawsuit between the NBCU owner & Entertainment Studios, the DOJ has now waded in

EXCLUSIVE: Heading towards a $20 billion showdown with Comcast at the U.S. Supreme Court this fall in his long running racial discrimination lawsuit against the media giant, Byron Allen today tore into the Brian Roberts-run behemoth and an 11th hour intervention by the Department of Justice

“This is historic,” the Entertainment Studios boss said of the August 15 brief filed by the feds seeking to tighten the definitions of a Reconstruction Era statute in Comcast’s favor. “Donald Trump’s DOJ and Comcast are working together to destroy a civil rights statute in the U.S. Supreme Court.”

“You have one of the biggest media companies in the world, which has been beating up Donald Trump for racism, and now they are saying, we will work together to maintain institutionalized racism in America, in this Amicus Brief they delivered last Thursday,” Allen asserted in the starkest of terms of the now William Barr-run DOJ and its move to tip the scales for Comcast as the parties await a November 13 hearing before the nine Justices.

The newly declared emphasis by the DOJ now puts a more than 150-year law in a distinctly different light from how Allen’s lawyers have been reading it, as the Department’s filing openly says.

“Although the statute does not expressly describe the necessary causal link between a plaintiff ’s race and a defendant’s refusal to contract, the text is most naturally read to require but-for causation, and background common-law principles confirm that a but-for rule applies,” the incensory submission last week from Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Assistant AG Joseph Hunt argues (read it here).

“The court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise,” the DOJ brass state of lower court ruling in February in the huge money suit that Allen first filed in early 2015, along with a $10 billion suit against Charter Communications several months later. Comcast and Charter sought to have the matter dismissed. When they failed in that effort to end a case that they framed as a form of corporate expression, the MSNBC-owner took the battle to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Associate Justices.

The government detailed its POV by saying last week that “because ‘making’ a contract means entering a contract, a person does not enjoy ‘the same right’ guaranteed by Section 1981 if race prevents her from entering a contract that a similarly situated white person would have entered. And the inverse is also true.”

The feds’ brief leaning into the law to require that Entertainment Studios has to prove that race was not merely a motivating factor, as 9th Circuit interpreted the statute earlier this summer. Now, under the DOJ’s take of the stature, Allen’s lawyers could be required to prove that race was absolutely only reason that Comcast didn’t place the company’s channels on its distribution services and platforms.

For Allen, the result is a near impossible standard for Entertainment Studios or any other person or entity availing themselves of the statute as it presently stands.

“They said, we need to go to the Supreme Court and change the definition of the statute so African Americans cannot use it and we can compromise everyone’s civil rights,” Allen told Deadline of the sudden paperwork by the DOJ, offering the Comcast and their well-funded lobbyists in D.C. an advantage at the Supreme Court.

“Comcast, in the name of profits, is compromising everyone’s civil rights,” the CEO and Joe Biden-donor proclaimed. “If you think you have a good case, take me to court. Deal with me. Don’t jeopardize everybody’s civil rights.”

Contacted by Deadline, Comcast had no comment on the DOJ brief or Allen’s remarks about the filing. Entertainment Studios themselves have until next month to respond to the feds’ filing and Comcast’s own docket entry citing the Appeal Court reading of the post-Civil War statute as too broad.

Following a surprising reversal of fortune this winter where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal essentially brought the case back to life, SCOTUS agreed in June that they would review the matter after a request by Philadelphia-based and very well politically connected Comcast.

With the initial filing of his cases in 2015 and 2016, Allen’s contention has been that both Comcast and Charter violated the Civil Rights Act after he attempted for years to get the cable giants to carry his networks, which were available to millions of television viewers through rival distributors including Verizon, the now AT&T-owned DirecTV and DISH. The African-American executive said he has been repeatedly rebuffed and jerked around and states clearly that he believes race played a factor because Entertainment Studios is a fully minority owned entity.

Both Comcast and Charter in their respective suits have said race was not a factor in the carriage deals or lack there of.

Allen and Entertainment Studios are represented in the case by a team from Miller Bardondess LLP and University of California Berkley School of Law’s Erwin Chemerinsky. Attorneys from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP are working for Comcast in the matter."
Two Iowa Congresswomen calling for investigation on EPA exemptions,https://kwwl.com,"['Taylor Vessel', 'Multimedia Reporter']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://kwwl.com/news/2019/08/20/two-iowa-congresswomen-calling-for-investigation-on-epa-exemptions/,"(KWWL) – According to her office, Representative Abby Finkenauer has signed a letter that will be sent to the Government Accountability Office asking for an investigation into small refinery exemptions handed down by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The letter is signed by a number of members of the House Biofuels Caucus including Democrat Iowa Representative Cindy Axne and Illinois Republican Representative Mike Bost.

An excerpt from the letter details an increase in waivers in the last few years:

“Between 2013 and 2015, the EPA granted no more than 8 waivers for any given year. The current Administration retroactively approved 19 waivers for 2016, then proceeded to grant 35 waivers in 2017, and now 31 waivers for 2018—exempting a total of nearly 4 billion gallons of fuel from the RFS. The number of waivers approved has grown exponentially with major corporations like ExxonMobil and Chevron among those that received these economic hardship exemptions. This raises real questions about the review process and what other factors that the EPA is considering in approving the waivers.”

An article posted to the EPA’s website this month says small oil refineries can receive an exemption from annual Renewable Volume Obligations if they can prove that complying with those obligations would cause them financial hardship.

RVOs are defined by the group Growth Energy as follows:

Each summer, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a proposal governing how much renewable energy should be available to consumers in the year ahead. These targets are called Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) and they determine how many gallons of biofuel refiners will add to the motor fuel mix. After a proposal is issued, the agency then accepts comments from the public before issuing a final rule making under the RFS.

The letter from Finkenauer goes to say that an investigation “will bring much-needed transparency to the waiver approval process.”

Rep. Finkenauer also released this statement after the EPA announced 31 new refinery exemptions:

“President Trump came to Iowa, looked my friends and neighbors in the eye and promised them he would protect the Renewable Fuel Standard. He gave them his word, and that should have meant something. Tonight, that promise is officially broken. His administration just allowed ANOTHER 31 refineries to ignore the law and exempted them from having to blend Iowa’s ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply. This protects big oil’s profits while devastating Iowa’s growers, who are already being hurt by the president’s never-ending trade war that he started, without a clear plan, on Twitter.” “I’m calling for the Government Accountability Office to step in and investigate this attack on the Renewable Fuel Standard which is hurting our farmers’ livelihoods & our environment.”

The Iowa Corn Growers Association also weighed in.

“Granting of the additional 31 refinery exemptions are ridiculous and a slap in the face to farmers,” said Curt Mether, President of the Iowa Corn Growers Association and a farmer from Logan, Iowa. “The RFS could be one of the most effective energy policies in our country’s history, but the waivers gut the policy and destroy corn demand for farmers that are faced not only with challenges from mother nature but market destruction. It is time for President Trump to step in and uphold his promise to farmers and to the RFS.”

Dept. of Energy recommends keeping your thermostat set to 78 or higher,https://www.abc15.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/dept-of-energy-recommends-keeping-your-thermostat-set-to-78-or-higher,"PHOENIX — What temperature do you keep your thermostat at?

A new report from the Department of Energy suggests keeping your home no cooler that 78 degrees, even during the summer months in Arizona.

The report is aimed at helping people save money during the summer, while trying to keep you cool at the same time.

The DOE recommends keeping your home at 78 or warmer while you’re inside, and turning it up several degrees while you’re at work or away from home.

Here are five tips from the DOE to save money on your energy bill:



On hot days, avoid using the oven; cook on the stove, use a microwave oven, or grill outside.

Take advantage of daylight instead of artificial lighting, but avoid direct sunlight.

Wash only full loads of dishes and clothes. Consider air drying both dishes and clothing.

If you use air conditioning, a ceiling fan will allow you to raise the thermostat setting about 4°F with no reduction in comfort.

Install window coverings to prevent heat gain through your windows.

Dollar weakens as U.S. yields resume slide,https://www.reuters.com,"['Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss', 'Min Read']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-global-forex/dollar-near-three-week-peak-as-global-stimulus-talk-lifts-yields-idUSKCN1VA023,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar declined on Tuesday, in line with the drop in Treasury yields, as investors braced for a potentially dovish Federal Reserve at a Jackson Hole, Wyoming, gathering later this week, with many expecting an announcement of some measure that would ease U.S. recession concerns.

Risk aversion crept into the market a day after investors cheered the prospect of new stimulus measures from global central banks to shore up their struggling economies.

Markets also cautiously awaited Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday in Jackson Hole.

“There are a lot of recession signs and the expectation is that Chairman Powell will address them and probably say we are looking to cut,” said Juan Perez, senior FX trader and analyst at Tempus Inc in Washington.

“What the market is trying to digest is that there are serious signs that have been here with a precedent prior to a recession. Of course, the inverted curve is a major one. Ultimately, safe havens are going to keep going up,” he added.

That said, market sentiment was not as distressing as that of last week, some analysts said, when the U.S. bond yield curve inverted, a sign many investors say presages a recession.

The curve of 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields, however, was steeper on Tuesday US2US10=RR, but could invert again based on past cycles.

“We think a long yen exposure makes sense ahead of the Fed’s Jackson Hole event,” Scotiabank said in a research note.” If Fed Chairman Powell sounds dovish, U.S. yields and the U.S. dollar should fall; if he sounds more hawkish, safe havens should rally.”

In afternoon trading, the dollar fell 0.4% against the yen to 106.24 yen JPY= and was down 0.4% versus the Swiss franc at 0.9777 franc CHF=.

The dollar index was down 0.2% at 98.166 after earlier rising to a 2-1/2-week high of 98.40. It reached its 2019 high of 98.932 at the beginning of the month.

The euro rose 0.2% against the dollar to $1.1102 EUR= after Italy's prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced his resignation on Tuesday even as he made a blistering attack on his own interior minister, Matteo Salvini. Conte accused Salvini of sinking the ruling coalition and endangering the economy for personal and political gain.

The pound was down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.2170 GBP=D3 and slipped 0.1% versus the euro to 91.20 pence EURGBP=D3.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson fired the opening salvo in his bid to renegotiate the country’s divorce terms from the EU, saying the “backstop” - an insurance policy included in Britain’s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU to avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland - should be replaced with a pledge."

""A lot of people prepare their salads around the sink, so it's cross-contaminated,"" said Mindy Brashears, deputy undersecretary for food safety at the USDA.

10 PHOTOS 9 Foods You Should Never Eat Raw See Gallery 9 Foods You Should Never Eat Raw So read on to learn about nine foods that you shouldn’t eat raw, and why. Chicken Between the processing plant and the supermarket, raw chicken can pick up lots and lots of nasty little bugs that can send you to the hospital if eaten, so you should make sure that all chicken is cooked to at least 165 degrees. And there’s no need to rinse off chicken before you cook it: the bacteria will be killed during cooking, and the splashing water could infect your whole kitchen. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Chaya Chaya is a ""superfood"" found in the Yucatan that was a favorite of the Mayans but hasn’t really caught on in the United States (yet). It’s similar to spinach, only it’s much stronger-tasting and only very small quantities of it can be eaten raw. Why? The leaves contain cyanide, which is obviously a deadly poison in large quantities. Boiling the leaves for five minutes neutralizes the toxin. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Yucca Just like Chaya, yucca (or cassava root) also contains cyanide, or cyanogenic glycosides to be exact. High levels of the toxin are found in its leaves, which prevents it from being eaten by insects and animals, but some also makes its way into the edible root as well. In order to make this starchy tuber edible, it must be dried, soaked in water, rinsed, and cooked as soon as possible after harvest. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Eggs Sure, Rocky might down raw eggs on a daily basis, but that doesn’t mean it’s smart. While they’re loaded with protein, raw eggs also have the possibility of containing salmonella, which infects about one out of every 30,000 eggs. And because it’s in the yolk, those who are concerned should never eat their yolks runny either. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Pits/Seeds of Apples, Mangos, Peaches, Pears, and Apricots These you really shouldn’t eat at all; forget about cooking them first. If you crack open seeds and pits from fruits that contain them, the inside is soft and appears to be edible. But don’t eat it: it contains a chemical called amygdalin that can turn into — you guessed it — cyanide (who knew that so many foods contained cyanide?). Thankfully, you’d need to eat a whole lot of peach pits in order to get sick, but we wouldn’t chance it. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Green Potatoes You know how sometimes older potatoes can begin to turn a funky shade of green? Yeah, you don’t want to eat that part. When potatoes get too much sunlight, a chemical called solanine can build up to toxic levels, and that’s what the green is. If consumed, it can lead to headache, fatigue, nausea, and stomach issues. Store your potatoes in a cool, dry place and you’ll avoid this problem. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Pork Pork no longer needs to be cooked to well-done, but you should still cook it past the medium point. Pork still has the potential to carry a couple of bugs: trichinosis, a roundworm; and pork tapeworm, which can grow up to 6 feet long in the gut of a pig. If the meat is eaten undercooked, it can transmit the parasite to you, with some unpleasant side effects. These diseases largely hail from the days when pigs were allowed to eat garbage, and have largely been eradicated by modern processing. It’s still risky, though, and rare pork doesn’t taste very good, either. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Raw Red Kidney Beans If you were to take a few raw kidney beans off the vine and eat them, not only would they taste gross, but within a couple hours you’d be nauseous, vomiting, and have an upset stomach. The culprit? A natural toxin called lectin. Soak the beans in water for at least five hours before cooking and you’ll be fine. Image Credit: iStockPhoto/Thinkstock Rhubarb Leaves You might have heard that rhubarb is poisonous when raw, but it’s actually the leaves you should avoid at all costs. The leaves contain insanely high levels of a toxin called oxalic acid, which when consumed can cause serious kidney damage, and possibly even death. Even a small amount can make you sick, and 10 or so pounds is enough to kill you.

The USDA partnered with North Carolina State University to investigate how home cooks handle raw meat, and how those practices affect nearby food.

The researchers recruited 300 people to prepare chicken and a salad in test kitchens at N.C. State. Some participants watched food safety videos ahead of time that discouraged rinsing raw chicken. Most of those participants followed the advice.

But among the control group — those who did not get the safety messages — 61 percent rinsed their raw meat. And nearly 30 percent of those participants' salads were later found to be contaminated with bacteria from the chicken.

""How many times have you been peeling a vegetable and drop it into the sink, and you just pick it up and go on,"" Brashears said. ""At that point, you've contaminated your vegetables.""

11 PHOTOS Don't Get Food Poisoning! Ten Tips to Help Avoid It See Gallery Don't Get Food Poisoning! Ten Tips to Help Avoid It Exposure to air is the enemy of food storage, and if a seal is broken or a can is dented, that’s a good sign that air (and potential foodborne pathogens) are making their way in. Bulges can be a sign of rampant bacterial activity inside the can. Even if the food looks okay when you open the can, don’t eat it. Wash Your Hands Always wash your hands before eating anything, because if you don’t, you’ll also be eating everything that you’ve touched since the last time you washed your hands. Be especially careful if you’ve handled raw meat — in that case, wash your hands before you touch anything else, not just food. Image Credit: Shutterstock.com Look Out for Cross-Contamination If you’ve cut up raw chicken on a cutting board, common sense should tell you not to go ahead and prepare a salad with that same knife and cutting board without thoroughly washing them first. If anything’s come in contact with raw meat, poultry, fish, or eggs, make sure it gets a thorough scrubbing with soap and hot water. Image Credit: Shutterstock.com Cook Meats Thoroughly Eating undercooked meat, especially chicken, can be a one-way ticket to the emergency room. Make sure that all poultry is cooked to 165 degrees and fish to 145 degrees (sashimi and tartares excepted, of course). And if you’re going to be cooking that steak medium-rare, make sure that it’s from a good source; if you have any doubt, cook it to 160 degrees.

Cheese dip that’s been on that party table for six hours, we’re looking at you. Image Credit: Shutterstock.com Throw Raw Meat Away After Two Days Raw meat is far more susceptible to infestation by bacteria and viruses than cooked meat, and even if it’s in your fridge, it can still go bad. Buy meat on the day you’re planning on cooking it, and don’t leave it in your fridge for longer than overnight. If you know you won’t be using it for a few days, freeze it. Image Credit: Shutterstock.com Use Common Sense The “smell test” is often your first line of defense against food poisoning. If something smells a little funky, don’t risk it. If you take a bite and something seems a little off, throw it out. Trust your instincts; they’re usually correct. Image Credit: Shutterstock.com Only Drink Treated Water “Don’t drink the water” is often the first thing you’ll hear when traveling to a foreign country, and it’s true: you haven’t had any time to build up immunity to potential toxins in the water like the locals have, so stick with the bottled stuff. In the same vein, never drink water from wells, streams, any other source that hasn’t been treated in some way, like chlorination.

It could be toxic, and eating a toxic mushroom can result in consequences from hallucinations to extreme discomfort to death.

Frozen foods, even if they’re cooked first, should still be considered raw, and need to be cooked thoroughly before serving. Even if you’re getting impatient, make sure your frozen foods heat for the specified time. Lukewarm food tastes even worse when served with a side of food poisoning.

Microbiological horror stories

Some of the participants ""washed"" their chicken by soaking it in the sink, either with water only, or adding soap, vinegar or lemon juice.

""These are horror stories from a microbiological standpoint,"" said Ben Chapman, a food safety specialist and professor at N.C. State. Chapman said there's no good evidence that soaking raw chicken in vinegar or lemon juice kills bacteria.

""What surprised me most was just how much food preparation happens in and around a sink after someone washes chicken,"" he said. Often participants rinsed lettuce in a colander in the sink where they'd just had raw chicken.

Contaminated water from the basin then splashes onto the lettuce. ""We in the food safety community didn't really have a good sense of this until the work we did here,"" said Chapman.

No one ate the food prepared in the studies. Investigators went into the test kitchens after the meals were prepared, swabbing the sinks and counters, finding them contaminated even after participants cleaned them.

Spice containers also showed signs of contamination.

18 PHOTOS 18 things in your home that are covered with germs See Gallery 18 things in your home that are covered with germs Sink: It’s where all your kitchen dirt goes (we hope). In fact, it’s home to as many as 500,000 bacteria per square inch. Spray it down often, clean out your food trap, and scrub with scouring powder like Bon Ami at least once a week. (Getty) Cutting boards: Whether you’re chopping meat, veggies or fruit, your cutting board could be Ground Zero for foodborne illness. Prevent cross-contamination by dedicating one board to meats and another to produce. And always wash your board ASAP after using it—especially if you were working with raw meat. Researchers at UC Davis also recommend plastic cutting boards over wood, because they’re easiest to sanitize—they can go in the dishwasher. Clean a wooden cutting board with soap and warm water, dry it quickly, and seal it with butcher-block oil whenever you notice the wood is drying out. (Getty) Countertops: All the action—chopping, mixing, drink-pouring—happens here, so of course they’re covered with little particles of everything. First off, cut the clutter to give crumbs and germs fewer places to hide. Then wipe them with a damp microfiber cloth after every meal. (Getty) Fridge shelves and drawers: Your refrigerator is home to both raw and cooked foods, and if it’s disorganized, they probably come in contact now and then. Store raw meat in a plastic bag to serve as an extra barrier, and stop spoiled food from turning into science experiments by throwing it away as soon as you notice it. Another cool trick we use at our house: Empty and wipe down the shelves and drawers whenever you do a big grocery shop. (Getty) Sponges: They’ve been banned from commercial kitchens—ban them from yours, too. But if you must use a sponge, rinse it with hot water after every swipe. At the end of every day, get it wet and nuke it in the microwave for a minute. Toss it after a few weeks (one week if you’re missing the daily sanitizing routine). (Getty) Dish towels: If you rush through washing your hands, some germs may still be hanging out on them and you’ll transfer those germs to the dish towel. Change dish towels a few times a week, and wash them with hot water when you do the laundry. (Getty) Makeup brushes: They touch your face every day, coming in contact with oils, bacteria and dead skin cells. Wash them with mild soap whenever you notice makeup buildup. (Getty) Towels: Like dish towels, they pick up any germs left after a shower. Plus, if your bathroom has poor air circulation, towels may get musty if they stay damp too long. Wash them in hot water at least once a week. (Getty) Tub: The equivalent of the kitchen sink for your bod, the tub takes in a lot of grime. Wipe it down with a microfiber cloth every day and get rid of mold spots with baking soda or vinegar. (Find dozens more ways to clean with baking soda here.) (Getty) ​​​Floor around the toilet: It gets splashed, plain and simple. For starters, make sure to put the lid down every time you flush. Clean up noticeable spots right away and scrub with bathroom cleaner at least once a week. (Getty) Faucet handles: You touch these before your hands are clean. ‘Nuff said. Wipe them down with a damp microfiber cloth. (Getty) Toothbrush holder: It’s all about gravity: Many of the germs on your toothbrush drip into the holder. Rinse it out daily—do double-duty while you’re brushing your teeth with the other hand. Then sanitize your toothbrush holder in the dishwasher (if it can take it) or give it a good scrub with soap and water. (Getty) Electronics: Smartphones, keyboards, mice, the remote control (OK, let’s be real: 17 remote controls)—germy fingers come in contact with them all the time. In fact, the National Institutes of Health recently found that cellphones are 10 times dirtier than toilet seats. Wipe them with a damp microfiber cloth as often as possible. Don’t forget to remove any cases so you can clean underneath. (Getty) Doorknobs, handles and light switches: Even if your hand only touches these items for a fraction of a second, that’s enough time to transfer bacteria. Once again, a quick wipe-down with a damp microfiber cloth will do. (Getty) Shoe rack: Footwear is a huge culprit for bringing germs into your home, so it’s no surprise that their storage unit is a bacterial breeding ground. Put some elbow grease into cleaning this one and wipe it with bathroom cleaner—you never know what somebody stepped in. (Getty) Carpets and rugs: Even if you’re using the no-shoes rule, carpets suck up every crumb, dead skin cell and germ that hits them. Vacuum weekly and spritz high-traffic areas with a carpet sanitizer. If you can toss rugs into the laundry, do it. (Getty) Bags: Your purse holds money (super dirty!) and your kid’s lunch bag holds food (raise your hand if you ever forget to clean it out over the weekend). Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on cleaning these to keep them in the best shape. (Getty) Toys: No matter whose toys they are—your kid’s or the dog’s—they probably spend a lot of time in somebody’s mouth. Consider what they’re made of, then clean accordingly, tossing them in the laundry, dishwasher, or wiping with a cloth.

The CDC estimates that 48 million people — one in six — get sick from a foodborne illness each year.

Salmonella is the kind of bacteria most people associate with raw poultry, and leads to about a million illnesses in the U.S. annually, according to the CDC. Most have diarrhea, a fever and stomach cramps, and most recover, but nearly 400 die each year from salmonella.

Another type of bacteria, campylobacter, is also found on raw or under-cooked poultry, and accounts for about 1.3 million illnesses every year.

Even food safety experts are at risk. ""I had campylobacter about a decade ago,"" Chapman said. ""I won't go into details, but it was not fun whatsoever.""

""I always saw my mom and dad do it""

The chicken-washing phenomenon is nothing new. Indeed, it's been happening in kitchens for decades.

""Growing up, I always saw my mom and dad do it,"" said Ashley Williams, 23, a grad student at N.C. State.

The USDA and N.C. State recreated the study to illustrate their findings for NBC News. Both Williams and Ross were participants, and both rinsed their raw chicken.

""I've just always done it this way,"" Ross said. ""That's what people around me did when I was growing up. I picked it up from the culture.""

And it's likely those decades of chicken-washing caused illnesses that went unreported.

""You've probably gotten sick from food and just don't know it,"" Brashears said. ""People say, 'Oh, I had a 24-hour flu' and never went to the doctor.""

Children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems are most at risk for foodborne illness.

Food safety experts say it's critical to re-educate the next generation, and get kids into the kitchen to teach them not only how to cook, but how to do it safely.

""Just because your mom did it doesn't mean you have to do it,"" said Brashears. ""You can be the one who causes change and stops the cycle of foodborne illness.""

Other ways to reduce the risk of cross-contamination include:

washing hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water, drying hands with a paper towel, then throwing the paper towel away

sanitizing the sink and kitchen counters before and after food preparation

using a meat thermometer to make sure chicken reaches 165 degrees

using separate cutting boards and utensils for raw meat and other food.

Dems accuse DOJ of trying to hobble Congress’ oversight to protect Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/20/dems-doj-congress-trump-1469789,"President Donald Trump sued the House Oversight and Reform Committee earlier this year, in his personal capacity. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo Congress Dems accuse DOJ of trying to hobble Congress’ oversight to protect Trump

The Justice Department is ignoring centuries of investigations into presidents in an attempt to dramatically curtail Congress’ power to probe President Donald Trump, House Democrats argued Tuesday.

In a court filing, House lawyers said the Justice Department’s call to invalidate a subpoena for Trump’s financial records was so sweeping it would essentially inoculate presidents from congressional inquiry — reversing precedents that began with George Washington, who submitted to congressional inquiry.

Story Continued Below

“These arguments are fabricated out of whole cloth: they may represent what the department wishes the law were, but they are not the law,” House lawyers wrote, accusing the Justice Department of trying to rewrite Congress’ authority to investigate a sitting president.

Trump sued the House Oversight and Reform Committee earlier this year in his personal capacity after Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) issued a subpoena to accounting firm Mazars USA, seeking several years of the president’s financial records. The subpoena came after the president’s former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen accused Trump of artificially inflating and deflating the values of his assets in order to win approval for loans — including one in a bid to buy the Buffalo Bills — or reduce his overall tax burden.

District Judge Amit Mehta, an appointee of President Barack Obama, upheld the committee’s subpoena in May, but Trump’s attorneys appealed the decision. The case is being heard at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Trump’s personal lawyers contend the committee overstepped its authority by subpoenaing the president’s personal records, arguing the committee failed to identify a legitimate “legislative purpose” to support its demands. Last week, the Justice Department echoed those arguments, suggesting courts should look dubiously at any efforts by Congress to “regulate the president.”

Trump’s personal legal team endorsed the Justice Department’s argument in a separate filing Tuesday, urging the court to give great weight to DOJ’s claims.

“The lack of any historical support for a legislative subpoena from a standing committee of Congress for the president’s records — directed to a third-party custodian no less — raises constitutional red flags,” Trump’s lawyers wrote, calling the committee’s demands “blunderbuss” and unreasonably broad.

In response, House general counsel Douglas Letter and his deputies rejected that as “an astounding and novel theory of limited congressional power to conduct investigations and oversight.”

Letter invoked the St. Clair investigation of 1792, when Washington acknowledged that a House inquiry for presidential papers could be valid “as the public good would permit.” He went on to cite an 1861 investigation of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, the Pearl Harbor investigation of 1945, Congress’ access to Richard Nixon’s tax returns, the Iran-Contra investigation of 1987 and the Whitewater investigation that began in 1995 as examples of presidents being targeted by — and at times responsive to — congressional inquiries.

“Presidents from George Washington on (unlike Mr. Trump) have understood that Congress has the power to conduct investigations and oversight of the president as part of the constitutional design,” the attorneys added.

Letter also noted that the argument from Trump’s personal attorneys and the Justice Department suggest Congress must already know the legislation it wants to pass before it has gathered any facts in its investigation.

“The department’s test is at odds with the Supreme Court’s express recognition that legislatures need facts to legislate wisely—facts that are frequently obtained through investigations,” House lawyers wrote.

They argued, as they have in previous court filings, that Congress has broad investigative authority as a co-equal branch of government.

“The Oversight Committee’s subpoena is an exercise of the House’s Article I power and not an attempt to usurp Executive power,” the House attorneys wrote.

Three Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday taking issue with reported changes that they warned could ""benefit wealthy industry groups at the expense of everyday Americans unable to afford lengthy litigation battles.""

The letter follows reports that the EPA is preparing a final regulation that would no longer allow individuals or communities to challenge the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) on any decisions about how much pollution is legally allowed at nearby power plants. However, the rule would reportedly allow the industry to continue to appeal denials.

“We believe the reported changes would threaten human health and the environment,” the lawmakers wrote Tuesday.

They added that the House panel is “troubled by EPA’s reported efforts to limit the ability of communities to challenge the Agency’s permitting decisions.”

“Additionally, we are concerned that EPA is contemplating actions which could undermine the EAB’s ability to effectively and independently adjudicate permits, limit the scope and nature of EAB’s review, or foreclose administrative appeals altogether,” they wrote.

While the EPA has not finalized the regulation, it is expected to be released soon.

The EPA did not immediately return requests for comment on the lawmakers’ letter. The agency has not officially confirmed or denied the existence of the forthcoming rule.

“EPA is always interested in improving its processes while maintaining environmental protection. Contrary to the speculation by certain parties, EPA is working to protect the public interest and transparently carry out its work,” a spokesman said in a statement in July.

An internal June 19 EPA email obtained by The Hill characterized the proposed procedural rule as an attempt to “streamline and modernize the role of the Environmental Appeals Board in EPA’s permitting process.”

The email sent to staff from Carol Ann Siciliano, the EPA’s acting deputy general counsel for environmental media and regional law offices, noted that the rule proposal was a top priority for EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA walks back use of 'cyanide bombs' to protect livestock from wild animals EPA proposes rolling back states' authority over pipeline projects New Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals' MORE.

SAN FRANCISCO— The U.S. again granted Huawei Technologies a reprieve, extending by 90 days the temporary license program that allows the Chinese telecommunications giant to buy chips and other components from U.S. suppliers.

The U.S. Commerce Department, which announced the extension Monday, said the temporary general license was being extended ""to afford consumers across America the necessary time to transition away from Huawei equipment, given the persistent national security and foreign policy threat.""

The Trump Administration in May added Huawei to its ""entity list,"" blacklisting the company from doing business with U.S. companies due to concerns about Huawei's affiliation with Chinese intelligence services. Huawei has long been suspected by U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials of ties to the Chinese government and the potential for Huawei's technology to be used for espionage.

Huawei Ban Could Come Back to Bite U.S.

The ban is widely expected to have a crippling effect on Huawei, which incorporate chips from U.S. companies in much of its infrastructure equipment and smartphone handsets. The Commerce Department on Monday also added 46 additional Huawei affiliates to the entity list.

The temporary general license, which was first announced in May, just days after Huawei was blacklisted, authorizes ""specific, limited engagements in transactions involving the export, reexport, and transfer of items to Huawei and its non-U.S. affiliates on the entity list, according to the Commerce Department.

“As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption,” said Wilbur Ross, secretary of commerce, in a statement. “Simultaneously, we are constantly working at the department to ensure that any exports to Huawei and its affiliates do not violate the terms of the entity listing or temporary general license.”

The semiconductor industry has lobbied the Trump Administration heavily to make exceptions to the export restrictions on Huawei, particularly involving less critical technologies were they argue there is no threat to national security. Chip industry insiders were also critical of the terms of the general temporary license when it was announced in May, with many suggesting it was too vague and too restrictive.

John Neuffer

On Monday, Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) CEO John Neuffer said through a statement that the SIA continues to urge the administration to ""take prompt action on license approvals where there is no nexus to national security."" Neuffer noted that President Trump said at the G-20 meeting in May, that U.S. companies should be allowed to sell products to Huawei as long as the sale does not negatively impact U.S. national security.

“While we are reviewing the announcement today and its implications for the semiconductor industry, we urge the Commerce Department to expedite the review, approval, and issuance of licenses for sales of commercial products that do not raise national security concerns, particularly for items that can be easily substituted by foreign competition not subject to the entity listing,"" Neuffer said.

The Reuters news service initially reported last week that the Commerce Department would extend the temporary general license to allow U.S. companies to continue selling to Huawei. However, Trump said over the weekend that there would be no extension to the general license."
US must re-seize Iran's illicit oil vessel,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/us-must-re-seize-irans-illicit-oil-vessel,"President Trump should direct the U.S. military to re-seize an Iranian oil tanker released from British custody this weekend.

The tanker, Grace 1, now renamed Adrian Darya 1, was seized by the British Royal Navy in July for attempting to transport more than $100 million in oil to Syria. That transportation breached European Union sanctions on the Syrian regime. Unfortunately, last weekend, the British government released the tanker from its Gibraltar territory. It said Iran had provided assurances that the oil will no longer go to Assad. Maritime tracking websites show the Adrian Darya 1 now en-route to the Greek port of Kalamata.

But Iran cannot be trusted here.

A U.S. indictment against Adrian Darya 1 attests that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has used the vessel to illicitly and covertly transport oil across the globe. The revenue generated by those sales has then filled IRGC coffers, enabling its conduct of hostile activity. The indictment also clarifies how Iran has sought to conceal the vessel's purpose and destination, even engaging in at-sea ship-to-ship transfers. This is sanctions-busting 101.

It is highly likely that at some point over the next few weeks the Iranians will again attempt to offload the vessel's oil in furtherance of new revenue generation. But the now-unsealed indictment means U.S. credibility is also now tied to Adrian Darya 1's future. Were the U.S. to thus allow the Adrian Darya 1 to offload its oil cargo, the IRGC would regard their success as testifying to American weakness. That cannot be allowed to happen.

This isn't about posturing, it's about holding firm to a policy that is paying dividends. The Trump administration has successfully balanced an interest in avoiding conflict with Iran with pressuring Iran's return to negotiations over its nuclear program. That requires a balancing act between avoiding unnecessary escalation while also deterring the IRGC-aligned Iranian hardliner faction. But if the IRGC sees that the U.S. is cowed by its threats not to intervene against the Adrian Darya 1, it will be encouraged to the belief that Trump is hesitant to challenge Iranian breaches of his aggression. In turn, it will also have better opportunity to undercut escalating efforts by more-moderate Iranian figures to seek a compromise with the United States.

Why, the hardliners will say, should we compromise when we can test American resolve and find it wanting?

Trump must send the U.S. Navy into action."

In a process that began in June 2017, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) collected and tested more than 3,600 samples, according to an update this week. The sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that it will no longer sample or test the specific products for Salmonella and Campylobacter.

“FSIS found that generally religious exempt poultry products and a subset of the low volume products sampled have a higher than national average rate of Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination,” the government reported.

But, saying those products make up a small portion of the country’s food supply, the USDA does not plan to take action toward regulation. A campaign to raise awareness is planned instead.

“The agency does not intend to propose performance standards for these products at this time,” according to the update.

“FSIS will use these results to conduct outreach with the industry and consumers to encourage the safe production and handling of these raw poultry products.”

The FSIS testing project specifically involved religious exempt chicken carcasses and low-volume poultry products. The agency “will no longer sample or test the products for Salmonella and Campylobacter.”

Neither religious exempt carcasses nor chicken products produced in low-volume operations are not subject to the government’s Salmonella contamination standards that apply to other chicken. Chicken carcasses that are religiously exempt from certain federal laws already do not receive the USDA inspection mark, which is printed inside the agency’s seal on non-exempt chicken.

Low-volume products are defined by federal code as being produced with an average daily volume of 1,000 pounds or less. The FSIS tested more than 3,600 samples of low-production chicken.

Beginning in June 2017, FSIS collected more than 150 samples from religious exempt chicken carcasses and tested them for Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination.

Both Salmonella and Campylobacter can cause serious illnesses and sometimes death in humans."

Commerce Department extends reprieve to let US companies work with Huawei,https://www.cnet.com,['Sean Keane'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnet.com/news/us-commerce-department-extends-reprieve-allowing-companies-to-sell-to-huawei/,"Óscar Gutiérrez/CNET

The US Commerce Department said Monday it's extending a temporary general license that allows American companies to do business with Huawei for another 90 days. This follows an initial 90-day reprieve, which started in May and was set to end Monday.

The department blacklisted Huawei following an executive order from President Donald Trump that effectively banned Huawei from US communications networks. It required American companies to get a license to do business with the Chinese telecom giant, which is the subject of national security concerns due to its cozy relationship with the Chinese government. Huawei has also announced that it's making its own mobile operating system.

Now playing: Watch this: What is going on between Huawei and the US?

""As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei's products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption,"" Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement Monday. ""Simultaneously, we are constantly working at the department to ensure that any exports to Huawei and its affiliates do not violate the terms of the entity listing or temporary general license.""

The department also said another 46 Huawei subsidiaries have been added to the list due to national security concerns, bringing the total to more than 100 added since May, the department said.

Huawei called the US government's actions unjust and said the decision to put more of its subsidiaries on the entity list was politically motived.

""These actions violate the basic principles of free market competition,"" the company said in a statement on Monday. ""They are in no one's interests, including US companies.""

Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Employment Discrimination Against Transgender Workers,https://time.com,['Tara Law'],,,,https://time.com/5654844/title-vii-trump-transgender-department-of-justice-supreme-court/,"The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court to set a legal precedent that would enable employers to fire employees because they are transgender.

The Department of Justice has submitted a brief to the Court Friday asking the Justices to rule that Title VII, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, does not protect transgender people. The department argued that they should throw out a lower court ruling that found that a funeral home that fired a transgender woman had discriminated against her.

The brief concerns R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one of three cases that the Supreme Court agreed to hear earlier this year that concern whether Title VII can be applied to LGBTQ workers.

In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found that the owner of the funeral home, Thomas Rost, had violated the law when he fired Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who worked for the company from 2007 to 2013. According to court documents, Stephens sent the company a letter in 2013 that said she struggled with a “gender identity disorder” and planned to begin to live as a woman, including by wearing the company’s female uniform – a jacket and skirt – instead of a suit and tie.

The company argued that Stephens was fired because she refused to wear the company’s dress code and argued that “[m]aintaining a professional dress code that is not distracting to grieving families is an essential industry requirement that furthers their healing process.”

In its brief, the Department of Justice has argued in favor of the funeral home, arguing that Title VII only protects what it defines as “biological sex.”

“In 1964 [when Title VII was enacted], the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the DOJ writes, clarifying, “In the particular context of Title VII—legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities—it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of “sex” referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.”

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Stephens, told HuffPo that the case could weaken Title VII protections both for transgender people and other groups.

“People don’t realize that the stakes are extending not just the trans and LGB communities, but every person who departs from sex stereotypes: Women who want to wear pants in the workplace, men who want more childbearing responsibilities,” Strangio said.

Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/457997-recessions-happen-when-presidents-overlook-key-problems,"Well, President Trump Donald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE is at it again—lashing out at commentators who suggest a recession could be coming. He believes that such talk is merely alarmist criticism meant to scuttle his reelection. But the president and his staff have access to the best economic data. And there are clear signs in the data that a slowdown may be on the way.

No doubt, uncertainty about the ongoing trade conflict with China isn’t helping things. Trump has applied tariffs en masse against Chinese imports. While tariffs can assist specific industries when utilized in a targeted, strategic manner, his broad duties on most products from China have backfired. The tariffs are beginning to hurt U.S. consumers, as well as farmers and other exporters.

Even with the tariffs, the U.S. manufacturing sector is slowing. The July manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management came in at its lowest level since August 2016.

ADVERTISEMENT

But there’s more. Despite the Trump tariffs, the U.S. trade deficit is still climbing, particularly with China. The U.S. goods trade deficit reached $875 billion in 2018, an increase of 10 percent in the past year alone.

Realistically, much of the recent growth in the U.S. economy was fueled by a large cash injection from the December 2017 tax cut along with increased federal spending. The administration’s subsequent, large-scale borrowing has also thrown more loose money into the economy. But these short-term, stimulatory effects are now starting to wash out.

Here’s the real problem, though—and why a recession could be drawing closer. The U.S. dollar has become substantially overvalued, in part due to a slowdown in global credit. This stronger dollar is cutting into U.S. manufacturing competitiveness while also lowering farm prices. It’s a serious burden on America’s productive economy. There are signs that the U.S. economy is cooling, and it’s time to consider concrete steps to prevent a downturn.

As the U.S. dollar keeps climbing, imports become cheaper. And U.S. exports grow more expensive. What’s causing this overvaluation is a continuing inflow of foreign capital into America’s financial markets. This flood of private overseas investment is driving up demand for the dollar. And the resulting appreciation is making it harder for domestic manufacturers to sell their goods abroad or to compete against imports that keep growing cheaper here in the U.S.

The situation has actually gotten worse, though, because Trump’s economic policies have actually helped fuel the dollar’s rise. Increased federal borrowing has attracted even more foreign capital, which further strengthens the dollar. The Federal Reserve reports that the dollar has climbed 25 percent in the past five years. And China has also played its ace in the hole, allowing its currency to fall recently, resulting in an overall 11.4 percent decline since March of 2018, when tariffs were first imposed.

ADVERTISEMENT

The president’s policies are now backfiring because the dollar’s rise is offsetting the impact of his tariffs. And in the face of this, the Congressional Budget Office foresees a perfect storm: Rising imports will drive America’s current account deficit up from $449 billion in 2017 to more than $700 billion in 2021. Concurrently, the U.S. goods trade deficit is accelerating, and may exceed $1 trillion within the next two years. And that could tip the nation into a new recession.

Trump has made varying comments about the strength of the dollar. But he’s avoided taking action. And that leaves us with a status quo of rising trade deficits, collapsing farm prices, and the fading effects of a 2017 cash injection.

To avert a possible recession, Washington needs to act. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) have introduced bipartisan legislation that would empower the Federal Reserve to tax foreign purchases of U.S. stocks, bonds, and other assets. That could address the influx of foreign capital investment currently driving the dollar to new heights. And it would gradually lower the U.S. dollar to a competitive, trade-balancing level.

The current trajectory for the U.S. economy is troubling. One way to achieve meaningful action would be to prioritize federal efforts that can restore the competitiveness of America’s productive industries. Lowering the dollar’s value through the recently introduced Senate currency bill offers a promising start.

"As Dicamba Injury Complaints Rise, States' Communication With EPA Declines",https://www.dtnpf.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2019/08/20/dicamba-injury-complaints-rise-epa,"Dicamba injury allegations are reaching new heights in some states this year, but -- unlike last year -- EPA is not regularly polling states on their dicamba investigations and experiences this summer. (DTN photo graphic)

ROCKVILLE, Md. (DTN) -- Once again, most major soybean states are dealing with a deluge of dicamba injury allegations this summer, with at least one already reporting a record level of complaints.

But, unlike last year, the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is not getting routine updates from state regulators on these injury reports. Last year, representatives from the federal agency participated in weekly conference calls with state pesticide regulators on dicamba injury complaints and investigative findings throughout the summer and fall. EPA officials also visited multiple states to tour dicamba injury and hold public forums on the topic.

This year, this regular communication and canvassing has dried up.

""We haven't been asked to provide any information to U.S. EPA headquarters,"" said Doug Owens, chief of the Bureau of Environmental Programs at the Illinois Department of Agriculture, which has fielded more than 450 alleged dicamba injury reports, up nearly 40% from last year and a record for the state. ""I know last year, we reported to them every week with weekly conference calls. We're not participating in that this year, and no information has been requested.""

This experience was echoed by other states, including Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and Minnesota. (State regulators from Nebraska did not respond to DTN's inquiries.) While most states are making informal reports on their experience with dicamba to the representatives in their regional office of the EPA, the national Office of Pesticide Programs, which oversees the dicamba registrations, has had little to no direct communications with most state regulators on this issue. Only the Arkansas Department of Agriculture reported sending 2019 injury statistics to EPA headquarters recently.

In an emailed statement to DTN on July 31, an EPA spokesperson said the agency was still working with states to ""determine the extent and frequency"" of communications on dicamba injury in 2019. But, with the spray season mostly behind them, state regulators told a different story.

Leo Reed, president-elect of the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO) and pesticide licensing manager for the Office of Indiana State Chemist, said the last time EPA communicated with the Indiana agency on dicamba injury was the previous crop season. ""They've not reached out to the state chemist office specifically on that topic since 2018,"" he said.

At a state regulator meeting in June, members of the State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group (SFIREG) said EPA had drafted a one-time dicamba survey for states to submit at the end of the 2019 season, in lieu of the weekly calls conducted in 2018. However, state regulators demanded more information on the purpose of the survey, noting that their efforts to communicate dicamba injury to EPA in 2018 had resulted in few substantial changes to the dicamba registrations. Since those concerns were voiced, EPA has been silent on the topic of a survey or any dicamba information-gathering. ""We were trying to determine what the results would be -- how will the information we collect be used?"" explained Reed. ""And no one at EPA responded. And that's the last we heard of that."""
Brother called FBI to investigate State Department official over hate,https://wtkr.com,['Cnn Wire'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://wtkr.com/2019/08/20/brother-called-fbi-to-investigate-state-department-official-over-hate/,"The brother of a State Department official linked to a white nationalist group by a civil rights organization tells CNN he reported his sibling to the FBI out of concern about his hateful views.

Matthew Gebert, the State Department employee, has been placed on administrative leave from his job as a foreign affairs officer in the Department’s Bureau of Energy Resources after the civil rights organization’s made the claim.

Gebert’s brother, Michael Gebert, told CNN on Thursday that details in the extensive report released last week by the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hatewatch initiative are accurate.

Hatewatch alleged that Matthew Gebert “oversaw the Washington, DC-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online.” According to the report, he used a pseudonym — Coach Finstock — to express “a desire to build a country for whites only.”

‘I was just so angry’

Michael Gebert identified his older brother as the man in a photo Hatewatch posted of white nationalists gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, months before the Unite the Right rally that resulted in the killing of a counter-protestor, 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

Michael Gebert also said it was his brother’s voice speaking as “Coach Finstock” on a white nationalist podcast and confirmed Hatewatch’s reporting that he had contacted the FBI about his brother last month through an electronic tip form on the bureau’s website.

“He’s had all this hate growing and accelerating under his skin,” the younger Gebert told CNN in a phone interview after Hatewatch released a report about his outreach to the FBI. “Everything else is keeping up good appearances.”

He told CNN he made the decision to contact the FBI out of concern for his brother’s children.

“It didn’t take courage to submit a tip to the FBI,” he said. “I was just so angry.”

Michael Gebert says he and his brother have long disagreed over politics.

‘So much evil’

Matters reached a head about a year ago at a family gathering in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, he said. After drinking some alcoholic beverages, he said his brother Matthew began using language about Jews, immigrants and minorities that concerned and frightened him.

Michael Gebert explained “it took everything in me” to not react in a violent manner. He said he told his brother, “Matt, I wanna smash your face in.”

He told Hatewatch of that evening: “I saw so much evil in my brother, I could not f**king deal with it.” Even so, Michael Gebert told CNN he still has some sympathy for his brother.

The State Department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about Michael Gebert’s efforts to warn authorities about his brother’s activities.

The FBI said it does not comment on tips. The agency said it can’t investigate people for holding an ideology or belonging to certain US-based hate groups.

Attempts by CNN to reach Matthew Gebert have been unsuccessful. Hatewatch said in its report that the group’s investigators had been unable to speak to him.

Gebert joined the State Department in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s administration, as a “presidential management fellow,” according to an alumni magazine from his alma mater George Washington University. According to the program’s website, it “attracts and selects the best candidates possible, but is really designed with a more narrow focus – developing a cadre of potential government leaders.”"

USDA to Consumers: Do Not Wash Raw Poultry

By Staff

Today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA FSIS) released its final report analyzing consumer handling of raw poultry.

USDA FSIS contracted with RTI International—a nonprofit organization that provides research and technical services—along with its subcontractor, North Carolina State University. The research involved meal preparation experiments to evaluate consumer food handling behaviors in a test kitchen.

The entire research experiment will be conducted in five separate iterations. The meal preparation portion is part of a larger 5-year annual study that also includes focus groups (two iterations) and web surveys (two iterations). The report released today describes the results of the second iteration of the meal preparation experiment that examined consumers’ washing of poultry when preparing a meal of chicken thighs.

The observational study looked at behaviors in terms of poultry washing, handwashing, cleaning and sanitizing surfaces and equipment, cross-contamination and microbiological analysis, and thermometer use.

USDA says the results of the observational study showed how easily bacteria can be spread when surfaces are not effectively cleaned and sanitized.

“Cooking and mealtime is a special occasion for all of us as we come together with our families and friends,” says Dr. Mindy Brashears, the USDA’s Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety. “However, the public health implications of these findings should be of concern to everyone. Even when consumers think they are effectively cleaning after washing poultry, this study shows that bacteria can easily spread to other surfaces and foods. The best practice is not to wash poultry.”

“Everyone has a role to play in preventing illness from food,” says Administrator Carmen Rottenberg of USDA FSIS. “Please keep in mind that children, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk. Washing or rinsing raw meat and poultry can increase your risk as bacteria spreads around your kitchen, but not washing your hands for 20 seconds immediately after handling those raw foods is just as dangerous.”

Huawei gets another 90-day reprieve from the U.S. Commerce Department [Updated],https://www.androidcentral.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-may-get-another-90-day-reprieve-us-commerce-department,"Update: The Commerce Department has now officially confirmed that the temporary reprieve has indeed been extended by 90 days. According to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the decision was taken to ""minimize disruption"" in rural America that relies on Huawei's telecommunication equipment. At the same time, the Commerce Department has added 46 Huawei subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"", banning U.S. companies from doing business with them.

Original story follows:

The U.S. Commerce Department may soon renew the ""temporary general license"" granted to Huawei by 90 days, according to a new report from Reuters.

Shortly after Huawei was put on the Entity List by the Trump administration in May, the Commerce Department had issued a 90-day reprieve to the company that allowed it to continue purchasing components from American companies. Since the current agreement is set to end today, we expect an official statement from the Commerce Department confirming another 90-day extension to arrive later in the day.

U.S. President Donald Trump, however, is still not keen on allowing U.S. companies to do business with Huawei. Speaking to the media before departing from Morristown, New Jersey, Trump said:"
Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund U.S.’s $1 trillion deficit — and that is a concern,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Joy Wiltermuth', 'Markets Reporter']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-treasury-is-about-to-flood-the-market-with-debt-to-fund-a-1-trillion-deficit-heres-why-that-is-a-worry-2019-08-15,"There may be some limitations to the U.S. government’s borrowing, after all.

An anticipated surge of U.S. borrowing in the global debt markets in the second half of this year is starting to create concern as the Treasury is expected to ramp up its issuance of bills, notes and bonds to fund a soaring $1 trillion budget deficit.

The U.S. government’s budget gap has widened 27% as compared with the first 10 months of fiscal 2018, as spending has risen 8% and receipts have grown by 3%. The federal fiscal year runs October through September. The Trump administration recently forecast a $1 trillion full-year shortfall, while the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more conservative, putting it at $896 billion.

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Not only does the Treasury needs to borrow to cover the fiscal deficit created by Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the inability of Congress to agree on spending cuts, but Treasury needs to rebuild its cash balance which was run down to pay the governments bills when the debt ceiling was hit in May.

The coming deluge of Treasury issuance has stoked worries on Wall Street about whether there is enough liquidity in the system in the short term to meet the supply without pushing up short-term borrowing costs and inverting the yield curve even further.

U.S. dollar liquidity is deteriorating and “is reaching a point where it may require drastic action if measures aren’t taken to address it soon,” warned Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, in a note on Wednesday.

To illustrate the concern, Saroliya pointed to the higher costs already faced by London-based banks lending to one other overnight in dollars, the popular dollar Libor-OIS spread, which has climbed in anticipation of the Treasury glut hitting markets.

This chart shows the rise of the 3-month dollar Libor-OIS spread since May, even as U.S. Treasury cash balances at the Federal Reserve have dropped from about $400 billion to closer to $150 billion.

Oxford Economics International funding squeeze

As the Treasury restores its cash balance with the coming supply, Saroliya expects liquidity woes to worsen, particularly in a scenario where long-term Treasury notes are yielding less than shorter-dated debt.

“With Treasury issuance set to surge in the wake of the recent debt-ceiling deal, an inverted yield curve could create a significant issuance indigestion in the market,” Saroliya wrote.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury 10-year note’s TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.63% yield briefly fell below the 2-year note’s TMUBMUSD02Y, +1.06% yield, an inversion of the funding curve that has foretold past economic slowdowns.

Meanwhile fears of an economic recession rattled U.S. stocks Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.66% closing down 800 points, its biggest one-day fall this year, before some recovery on Thursday morning in the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, -0.79% .

Amid the stock-market rout, the chances of a half-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point rate cut next month.

Despite the rising Treasury debt issuance, investors globally have been buying U.S. government debt, pushing the 30-year U.S. bond TMUBMUSD30Y, +1.11% to a record low around 2% this week, as yields on many other developed-economy bonds are even lower, with about $15 trillion in debt now offered at negative yields.

Slowing global economic growth due to the U.S.-China trade war is resulting in central banks’ easing monetary policy, and an array of geopolitical risks from Brexit, to Italian political instability, to U.S. sanctions on Iran and violent protests in Hong Kong are encouraging investors into the safe haven of U.S. debt.

But in the short-term money markets, the coming flood of U.S. debt issuance may cause indigestion.

Bond dealers who underwrite the Treasury’s debt sales in the weekly auctions are already holding record amounts of U.S. Treasurys on their books as the fiscal deficit has increased. Now their need to borrow more cash in short-term money markets, using Treasuries as collateral, to buy even more government debt is pushing up short-term rates.

A key risk barometer, the U.S. “repo” market, where cash is borrowed overnight using Treasurys for collateral, has signaled that liquidity is tightening.

Repo rates have climbed recently in relation to what the Federal Reserve pay banks to hold excess reserves. The rate that lenders have charged for cash in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements was 2.22% on Tuesday, compared with the 2.1% that the Federal Reserve pays banks to hold excess reserves, known as the IOER rate.

Liquidity may also be tightening in the market for short term borrowing of U.S. dollars internationally, known as the “foreign repo pool” where non-U.S. investors keep cash balances with the Federal Reserve, and the rising costs of currency hedging given the strength of the U.S. dollar may make investing in U.S. Treasury debt less appealing, Saroliya noted.

China and Japan were by far the largest foreign holders of Treasury securities, as of July 16, in the most recent report of holders.

For Saroliya, it all boils down to the Federal Reserve needing to act to preserve liquidity, perhaps by cutting benchmark U.S. rates by another 50 to 100 basis points or through another round of quantitative easing or bond buying.

“And that needs to be immediate!” Saroliya urged.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Cabana also warned that the historically high levels of Treasury securities held by dealers could pose problems when it come to issuing more debt.

“We are concerned that the U.S. banking system is nearing reserve scarcity,” Cabana wrote in a note to clients. Ultimately, he said opening the Treasury “floodgates” would likely “force the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet by year-end.”

To be sure, not everyone sees doom in the U.S. adding to the already $22.4 trillion national debt.

“A lot of Street commentators have highlighted the fact that there is going to be a huge amount of supply in the Treasury market, and how that is going to affect rates,” said Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch.

“When you look at the space though this is a market that most people want to own at some point, especially given the fact that there are $15 trillion of bonds in negative yields,” he said. “It makes the U.S. look really attractive.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc, the largest U.S. airline, will pay $22.1 million to settle claims it falsely reported the times it transferred possession of U.S. mail to foreign postal administrations or other intended recipients, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.

The United States Postal Service contracted with American to take possession of receptacles of U.S. mail at six locations and then deliver it to numerous international and domestic destinations. The settlement resolves claims American Airlines falsely reported the times it transferred possession of the mail. American did not immediately comment Tuesday.

“We expect companies doing business with the government to comply with their contractual obligations,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt, who heads the department’s civil division. “The Department of Justice vigorously pursues all manner of fraudulent conduct that undermines the benefits that the government has bargained for.”

American said in a statement it was pleased it had reached a settlement.

“The allegations focused on conduct that was remedied years ago, and we have invested in new equipment and procedures to ensure that we are in full compliance with our commitments,” the statement said. It added that “the U.S. Postal Service is an important customer for American, and we are glad to have corrected these procedures and put this matter behind us.”

American said in a securities filing the Justice Department in April 2015 notified the airline it was investigating American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the U.S. Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air.

The contract required American to take possession of mail at U.S. locations or at various Department of Defense and State Department locations abroad, and then deliver that mail to numerous international and domestic destinations.

“To obtain payment under the contracts, American Airlines was required to submit electronic scans of the mail receptacles to USPS reporting the time the mail was delivered at the specified destinations. The contracts specified penalties for mail that was delivered late or to the wrong location,” the Justice Department said.

“The U.S. Postal Service contracts with commercial airlines for the safeguarding and timely delivery of U.S. Mail to foreign posts, including the mail sent to our soldiers deployed to foreign operating bases,” said Scott Pierce, special agent in Charge, USPS Office of Inspector General."
It shouldn't be partisan or divisive to want a moral role model in the White House,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Robert Schmuhl', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/08/20/presidents-should-be-moral-role-models-is-trump-new-normal-column/2054079001/,"FDR called the presidency 'a place of moral leadership.' That's what I've taught students for decades. Will we get that back after Donald Trump?

I received an overture the other day to compose a journalistic effusion on the consequences of presidents — well, to be specific, one president — trafficking in conspiracy theories and using the news media to amplify unverified, if not completely false, allegations. You can probably guess that an aging president-watcher would harbor a view or two on that subject. But, in a rare spasm of wordsmith reluctance, I declined.

In this political environment, to sound off about a commander in chief promoting baseless balderdash would undoubtedly lead to labeling by the officeholder’s base supporters as an “enemy” of those people or worse. We know where he stands, I could hear some readers say while rejecting the argument.

When this happens, the give-and-take of democratic conversation goes by the wayside amid a hyperpartisan atmosphere that pervades the media writ large and the public in general. Instead of the open-minded discussion of public problems a self-governing people deserves, it seems as though more and more citizens are wearing blinkers to focus their attention on party-identified differences they deem worthy of approbation or condemnation. With those blinkers firmly in place, they lose sight of the middle ground between extremes.

'Decent respect' should be the norm

At the same time polarizing partisanship has become so brass-knuckled and fierce, historic norms, conventions and traditions of the White House have of late either come under assault or been abandoned altogether. Having (in the phrase of the Declaration of Independence) “a decent respect” for the office of president and those who’ve occupied it should be natural. The genuine friendships between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter as well as between George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, rivals in the campaigns of 1976 and 1992, respectively, attest to that.

However, the recent suggestion sent via Twitter to over 63 million followers that one former president might be involved in murder gives new meaning to the word “unconventional” for anyone attempting to describe a successor to George Washington.

When Franklin Roosevelt was campaigning for his first of four White House victories in 1932, he called the presidency “preeminently a place of moral leadership.” For nearly a half-century, through Democratic and Republican administrations, I’ve taught and written with Roosevelt’s insight as a lodestar or guiding principle of nonpartisan — and one always prays — fair analysis in assessing presidents, what they say and their actions.

How to define moral leadership

Though a precise definition of moral leadership is elusive for politically minded souls, some essential characteristics stand out, I’d emphasize for students or readers. From a foundation of integrity and honesty, the public figure needs to add inspiration, empathy and courage. Over time that amalgamation of attributes can develop into a full-fledged vision for governing that’s based on credibility and trust.

Individual political judgments about the merits of such leadership will differ, of course, but the reasons for pursuing one or another course are clear and usually revolve around fundamental questions. What’s the right course for the people and country? How can women and men across the nation come together to address problems? Who share these standards for governance and might be willing to help?

Unfortunately, when theory and practice collide like speeding trains, dispassionate evaluation goes off the tracks, throwing the neutral observer into a ditch of perilous surroundings. In this circumstance, even a tepid, wishy-washy explanation invariably gets interpreted as taking one side or another in whatever newsworthy matter might be playing out at the moment.

It's not partisan to want a role model

Looking beyond a particular moment looms the larger concern about the future. Put more starkly: Is what’s happening now an anomaly or an augury? Can we expect at some point to see a return to norms established by previous presidents, or will the spirit of “anything goes” continue for winners of the White House?

In sketching out traits of moral leadership on the blackboard for students, I would always include one other requirement in the inventory: emulation. Is the president (or the candidate who’s running for our highest office) someone possessing the character and temperament that other people can recognize and respect, no matter the person’s political affiliation?

Call me hopelessly old-fashioned, even deplorably die-hard, but wanting a role model in the Oval Office shouldn’t be too outlandish a dream for Americans, young, middle-age or elderly. That heartfelt wish chooses no partisan side — just the common, and national, good.
