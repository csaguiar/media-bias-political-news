Trump Consultant Is Trolling Democrats With Biden Site That Isn’t Biden’s,https://www.nytimes.com,['Matthew Rosenberg'],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/us/politics/fake-joe-biden-website.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — For much of the last three months, the most popular Joseph R. Biden Jr. website has been a slick little piece of disinformation that is designed to look like the former vice president’s official campaign page, yet is most definitely not pro-Biden.

From top to bottom, the website, JoeBiden.info, breezily mocks the candidate in terms that would warm the heart of any Bernie Sanders supporter: There are GIFs of Mr. Biden touching women and girls, and blurbs about his less-than-liberal policy positions, including his opposition to court-ordered busing in the 1970s and his support for the Iraq war. Pull quotes highlight some of his more famous verbal gaffes, like his description of his future boss, Barack Obama, as “articulate and bright and clean.” The introductory text declares, “Uncle Joe is back and ready to take a hands-on approach to America’s problems!”

All the site says about its creator is buried in the fine print at the bottom of the page. The site, it says, is a political parody built and paid for “BY AN American citizen FOR American citizens,” and not the work of any campaign or political action committee.

There is indeed an American behind the website — that much is unambiguously true. But he is very much a political player, and a Republican one at that. His name is Patrick Mauldin, and he makes videos and other digital content for President Trump’s re-election campaign. Together with his brother Ryan, Mr. Mauldin also runs Vici Media Group, a Republican political consulting firm in Austin whose website opens with the line “We Kick” followed by the image of a donkey — the Democratic Party symbol often known by another, three-letter, name."
"Trump heads to DMZ, dangling possibility of meeting Kim and crossing into North Korea",https://www.foxnews.com,['Judson Berger'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-heads-to-dmz-dangling-possibility-of-meeting-kim-and-crossing-into-north-korea,"President Trump, always one to think about the ratings, built anticipation ahead of a Sunday visit to the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South Korea – abruptly offering to meet dictator Kim Jong Un for a handshake and even saying he’s willing to cross the border.

No sitting U.S. president has set foot in North Korea.

TRUMP OFFERS TO MEET KIM JONG UN AT NK BORDER

The tantalizing possibility of such a historic photo op – which Trump would cast as part of his effort to secure a nuclear deal, but Kim could exploit to burnish his cult of personality – was first dangled in a tweet.

“After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon),” Trump tweeted Friday. “While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!”

The president is in Seoul after meeting with world leaders at the G20 summit in Japan.

While in Japan, Trump said at a news conference that he was “literally visiting the DMZ,” but wasn’t sure whether Kim would meet him.

Trump said he’d “feel very comfortable” crossing the border into North Korea if Kim showed up, saying he’d “have no problem” becoming the first U.S. president to step into North Korea.

It was not immediately clear what the agenda, if any, would be for the potential third Trump-Kim meeting.

“If he’s there we’ll see each other for two minutes,” Trump predicted.

North Korea responded by calling the offer a “very interesting suggestion.”

There have been no public meetings between Washington and Pyongyang since the breakdown of a Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam earlier this year. The chances for a resumption of U.S.-North Korea diplomacy have brightened since Trump and Kim recently exchanged personal letters. Trump called Kim's letter ""beautiful,"" while Kim described Trump's as ""excellent,"" though the contents of their letters have not been disclosed.

TRUMP MEETS TOP K-POP BAND

The prospect now of a cross-border handshake and even a foray by an American president into the internationally isolated, hermetic North could, if nothing else, kick-start movement toward resuming formal negotiations – even as it surely would attract Democratic criticism that Trump is cozying up to dictators.

But Trump, at least publicly, discussed the offer to Kim in casual terms, leaving unclear the likelihood of such an encounter.

“All I did is put out a feeler, if you’d like to meet,” Trump said later of the message to Kim.

Despite the deadlocked nuclear negotiations, both Trump and Kim have described their personal relationship as good.

But in yet another reminder of North Korea's continued mistrust of the United States, its foreign ministry said Wednesday it won't surrender to U.S.-led sanctions and accused Washington of trying to ""bring us to our knees.""

Trump just publicly proved he couldn’t pass a middle-school civics test,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-believes-western-liberalism-literally-means-liberals-on-the-west-coast-b9f8e2ac6fe0/,"President Donald Trump embarrassed the country yet again on the international stage this past week during the G20 summit. Speaking to reporters in Osaka, Japan where the summit was held, Trump displayed a complete lack of understanding when it comes to basic history and political terminology.

When asked by The New York Times about Russian president Vladimir Putin’s comments about Western liberalism being “obsolete,” Trump took that to mean literally liberals living on the west coast of the United States.

“He’s sees what’s going on, I guess, if you look at what’s happening in Los Angeles, where it’s so sad to look, and what’s happening in San Francisco and a couple of other cities, which are run by an extraordinary group of liberal people,” Trump told the Times.

“I don’t know what they’re thinking,” he added. “But when you look at Los Angeles, when you look at San Francisco, when you look at some of the other cities — and not a lot, not a lot — but you don’t want it to spread.”

What Putin was referring to, of course, is liberalism in the Western world, which consists most of Europe and the United States. In this usage, “liberalism” refers not to progressive or leftist policies, but to individual rights, equality before the law, and democracy and consent to be governed, in contrast to a dictatorship or populism or minority rule. In recent European Union elections, however, nationalist, populist parties have been gaining influence in countries like Italy and Poland. That is what Putin meant by those comments, not what liberal politicians in California or Washington state are doing.

This was hardlyTrump’s only flub during the Saturday’s news conference. He was asked by ABC News about an exchange between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) in Thursday’s Democratic presidential debate over busing. “Busing” refers to the practice of transporting children outside of their geographic school districts in order to help integrate schools. After the Supreme Court struck down school segregation in 1954, some black children were sent to white schools and vice-versa, in order to integrate school systems.

Trump’s made clear he thought the term “busing” meant using a bus to commute to school.

“You know, there aren’t that many ways you’re going to get people to schools. So this is something that’s been done. In some cases, it’s been done with a hammer instead of a velvet glove. And, you know, that’s part of it [….] But it is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools.”"
Trump reversed course on Huawei. What happens now?,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jackie Wattles', 'Cnn Business']",06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/29/business/huawei-trump-us-goods/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Six weeks after Huawei was blacklisted by the US government, President Donald Trump had what the Chinese telecom firm described as a ""U-turn.""

Trump said Saturday that ""US companies can sell their equipment to Huawei,"" allowing the transactions won't present a ""great, national emergency problem.""

Trump's comments at the G20 in Japan came after a widely anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jingping. The two sides met to discuss the impasse in the trade dispute, and Huawei, one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world, has become a flash point in the battle.

In May, the US Commerce Department banned sales of American-made goods to Huawei without first obtaining a license. US officials have accused the company of working to undermine US national security and foreign policy interests.

Trump said Huawei was still part of the ongoing trade discussions between Washington and Beijing, but for now, he would move to resume allowing US companies to sell parts to the Chinese firm."
House Judiciary calls for DOJ inspector general investigation into discrimination claims at FBI Academy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-judiciary-calls-for-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-discrimination-claims-at-fbi-academy,"Bipartisan leaders of the House Judiciary Committee called for the Justice Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into allegations of discrimination against women at the FBI Academy earlier this week following a federal lawsuit alleging that Quantico is run like a “good old boy network.""

Sixteen former female trainees at the FBI filed a lawsuit in late May claiming that they and dozens of other women had been sexually harassed, subjected to a hostile work environment and outdated gender stereotypes, wrongly kicked out of the training program, unfairly forced to resign or made to think that the continuing the training would be futile, suffered retaliation, and more.

And top members of the congressional committee tasked with overseeing the FBI called the allegations “disturbing” and said that, if true, “such conduct cannot be tolerated.”

The letter, signed this week by two Democrats and two Republicans — Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia as well as Karen Bass of California and John Ratcliffe of Texas — said they believed America’s diversity should be reflected by the FBI’s agents, emphasized that the FBI’s selection process should be free from bias, and called on DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to look into it.

“We must ensure potential agents not be deterred from applying because they fear the possibility of such treatment,” they wrote. “We believe these detailed allegations require an investigation into the FBI’s training and selection prices for new agents.”

A representative for the FBI told the Washington Examiner that the bureau is “unable to comment on litigation” but that “the FBI is committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected.”

“Diversity is one of our core values, and to effectively accomplish our mission of protecting the American people we need people of different genders, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives,” the representative said.

The federal lawsuit filed by female former trainees in May is directed at the training policies at the FBI and the conduct of its instructors at its agent training facility in Quantico, Virginia. The lawsuit claims FBI training guidelines are “highly subjective” and that “the uneven power dynamic at the FBI Academy puts female trainees at a distinct disadvantage.” And the lawsuit claims the subjective guidelines lets instructors misrepresent scenarios and fail women.

The complaint also alleges that when one of the women told former FBI Director James Comey of the allegations, Comey denied that discriminatory behavior was occurring and “instead suggested she use her ‘pain’ to reflect on her strengths and weaknesses.”

Mark Morgan, a former deputy assistant director at the FBI and the new acting chief of Customs and Border Protection, is also mentioned in the lawsuit.

David Shaffer, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Washington Examiner the FBI Academy relies upon “a completely subjective system that allows instructors to give rise to their own biases and beliefs with no accountability and oversight.”

Shaffer said that a common dynamic is that when a female trainee explains or defends her actions to an instructor, she is viewed being argumentative while when a male trainee does he is seen as standing up for himself.

Statistics provided by the FBI show that 20% of the special agents who are brought into the FBI are female. For the 2019 cycle, the FBI says that women made up 32% of those in the special agent basic field training course and 36% of those who had applied to be special agents. The FBI says that its 2019 target for female applications had been 33%, and the numbers reflect improvements from the 26% of special agent applications in the 2018 cycle and 22% in the 2017 cycle.

The FBI says that the total number of those who make it through the entire FBI special agent process — including application, training, and graduation — has held steady at just 6%.

If the DOJ inspector takes up the issue of discrimination at Quantico, it wouldn’t be the first time. A 2003 inspector general report which looked into allegations of disciplinary double standards at the FBI uncovered instances of instructors making inappropriate comments towards some trainees.

When asked by the Washington Examiner whether the DOJ inspector general would be launching an inquiry following the request from congressional leaders, the watchdog office declined to say.

Shaffer said that an inspector general investigation “should be done of course,” but he said that Congress needed to take action too.

“They need to be doing their oversight of the agency and asking the hard questions — and not relying on the FBI to investigate themselves,” Shaffer said.

USDA reports large U.S. soybean sale to China ahead of Trump-Xi meeting,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karl Plume', 'Min Read']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-soybeans/usda-reports-large-us-soybean-sale-to-china-ahead-of-trump-xi-meeting-idUSKCN1TT2ET,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Friday reported a large soybean sale to China, an apparent goodwill gesture a day before the first meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in seven months.

The trade war has curbed exports of U.S. crops to China and looms over the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Japan. Expectations have dimmed that the world’s two biggest economies can ease tensions when Trump and Xi meet in Osaka on Saturday.

The USDA said Chinese importers bought 544,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans for shipment in the 2018/19 marketing year which expires Aug. 31. It was the largest U.S. soybean sale to China since late March, USDA data showed.

The USDA said in a statement the sale was new and not a change of destination of a previously announced sale.

The deal surprised some traders as soybean export premiums for late-summer shipments were unchanged this week, showing little evidence that a large purchase was occurring, and because recent large purchases have come only after talks between the two countries.

A sharp drop in China’s hog herd, which consumes most of the soybeans processed by the world’s largest pork market, due to a deadly hog disease called African swine fever has also reduced demand for the oilseed.

“To me it looks like a good faith purchase, which we’ve seen before, although in the past they came after the two presidents shook hands. Today it’s coming before they do so it may be trying to influence talks,” said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for INTL FCStone.

“All this comes against a backdrop of China having ample supplies of soybeans and talk of them delaying shipment of July beans into August because of the big supplies,” he said.

Beijing had agreed to buy nearly 14 million tonnes from American farmers over December to March during a temporary truce in the trade spat.

More than 8 million tonnes of those have already been shipped to China, but about 6 million tonnes, including Friday’s sale, still need to be delivered.

Trump said on Friday he hopes for productive talks but made no promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs that have cast a shadow on global growth.

U.S. soybean exports to China have plunged by more than 80 percent since Beijing slapped steep tariffs on shipments last July. China, the world’s top soybean importer, is on pace for its smallest U.S. soybean imports in 11 years as importers there have increased purchases from South America, mainly from top exporter Brazil."
That was fast: Donald Trump-Jimmy Carter détente crumbles,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/that-was-fast-donald-trump-jimmy-carter-detente-crumbles,"Donald Trump and Jimmy Carter have both had at times toxic relationships with fellow living presidents, for different sorts of reasons. So, the trans-Pacific sniping between the pair during President Trump's Asia visit isn't terribly surprising.

But it is notable, considering only weeks ago the president reached out to Carter, who held office during Trump's Studio 54 club days in the late 1970s, when he was an up-and-coming Manhattan real estate developer.

In mid-April, Trump called his predecessor to discuss China, according to Carter, which the Trump White House then confirmed. Carter, 94, told a Georgia Sunday school audience the discussion was prompted by a letter Carter wrote to Trump about relations between the United States and China.

""President Jimmy Carter wrote President Trump a beautiful letter about the current negotiations with China and on Saturday they had a very good telephone conversation about President Trump’s stance on trade with China and numerous other topics,"" the White House said in an April 15 statement. ""The President has always liked President Carter and First Lady Rosalynn Carter, and extended his best wishes to them on behalf of the American people.""

The call marked the first time the sitting commander in chief is known to have reached out to a predecessor on a policy issue. But the warm relations didn't last.

On Friday, Carter said he doesn’t believe Trump, 73, won the 2016 election legitimately. Speaking at a Carter Center conference on human rights, the former president said a full investigation into Russian interference “would show that Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016.”

“He lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,” Carter said.

Trump soon fired back.

""He's a nice man. He was a terrible president. He's a Democrat, and it’s a typical talking point. He's loyal to the Democrats, and I guess you should be,"" Trump said from the G-20 Summit in Osaka, Japan. ""As everybody now understands, I won not because of Russia, not because of anybody, but myself.""



Trump responds to Carter:

So, add Carter to Trump's enemies in the ex-president's club.

Trump and Obama are not on speaking terms. At former President George H.W. Bush's funeral, they exchanged a fleeting handshake while sitting next to each other but didn't speak. And former first lady Michelle Obama wrote in her 2018 memoir Becoming that she could never forgive Trump for jeopardizing her family’s safety by promoting the birther conspiracy theory, which claimed Barack Obama was born in Kenya, not Hawaii, thus making him ineligible to be president.

Trump also regularly chides former first lady Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state and his defeated 2016 Democratic rival, and sometimes her husband, Bill Clinton. Former President George W. Bush has been a Trump target, too, from time to time, through criticism of the Iraq war he led as commander-in-chief. The Bush clan has largely kept its distance from Trump.

Carter, an ex-president now for more than 38 years, has also annoyed his Oval Office successors, both Democrats and Republicans. In fall 1990, he drew President George H.W. Bush's anger over efforts to undermine the international coalition the U.S. and allies were building at the United Nations to eject Iraq from Kuwait, which it occupied that August.

Nearly four years later, Carter infuriated then-President Bill Clinton by inserting himself into diplomatic efforts to make Haiti's military leaders step down and avert an imminent American-led invasion. And Carter went on to be a fierce critic of President George W. Bush's foreign policy approach, particularly the Iraq War.

Carter's 2002 Nobel Peace Prize was largely seen as a rebuke to Bush. Gunnar Berge, the Nobel committee chairman at the time, was blunt about his committee's intentions. The award ""should be interpreted as a criticism of the line that the current administration has taken,'' he said."

The Justice Department said that $6 million from the Office of Justice program's Bureau of Justice Assistance will go toward hiring, equipping and training village public safety officers, village police officers and tribal police officers working in rural Alaska.

The Department of Justice's Office on Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) will also award $4.5 million in funding for 20 officer positions, equipment and training.

“In May, when I visited Alaska, I witnessed firsthand the complex, unique, and dire law enforcement challenges the State of Alaska and its remote Alaska Native communities are facing,” Barr said in a statement.

“With this emergency declaration, I am directing resources where they are needed most and needed immediately, to support the local law enforcement response in Alaska Native communities, whose people are dealing with extremely high rates of violence,"" he said.

Alaska has the highest per capita crime rate in the country, and the Justice Department says the state’s geography poses unique problems for law enforcement.

The agency cited estimates and studies saying that one-third of Alaskan villages have no local law enforcement personnel at all, and more than four in five American Indian and Alaska Native adults have experienced some form of violence in their lifetime.

Barr said the Justice Department would work with local and tribal officials.

“I want to be sure that the support this Department offers to Alaska Native communities will support solutions identified by the communities themselves,” he said. “The only way for us to provide effective support is to work in partnership with others. This is true in Alaska and throughout Indian country.”"

The US president displayed a “state of aggressive arousal”, says Judi James, as he sought to assert himself at the beginning of their crunch trade talks.

The leaders met at the end of the summit in Osaka and after the President said relations “were back on track” with threat of $300 billion worth tariffs on Chinese goods lifted.

The US President has in the past professed his admiration for his Chinese counterpart - and fellow strongman - and last year said “Xi and I will always be friend” despite their differences.

But Judi said that didn’t prevent Trump trying to get one over on Xi by a display of aggressive body language.

“He arrived with his jacket undone, which could have been seen as a slight by the formally buttoned-up Xi,” she said.

“Xi offered an outstretched arm with a very open palm, suggesting an enthusiastic welcome but Trump pulled his hand out of the shake quickly and turned to the front to perform a series of physical power-flexing rituals.

“Trump buttoned his jacket while his torso shimmied and then squared up as though he was preparing for a fight.

“He splayed his shoulders and his feet and stood with his arms hanging at his sides in what looked like a state of aggressive arousal, which in alpha terms is more about looking tough to intimidate opponents and therefore avoid an actual fight.”

""As Trump squared up his body he narrowed his eyes, stared hard at the cameras before scanning the room and his lower jaw jutted slightly in another signal of prepping for a fight.”

Before the meeting got underway she said “their second shake was instigated by Trump who added a power-pat gesture onto Xi’s back”.

At the start of their meeting two leaders sat at a long table facing each other with their aides at their sides.

Xi Jingping began by referring to the so-called ping-pong diplomacy that began in 1971, that eventually led to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979.

In his opening remarks, Trump fondly recalled his 2017 visit to Beijing, calling it “one of the most incredible of my life"".

Trump addressed the comments made by Carter during a news conference Saturday following the G-20 summit in Japan, saying that although Carter is “a nice man, he was a terrible president,” before noting that “he’s a Democrat and it’s a typical talking point.”

He added that Carter is “loyal to the Democrats” but “as everybody now understands, I won not because of Russia, not because of anybody but myself.”

Carter said Friday at a Virginia forum that “I think a full investigation would show that Trump didn’t actually win the election in 2016.”

“He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,"" he added. When asked if Trump was “illegitimate president,” Carter responded saying “Basically, what I just said, which I can’t retract.”

Trump said during the news conference that he “campaigned better, smarter, hotter than Hillary Clinton. I went to Wisconsin, I went to Michigan the night of the vote.”

""I won Michigan, I won Wisconsin, I won Pennsylvania, I won states that traditionally haven’t been won by Republicans for many years,” he continued. “This had nothing to do with anybody but the fact that I worked harder and much smarter than Hillary Clinton did.”

The president added that he was “surprised” Carter made such comments but he also “felt bad” for him as he’s been attacked even by his own party.

“He’s been trashed within his own party, he’s been badly trashed. I felt bad for him because you look over the years, his party has virtually … he’s like the forgotten president,” Trump said. “And I understand why they say that.”

"US attorney general declares emergency for public safety in rural Alaska, freeing up $10.5 million to support police",https://www.adn.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2019/06/28/us-attorney-general-announces-10-million-in-emergency-funds-to-support-public-safety-in-rural-alaska/,"U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr declared an emergency for public safety in rural Alaska on Friday and announced that the Department of Justice will provide more than $10 million in emergency funds as part of a sweeping plan to support law enforcement in Alaska Native villages.

The department’s Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Program will immediately provide $6 million to the state to hire, equip and train rural police, and for mobile holding cells. Another $4.5 million will support 20 officer positions and be provided to Alaska Native organizations by the end of July.

The announcement comes a month after Barr visited Alaska during a multiday trip to hear concerns from Alaska Natives and rural residents about a lack of police in rural communities and high rates of sexual assault and family violence.

During a trip to a Western Alaska village in late May, Barr called the situation an “emergency” and vowed to do everything he could to help.

“In May, when I visited Alaska, I witnessed firsthand the complex, unique, and dire law enforcement challenges the state of Alaska and its remote Alaska Native communities are facing,” Barr said in a statement from the Department of Justice. “With this emergency declaration, I am directing resources where they are needed most and needed immediately, to support the local law enforcement response in Alaska Native communities, whose people are dealing with extremely high rates of violence.”

The state’s largest Native organization praised the decision.

“We appreciate that U.S. Attorney General William Barr clearly understands the urgency of the public safety situation in rural Alaska,” said Julie Kitka, longtime president of the Alaska Federation of Natives.

Kitka views Barr’s declaration and the scope of his plans as unprecedented, according to AFN spokesman Jeffry Silverman.

She has never seen anything like this in her lifetime, and views this as a real opportunity to make a difference, Silverman said.

Alaska has the highest per capita crime rate in the country, the Department of Justice statement said.

The unique circumstances of Alaska’s “jurisdictional landscape” and its hard-to-reach villages — some accessible to investigators only by boat or plane, contributing at times to lengthy delays into criminal investigations — factored into Barr’s decision.

The isolation of Alaska villages contributes to “law enforcement problems not seen anywhere else in our nation,” the statement said.

Barr said he was directing agencies with the Justice department to submit plans within 30 days on how they will provide more support for federal, state and tribal public safety efforts in rural Alaska. The goals must include providing better services to crime victims, stamping out illegal drugs, improving detention facilities and getting more police and legal resources to rural Alaska.

On top of those funds, two other agencies within the Department of Justice have identified $14 million that is available for child advocacy centers in Alaska and in the Lower 48.

“Lives depend on it, and we are committed to seeing a change in this unacceptable, daily reality for Alaska Native people,” Barr said.

During his visit to rural Alaska, Barr said he could not imagine a more vulnerable people than Alaska Natives with limited access to police, lawyers and courts.

In May, the Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica reported that one in three communities in Alaska, about 70 all together and nearly all of them Alaska Native, had no local law enforcement at some point this year. Many are in regions with the highest rates of poverty, sexual assault and suicide in the United States.

Barr said he would work closely with Native leaders and congressional and state representatives to ensure the programs are delivered effectively.

“I want to be sure that the support this department offers to Alaska Native communities will support solutions identified by the communities themselves,” he said. “The only way for us to provide effective support is to work in partnership with others. This is true in Alaska and throughout Indian country.”

Barr also announced a suite of funding opportunities and deadline extensions to programs that could support public safety in Alaska’s villages. Among the specifics:

• The Office on Violence Against Women will issue an award for sexual assault training and technical assistance in Alaska, including training community health aides in Alaska Native villages to perform sexual assault forensic exams and training for victim advocates.

• The Office for Victims of Crime will extend its application deadline for the Crime Victim Fund tribal set-aside solicitation. The money is part of the $167 million available to tribes for victim services this year to Aug. 16. This money can fund direct services and advocacy, domestic violence shelters, rape crisis services, children advocacy programs and elder abuse programs.

• The Office of Justice Program’s Bureau of Justice Assistance will extend an application deadline to July 15 for programs that target mental health issues, and drug addiction and re-entry initiatives.

• The Office on Community Oriented Policing Services will reopen two grant programs for state law enforcement agencies to fight crimes related to methamphetamine and heroin.

Barr’s visit to Alaska at the end of May began with a roundtable meeting with Alaska Native leaders in Anchorage on May 29. The following day, he visited the state’s crime lab in the city, seeing firsthand the backlog into the processing of evidence of sex crimes.

He and a large entourage of officials flew to the rural communities of Galena, Bethel and Napaskiak on May 31. Tribal leaders in Napaskiak urged Barr to issue an emergency declaration.

In Alaska, Barr heard impassioned pleas for help. Alaska Native leaders relayed stories of villages in lockdown awaiting state troopers during active threats from shooters. He heard about underfunded rural shelters struggling to meet victims’ needs, and of perpetrators who keep committing crimes because prosecution is lacking.

U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan had urged Barr to visit Alaska to see the problems firsthand. He complied and launched the Anchorage meeting with Native leaders by saying the nation’s attorney general must ensure the legal system works for every community in the country.

The Alaska delegation, including Rep. Don Young, applauded Barr’s quick response.

Barr felt Alaskans’ concerns ""in his heart,” Murkowski said.

“I appreciate the urgency that the attorney general is placing on Alaska and our public safety situation and I look forward to working with him to further identify and implement lasting, systemic solutions to rural public safety and wellness in coordination with the Department of Justice,” she said.

Sullivan said Friday that he was struck by the swiftness and breadth of Barr’s plan. There’s been too much rhetoric and not enough action in past efforts to tackle the problem, he said.

Barr and his team truly listened to Alaskans, he said, and are committed to helping the people in the state who need it the most.

“I’m hopeful this will be an opportunity to really spur action,” Sullivan said.

The declaration and funding are “welcome news not only for the families that have been victims of crime, but also for the children of Alaska who deserve to grow up in neighborhoods that are safe and secure,” Young said.

Vivian Korthuis, chief executive for the Association of Village Council Presidents, providing social services to dozens of villages in Southwest Alaska, called the declaration “unprecedented,” according to the delegation’s statement.

“AVCP has asked for protection and safety of our families and tribal communities, and Attorney General William Barr has heard us,” Korthuis said. “We are not asking for anything less or anything more than any other community in Alaska or the United States.”

Bryan Schroder, the U.S. attorney for Alaska, told reporters Friday that the initiatives will bring additional resources to the state, including two assistant U.S. attorneys to support state prosecutors in rural areas.

Barr wants a long-term solution, Schroder said.

Schroder will launch a working group to explore ways to reduce violent crime in rural Alaska, especially crimes against children. The group will provide a report to Barr in 30 days, he said.

The group will take input from Native leaders and others. One idea that will be considered calls for creating a regional public safety system led by tribal groups, similar to how health care is delivered to Alaska Natives, he said.

The discussion will include possible long-term sources of funding to support public safety in rural Alaska, he said.

Katharine Sullivan, a principal deputy assistant attorney general, told reporters that Barr directed Department of Justice officials to begin taking steps to tackle the problems immediately after he returned from Alaska.

She said the department’s admittedly lofty goal is putting a police officer in every Alaska village. It will involve multiple organizations working together.

“I’m not saying in any way we will meet that goal, but we will work toward it,” she said.

Also on Friday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed $6 million in unspent funds from the state’s Village Public Safety Officer program. About 40 of the officers work in rural Alaska.

The governor’s reduction does not reduce the number of those officers because the program has been unable to hire enough officers to use its full budget.

Matt Shuckerow, Dunleavy’s spokesman, said the vetoes to the program restore the governor’s original proposed budget cuts in February.

The attorney general’s announcement, and the governor’s cuts, are completely unrelated, Shuckerow said.

The governor met with Barr during his visit to Alaska to address rural public safety and is working with rural stakeholders on the topic, Shuckerow said.

“To be clear, the governor is fully committed to providing the resources necessary for public safety,” Shuckerow said. “It’s one of the areas where he said we have to spend more.”

If the Legislature finds a way to repurpose funds for public safety in rural Alaska, the governor would be happy to consider their plan, Shuckerow said."
New leaders installed at top immigration agencies amid questions over DHS secretary’s future,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-leaders-installed-at-top-immigration-agencies-amid-questions-over-dhs-secretarys-future,"The Trump administration named new leaders Thursday to top immigration agencies amid a deepening crisis at the border -- and swirling speculation over the future of the Homeland Security secretary who oversees it all after he was accused of leaking a highly sensitive operation.

Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday announced that Mark Morgan, who was serving as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be shifted over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to replace former Commissioner John Sanders, who abruptly resigned from his post this week. ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence was tapped to replace Morgan at that agency.

But bigger questions now surround McAleenan himself.

Two senior administration officials told Fox News that high-level discussions were underway with top administration and White House officials regarding McAleenan’s future in light of the accusations against him -- which the secretary strongly denies. The officials said there is uncertainty as to how much longer the secretary could remain in his post.

A White House official declined to comment on these claims when asked by Fox News.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

McAleenan had come under fire after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

One senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday that after the alleged leak, ""He’s lost the confidence and trust of both the workforce and his superiors, with no viable path to proceed with any confidence and credibility.""

The official lamented the state of morale at the department, saying: “DHS has devolved into chaos and employee morale is abysmal.”

Another senior administration official also told Fox News Thursday that McAleenan has “completely lost his credibility leading the Department.”

“I can’t imagine the White House has an interest in keeping him in place much longer when they know he opposes most of their immigration policies,” the official said.

McAleenan, though, has adamantly denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

Meanwhile, one of the officials told Fox News that McAleenan spent several days in Guatemala this week for multilateral meetings with Central American allies, while other top administration officials negotiated on Capitol Hill for additional funding for the agencies as part of a major piece of legislation -- which has not yet cleared Congress.

The official told Fox News that “support for a spending package vital to the department coalesced, was debated, and voted on in his absence.” That official also said that McAleenan has been “cut out of the process.”

Another administration official noted that McAleenan was slated to host a press conference on Thursday afternoon on the supplemental spending bill. “It’s interesting that he is standing alone. This is him trying to save his job, and taking a victory lap on the supplemental bill when he has been absent for the last few days.”

The event, though, was later canceled."
Elizabeth Warren says no wealthy donors as ambassadors in State plan,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/28/19102522/elizabeth-warren-state-department-plan-2020,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) just released her vision for how she would run the State Department from the Oval Office — and it’s a dramatic change from how President Donald Trump has handled America’s diplomatic corps.

In a Friday Medium post, Warren vowed to pursue a “diplomacy-first strategy” as president as opposed to conducting US foreign policy mostly through the better-funded Pentagon. To do that, she says, her administration would invest much more in the current and future diplomats that serve in roughly 270 posts around the world.

“American security and prosperity depend on robust diplomacy,” she wrote. “Our diplomats are the front line of our engagement with the world.”

Her piece details that she won’t allow wealthy campaign donors to become ambassadors, how she aims to double the size of the diplomatic corps while improving diversity in its ranks, and how she’d create a diplomatic equivalent of ROTC programs in universities, among other moves.

It makes sense for Warren to put out a vision like this. First, having a plan for every aspect of governance is kind of her thing. Second, her overall foreign policy views prioritize diplomacy over using the military. And third, the Trump administration has caused much heartburn at the State Department by proposing lower budgets and failing to nominate qualified people for key positions, although that’s starting to change.

But because it’s a relatively short Medium post, the senator’s State Department plan is lacking many details about how, exactly, she would turn her aspirations into reality. There’s no mention about how she’d fight a GOP-led Senate to spend more and confirm nominees, there’s no real connection (yet) with how these views intersect with her thoughts on defense and development, and no discussion of tradeoffs she might face while prioritizing the State Department’s revamp.

Still, offering a State Department plan makes her the leading candidate on the issue during the 2020 cycle (for now). And what she offers are some concrete proposals that would let Warren put her mark on one of America’s oldest governmental professions.

How Warren wants to fix the State Department

Warren’s plan comes down to three main proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the way the State Department has been managed under Trump — and that represent something of a departure from how the department was run under President Barack Obama, too.

1) No wealthy donors become ambassadors

This is likely the part of Warren’s plan that will get the most attention. There’s a long tradition of presidents in both parties nominating some of their richest financial supporters to plum ambassadorial posts. In Obama’s second term, for example, he named 31 campaign “bundlers” — people who raised at least $50,000 for his campaign — as an embassy’s top diplomat.

“Nearly all of these bundlers ... serve in Western European nations or other highly developed and stable countries such as Canada and New Zealand,” the Center for Public Integrity reported in January 2017.

Trump continued the practice by nominating 14 inauguration donors — who gave on average about $350,000 — as ambassadors. What’s worse, the people he nominated for top embassy posts were less qualified than in administrations past, as the February chart from Axios below shows. (The nominated ambassadors also gave more money to his campaign, on average, than previous rich donors gave other presidents.)

Warren says that trend would end under her watch. “I’ll make my ambassadorial appointments based on only one thing: finding the most qualified person for the job,” she wrote. “I won’t give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers — period,” she continued, calling on other candidates to promise the same.

That said, it’s somewhat easy for Warren to make this pledge. She’s already not taking money from high rollers or speaking at big fundraisers, so her bench of wealthy supporters is already thin. Still, her vow, if enacted, would end a long-standing problem of pay-for-play at some of America’s most important embassies.

2) Revamp the diplomatic corps

Warren blames Trump for many diplomats recently leaving the government, but she also notes that’s been a problem for a while. “Years of hiring freezes and spending cuts have caused many talented diplomats to head for the doors,” she wrote.

So Warren proposes two ways to change that: double the size of the foreign service and improve the diversity in the diplomatic corps.

Those go hand in hand. Right now, America’s diplomats are mainly white and male. “[T]he Foreign Service is not sufficiently representative of the American people with respect to race, gender, socioeconomic background, and regional origin,” a May 2018 Congressional Research Service report noted.

That means there’s a vast, untapped pool of people around the country that may be interested in a diplomatic posting. To reach out to them, Warren says she’ll “dedicate recruiting resources to applicants from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and other minority-serving institutions, women’s colleges, and community colleges. And I’ll double the size of fellowships designed to recruit minority and low-income diplomats.”

She’ll also push for universities to have a ROTC-like program for diplomats as well as double the size of the Peace Corps.

Trump, meanwhile, has consistently proposed cuts to the State Deparment budget and recruited secretaries of state that seem intent on lowering diplomatic ranks. Multiple diplomats I’ve talked to since the start of this administration have consistently noted the poor morale among the corps and just how understaffed — and therefore overworked — they all are.

Warren’s changes, then, will certainly require tons of effort and a decent chunk of money (although surely a lot, lot less than the Pentagon spends). It’s unlikely she could completely alter the face of the US diplomatic corps in four or even eight years. But she seems intent on making structural tweaks quickly in hopes of long-term change.

3) Improve the lives of diplomats

Diplomats have to deal with two big institutional challenges. First, they work for a large, impersonal bureaucracy that doesn’t always let the best talent rise to the top. Second, their service in major cities around the world makes it harder to raise a family and strike a normal work-life balance.

Warren wants to alter all that.

She proposes creating a “core professional development curriculum” which would help diplomats improve in their jobs and prepare for more senior roles. That will help her make at least one Deputy Secretary — a position right under the secretary of state — a career ambassador, one of the corps’ top designations.

The senator also aims to “enhance workplace flexibility to retain a diverse workforce.” She’d do that, in part, by “expanding parental leave and preferential postings for new parents.” That means new mothers and fathers wouldn’t be penalized as much for starting a family in the hyper-competitive State Department. What’s more, raising a kid in a more developed country could make an upbringing easier than, say, growing up in a warzone.

None of this is to say Warren’s plan is perfect; no plan is. But even in a short Medium post, Warren has given more thought about what to do with the State Deparment than many (if not all) of her Democratic opponents. The question now is if any other presidential candidate — including Trump — can come up with a better plan in the months ahead."
"U.S. Corn Acreage Way Above Trade Expectations, Market Falls, USDA/WASDE Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/us-corn-acreage-to-drop-to-record-low-usdawasde-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The USDA sees the U.S. 2019 corn acreage nearly unchanged from its March estimate, according to its June Acreage Report released Friday.

As a result, the corn dropped 'limit down’ 25¢, basis the Sept. futures contract, while the soybean market moved up 11¢ per bushel, following the report.

•Note: USDA announced Friday that it will resurvey 14 states, regarding planting acreage, due to flooding and inclement weather. The results of the survey will be released August 12, 2019.

At the close, the Sep. corn futures finished 21¢ lower at $4.24¾, bouncing off a daily limit low of $4.20. Dec. corn futures closed 19½¢ lower at $4.31¼.



Aug. soybean futures closed 10¾¢ higher at $9.04½. November soybean futures finished 10¾¢ higher at $9.23.

Sep. wheat futures closed 19½¢ lower at $5.27¼.

August soymeal futures closed $2.10 per short ton higher at $315.30. August soy oil futures ended 0.44¢ higher at 28.37¢ per pound.

In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.55 lower, the U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 50 points higher.

U.S. 2019 Planting Report

In its report, the USDA pegged the U.S. 2019 corn acreage at 91.7 million bushels vs. the avg. trade estimate of 86.7 million and the USDA’s 2018 June estimate of 92.8 million.

For soybeans, the USDA sees 2019 acreage at 80.0 million vs. the trade’s expectation of 84.4 million and the USDA’s 2018 June estimate of 89.2 million.

All Wheat acreage estimate is pegged at 45.6 million vs. the trade’s expectation of 45.67 million and the USDA’s June 2018 estimate of 45.8 million.

Trade Reaction

Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that USDA gave the markets another shocker today.

“Everyone was looking for more beans and less corn and got exactly the opposite. That is why the big reaction, and it is perfectly understandable. A 25¢ range in corn in less than 3 minutes is something. No one understands the corn planted and harvested area, as USDA had not shown that type of progress in the weekly data. The stocks reports are kind of friendly, but the planted area report is the headline and most likely not in a good way for a lot of traders and brokers. These are wild numbers. I do have one farmer who has been telling me that a lot of corn got planted early in the month, but even so, these numbers are hard to believe,” Scoville says.

Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that the USDA corn acreage estimate is telling.

“Farmers were clearly incentivized to plant corn in order to capture government benefits contingent on getting something into the ground this season. Look for the July WASDE to reflect a slightly improved corn balance sheet and to tighten the soybean balance sheet perhaps more than was anticipated prior to today’s acreage report,” Gilbertie says.

Gilbert adds, “Wheat disappearance reflects the healthy rate of wheat exports we’ve seen so far this year.”

Britt O’Connell, cash adviser for Commodity Risk Management Group, says that not a lot of people will believe today’s USDA corn acreage estimate.

“I don’t think anyone saw this coming. I doubt there is much belief in the published numbers. Trade is telling us that as well. Touched limit down and now trading down 17 to 18,” O’Connell says. “What a wild ride. At one point, we were up 14¢ to 15¢.”

The confusion is occurring because USDA starts March with planting intentions of 92.4 million acres. After a wet spring with delayed planting, the USDA takes 3.0 million corn acres out of production in its May WASDE, O’Connell says.

“That’s not a typical move, but nonetheless something that was very easy to rationalize and warrant. Today, USDA places planted acres at 91.7 million acres. Effectively saying that we planted all of the acres that we originally had planned,” O’Connell says.

A further dive into the numbers on a state-by-state look, points to states that have struggled tremendously – Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, to be planting either the same amount of acres of more than last year, O’Connell says.

“It simply doesn’t add up. This should be viewed as a buying opportunity on corn. Bean number could hold some water, with burdensome stocks continuing to loom over that market. Even with this bullish news in beans, they can only muster up a 10¢ rally.

Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says that today’s USDA Report continues to give shock waves in the grains.

“Last month the large drop in yield for corn, due to poor planting conditions, was considered friendly. The shock today, with an anticipated 4- to 5-million-acre drop in corn, was that USDA reduced corn acreage by only 1.1 million. But the soybean acre number was lowered by 4.6 million acres, with these numbers being shifted by the USDA. The large stocks on beans could be jeopardized. Weather will be watched closer now than most markets we have seen in modern times.”"
Reporters erupt after DHS chief McAleenan walks out of presser after four questions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/reporters-erupt-after-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-walks-out-of-presser-after-four-questions,"Reporters erupted in frustration with Kevin McAleenan after the acting homeland security secretary abruptly departed a rescheduled press conference after taking only four questions amid crossfire over questions about his leadership.

After reading Friday from a prepared statement for 11 minutes, McAleenan opened the floor to questions. He took four of them over seven minutes then cut off the briefing and said ""thanks"" before exiting.

""This is ridiculous! We get no..."" one reporter in the front row yelled as McAleenan walked out.

""Seriously, Andrew, it's so unprofessional,"" another reporter said, directing her comment to the only DHS official still onstage, acting Public Affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan.

""Four questions and we haven't had a press conference in months,"" one person said, referring to McAleenan's installation in his current role nearly three months earlier.

""We'll be more engaging in the future,"" Meehan responded.

""Why don't we keep rolling and you keep answering our questions?"" one of the reporters asked.

Reporters immediately began asking a handful of additional questions before Meehan excused himself after four minutes of it.

McAleenan was accused by five current and former senior administration officials, in comments published by the Washington Examiner over the weekend, of attempting to sabotage a federal immigration operation by leaking details to a media outlet.

Since then, top officials at DHS and across the administration have used various press outlets, including the Washington Examiner, to try to undermine McAleenan by calling for him to resign and charging he is a liar for an alleged cover-up of what they claim was his own leak.

The Friday afternoon press conference was announced in an email from DHS around 9:30 a.m. The Washington Examiner, which received an invitation to attend the same event a day earlier, did not receive an invitation Friday.

On Thursday, the Washington Examiner reported that McAleenan was expected to lay the blame on Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Mark Morgan for the revelation in a Washington Post story of details about immigration raids. The report was published a half-hour before the Thursday briefing was scheduled to take place. Moments before it began, DHS abruptly called off the briefing.

A DHS spokesman claimed it was because the department did not want McAleenan's comments to interfere with Capitol Hill negotiations for supplemental border funding, even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had publicly announced nearly an hour before the briefing the chamber would pass the Senate's supplemental bill, according to reporters.

DHS had said Thursday the event would be used for McAleenan to discuss the ""supplemental funding request for DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the changes needed to the immigration legal framework to address the humanitarian and border security crisis.""

McAleenan did not address the leaks in his appearance Friday."

The Department of Justice has subpoenaed records from Boeing relating to its 787 Dreamliner aircraft and employees at the aerospace giant's South Carolina manufacturing plant, according to the Seattle Times.

The Justice Department has been investigating Boeing 737 Max plane, which has seen two fatal crashes in the past 12 months and is currently grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration. The New York Times reported in April allegations of shoddy production practices at the South Carolina plant where the 787 is made.

The FAA announced earlier this week that it had found another flaw in the 737 Max. Boeing said in a securities filing after that announcement that it ""agrees with the FAA's decision and request, and is working on the required software to address the FAA's request.""

A Boeing official told CNBC earlier this week that the manufacturer hoped to submit its changes to the FAA in September, which would mean the plane could rejoin commercial air fleets near the end of the year.

When reached for comment, a Boeing spokesperson said, ""We don't comment on legal matters."" The Justice Department declined to comment.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced USD49.3 million in funding for nuclear energy research, facility access, crosscutting technology development, and infrastructure for 58 advanced nuclear technology projects in 25 states.

The NEUP was created in 2009 to consolidate the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy's university support under one programme (Image: NEUP)

The awards include USD25.8 million for some 40 university-led research and development projects plus USD1.6 million for seven university-led research reactor and infrastructure improvements under the Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP).

Five research and development projects led by DOE national laboratories and US universities will receive a total of USD4.5 million in funding to conduct research to address ""crosscutting nuclear energy challenges"" that will help to develop advanced sensors and instrumentation, advanced manufacturing methods, and materials for multiple nuclear reactor plant and fuel applications. These include a project led by Los Alamos National Laboratory to determine the feasibility of laser additive manufacturing for producing reactor components of a ferritic/martensitic steel with an engineered microstructure, which is earmarked for an estimated USD1 million of funding.

Two university-, one national laboratory- and three industry-led projects to investigate important nuclear fuel and material applications will receive support under the Nuclear Science User Facilities (NSUF) programme. DOE will support three of these projects a total of USD1.5 million in research funds, while supporting all six by more than USD10 million in facility access costs and expertise for experimental neutron and ion irradiation testing, post-irradiation examination facilities, synchrotron beamline capabilities, and technical assistance for design and analysis of experiments. Two of the NEUP projects will also be supported with USD3 million in NSUF access funds.

""DOE is looking to the future, and that's why we are investing in advanced nuclear technologies. Nuclear energy is a critical part of our all-of-the-above energy strategy, and early-stage research can help ensure it will continue to be a clean, reliable, and resilient source of electricity for a long time to come,"" said DOE Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Ed McGinnis said.

The DOE Office of Nuclear Energy has now awarded more than USD678 million through its university programmes since 2009, the department said.

Soybeans were higher while grains were lower in overnight trading ahead of key reports from the USDA due today.

The government will release its Acreage and Grain Stocks Report at noon in Washington.

Analysts have pegged corn acres at about 86.7 million, down from a government estimate of 89.8 million earlier this month, and soybean area at 84.4 million, down slightly from the 84.6 million estimated in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report, according to research Allendale.

All wheat area is pegged at 45.7 million acres, down marginally from the 45.8 million estimated earlier this month.

Analysts polled by Reuters have pegged corn stockpiles on June 1 at 5.33 billion bushels, up from 5.31 billion bushels a year earlier, and soybean inventories at 1.861 billion bushels, up considerably from the 1.22 billion in storage last year.

Wheat stocks at the start of the month are expected to be reported at 1.1 billion bushels, unchanged from the year-earlier level, Reuters said.

3. Heat Warnings Issued in Parts of Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Nebraska

From excessive rainfall to weather that’s too hot, parts of the Midwest can’t seem to catch any normal weather this year.

A heat advisory has been issued for much of northeastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri, as temperatures are expected to climb into the mid-90s, which will push heat index values as high as 105˚F., according to the National Weather Service.

The area has seen major flooding for the past several weeks after excessive rainfall pushed the Missouri River and its tributaries over their banks. Flood warnings are still in effect for the region.

It’s not just the heat; another round of thunderstorms is possible in northern Missouri tonight. Small hail and gusty winds are expected.

A heat advisory also has been issued for parts of southeastern South Dakota, northeastern Nebraska, and a few counties in western Iowa.

Heat index values are expected to reach 103˚F. this afternoon, the NWS said in a report early this morning."
The Census Case Shows Why We Need a Defender General,https://slate.com,['Matthew R. Segal'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/doj-noel-francisco-lies-census-case-supreme-court-defender-general.html,"Noel Francisco attends his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in D.C. on May 10, 2017. Mark Wilson/Getty Images

It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Department of Justice lawyers representing the Trump administration. Last week, career DOJ attorney Sarah Fabian came under intense criticism for an argument in which she equivocated when federal appellate judges asked her whether it would be “safe and sanitary” for the government to deny detained migrant children access to toothbrushes, soap, and blankets. And on Thursday, citing evidence that the Trump administration “contrived” its explanations to courts, the Supreme Court largely upheld a district court’s decision to block a citizenship question on the 2020 census. This opinion is a powerful, though tacit, rebuke of the DOJ attorneys who failed to acknowledge that their clients’ proffered rationale for adding the citizenship question—enforcing the Voting Rights Act—was pretextual. Essentially, the government lied about why it was taking a certain action in the census case, and the government’s attorneys failed to acknowledge those lies to the Supreme Court. This is not what our country’s top government lawyers should be doing.

I’ve litigated against Fabian and respect her public service, so I share the dismay that so many have expressed about her “safe and sanitary” argument. But the crucial lesson of the DOJ’s recent actions isn’t that we should be disappointed in a particular DOJ lawyer, or even Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued the government’s position in the census case. It’s that DOJ lawyers aren’t going to save us. As the census case shows, there are serious and ongoing institutional problems with the DOJ’s defense of Trump administration policies. These problems demand an institutional solution—one that will empower government lawyers to stand up for what’s right.

Part of the solution should be to create a new legal office—a defender general—to represent the interests of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, and to push back against faulty legal arguments by government attorneys that advance the president’s political interests.

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Let’s start with the DOJ. It has spent two-plus years utterly failing to serve as a bulwark against the Trump administration’s wanton cruelty. Sadly, we now know that, no matter what cruel policies Trump undertakes, skilled lawyers will not only take prestigious political jobs like solicitor general and attorney general, but use those jobs to paper over the Trump administration’s discriminatory intent.

For example, although in theory the solicitor general’s office has a practice of “confessing error” when it believes the government should lose a case, Francisco has not seen fit to concede the illegality of any Trump administration policy. Not the Muslim ban. Not the ban on transgender service personnel. Not family separation (where an appeal has been held in abeyance following a district court ruling against the practice). And not the citizenship question, even when confronted with what the Supreme Court just called “an explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking process.”

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Career DOJ lawyers like Fabian can’t be expected to fix what those in leadership are breaking. These lawyers are in a difficult situation because their political clients and bosses often direct the positions they take in court. If they stay in their jobs, their legal skills might be exploited to defend a cruel practice or launder Trump’s discriminatory intent. If they quit in protest, they will inevitably be replaced by lawyers who are less troubled by Trump’s actions.

Indeed, as a civil rights lawyer representing immigrants against the Trump administration, I’ve been frustrated by the tactics and arguments that some career DOJ lawyers have deployed to keep my clients from the justice they deserve. But I don’t think the career DOJ lawyers are calling the shots.

To protect the rule of law, and to save the legal profession from being debased by the next Trump, we need to look beyond individual attorneys and toward the health of our institutions.

Here’s where the Office of the Defender General would come in. The concept of a defender general has been floated in legal circles as a means of improving representation for indigent criminal defendants. Consistent with these aims, Valparaiso University Law School professor Andrea Lyon has proposed that a defender general could serve as a “voice at the policy table for the accused, incarcerated and paroled.” And Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would create a “Defender Office for Supreme Court Advocacy” to help criminal defendants in the U.S. Supreme Court and state courts of last resort.

The events of the Trump era point to another reason to create a defender general’s office: the need to counteract the DOJ during times of moral rot.

A defender general’s office could serve precisely this function if it were afforded some independence—Booker’s bill would make it a nonprofit corporation—and if its mission were understood to go beyond criminal defense. We need a government-sponsored institution whose lawyers will stand up in court, and stand athwart DOJ lawyers, to articulate our country’s interests in the liberty of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, from prisons and jails to immigration detention.

Properly empowered, a defender general could pressure the DOJ to make more responsible legal arguments, and then publicly and loudly call out the DOJ—within government and in court—when it falls short. Would DOJ leaders have sent a career lawyer to quibble with federal judges about soap and blankets for detained kids if they had understood that a prestigious government-funded law office was prepared to tell the court that the DOJ’s position was meritless?

Another virtue of creating a defender general office is that it would generate alumni who could speak out in public when the government oversteps. A weird feature of the Trump era has been that so many “resistance” heroes are former prosecutors. This is partly because media outlets favor people who have been powerful lawyers, and there are almost no powerful government law jobs devoted to criminal defense or civil rights. As a result, the voices of lawyers who have devoted their careers to freeing people, instead of advancing reasons to keep them locked up, tend to be disproportionately drowned out, not only in government but in the public square.

None of this means that a quasi-governmental defender general could easily halt the Department of Justice’s dismaying slide toward defending the indefensible. But it’s clear that the remedy for what ails the DOJ must include institutional reform of some kind. And if the defender general can’t protect the rule of law, then maybe, by publicly confronting the failure of DOJ lawyering, she can avenge it.

"Presidents Trump, Xi strike diplomatic tone during US-China trade talks",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidents-trump-xi-strike-diplomatic-tone-us-china/story?id=64032033,"In the most anticipated -- and perhaps most consequential -- meeting of his time at the G-20, President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China sat down for talks Saturday amid an ongoing trade dispute.

Both presidents struck a diplomatic tone in their remarks.

Trump said his meeting with Xi was ""excellent ... as good as it was going to be.""

He made the brief remarks seated next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a quick media spray.

""We discussed a lot of things and we're right back on track and we'll see what happens, but we had a really good meeting,"" Trump said. ""I think President Xi will be putting out a statement ... and we will too.""

He added: ""We had a very, very good meeting with China, I would say probably even better than expected. The negotiations are continuing. ... We're doing very well.""

Trump was complimentary of Xi in brief remarks before the private meeting, saying, ""We've become friends,"" and recalling his trip to Beijing in November 2017 as ""one of the most incredible of my life.""

""I look forward to working with you,"" Trump said. ""We've had an excellent relationship but we want to do something that will even it up with respect to trade.""

The president said it would be historic if the two sides could reach a fair trade deal and expressed optimism that the meeting would bring a positive result.

""I think this can be a very productive meeting and I think we can go on to do something that will be monumental and great for both countries and that's what I look forward to doing,"" Trump said.

Xi began his comments by harking back to the days of so-called ping-pong diplomacy that began a process of normalizing relations between the two sides.

""The small ball played a big role in moving world events,"" Xi said.

""Enormous change has taken place in the international situation and U.S.-China relations, but one basic fact remains unchanged: China-U.S. relations benefit from cooperation and lose in confrontation,"" Xi said.

""Cooperation and dialogue are better than friction and confrontation,"" Xi continued, and then referenced his recent exchange of calls and letters with Trump and said he looks forward to the meeting to forge a way toward cooperation.

Trump did not take any questions about whether they would be discussing the controversy surrounding Chinese telecom giant Huawei or whether the U.S. and China are close to a trade deal."
Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/736290295/top-clean-air-official-plans-to-step-down-from-epa-post-amid-ethics-probe,"Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty Images Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty Images

Bill Wehrum is stepping down as the Environmental Protection Agency's chief air quality official at the end of the month, amid mounting scrutiny over possible ethics violations.

EPA Administrator Andrew Andrew Wheeler said Wednesday that Wehrum's departure as the head of the agency's Office of Air and Radiation is both voluntary and expected.

""While I have known of Bill's desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,"" Wheeler said in a statement.

Wehrum was confirmed to the EPA post in November of 2017. Since then, he has been regarded as the architect of some of the Trump administration's most controversial climate policies, overseeing efforts to roll back regulations that limit air pollution. One casualty was the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which just last week was replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy regulation — new rules that allow more greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

""I applaud Bill and his team for finalizing the Affordable Clean Energy regulation last week and for the tremendous progress he has made in so many other regulatory initiatives,"" Wheeler said.

Wehrum also crafted a proposal that would weaken future fuel economy standards for cars and trucks.

""Bill Wehrum oversaw the most relentless rollback of clean air, climate and health safeguards in EPA's history,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council's John Walke, who is the clean air director of the group's climate and clean energy program. He called on the agency to ""return to its mission to protect Americans' health and air quality, and take strong climate action.""

Allegations of ethical violations dogged Wehrum throughout his EPA tenure, related to his former work as a lawyer and lobbyist for a number of the same companies the agency regulates — including some of the country's largest coal, oil and petrochemical companies.

Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched a probe into Wehrum's conduct in April, seeking to find out if he or his deputy, fellow former lobbyist David Harlow, may have loosened air pollution rules to help their former clients in the energy sector.

In a letter to eight utility companies and Wehrum's former lobbying firm, House Democrats on the Energy Committee said they were concerned that ""the Office of Air and Radiation's agenda appears remarkably similar to the substantive agenda"" of the firm's utilities clients. They added, ""These allegations have raised substantial questions regarding whether Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow are properly carrying out the [Clean Air Act] as directed by Congress or instead changing agency policies to benefit former clients.""

Wehrum is the latest Trump administration official to leave the environmental agency under a cloud of scrutiny. Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who resigned after reports that he misused his power and spent far more taxpayer money than his predecessors had on travel and security expenses.

With Wehrum's exit, his deputy, Anne Idsal, will take over his responsibilities."
Supreme Court gives Marine seeking VA benefits second chance in lower court,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Devan Cole']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/supreme-court-kisor-wilkie-marine-veteran-federal-agencies/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a Marine Corps veteran who sought disability benefits for his service-related post-traumatic stress a second chance to prevail in a case that will impact the amount of power federal agencies have.

But lurking behind the case was a dispute over government agencies that some conservatives feel have become too powerful, upsetting the balance of power.

Writing for five of the nine justices, Justice Elena Kagan narrowed the circumstances in which courts will defer to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous language in its own regulations. But Kagan stopped short of overturning court precedent.

Kagan wrote that such deference ""retains an important role in construing agency regulations,"" but she said it is ""sometimes appropriate and sometimes not."" She outlined ""markers"" for when courts should and should not defer.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment outlining those markers.

""The underlying regulation must be genuinely ambiguous; the agency's interpretation must be reasonable and must reflect its authoritative, expertise-based, and fair and considered judgment; and the agency must take account of reliance interests and avoid unfair surprise,"" Roberts wrote.

Paul Hughes, a lawyer for Kisor, praised the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision will significantly narrow agency authority."" Hughes noted that the lower court had applied a ""reflexive form of deference"" to the agency that was not warranted.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined in full by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, wrote to say they thought court precedent should have been ""easy for the Court"" to overturn. Gorsuch said that while the opinion manages to leave court precedent ""maimed and enfeebled"" the justices should have found the ""nerve"" to wipe it off the books.

""Although it's easy to get lost in the administrative law weeds of this case, the major headline here is that Chief Justice (John) Roberts declined to join the four other conservative justices in overruling prior precedent, and instead joined his more progressive colleagues in narrowing but not ditching the idea that courts should sometimes defer to how administrative agencies resolve ambiguities in their own regulations,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""The chief justice wrote separately to suggest that there isn't that much daylight between the result the Court reached and the one the dissenters would have adopted, but lower courts may well disagree as cases like these go forward,"" he said.

Vladeck added that the Court ""was unanimous in agreeing to send the case back to the Federal Circuit, but split as to what should happen thereafter.""

""Five Justices still think there is some room for deference to the VA, although they're not sure whether such deference is warranted in this case. Four would have the lower courts resolve the issue without any deference to the VA,"" he said.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been pushing back against the move, concerned about losing an agency that has cybersecurity and investigative components. The department, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is responsible for protecting the country against cyberattacks and ensuring election security, in addition to enforcing immigration law."

WASHINGTON — In a remarkable glimpse into President Trump’s unconventional way of running the White House and foreign policy, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has described a string of secret meetings, hidden dinners and undisclosed conversations with world leaders conducted by presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner — and concealed from America’s top diplomat.

The secret diplomacy often caught Tillerson unawares as important policy issues favored by Trump and Kushner were being decided, and created a sense of chaos within the White House to observers on the outside.

Tillerson’s comments were contained in a transcript released Thursday of testimony he gave to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in May.

NEW: President Trump's son-in-law often held talks with Saudi Arabia's crown prince and other foreign government officials without briefing or informing senior US diplomats about his discussions, former Sec. Tillerson told lawmakers in testimony. https://t.co/J6wcSxqdcu — NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) June 27, 2019

Trump fired Tillerson, via Twitter, on March 13, 2018, and replaced him with then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Trump described the former Kansas lawmaker as being more on his same “wavelength.”

It has long been known that Tillerson had a prickly relationship with Trump. He frequently found himself contradicted publicly by Trump, often within minutes of making a policy statement.

But the level of dysfunction has rarely been so starkly illustrated as in Tillerson’s under-oath testimony.

In one embarrassing episode, Tillerson said he didn’t even know his Mexican counterpart was in Washington until he walked into a restaurant and discovered Luis Videgaray dining with Kushner. It came during a delicate time in U.S.-Mexican relations, when Videgaray often went around the State Department to capitalize on his friendship with Kushner.

“I walked back,” Tillerson said. “I could see the color go out of the face of the foreign secretary of Mexico.

“I smiled big, and I said: ‘Welcome to Washington.’ And I said: ‘I don’t want to interrupt what y’all are doing.’ I said: ‘Give me a call next time you’re coming to town.’ And I left it at that.”

Tillerson said the foreign minister later said he was shocked that the issues that Kushner raised with him had not already been cleared at the State Department.

Tillerson, a former CEO of Exxon Mobil, said then-Defense Secretary James N. Mattis was also often cut out of policy discussions, with former adviser Steve Bannon acting alongside Kushner.

In another meeting concealed from the secretary of state, Kushner and Bannon at a private dinner in May 2017 discussed with leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates their plans to place a blockade on neighboring Qatar.

Tillerson, surprised when Saudi Arabia and the UAE announced the blockade some time later, indicated the U.S. would remain neutral, since Qatar is also an important ally. Barely had Tillerson spoken when Trump threw his full support behind Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The tense Persian Gulf standoff continues to this day.

Tillerson told the lawmakers that unclear lines of authority and responsibility in the White House “made it challenging for everyone.”

“When you first came on board,” Tillerson was asked, “what was Mr. Kushner’s role described to you as?”

“No one really described what he was going to be doing,” Tillerson responded.

Tillerson recalled a 1 1/2-inch-thick study Kushner had prepared outlining a complete overhaul of the U.S.-Saudi economic, business and political relationship, with little or no input from, or knowledge of, State Department diplomats.

“It’s the president’s prerogative” to have special advisers, Tillerson testified. “But … it presents special challenges to everyone if others who are trying to effect foreign policy with a country and move the agenda forward are not fully aware of other conversations that are going on that might be causing your counter-party in that country to take certain actions or behave a certain way, and you’re not clear as to why, why did they do that.”

Kushner, though his title is senior adviser to the president, was a real estate businessman in his mid-30s with no political or diplomatic experience when he entered the White House.

He is known to have a close personal relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and has shown a willingness to brush aside some of the prince’s most egregious acts, including the bombing of civilians in Yemen and an alleged role in the murder of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Under the Trump administration, and thanks in part to that friendship with Kushner, U.S. ties to Saudi Arabia are closer now than they have been in years.

Trump also put Kushner in charge of drafting a peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians, which has yet to materialize. No State Department personnel have been involved in a significant way in the proposal’s drafting."

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

""My primary responsibility is the safety of the men and women who go out there every day to protect the American people. And so it's just not true."" — Kevin McAleenan, acting DHS secretary

McAleenan was accused last week of leaking plans for raids scheduled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a unit of the DHS, after supposedly expressing fierce opposition to the plan and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

The source also said Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

McAleenan also denied that anyone in his office leaked the information after host Laura Ingraham pressed further, saying that as the operation date nears ""you have to push information out into the field.""

""So tonight you're saying these rumors are wrong false and you did not do that?"" Ingraham asked.

""Absolutely not,"" McAleenan responded.

The acting secretary also commented on the Democratic presidential candidates advocating for decriminalizing illegal border crossings, saying it would ""further undermine our efforts at the border"" and increase the numbers of those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""Decriminalizing crossing between ports of entry when we know it's associated with criminal smugglers ... when they know they bring drugs behind those people that are crossing, it would just add to the problem,"" McAleenan said.

In a press release sent to EcoWatch, the Center for Biological Diversity stated: The approval includes 2019 crops of cotton and sorghum in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Ten of the 11 states have been granted the approvals for at least four consecutive years for the same ""emergency."" Five have been given approvals for at least six consecutive years. If an occurrence is happening six years in a row, does that justify an emergency? ""This administration has been grossly abusing this exemption to allow the use of this one pesticide called sulfoxaflor on a vast acreage year after year,"" said Burd. Our biodiversity is at serious risk. For example, in Texas — where 5.8 million acres got emergency exemption to spray — more than 800 native bee species and eight species of bumblebees reside. It is also an important migration route for monarch butterflies. ""Monarch butterflies and eight species of bumblebees do overlap with Texas counties where there is sulfoxaflor spraying,"" said Burd. ""Even at subacute, very low doses, sufoxaflor will have a very dramatic effect on bumblebee reproduction."" The purpose of sulfoxaflor is to kill insects.

Farmers have only gotten away with spraying sulfoxaflor because they were granted emergency. The EPA has not approved the lethal insecticide sulfoxaflor to be used on sorghum because it is known to attract bees. At one point the EPA did allow the use of sulfoxaflor on cotton, however the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the approval — the result of a lawsuit brought to them by beekeepers. In a summary following the vacated approval in 2015, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit published conclusions: The panel held that because the EPA's decision to unconditionally register sulfoxaflor was based on flawed and limited data, the EPA's unconditional approval was not supported by substantial evidence. The panel vacated the EPA's unconditional registration because given the precariousness of bee populations, leaving the EPA's registration of sulfoxaflor in place risked more potential environmental harm than vacating it. Criticism has been raised by the fact-checking resource Snopes on the grounds that it is misleading to imply that Trump is the only one who's approved emergency exemptions for sulfoxaflor. EcoWatch asked the Center for Biological diversity to respond. ""This is not a new problem,"" said Burd. ""This has been going on for six consecutive years and we have not been in the Trump administration for six consecutive years."" So, yes, Trump's EPA did this, but ""this is by no means a new problem. Our pesticide registration and approval process is fundamentally broken. EPA's pesticide office is captured by industry and they are not doing their jobs protecting human health and the environment from these pesticides,"" said Burd.

EcoWatch asked Burd if there anything the public can do to stop these emergency approvals and prevent the use of toxic pesticides.

Burd suggested EcoWatchers consider signing a petition ""demanding that Trump's EPA stop rubber-stamping 'emergency' uses of pesticides that wreak havoc on our environment."" EcoWatchers can also help by getting involved with various groups working to protect the environment, choosing organic, refusing the use of pesticides at home, talking about not using them at work or at a homeowners association, supporting local ordinances going after pesticide issues, voting often or early and planting pollinator friendly gardens in rural and urban environments."
USDA identifies unapproved GMO wheat growing wild in Washington,https://www.upi.com,['Jessie Higgins'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/06/27/USDA-identifies-unapproved-GMO-wheat-growing-wild-in-Washington/6441561660173/,"No genetically engineered wheat is approved for use in the United States. Photo by Alexandr Dobysh/Shutterstock

June 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified the genetically modified, unapproved wheat found growing wild in Washington state as a grain created by Monsanto.

The wheat was genetically engineered to withstand the company's Roundup herbicide, which would allow farmers to better kill other plants without affecting their wheat crops. It's called Roundup Ready wheat.

The company also makes Roundup Ready corn and soybeans, both of which are approved by the USDA.

The wheat, also called MON 71800, does not have USDA approval -- no genetically engineered wheat is approved from commercial use anywhere in the world.

RELATED Unapproved GMO wheat found growing wild in Washington

Monsanto petitioned for its approval in 2002 and 2004, but chose to withdraw its applications before the agency issued a ruling, said Rick Coker, a USDA spokesman.

However, the Food and Drug Administration completed a ""voluntary consultation"" of MON 71800 in 2004, ""concluding that this GE wheat is as safe as food and feed as non-GE wheat currently on the market,"" Coker said.

The Roundup Ready wheat was found growing wild in eastern Washington state in early June in an area that was ""possibly on the site of a former [Monsanto] field trial,"" Charla Lord, a spokeswoman for Bayer, which recently purchased Monsanto, said shortly after it was found.

The USDA still is reviewing the situation, and anticipates the investigation will take between six and nine months, Coker said.

Bayer had no comment on the USDA's most recent findings. Shortly after the USDA announced the discovery June 7, the company issued the statement, ""We are cooperating with USDA to gather more information and facts as the agency reviews the situation. We will provide more information when possible."""

Two State officials told CNN that Lawler was called into the office of the deputy secretary on Monday afternoon and told he needed to leave due to the status of the investigation.

On the same afternoon, senior staff in the protocol office met with State Department management and were told that Lawler had to leave over personnel issues, according to the officials.

They were also told in this meeting that their new acting chief of protocol is Mary-Kate Fisher, and her acting deputy is Cathy Fenton, who served as social secretary in the George W. Bush White House and also handled social affairs‎ for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush. State Department sources said both are highly respected.

One of the State Department officials described what multiple others told CNN was a pattern of behavior on Lawler's part.

"USDA Shocks Markets, Analyst Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/usda-shocks-markets-analyst-says,"Wheat markets worked their way higher all week, led by Chicago as tight milling stocks and a poor-quality harvest keeps the cash markets moving higher.

Kansas City struggled to keep up as harvest rolls into Kansas.

Corn and soybeans paced sideways, waiting for the important plantings and stocks reports on Friday that were expected to provide some fireworks.

The reports didn’t disappoint. USDA pegged corn plantings at 91.7 million acres – a complete shock to the market. It is confusing how the USDA can lower corn plantings by 3 million acres earlier this month in the supply/demand report, and then give back 2 million in this report. The markets were expecting another 3-million-acre reduction!

Naturally, corn plummeted and was limit down for a few minutes before crawling out of the hole to settle just a few cents off the lows. But it was a huge outside day lower for corn, which took us down to the early June lows.

As for wheat, the plantings and stocks were pretty much in line with expectations with all plantings at 45.6 million and stocks at 1.07 billion bushels. But wheat followed corn lower, and also had a sweeping outside day lower.

Wheat has found some recent support from heat in Europe and drying conditions in the Black Sea. In late June, that will shave some yield, but it’s not a crop killer. Harvest has already begun in southern Russia with yields reportedly better than expected.

Chicago wheat has had major support from the slow moving train wreck that is this year’s crop. Basis for soft red has steadily risen as cash holders hang onto stocks, expecting they’ll need to blend it into this year’s crop. The Chicago/Kansas City spread has soared to record highs. At some point, it will hit the wall as soft red exports will plummet. Yet, it’s unlikely that hard red winter can regain premium to soft red winter until we see a notable increase in soft red supplies. That could come on more planted acres this fall, or we’d have to wait longer term to see what production will be next summer.

Hard red winter wheat harvest has moved into Kansas, with record yields in many locations. Quality has been an issue throughout the Plains, but we did see a bump in protein in northern Oklahoma. Much of the Plains’ wheat will head to the feedlots. At least it has a home.

Export sales were better than the recent average at 612 TMT. Considering our high prices, that is definitely a win.

The chart formation looks like a significant high has been made in Chicago. The other two markets established their highs in early June. Harvest progress will keep the pressure on Kansas City, and improving weather in the north is shoring up a big spring wheat crop. Corn looks like it has hit the wall, and it will likely take pollination problems to reestablish the upward trend. Pollination will occur much later than normal, raising the risk of heat issues.

I look for wheat to come down and test the lows established in mid-May by late July, especially if corn continues to move lower. Northern Hemisphere harvest will also lend pressure to wheat complex through July.

"NASA, Homeland Security receive D- grades on IT issues",https://thehill.com,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/450520-nasa-homeland-security-receive-d-grades-on-it-issues,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were both awarded D- grades on their information technology management efforts in a biannual scorecard of federal agencies.

The House Oversight government operations subcommittee released version 8.0 of the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) scorecard in a hearing on Wednesday.

The scorecard gave IT scores to two dozen agencies, as well as individual scores for each agency in areas such as cybersecurity, the modernization of technology and transparency and risk management.

The scorecard has been required since 2014 as part of the FITARA Act, which requires multiple federal agencies to boost IT security and modernization efforts. It was first published in November 2015, with the most recent previous scorecard released this past December.

While DHS and NASA both received the lowest grades, the Department of Education, the Small Business Administration, the General Services Administration, and the National Science Foundation tied for the top overall grade of a B+. No agency received an A overall score.

Scores most stayed stagnant from December, with five federal agencies increasing their scores, 14 keeping the same scores and five seeing lower scores. DHS was among those to have its grade cut, going from a C- to a D-, while the departments of Agriculture and Defense were among those that saw the most improvement since December.

Most agencies appeared to struggle most in cybersecurity, with only the National Science Foundation receiving an A in that category.

The departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Commerce all received Fs on cyber issues. Software licensing, by comparison, was the area where agencies most excelled, with 20 receiving As.

Subcommittee Chairman Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) said during the hearing that the scorecard “reflects the improvements agencies have made in implementing” the FITARA Act, and said the law would help agencies protect themselves against cyber attacks.

FedEx sues US Commerce Department over export restrictions that affect Huawei,https://www.cnn.com,"['Sherisse Pham', 'Cnn Business']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/business/fedex-lawsuit-intl-hnk-huawei/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) US delivery company FedEx has filed a lawsuit against the US government, arguing that it should not be required to enforce federal government export bans.

The move comes after FedEx mishandled a couple of deliveries for Huawei , and failed to deliver a Huawei smartphone shipped from Britain to the United States.

Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone brand. The Trump administration added Huawei to a trade blacklist last month , barring US companies from selling or exporting technology and components to the Chinese tech firm without first obtaining a US government license.

The restrictions have disrupted Huawei's global supply chain, and left companies like Alphabet-ownedandscrambling to figure out what they can and cannot sell to Huawei.

said in a statement Monday that the US Export Administration Regulations ""violate common carriers' rights"" by making delivery companies liable for shipments that may violate US restrictions. ""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" the statement said.

The regulations ""essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally,"" the company said in its lawsuit

""We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting US national security,"" a Commerce Department spokesperson said Tuesday.

FedEx under fire in China

Beijing launched an investigation into FedEx earlier this month, after Huawei said the delivery company diverted to the United States two packages intended for the company's offices in China.

""FedEx, as a large multinational corporation, should offer the public a reasonable explanation. And they should also take responsibility for their actions,"" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Geng Shuang said Monday, in reference to Huawei's dispute with FedEx.

On Friday, PCMag reported that FedEx ""refused"" to deliver a Huawei smartphone sent by one of its UK writers to the magazine's New York office. It was returned to sender, with a label attached saying ""parcel returned by FedEx, due to US government issue"" with Huawei and the Chinese government, according to PCMag.

""The package in question was mistakenly returned to the shipper, and we apologize for this operational error,"" FedEx spokesperson Maury Donahue said in a statement to CNN Business.

She added that the company is trying to minimize disruptions to customers as ""we adjust operations to comply with a dynamic US regulatory environment.""

Asked about the botched deliveries in an interview with Fox News on Monday, FedEx CEO Fred Smith said ""Huawei is just emblematic of this problem.""

FedEx contacted the Department of Commerce and told them that ""the increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden on FedEx and common carriers,"" Smith said."
VA secretary visiting Dayton military cemetery criticized for pro-Confederacy comments,https://www.daytondailynews.com,[],,,,https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/secretary-visiting-dayton-criticized-for-pro-confederacy-comments/QUNLF8G5ddSZPVAI1LjqyI/,"Robert Wilkie, secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, will visit the campus of the Dayton VA Medical Center today.

Wilkie, who became secretary almost a year ago, has come under fire for pro-Confederacy comments and speeches he made in the past.

The current Dayton VA campus was originally home to a hospital for veterans of the Civil War, several of which are buried in the adjacent Dayton National Cemetery.

» RELATED: Once erased from the map, 150-year-old Dayton VA tunnel could be reopened

In a 1995 speech, Wilkie praised Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, as a “martyr to the lost cause,” reports The Washington Post. Wilkie also reportedly described Davis as an “exceptional man in an exceptional age though he did call slavery a “stain on our story as it is a stain on every civilization in history.”

Wilkie’s ancestors fought for the Confederacy, according to the Post. As recently as 2005, Wilkie was a guest at annual memorial ceremonies hosted by Confederate descendants around Davis’ birthday, the Post reports.

Wilkie visited the Columbus VA in October and was at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center on Thursday before coming to Dayton, said Ted Froats, spokesperson for the Dayton VAMC.

“This is just a standard visit, typical of new secretaries getting to know the facilities he oversees,” Froats said via email.

The Dayton VA Medical Center’s campus was originally the location of the Central Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers. It opened in Dayton in 1867 and was the third of its kind to house and care for veterans of the Civil War, according to the National Cemetery Administration.

Three Civil War veterans, all Union soldiers, who received the Medal of Honor are buried in what eventually became the Dayton National Cemetery. They include Army Lt. Henry W. Downs, Navy Seaman John H. James and Army Pvt. Charles A. Taggart.

Army Pvt. Joshua Dubar, a former slave who served in the all-black 55th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, was buried in Dayton National Cemetery in 1885. He was the father of famed poet Paul Laurence Dunbar.

The Confederacy is a symbol that has “always represented more than ancestral pride” and is “extremely hurtful,” said Derrick Foward, president of the Dayton chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Foward said he hopes that while Wilkie is in town that he will refrain from using pro-Confederacy rhetoric he’s used in the past.

“It’s frankly hurtful to millions of Americans,” Foward said. “To know that it is being promoted by any arm of the United States government is all the more hurtful.”

The FTC’s Qualcomm Case Reveals Concerning Divide with DOJ on Patent Hold-Up,https://www.ipwatchdog.com,['The Author'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/06/28/ftcs-qualcomm-case-reveals-concerning-divide-doj-patent-hold/id=110764/,"“For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty.”

On May 2, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took the unusual step of submitting a Statement of Interest in the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) case against Qualcomm to take a position contrary to the FTC. The DOJ argued that “[b]ecause an overly broad remedy could result in reduced innovation, with the potential to harm American consumers, this Court should hold a hearing and order additional briefing to determine a proper remedy that protects competition while working minimal harm to public and private interests.” In response, the FTC informed the court that it “did not participate in or request” the DOJ’s filing, that it “disagree[d] with a number of contentions” made by the DOJ, and that the DOJ “misconstrues applicable law and the record.” In the end, the court agreed with the FTC and issued injunctive relief against Qualcomm without conducting the further remedy proceedings the DOJ advocated.

Underscoring the Divide

The public feuding between the two federal antitrust enforcement agencies about how to resolve a case litigated by one them was a remarkable spectacle. It also brought into focus a broader divide between the FTC and DOJ on the role of antitrust law in addressing patents that are essential to industry standards (SEPs) and subject to commitments to license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

Since being confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division in September 2017, Makan Delrahim has shifted the DOJ’s longstanding focus on the risks of patent hold-up—where SEP owners take advantage of large investments by companies to develop products using a standard to extract unreasonable, non-FRAND licensing terms—to address what he views as the greater risk of patent hold-out—which he defines as potential licensees colluding on issues such as licensing terms for SEPs. In a March 16, 2018 speech, Delrahim said that “hold-up is fundamentally not an antitrust problem, and therefore antitrust law should not be used as a tool to police FRAND commitments that patent-holders make to standard setting organizations” and offered his view that “implementer hold-out poses a more serious threat to innovation than innovator hold-up.”

Joseph Simons, the FTC Chairman, addressed this divide in a September 25, 2018 speech. While he noted that “[c]onsistency across the two federal enforcement agencies is . . . beneficial,” he observed that treatment of SEPs may be an area for “some potential inconsistency” between the agencies. He elaborated that “we agree with the Division that hold-out in the standard-setting process can raise serious concerns under antitrust law when such hold-out is the result of collusion among potential adopters/licensees. But we also believe that hold-up raises potential antitrust issues, as well.” Simons committed that the FTC “will continue our economically grounded and fact-based enforcement of the antitrust laws in this area.” Consistent with that approach, the FTC contended in a December 2018 filing in the Qualcomm case that “Qualcomm’s refusal to make SEP licenses available to competitors in breach of its voluntary commitments to standard-setting organizations is anticompetitive conduct.”

Although the DOJ submission in the Qualcomm case did not take a position on the merits, it appears to have been motivated by, and is consistent with, Delrahim’s efforts to downplay the potential for harm from patent hold-up. (Delrahim, who lobbied for Qualcomm, is reportedly recused from matters involving Qualcomm and did not sign the DOJ’s Qualcomm filing.) The DOJ filing highlighted the divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this important issue. It was not always so. For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty regarding what had been a consensus area of concern for the agencies.

The Roles of the DOJ and FTC

Before turning to how the DOJ and FTC have previously addressed patent hold-up, it is worth briefly examining the dual roles of the DOJ and FTC in enforcing the antitrust laws.

Among other statutes, the DOJ Antitrust Division is charged with criminal and civil enforcement under the Sherman Act and civil enforcement under the Clayton Act. The DOJ also provides guidance on the application of antitrust laws, including by issuing business review letters advising on how it may respond to particular proposed joint ventures or other business conduct.

The FTC was created with the passage of the FTC Act, which directs the agency to prevent “unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(2). As interpreted by the FTC, Section 5 of the FTC Act “encompasses not only those acts and practices that violate the Sherman or Clayton Act but also those that contravene the spirit of the antitrust laws and those that, if allowed to mature or complete, could violate the Sherman or Clayton Act.” Unlike the DOJ, the FTC does not conduct criminal enforcement.

The jurisdictions and roles of the FTC and DOJ thus overlap, including in merger reviews, investigations of anticompetitive conduct, and offering guidance on the antitrust laws. The agencies employ a “clearance” process to ensure that they do not undertake duplicative investigations that would, among other problems, subject targets to competing demands from the agencies and potentially lead to conflicting outcomes.

When it comes to the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property, both agencies have oversight responsibilities and they have collaborated to issue guidance on their shared approach to enforcement. For example, in 1995, the agencies jointly issued Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property setting forth their policy on antitrust treatment of licensing intellectual property.

The DOJ and FTC Have Traditionally Agreed on the Dangers of Patent Hold-Up

Over the course of more than a decade—across both the Republican Bush Administration and the Democratic Obama Administration—the DOJ and FTC both consistently recognized that SEPs present a danger of hold-up, and that this was a proper subject for antitrust agency enforcement.

As early as 2006, the DOJ warned of the dangers of patent hold-up in a business review letter to a standard-setting organization (SSO): “Once a particular technology is chosen and the standard is developed . . . it can be extremely expensive or even impossible to substitute one technology for another. . . . Thus, those seeking to implement a given standard may be willing to license a patented technology included in the standard on more onerous terms than they would have been prior to the standard’s adoption in order to avoid the expense and delay of developing a new standard around a different technology.”

In 2007, the DOJ and FTC partnered to issue a report called Antitrust Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights: Promoting Innovation and Competition. The agencies described the “potential for ‘hold up’ by the owner of patented technology after its technology has been chosen by the SSO as a standard and others have incurred sunk costs which effectively increase the relative cost of switching to an alternative standard.” The agencies warned that this “power to extract higher royalties or other licensing terms” could harm consumers “if those higher royalties were passed on in the form of higher prices.”

In 2013, the DOJ partnered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office on a Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments. The Policy warned of the risk that SEPs could be used “to pressure an implementer of a standard to accept more onerous licensing terms than the patent holder would be entitled to receive consistent with the F/RAND commitment.” A DOJ official explained that the Statement “was informed by over a decade of thinking by the [DOJ Antitrust Division], the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the PTO about standards-setting activities and the IP policies of standard-setting organizations (SSOs).” (Delrahim announced in December 2018 that the DOJ was withdrawing its assent to the Statement.)

Beyond issuing guidance, the DOJ also accounted for patent hold-up in enforcement. In 2012, when the DOJ closed its investigation of Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings and a consortium’s acquisition of Nortel Networks’ SEPs, it explained that it had “focused on whether the acquiring firms would have the incentive and ability to exploit ambiguities in the SSOs’ F/RAND licensing commitments to hold up rivals, thus preventing or inhibiting innovation and competition,” including by “seeking to prevent or exclude products from practicing those SEPs from the market altogether.”

For its part, the FTC has challenged hold-up through seven enforcement actions over two decades. Those include a 2005 consent order with Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) after the FTC accused it of monopolizing a market for low-emission gasoline by misrepresenting in state regulatory standard-setting proceedings that an approach to reducing emissions was in the public domain when Unocal was actively pursuing patents on the technology that would later allow it to charge hold-up royalties to its competitors.

A Cause for Concern

The DOJ’s turn away from its long-held position on the risks of patent hold-up is a cause for serious concern.

First, it is bad policy. In explaining the DOJ’s about-face, Delrahim has referred to a “so-called ‘hold-up’ problem in the context of SSOs” and contended that concerns with hold-up “rely on models devoid of economic or empirical evidence that hold-up is a real phenomenon.” But the DOJ’s prior recognition of the risks of patent hold-up was well supported.

U.S. courts have long recognized that SEPs pose a hold-up threat. In 2007, for example, the Third Circuit observed that “[t]o guard against anticompetitive patent hold-up, most [standards development organizations] require firms supplying essential technologies for inclusion in a prospective standard to commit to licensing their technologies on FRAND terms.” Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 313 (3d Cir. 2007). More recently, the Ninth Circuit explained that “[t]he development of standards . . . creates an opportunity for companies to engage in anti-competitive behavior” and that “[u]sing that standard-development leverage, the SEP holders are in a position to demand more for a license than the patented technology, had it not been adopted by the SSO, would be worth.” Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 795 F.3d 1024, 1031 (9th Cir. 2015); see also, e.g., Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“SEPs pose two potential problems that could inhibit widespread adoption of the standard: patent hold-up and royalty stacking”).

As to the economics of patent hold-up, the DOJ observed in a 2015 business review letter that the “economic bargaining model underlying claims of hold-up has been studied extensively and applied to the standard-setting context,” citing scholarship dating back decades. That conclusion echoed the views of the DOJ and FTC in their 2007 report that patent hold-up is simply a “variant of the classic ‘hold-up problem’.” The DOJ also noted in its 2015 letter that “litigated cases demonstrate the potential for hold up when owners of RAND-encumbered standards-essential patents make royalty demands significantly above the adjudicated RAND rate” and provided examples where licensors’ demands were on the order of about 170 to 230 times what courts determined were RAND rates.

Recognition of the dangers of hold-up is thus well supported as a matter of law and economics. To be sure, if competitors collude in an SSO to fix the terms on which they will license technology, antitrust enforcement would be appropriate. But simply because one can envision the possibility of an alternative form of anticompetitive conduct relating to standard setting does not mean that the DOJ should simply ignore the well-documented existence of another form of harm.

Second, the DOJ’s abrupt shift away from over a decade of guidance on hold-up creates uncertainty for the many industries that rely on standards. While the shift in policy has been cast as being motivated by a concern for fostering innovation, it threatens to have the opposite effect. Companies planning investments in standardized products now face greater uncertainty about whether they can count on established rules, particularly as articulated in the DOJ’s business review letters, to safeguard their ability to license SEPs on FRAND terms.

Third, that a change in administration has led the DOJ to turn away from a long-held, bipartisan approach plays into the perception that antitrust enforcement is increasingly a political tool. While there may be higher profile examples of the politicization of antitrust enforcement, any step that suggests that a change in administration, not law and economics, will lead to wholesale departure from existing antitrust policy is troubling."

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”
