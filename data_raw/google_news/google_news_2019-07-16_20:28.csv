"GOP leaders dismiss Dem outcry over Trump tweets as ‘all about politics,’ impeachment",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-brass-blast-dems-outcry-to-trump-tweets-as-all-about-politics-impeachment,"House Republican leaders stood by President Trump on Tuesday in response to a Democratic resolution condemning his controversial tweets about four freshman lawmakers, alleging their outrage is “all about politics” and suggesting it's being used to revive an impeachment push.

“They talked more about impeachment than anything else,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, referring to Monday's fiery press conference with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley. ""We should get back to the business of America.""

CONWAY BLASTS DEMS' 'TIRED' CLAIMS OF RACISM, SAYS SHE 'TOTALLY DISAGREES' WITH HUSBAND'S SCATHING OP-ED

The battle between Trump and congressional Democrats over his weekend tweets has become all-consuming, effectively putting other skirmishes -- ranging from a bid to hold Trump Cabinet officials in contempt to feuding inside the Democratic caucus over those same freshman lawmakers' conduct -- on the backburner.

If anything, Trump's comments -- telling the freshmen to “go back” to the countries they came from (despite all but Omar being from the United States) and then come back and show everyone how to fix things -- have united the fractured Democrats for the time being.

Democratic leaders are now preparing a resolution condemning Trump's remarks for the House floor later Tuesday. And in a House Democratic Caucus meeting Tuesday morning, Speaker Nancy Pelosi made clear her support for the four freshmen amid these attacks -- just days after she and Ocasio-Cortez were trading jabs in dueling media interviews.

“These are our sisters,” Pelosi said, according to an aide in the room.

Despite the resolution's focus on Trump's tweets, McCarthy said that Monday's press conference held by the four congresswomen revealed their true goal.

“On the night of being sworn in … they spoke about impeachment in words I will not use here,” McCarthy said, likely referring to when Tlaib said, “Impeach the motherf----r.”

McCarthy also accused House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., of working to win the chairmanship based on his supposed ability to impeach the president, before Special Counsel Robert Mueller had even released his report on the Russia investigation. (Publicly, Nadler has said there's justification to pursue impeachment but has urged caution.)

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise also accused Democrats of calling “for impeachment of the president from day one.”

In advance of the House vote on the resolution, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a Capitol press conference, said Trump must “tone down the xenophobic and racist rhetoric that is consistently peddled out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.” He called for Republicans to join Democrats in voting to condemn the president’s remarks in Tuesday’s vote.

“We want the strongest vote possible,” Jeffries said. “And we’re hopeful that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would put country ahead of party, would put decency ahead of Donald Trump. Let’s see what happens on the floor later on this evening.”

Some Republicans have condemned the president's remarks, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who tweeted: “There is no excuse for the president’s spiteful comments –they were absolutely unacceptable and this needs to stop.”

But McCarthy, while clarifying that he believes the Democratic lawmakers in question ""love this country,"" said he is not on board with the resolution and will encourage other Republicans to vote against it.

“Let’s not be false about what is happening here today – this is all about politics,” McCarthy said.

This echoed Trump’s own warnings about the resolution that he delivered in a tweet Tuesday morning.

“The so-called vote to be taken is a Democratic con game,” Trump said, warning that “Republicans should not show ‘weakness’ and fall into their trap.”

When asked whether he thought Trump’s tweets were racist, McCarthy said no. When asked if he was concerned about the optics of the GOP backing Trump amid accusations of racism, he said, “This is the party of Lincoln … this party believes in the content of the individual.”

House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney tried to turn the issue of racism around on Democrats, specifically Pressley for saying recently that, ""We don’t need black faces that don't want to be a black voice.""

WALL STREET JOURNAL: TRUMP'S TWEETS GIVE DEMOCRATS A BREAK FROM ATTACKING EACH OTHER

“Our colleagues are wrong when they tell Americans, as Congresswoman Pressley did just last weekend that any individual’s seat that the table is only valuable, only legitimate if that person espouses some preapproved set of beliefs deemed appropriate based on their religion or their gender or their race. When they say that, that is racist,” Cheney said, stating that the GOP’s opposition to the so-called “Squad” of progressive women “has to do with the content of their policies,” not their gender, religion, or race.

The Painful Roots of Trump’s ‘Go Back’ Comment,https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Rogers'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/aoc-trump-tlaib-omar-pressley.html,"It was there in 1882, when the Chinese Exclusion Act sought to curb the number of Chinese workers and families entering the United States to find day-labor work, from building railroads to doing laundry. And it was there in the 1840s, when anti-Irish and anti-Catholic sentiment in the United States led to the creation of a nativist political party designed to weed out foreign influence.

One of the prime examples of the “go back” sentiment has roots in the American Colonization Society, a white-led organization that sought to send freed slaves back to Africa. Fodei Batty, an assistant professor of political science at Quinnipiac University, wrote in a 2016 Washington Post analysis that some freed slaves went willingly because they were “disillusioned with the prospects of racial equality in America,” while others who wanted to stay argued that the effort to resettle slaves was a thinly veiled way to purge the United States of black people.

Descendants of those who stayed, Mr. Batty said in an interview, are now familiar with the sort of knee-jerk “go back” slur meant to immediately single out someone from a group where one trait — usually whiteness — is the default.

“You’re making this claim only to adopt a sense of place,” Mr. Batty said, “to put someone in a sense of place and give a sense of the other, that someone is different, without even having an understanding of the implications of those words.”

For African-Americans, the idea of returning to Africa, originally advocated by some whites as a better alternative than servitude, now persists as an angry slur. Outside a Trump rally in Cleveland in 2016, a man was filmed shouting “go back to Africa” at a black woman who was there to protest Mr. Trump.

“Y’all brought us here,” the woman retorted.

From the 4,800 responses The Times received, a common theme seemed to be encountering the slur when speaking up in white spaces, with the targets not limited to African-Americans. Samantha Edwards, a 47-year-old administrative assistant who grew up in Las Vegas, also wrote to The Times to share her story.

In the mid-1990s, she said she and her mother were chased out of a restaurant by two white men who screamed at them to “go back to Mexico.” She said she and her mother had been speaking together in English before the men chased them. Ms. Edwards, who was born in the United States but is of Mexican descent, said her parents avoided teaching her Spanish so she could avoid some of the discrimination they felt."

Senior Trump officials confirmed Tuesday that most Bureau of Land Management headquarters staffers must leave D.C. by the end of next year under the Interior Department’s reorganization plan.

In a 17-page letter to lawmakers, Interior Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Joe Balash detailed how the administration plans to move 81 percent of the agency’s headquarters staff west of the Rockies by 2020. The relocation, which The Post first outlined Monday, will move all but 60 Washington-based staffers and represents a sweeping change to the agency that manages more than 10 percent of America’s land.

“This implementation plan will delegate more responsibility and authority down to the field, optimize services available to the American people, is demonstrably cost-effective, and will provide an increased presence closer to the resources the BLM staff manages,” Balash wrote Sen. Tom Udall (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

A total of 27 leadership jobs will be relocated to Grand Junction, Colo., Balash said, “as part of an initiative to establish the Headquarters.” Seventy-four of the reassigned employees will report to BLM state directors instead of headquarters staff, he said, and staffers will be reassigned to states including Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming.

Hours before Interior formally notified Capitol Hill of the move, Balash and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Land and Minerals Management Casey Hammond, who has been running the bureau on an acting basis since May, provided employees with details about the reorganization.

Several lawmakers have already embraced the reorganization plan, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Republican Reps. Rob Bishop (Utah) and Scott R. Tipton (Colo.). In a statement Monday, Bishop said that he would work with Bernhardt to place the staffers moving to Utah in the right place.

“The BLM personnel will be moved where they will have a greater impact on, and input by, the people who live in the regions where their influence is greatest,” Bishop said. “Not by bureaucrats from thousands of miles away.”

But critics of the plan such as Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), who chairs the House Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, said in a statement that it made no sense for the administration to unilaterally reorganize an agency when the president has yet to nominate a permanent director for BLM after more than two-and-a-half years in office.

“After my discussion with Secretary Bernhardt this morning, serious questions remain: What are the benefits to the Interior Department and to the American public? What problem will this move solve? Why is BLM singled out for this move? How much will the move cost?” McCollum asked. “Assuming the goal is to improve efficiency, streamline operations, and improve lines of communication, perhaps Mr. Bernhardt should prioritize securing a permanent director — which BLM has lacked for the duration of this administration — before the Department spends millions of taxpayer dollars playing musical chairs with employees’ lives.”

Kate P. Kelly, public lands director for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, questioned in an email why the administration would reassign nearly all of the bureau’s D.C. staff when 95 percent of them already work out in the field.

“The true impact of this move is to make the agency and its leadership invisible in a city where — like it or not — the decisions about budgets and policies are made,” she said. “The constant shuffling, shrinking and disassembling of BLM’s workforce will have long-term implications for the health of the agency.”

According to a participant in Tuesday’s employee briefing at the agency’s 20 M St. office in Southeast Washington, the tension in the room was palpable as employees questioned what the move would mean for those with two-career families or other obligations that might tie them to Washington. The staffer spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation.

When Hammond declared, “There is no need to panic,” several in the audience laughed.

“This announcement is deeply unsettling, and has created a lot of uncertainty for us,” the participant said. “The best part of my job is my co-workers, and they are working to tear us apart for purely political reasons. I’m sick to my stomach.”

Hammond and Balash emphasized the relocation would save the government money because the cost of living was cheaper out West and the lease on the BLM’s main building, in Southeast Washington, was set to expire. But one employee suggested in the meeting that staffers’ pay will also decline once they relocate and urged colleagues to write their member of Congress, prompting applause.

Balash also said that officials are looking to relocate staffers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey, but the department has not done as comprehensive an analysis of those moves.

Other employees embraced the reorganization, according to the meeting participant, asking how early they can leave Washington.

It is unclear what sort of congressional authorization is required to carry out the administration’s plan. When a BLM staffer raised the issue on Tuesday, Hammond replied that the department had already received the $5 million needed to carry out the initial stage of the move in May."
"In Eric Garner case, Justice Department declines civil rights charges against New York City police officer",https://www.foxnews.com,['Lucia Suarez Sang'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-will-not-pursue-charges-against-cop-involved-in-eric-garners-death-source,"Despite disagreement between top prosecutors regarding the strength of the case, the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday ultimately declined to bring civil rights charges against the New York City police officer involved in the controversial and racially-charged death of Eric Garner -- with Attorney General Bill Barr stepping in to make the ultimate decision, a person familiar with the case confirmed to Fox News.

Garner, who was black, died in 2014 during his arrest for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes outside a Staten Island convenience store. The 43-year-old refused to be handcuffed, and cops -- including the white officer who the DOJ declined to prosecute -- took him down.

A senior justice official familiar with the case told Fox News the DOJ's Civil Rights Division recommended charges be brought against officer Daniel Pantaleo -- but the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York disagreed, saying the government's burden of proof could not be met.

Ultimately, the decision fell to Barr, who broke the tie and made the final call not to bring charges after several briefings with lawyers on both sides of the issue and after viewing the video of the arrest gone awry on numerous occasions.

In the video, taken by a bystander, Garner was heard crying out “I can’t breathe” at least 11 times before he fell unconscious. The phrase has since become a rallying cry among those protesting perceived racial injustices perpetrated by police departments nationwide.

FLASHBACK: ERIC GARNER CHOKEHOLD DEATH: NO INDICTMENT FOR NYPD COP, DOJ TO OPEN CIVIL RIGHTS PROBE

The decision not to bring charges against Pantaleo comes a day before the statute of limitations was set to expire, marking five years since the encounter that led to Garner’s death.

A state grand jury has also refused to indict the officer on criminal charges. Civil rights prosecutors have advocated charges in the case, though they've met fierce resistance.

Garner's family and attorney were informed of a decision Tuesday morning. During a press conference later with the Rev. Al Sharpton, Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, demanded the police department act immediately to fire Pantaleo.

""We are here with heavy hearts because the DOJ has failed us,"" she said. ""Five years ago my son said he couldn't breathe 11 times. Today we can't breathe because they have let us down.""

She added: ""We will keep pushing. This is not the end. We are asking the commissioner to make the right decision.""

An attorney for the family said the DOJ's failure to bring charges against Pantaleo was a ""national shame"" and said every candidate running for president will need to take a position on this case.

Chokeholds are banned under police policy and, though Pantaleo maintained he used a different and legal takedown maneuver called the “seatbelt,” the medical examiner’s office has said a chokehold contributed to Garner’s death.

But, according to a senior Department of Justice official, prosecutors still felt they couldn't reach the bar for proving Pantaleo or other officers acted ""willfully"" during the physical confrontation.

""What's communicated to the officer is relevant, but it is not determinative to what was going through the officer's mind,"" the official said.

ERICA GARNER, DAUGHTER OF NYPD CHOKEHOLD VICTIM, DIES AFTER SUFFERING HEART ATTACK

Part of the Department's thinking in the matter relied on Supreme Court precedent, specifically, the case 'Graham v. Connor,' in which the high court ruled ""not every push or shove violates the Fourth Amendment"" and the fact that police officers must make ""split-second decisions"" has to be taken into account.

The particular test that could not be met was whether the officers -- and Pantaleo in particular -- carried out their actions ""willfully,"" the official said. To meet that burden, the government would have been required to prove officers were acting with ""some clarity of thought.""

""We expect a different outcome when a member of the public comes in contact with a police officer,"" a senior DOJ official said. ""But the decision to bring federal charges is a different matter.""

The New York Police Department brought Pantaleo up on departmental charges earlier this year. An administrative judge has not ruled whether he violated policy. He could face dismissal, but Police Commissioner James O’Neill has the final say. O'Neill will not make a formal decision until the police administrative judge who oversaw the disciplinary trial renders her verdict, the New York Times reported.

The NYPD said in a tweet on Tuesday that the internal department disciplinary case against Pantaleo is ""proceeding and a determination has NOT yet been made.""

""Today's announcement by the US Department of Justice does not affect this process,"" it said.

None of the other police officers involved in Garner's death have been charged with a crime or disciplined by the Police Department.

""All the officers involved need to be off the books. The steers of New York City are not safe with them,"" Carr said. ""Five years ago, it was my family. Tomorrow it could be yours... We are going to keep fighting. This will not be swept under the rug.""

In the years since Garner’s death, Pantaleo has remained on the job but not in the field, and activists have decried the fact he's still being issued paychecks that include union-negotiated raises.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement that the city put their faith in the federal government to act on possible charges against Pantaleo and that they ""won't make that mistake again.""

""New York City is not the same city it was five years ago. We are a different city, and we must act like a different city,"" he said. ""Moving forward, we will not wait for the federal government to commence our own disciplinary proceedings.""

The city of New York also reached a civil settlement with Garner's family in 2015 for $5.9 million.

"E.P.A. Broke Rules in Shake-Up of Science Panels, Federal Watchdog Says",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/climate/epa-advisory-panels-gao-report.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration failed to follow ethics rules last year when it dismissed academic members of Environmental Protection Agency advisory boards and replaced them with appointees connected to industry, a federal watchdog agency concluded Monday.

The agency, the Government Accountability Office, found that the administration “did not consistently ensure” that appointees to E.P.A. advisory panels met federal ethics requirements. It also concluded that Trump administration officials violated E.P.A. guidelines by not basing the appointments on recommendations made by career staff members.

Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s first E.P.A. administrator who resigned last year amid ethics scandals, remade the agency’s science advisory panels because he said they did not fairly represent the United States geographically, or the industries affected by regulations.

The percentage of academic scientists serving on one E.P.A. panel, the Scientific Advisory Board, dropped 27 percent during the first year of the Trump administration. Academics on the agency’s Board of Scientific Counselors dropped 45 percent. Investigators found that the percentage of academics on E.P.A. advisory boards remained stable around 83 percent during the first year President Barack Obama was in office ."
"US Treasury Secretary Shares Trump’s Concerns on Crypto, Stresses Compliance",https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'John Jackal', 'Justin Connelly', 'Ernst D. Berg', 'Jose Rafael Ruiz Estanga', 'Masao Akimoto']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-shares-trumps-concerns-on-crypto-stresses-compliance,"United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin shares President Donald Trump’s concerns on the use of cryptocurrency to finance illicit activity, and stresses the role of enforcing FinCEN regulations with respect to crypto-dealing organizations. Mnuchin made his remarks at a press conference on July 15.

Mnuchin called the use of cryptocurrencies to fund illicit activity a national security issue, saying that billions of dollars have been used for this purpose:

“Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity, like cybercrime, tax evasion, extortion, randomware, illicit drugs, human trafficking […] This is indeed a national security issue.”

In response to a question from the press, Mnuchin further commented on the ostensible role of crypto as a means to finance crime, saying:

“I think to a large extent, these cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activities and speculation.”

Secretary Mnuchin also echoed the Presidents’ latest Twitter posts on cryptocurrencies, saying: “As the President has said: ‘Bitcoin is highly volatile and based on thin air’” and “Treasury takes very seriously the role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.”

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, President Trump tweeted out a series of anti-crypto and anti-Bitcoin remarks on July 12, following his “Social Media Summit” for conservative personalities. Trump remarked that the value of crypto is “highly volatile and based on thin air” and that they can “facilitate unlawful behavior.”

According to Mnuchin, the Treasury has stressed — to Facebook and Bitcoin (BTC) users among others — that digital financial services are bound by the same Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism policies as traditional institutions such as banks.

Additionally, he said that any crypto transmitters must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN): a bureau of the Treasury. FinCEN is the federal regulator that implements the BSA in practice, and has authority over all money service transmitters — including cryptocurrency projects such as Libra.

Mnuchin also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s Working Group on Digital Assets, which reportedly includes key regulatory players such as the SEC, CFTC, and the Fed in addition to FinCEN. The idea of this group is to mitigate purported regulatory risks associated with cryptocurrencies."

"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

Presidential historian: Trump now with Andrew Johnson as 'most racist president in American history',https://thehill.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/453240-presidential-historian-trump-now-with-andrew-johnson-as-most-racist,"Presidential historian Jon Meacham said Monday that President Trump Donald John TrumpEsper sidesteps question on whether he aligns more with Mattis or Trump Warren embraces Thiel label: 'Good' As tensions escalate, US must intensify pressure on Iran and the IAEA MORE's latest attacks against a group of minority congresswomen placed him alongside former President Andrew Johnson as the ""most racist president in American history.""

""What the president’s done here is yet again, because I think he did it after Charlottesville, and I think he did it frankly when he was pushing the birther lie about President Obama, is he has joined Andrew Johnson as the most racist president in American history,"" Meacham, who has written biographies on past presidents Thomas Jefferson and George H.W. Bush, said on MSNBC's ""Hardball.""

Meacham described the 17th president's history with racism, noting that Johnson once said in a state message that ""African Americans were incapable of self government and relapsed into barbarism if they weren’t closely supervised.""

The historian drew the parallels between Trump and Johnson one day after Trump targeted four freshman House lawmakers, saying that they should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" before speaking out about how the United States government should be run.

Trump also claimed that the progressive Democrats ""came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe.""

He did not identify the lawmakers in his tweet, but the comments were aimed at Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.). The four addressed the comments in a press conference on Monday. Omar, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia, is the only one among the four who was born in a foreign country.

Several Democratic lawmakers, as well as multiple GOP congressmen, have derided the comments as xenophobic and racist. House Democrats on Monday introduced a formal resolution to condemn Trump's remarks.

Meacham, a frequent critic of Trump, said Monday that the president's remarks contradicted the ""journey"" of the United States.

""It’s long been said, and President Reagan said it quite well, that America is the one place on earth that is not about a birthright,"" he said. ''It’s about the ascent to an idea, an idea that was written in one of the most important sentences ever written in the English language, that all men were created equal and were endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.

""We didn't apply that fully then. We haven't applied that fully now. But that journey toward a more perfect union is the story of the country.""

Trump has stood by his remarks about the progressive Democrats, stating that the lawmakers should leave the country if they are not ""happy."""
DHS inspector general confirms investigation into leaked ICE raids,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-confirms-investigation-into-leaked-ice-raids,"The Department of Homeland Security's independent Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement to call off a nationwide operation, according to the federal agency.

“Last month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) became aware of an apparent leak related to a planned enforcement operation. Leaks of law enforcement sensitive information jeopardize the safety of ICE officers and agents who have sworn an oath to uphold the law. ICE referred the incident to its Office of Professional Responsibility, which, in accordance with its normal procedures, referred it to the DHS Office of Inspector General,"" ICE said in a statement issued Monday morning.

The Washington Examiner was first to report on Friday that then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team had reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak.

""Everyone knows who they are investigating. Why didn't the acting secretary call for an investigation?"" a senior official told the Washington Examiner on Monday.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak. These sources charged he wanted to sabotage ICE’s months-long plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham two weeks ago, but last Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which Border Patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE carried out raids nationwide this past weekend, though reports suggested they were not of the magnitude anticipated."
"BLM moving headquarters to Colorado from D.C., dashing Utah’s hopes",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Bmaffly Sltrib.Com', 'Brian Maffly']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2019/07/15/federal-bureau-land/,"Following through on one of his predecessor’s key initiatives, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is expected to announce Tuesday that he will move the Bureau of Land Management’s headquarters from Washington, D.C., out West.

While Salt Lake City and Ogden would have been centrally located cities for the agency’s national office, Utah was not selected, although some BLM staffers could be transferred to offices here.

The headquarters will be established in Grand Junction, Colo., an oil and gas industry hub, according to Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, who praised the move because it will bring the agency closer to the lands it administers.

“The problem with Washington is too many policymakers are far removed from the people they are there to serve. Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is west of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters,"" Gardner said in a prepared statement. ""This is a victory for local communities, advocates for public lands, and proponents for a more responsible and accountable federal government.”

Ryan Zinke, a onetime Montana congressman, had proposed moving the BLM headquarters from his first day as President Donald Trump’s interior secretary, as part of a larger effort to reorganize Interior’s various agencies. Zinke left office under a cloud of ethics investigations early this year and was succeeded by his No. 2, Bernhardt, a native Coloradoan who had previously worked for the BLM and later as an oil and gas industry lobbyist.

According to reporting by The Washington Post, Bernhardt plans to relocate 77 staffers, or one-fifth of the BLM’s 350-member Washington workforce, to Western cities, mostly to Grand Junction, at a cost of about $4 million. E&E News broke the story Monday, identifying Grand Junction as the likely headquarters site.

The BLM administers 42 percent of the land in Utah, or 23 million acres, plus the minerals under 8 million acres of national forest. Nationally it oversees 245 million acres, nearly all of it in Western states, and many more acres of offshore oil and gas reserves. After 2½ years of the Trump administration, the BLM has yet to have a permanent director. Casey Hammond is the latest in a string of acting directors to head the agency.

Already the vast majority of the BLM’s 9,260 employees work in state headquarters and field offices, such as those in Salt Lake City, Vernal, Moab and Richfield.

Where Western politicians see greater efficiency and responsiveness in pushing even more BLM staff into the West, environmental activists see political theater and waste.

“This move is a solution in search of a problem,"" said Athan Manuel, director of public lands protection for Sierra Club. “Spending millions to relocate when there are existing regional offices, billions in park maintenance backlog on the books, and costs still rolling in from Trump’s Independence Day extravagance is just foolhardy.”

Like Gardner, Utah’s political leaders had viewed the BLM’s proposed move favorably, especially if the new headquarters wound up in Salt Lake City or Ogden.

“Moving the BLM [from Washington] to Utah will be far more than a symbolic gesture. It will actually generate better policy,” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said last year at a forum on Interior reorganization hosted by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah. “It will alleviate the anger and anxiety we have out here. It will change the nature of the discourses and relations the Intermountain West has with the rest of the country.”

A spokeswoman for Herbert declined comment until Interior makes an official announcement. The Interior Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Bishop on Monday praised Bernhardt’s “thoughtful, methodical approach,” calling it “a true win for the West.”

“I’m pleased that a significant number of personnel will be coming to Utah and other Western states,"" he said. ""The BLM personnel will be moved where they will have a greater impact on, and input by, the people who live in the regions where their influence is greatest. Not by bureaucrats from thousands of miles away.”

Critics, however, were quick to denounce BLM’s relocation.

Rep. Raul Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who heads the House Natural Resources Committee, linked the move to the Trump administration’s American energy dominance agenda, which he argues is geared more toward pandering to industry and cutting staff, rather than serving the public.

""Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s home town [of Rifle, Colo.] just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,"" he said in a prepared statement Monday. ""The BLM officials based in Washington are here to work directly with Congress and their federal colleagues, and that function is going to take a permanent hit if this move goes forward.""

Grijalva is also concerned that the BLM will lose many valued employees who might not want to leave Washington. “I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here,” he said.

Environmental activists also eye the move with skepticism.

“Bringing jobs to a Western community like Grand Junction is a laudable goal, but this announcement is nothing but a P.R. stunt,"" said Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.

“More than 90 percent of BLM staff already work outside of Washington, D.C., and the agency has dozens of offices across the West,” she said. “Moving senior BLM leadership would only turn the agency into an afterthought, rather than a core piece of the Interior Department.”"
Trump Fans the Flames of a Racial Fire,https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-race.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump woke up on Sunday morning, gazed out at the nation he leads, saw the dry kindling of race relations and decided to throw a match on it. It was not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last. He has a pretty large carton of matches and a ready supply of kerosene.

His Twitter harangue goading Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the country they came from, even though most of them were actually born in the United States, shocked many. But it should have surprised few who have watched the way he has governed a multicultural, multiracial country the last two and a half years.

When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century. While others who occupied the White House at times skirted close to or even over the line, finding ways to appeal to the resentments of white Americans with subtle and not-so-subtle appeals, none of them in modern times fanned the flames as overtly, relentlessly and even eagerly as Mr. Trump.

His attack on the Democratic congresswomen came on the same day his administration was threatening mass roundups of immigrants living in the country illegally. And it came just days after he hosted some of the most incendiary right-wing voices on the internet at the White House and vowed to find another way to count citizens separately from noncitizens despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked him from adding a question to the once-a-decade census."
Education Department ruling a win for cosmetology schools and students,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/education-department-ruling-a-win-for-cosmetology-schools-and-students,"The cosmetology industry is among the fastest growing sectors in our economy because millions of Americans have come to rely on experienced, licensed cosmetologists every day. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the industry is expected to grow nearly twice as fast as the national average, by over 13% in the next few years. In 2016 alone, it generated more than $84 billion in revenue, which has helped to support workers and communities across the country.

That record of success and continued growth has been at great risk because of the Obama-era “Gainful Employment” rule. This rule could have forced cosmetology school closures across the country. This would have created a ripple effect of unintended consequences for schools, students, spas, and salons, as well as millions of Americans who rely on skilled, licensed cosmetologists every day.

Fortunately, students, schools, and consumers achieved an important win recently when Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded the rule, based on its flawed construction and the inaccurate data that had been used to grade cosmetology programs.

Gainful Employment was first implemented to measure schools' success by comparing their students' debt to their presumed income after graduation. While seemingly well intentioned, the rule’s framework serves as a warning of what happens when rulemaking does not account for real-world situations.

When it came to the cosmetology industry, the rule failed to take into account a number of critical factors, including the underreporting of wages and tips. It’s well known that much like the restaurant industry, many transactions in the cosmetology industry are made in cash. As a result of underreported tips, the Gainful Employment scores of cosmetology schools were being significantly skewed.

Despite these known inaccuracies, the Education Department continued to use this metric with devastating consequences. If a school program failed, it faced ineligibility for federal aid. Students would no longer be able to use financial aid to pay for their education, ultimately forcing them to withdraw or pay out-of-pocket.

American Association of Cosmetology School members have always supported strengthening transparency in the higher education system and ensuring students can make the best choice possible for their own futures. But from day one, the association made clear that this rule was not only flawed but also had the potential to seriously damage and possibly close hundreds of reputable cosmetology schools. Even the IRS recognized how problematic the underreporting of wages and tips were on accurately measuring a school’s score.

When other efforts failed, the association filed a lawsuit against the Education Department and won. But it still left an uneven playing field across our educational institutions with an unfair advantage given to nonprofit schools.

That is because in reality, this rule did nothing more than target schools based on their tax status. According to Forbes, in 2016, only 16% of all students were actually enrolled in a program covered by the Gainful Employment rule. This means that roughly 80% of all college students were exempt from these standards. Moreover, cosmetology programs often take a year or less to complete and cost approximately $18,000, with average debt less than $10,000, significantly less than traditional four-year schools. In contrast, private, nonprofit schools average $35,000 per year.

All schools should be held to the highest standards, but those standards should be applied fairly across the board to create a level playing field.

As an industry, we believe that holding institutions of higher education to the highest standards, and ensuring students and parents have all the necessary information to make informed enrollment and borrowing choices is vital to the long-term success of both students and our schools. America’s cosmetology schools applaud Secretary DeVos and the Department of Education for ending this harmful regulation and protecting schools, students, and consumers.

Kathy Chow is the executive director of the American Association of Cosmetology Schools, representing over 600 cosmetology schools and nearly 300 school owners across the nation."
We need someone who can lift us up again. Enter President Obama.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Karen Tumulty', 'Columnist Covering National Politics', 'July At Pm', 'Karen Tumulty Is A Washington Post Columnist Covering National Politics.

An open letter to Barack Obama:

Mr. President, it is time. You must speak. Your country needs you.

Eleven summers ago, as you accepted the Democratic nomination for president, you announced: “Tonight, I say to the people of America, to Democrats and Republicans and independents across this great land: Enough. This moment — this election — is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.”

Of course, we knew then that our nation had deep political differences, and would continue to. Only the most naive among us would have expected the election of the first African American president to come about with no backlash.

But would anyone have anticipated that within a dozen years, we would hear another president tell four nonwhite congresswomen — three of whom were born in this country — to “go back” to where they came from?

Donald Trump’s tweets over the weekend were the basest kind of bigotry, the oldest of racist tropes. And they were a reminder that in the eyes of some, who apparently include our current president, people of color will never be seen as fully American, regardless of how many generations their families have been part of this nation’s story or how much they achieve as individuals.

President Obama, I understand your reluctance to weigh in on Trump’s latest transgression. You are a respecter of norms, including the one dictating that former presidents steer clear of criticizing their successors. And for all the barriers you shattered, racism was never a topic upon which you seemed eager to hold forth.

But silence now is unacceptable. It is time to make yourself heard.

We have long since given up expectations that anyone in Trump’s own party will do or say anything to call him out for what he is. The few who tried at the beginning have capitulated, been driven from office or walked away.

For Trump, racism is not a moral failing; it is a political tactic. None of us can really claim to understand what is in his heart, but the cynicism of his actions is apparent, and it must be exposed for what it is.

No one knows that better than you do. Trump launched his political career by spreading a blatantly racist lie that you had been born in Africa.

At the time, Americans could still be hopeful enough about who we were to write him off as a buffoon. You even joked about it. As Trump sat fuming in the audience at the 2011 White House correspondents’ dinner, you released what you said was your “official birth video.” It was a clip from “The Lion King.”

But he was just getting started. Birtherism turned out to be Trump’s original sin, the one from which so many others have followed — the 2015 presidential announcement speech in which Trump branded Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and rapists, his call for a ban on Muslims entering the country, his claim that a judge of Mexican descent born in Indiana was incapable of ruling fairly on a case involving Trump University, his declaration that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the deadly clashes between hate-fueled white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville.

There was a political calculation behind every one of those vile statements, and as repulsed as we are with his latest racist rant, it is possible to see the calculation that is at work here as well.

Trump knows Democrats will set aside their internal differences, as they should, to rally around the four, who represent their party’s more liberal, more youthful edge. He intends to make Reps. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) the faces of the Democratic Party, as he wants America to see it.

“These are people that if they don’t like it here, they can leave,” he said Monday. “They hate our country. They hate it, I think, with a passion.”

The irony was rich, given how incessantly Trump himself criticized this country before he was elected, and how even his campaign slogan — “Make America Great Again” — denigrated both the nation and the progress it has made.

President Obama, what we need more than anything else right now is someone who can lift the country’s sights again. Someone who can charge us, as you once did, with a mission to “march into the future. Let us keep that promise, that American promise, and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.”

Find your voice again. Reclaim your legacy. Do it now. It won’t wait until your memoirs."
Dogs deserve better than brutal VA research that wastes money better spent on veterans,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Dina Titus', 'Brian Mast', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/16/veterans-affairs-dog-testing-brutal-shameful-must-stop-column/1733380001/,"CLOSE

The VA has done these barbaric tests for decades with no discernible benefits in many years. It should stop hurting dogs and start helping veterans.

Few members of the public are aware that the federal government uses taxpayer money to hurt puppies in painful and unnecessary lab experiments.

At the Richmond Veterans Affairs Hospital, where most of the VA’s dog testing takes place, puppies are given heart attacks by injecting latex into their arteries. The dogs are then put on treadmills to stress their compromised hearts, and they are ultimately killed and dissected.

These and other cruel practices must end.

We’ve been leading the charge against this government-funded animal abuse. Our efforts have focused on the Department of Veterans Affairs, where hounds and beagles are subjected to deadly experiments. Though the department has conducted these barbaric tests for decades, the research has not resulted in any discernible benefits for veterans in many years.

VA experiments stopped in many cities

The good news is that we’re making significant progress to end the VA’s canine cruelty. Today there are just a few ongoing dog experiments thanks to pressure from grassroots advocates, sharp media scrutiny and congressional action. In Los Angeles, the VA has stopped injecting Dobermans with methamphetamines; in Milwaukee, the VA has put an end to several painful and invasive experiments on beagles. And in Cleveland, the VA just stopped severing the spinal cords of puppies in deadly tests.

A dog's nose and a single step: On K9 Veterans Day, honor heroic military working dogs for saving soldiers' lives

Now there’s momentum to completely end this antiquated program once and for all. At our urging, the House has passed legislation this year that cuts all funding for painful dog experiments, and our bipartisan bill to permanently end VA dog testing — the Preventing Unkind and Painful Procedures and Experiments on Respected Species (PUPPERS) Act — now has over 100 co-sponsors, including 17 veterans.

Eliminating dog testing within reach

We’re optimistic because there is growing recognition that VA’s dog testing is outdated and unnecessary:

► Earlier this year, due to pressure from Congress and advocates, the VA committed $2 million to develop alternatives to its disgraceful heart attack tests on dogs.

► In May, a spinal cord injury researcher from the University of Miami told a VA-commissioned panel that dog use for spinal cord research like the tests that were being done in Cleveland is unnecessary and that alternatives are readily available.

► Former VA Secretary Dr. David Shulkin was instrumental in many of the pro-puppy reforms we’ve seen in recent years.

And while the VA absurdly drags its feet on ending this outdated program, the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control are moving away from dog experiments.

Help veterans, don't hurt dogs

We know all too well that veterans desperately need the resources that are currently wasted on unnecessary and cruel dog testing. The brave service members who have selflessly served this nation deserve better. That’s why our movement to end these experiments has the support of many national veterans’ groups that want to end this waste and abuse.

I knew too much about war, he knew blessedly little: Afghanistan veteran on the dog that is his best friend

Most importantly, our dogs — who are cherished pets, faithful partners to patriots serving abroad, and sources of comfort and healing to those who have returned home — deserve much better. Putting an end to the VA’s brutal dog experiments would be a win for veterans, taxpayer, and the dogs that are troops’ best friend. We intend to do exactly that, once and for all.

Lindsey Graham promises his own 'deep dive' after DOJ inspector general report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-promises-his-own-deep-dive-after-doj-inspector-general-report,"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham promised that he will launch his own “deep dive” inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after the conclusion of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

“I promise your listeners, after Horowitz issues his report about the flawed FISA warrant, I’m going to deep-dive into how this stuff started,” the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman said while appearing on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News this morning. “How could it go so far if there was no collusion?”

Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded that although the Russians did interfere in the 2016 presidential election, he could not establish any criminal collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. He will be testifying in front of Congress on July 24.

Graham, speaking with Maria Bartiromo, said that the probe by the Justice Department and FBI into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia that began under President Obama was a “politicized investigation.” Citing what he said is a clear double standard, Graham contrasted the Justice Department's ""kid-gloves"" investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of an illicit private server with their all-out investigation of Trump-Russia collusion.

Graham said that he wanted to “explain to the public how the system works,” as he compared the Clinton investigation to the Trump investigation.

“When Hilary Clinton was investigated, people for her literally took material and beat it up with a hammer. They destroyed evidence and no one was prosecuted. No one was flipped. Nobody was prosecuted for minor offenses to get them to talk against Clinton,” Graham said. “Everything they did to break the Trump world, they treated Clinton with kid gloves. They hated Trump. They wanted Clinton to win. This was a politicized investigation. It should scare every American.”

And Graham pointed specifically to the FISA warrants obtained against Trump campaign associate Carter Page beginning in October 2016, which relied heavily upon “a dossier prepared by a foreign agent that's a bunch of garbage.” Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy who compiled the salacious and unverified dossier while working for Fusion GPS which had been hired by the Clinton campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm, has spoken with the Justice Department inspector general in recent weeks.

“I’m going to get to the bottom of it and explain how one campaign was treated differently than the other to make sure it never happens again,” Graham promised.





In addition to Horowitz’s investigation, President Trump provided Attorney General William Barr with broad declassification authority to get answers on the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, and Barr in turn selected U.S. Attorney John Durham to serve as his point man in that effort.

Bartiromo asked whether Graham believed that “any of these people who actually put their finger on the scale in their powerful positions and tried to stop Donald Trump” might face criminal charges, pointing specifically to former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, and former CIA Director John Brennan.

Graham said that he trusted Durham and Horowitz to look at these issues closely, and said that his job is “to make sure we fix the system that no other president has to go through what Donald Trump went through.”

“But yes, I think there are plenty of people involved in the 2016 election, the way they investigated the Trump campaign, the FISA warrant application, where they have criminal liability, but we will leave that up to Mr. Durham,” Graham said. “But I promise you, we’re going to look at the other side. Mueller was the final word for me on all things Trump and Russia. The other side — now it's their turn to be looked at.”

Graham also said that the ongoing efforts by Democratic House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and others were not about getting to the truth, but rather that “they are trying to set up a case for impeachment against President Trump.

“If they bring impeachment charges based on the Mueller report, it would be unfair, it would blow up in their face politically, President Trump would get reelected, and we would take back the House and the Senate, because Mueller said there was no collusion,” Graham opined. “The facts in the law did not justify bringing an obstruction case. There was no underlying crime. This is all politically motivated. Does anybody really think Jerry Nadler's trying to get to the truth or that he will do a better job than Mueller?”"
The Energy 202: Watchdog says EPA didn't follow its own rules when picking science advisers,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'July At Am']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/07/16/the-energy-202-watchdog-says-epa-didn-t-follow-its-own-rules-when-picking-science-advisers/5d2cb871a7a0a45423a3ec0a/,"THE LIGHTBULB

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)

A government watchdog said Monday the Environmental Protection Agency did not follow its own guidelines when filling two key science advisory panels with fewer academic researchers and more industry voices.

The findings from the Government Accountability Office, published Monday at the request of several Senate Democrats, provide additional fodder for critics who say President Trump's deputies are trying to degrade the way EPA assesses scientific research. Both panels are part of the EPA and made up of scientists from outside the agency who advise it on the best science surrounding issues like air pollution, pesticides and hazardous waste.

The agency itself disputes the watchdog's findings, arguing in a letter submitted to the GAO that its way of choosing new panelists for the Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee is “more rigorous” than under the EPA's old guidelines.

The GAO described a sharp decrease in the number of university researchers serving on the Science Advisory Board, which reviews the integrity of scientific information used by the EPA when writing rules, over the first 15 months of the Trump administration. The number of university researchers on the panel went from 36 in January 2017 to just 22 in March 2018. The panel had between 44 and 47 members during that period.

The decrease came as the number of researchers from consulting firms or from companies regulated by the agency went up, a fact that Democrats latched onto as more evidence the Trump adminisitration is overly influenced by polluting industries.

“After a careful investigation, the non-partisan GAO confirms what we’ve been critical of all along: The Trump Administration is violating its own rules by putting industry officials in charge of crucially important science advisory boards,” said Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee who with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) led a group of Democrats in asking the GAO to investigate the agency's practices. “This is not a trivial issue, but a serious problem that has profound consequences for enforcement and regulatory actions across the agency.”

Among those who under Trump joined the Science Advisory Board are Brant Ulsh, a health physicist at M.H. Chew & Associates who has argued the EPA has overplayed the risk of small doses of radiation; and John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville whose work critical of NASA's climate scientists has been often cited by so-called climate “skeptics.”

The watchdog agency found fewer ""notable"" changes to the composition of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.

That decrease in academics on the Science Advisory Board is due largely to a Trump administration policy barring scientists who get EPA grants from serving as advisers, according to Genna Reed, a science and policy analyst in the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“It's a pretty clear connection to draw,” she said. The ban, put in place by former EPA chief Scott Pruitt, drew praise from industry lobbying groups and condemnation from scientific organizations such as Reed's when it was announced in 2017.

According to the GAO, in the past agency staffers weighed in with written recommendations on who should be selected for these two boards. That part of the selection process was spelled out in one of the EPA's own handbooks.

But in the Trump administration, officials ignored those internal guidelines and chose advisers without much of a paper trail. Instead of written recommendations, EPA management instead requested briefings with staffers.

“That was our key finding: The EPA didn't follow this key step with these two committees,” said J. Alfredo Gomez, director of the GAO's natural resources and environment team.

In the past, EPA head Andrew Wheeler cast the panel appointments as an effort to gather scientific opinions from a diverse set of voices. But when selecting researchers for the Science Advisory Board, there is one region of the country the Trump administration seems to turn to frequently: the South.

At the start of the administration, about a quarter, or 28 percent, of the panel hailed from the generally conservative region, which spanned Delaware to Texas in the GAO's analysis. About 15 months later, Southerners constituted more than half of the board.

One of the newcomers is Michael Honeycutt, the top toxicologist in the state of Texas who in 2017 was chosen to chair the Science Advisory Board and who has accused the agency of “overstating” the risks associated with mercury, a toxic heavy metal that can cause brain damage.

In a letter commenting on a draft of the GAO report, the EPA urged the watchdog to delete from the final version the conclusion that EPA ignored its own rules when selecting members of the panels because it is within Wheeler's authority to set new guidance.

“EPA has already provided GAO its thorough explanation on their conclusion that the Agency did not follow its own policy — the assertion is incorrect and should be removed from the report,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud wrote in an email Monday.

The GAO acknowledged Wheeler had that discretion, but ultimately recommended that the EPA follow the handbook's guidelines.

— Another agency is moving staff out of Washington: The Interior Department is planning to yank most of the Bureau of Land Management’s Washington-based employees out of the District and move them out West. Some top employees are set to be transferred to Grand Junction, Colo., and others will move to other cities, The Post’s Juliet Eilperin and Lisa Rein report.

The context: “The proposal to move roughly 300 employees from a key Interior Department agency — among them the majority of top managers — comes as Trump officials are forcibly reassigning career officials and upending operations across the federal government,” they write. “Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue finalized plans this summer to move about 550 jobs at two of his department’s scientific agencies from the nation’s capital to greater Kansas City. The White House is trying to abolish the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, and has threatened to furlough as many as 150 employees if Congress blocks it.""

Two sides to the argument: In a statement supporting the move, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said the “problem with Washington is too many policy makers are far removed from the people they are there to serve... Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is West of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters,” he added. Meanwhile, Steve Ellis, who retired as BLM’s deputy director in 2016 told Rein and Eilperin: “If I wanted to dismantle an agency, this would be in my playbook … It’s important for these agencies to have a meaningful footprint in D.C.”

Under the plan (I got additional details last night), Utah will get several dozen jobs, as will Nevada and Colorado. More than 80 percent of headquarters jobs will move West. https://t.co/rddUkHXdTY — Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) July 16, 2019

THERMOMETER

— Tracking the deluge from Barry: There were rainfall totals reaching 15 inches in parts of Louisiana on Monday, as the impact of tropical depression Barry poured down on the state, though later than anticipated, The Post's Jason Samenow reports. “Since late last week, forecasters said Barry would be a drawn-out event, with heavy rain a threat lasting two to three days. But the worst was expected over the weekend, when meteorologists predicted tremendous amounts of rain in Louisiana. Rivers were forecast to surge to historic heights,” he writes.

Still, more rain is yet to come: “Dangerous, significant flash flooding is likely, especially across south-central Louisiana,” the National Weather Service wrote in a statement. Samenow adds the agency is predicting “five to eight inches more of rain in this area through the afternoon and rainfall rates as high as two to four inches per hour.”

— This climate scientist is also an evangelical Christian, and she’s trying to persuade skeptics: Katharine Hayhoe, a leading climate scientist, has found a way to talk to people about science by talking to them about faith, The Post’s Dan Zak writes in this profile of the Texas Tech University researcher. During a keynote address at the Citizens’ Climate Lobby conference in Washington, Hayhoe — who is also a lead author on the U.S. government’s latest National Climate Assessment — displayed an ability to communicate that seems “miraculous by the standards of modern climate politics: She can convert nonbelievers — or, to put it in her terms, make people realize that they’ve believed in the importance of this issue all along,” Zak writes. “She knows how to speak to oilmen, to Christians, to farmers and ranchers, having lived for years in Lubbock, Tex., with her pastor husband. She is a scientist who thinks that we’ve talked enough about science, that we need to talk more about matters of the heart.” “We humans have been given responsibility for every living thing on this planet, which includes each other,” she said at the conference. “We are called to tend the garden and be good stewards of the gifts that God has given us.”

— How extreme heat is changing sports: Scientists say the hottest places on the planet are getting hotter, faster. Las Vegas, for example, the location of an annual race called Running with the Devil, is the “fastest-warming city in the country and has seen an average temperature increase of nearly 6 degrees since 1970,” The Post’s Rick Maese reports in the latest piece in a series on how climate change is affecting the world of sports. “The Running with the Devil race, intentionally scheduled for extreme conditions, might not be an exact peek into the future, but it does highlight many of the challenges already confronting much of the sports world. How does heat affect performance? What dangers lurk on the outdoor courses and fields exposed to the summer sun? How does one stage a safe event in extreme conditions?”

— Man, it’s a hot one: Last month was the Earth’s hottest June on record, 1.7 degrees above the norm for the global average temperature for the month, according to data from NASA. “The month was punctuated by a severe heat wave that struck Western Europe in particular during the last week, with numerous all-time-hottest-temperature records falling in countries with centuries-old data sets,” The Post’s Jason Samenow and Andrew Freedman report. “NASA is the second institution to confirm that it was Earth’s hottest June, as the Copernicus Climate Change Service had already determined that June 2019 was the warmest such month on record for Europe and globally.”

— No word on what caused New York City’s blackout: Con Edison warned the city could see more power outages this summer after a weekend power failure left 73,000 residents in the dark. “We expect that there could be service outages — those things happen during heat waves,” the power company’s chief spokesman, Mike Clendenin, said in an interview with PIX 11, according to the New York Post. He also said there’s still no explanation for what caused the blackout. “We are very, very focused on examining exactly what transpired and caused that outage,” Clendenin said. ““There’s a lot of patience and poise that New Yorkers displayed during the outage itself. The same kind of patience and diligence is going to be needed as engineers and experts dive into the date and actually analyze how equipment tripped off, or what went wrong, that led to the large outage.”

Meanwhile, in Washington: ""Power was cut off Monday night to as many as 7,000 homes and businesses in the District, many of them in Northeast, near Capitol Hill according to Pepco,"" The Post's Martin Weil reports. ""The utility said it had issues with equipment at a substation in Northeast.""

Barack Obama Statue Added to South Dakota's 'City of Presidents' — and Daughter Sasha Is with Him,https://people.com,['Dave Quinn'],,,,https://people.com/politics/barack-obama-sasha-statue-south-dakota-city-of-presidents/,"A sweet moment of former President Barack Obama holding the hand of his daughter Sasha and waving at onlookers has been memorialized in a sculpture as part of Rapid City, South Dakota’s long-running “City of Presidents” project.

Since 2000, the western South Dakota city has been populating its streets and sidewalks with life-size bronze statues of the nation’s past commanders-in-chief — an art instillation meant to honor the legacy of the American presidency.

So far 43 former president have been added to the project, from the country’s first, George Washington, on to Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and, now, Obama.

Rapid City offers a “City of Presidents” map and interactive walking guide for the project. The pattern of placement for the presidents was chosen “to maintain a coherent structure and eliminate any sense of favoritism or political gain,” the city notes.

Each sculpture is privately funded and depicts the president in a pose specific to his personality.

Obama’s statute, which was unveiled on Saturday, was created by sculptor James Van Nuys over a two-year period.

According to CNN, Meyers was originally going to sculpt Obama, 57, standing and waving when his collaborators suggested he try something different.

“One of us said, ‘This is boring. This is not going to have the wow factor,’ ” Dallerie Davis, the group’s co-founder, told CNN. “A man waving is not a showstopper.”

The final sculpture was inspired by a photo of Obama and Sasha walking on a stage at Chicago’s Grant Park, after Obama was first elected president, Van Nuys told CNN.

Rapid City has yet to unveil the placement of the Obama statue but said on its website it will be placed by the end of the summer."

Scientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453193-scientists-flee-usda-as-research-agencies-move-to-kansas-city-area,"A Trump administration decision to move researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the Kansas City area is threatening to spark the flight of more than half of the staff selected to move, gutting the agency of its top scientific voices.

Staff have until midnight Monday to decide whether to uproot and join the department as it moves its research branches from Washington, D.C., lured by $26 million in promised incentives from state and local officials.

Critics see the move, set to be completed by Sept. 30, as yet another example of the Trump administration looking to sideline scientists and researchers, keeping them away from the corridors of power. Administration officials deny that, calling it a cost-saving move intended to have researchers closer to farmers.

The decision comes as other agencies are also planning to relocate parts of their teams amid suspicions about the move. For example, the Interior Department is expected to announce new headquarters for the Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

The move affects two wings of the USDA. Economic Research Service (ERS) employees analyze the agricultural market, but their research is much broader, including looking at food stamps, rural poverty and conservation.

National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) employees work with universities to fund research and coordinate the process that issues research grants on agriculture-related subjects, including climate change adaptation.

The two agencies voted to unionize in response to the move, as Democrats in both chambers and a number of groups that regularly work with the two agencies lobby to keep them in Washington.

Estimates tallied by employees show 70 percent of ERS employees designated for the Kansas City office will not be moving. For NIFA, 45 percent of those surveyed said they will not move. Overall, the move was expected to impact 547 staff between the two agencies.

But the numbers of staff refusing to move may grow. Some employees said staff at both agencies are trying not to tip their hands, saying they will move only if they do not find another job in the D.C. area.

So far, just 27 ERS staff out of 250 have committed to moving to the Kansas City area, according to the employee tallies.

The UDSA argues the move will save $300 million over 15 years, but critics have said their cost-benefit analysis was shoddy and did not follow guidelines.

A different cost-benefit analysis from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association found the move would cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million.

Democrats have blocked USDA funding from supporting the move and asked the agency to turn over information about its decisionmaking process, and they have sponsored legislation to keep the two agencies in Washington.

“I am appalled with the Trump administration’s decision to force hundreds of Washington-based USDA research staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods,” Rep. Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeScientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area Federal employees turn their backs on Agriculture secretary after relocation plans announced Congress should make Interior's Bernhardt 'manage the land to stop climate change' MORE (D-Maine), who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement when the move was announced.

“Many of these staffers believe their relocation is an effort to silence their research into topics that do not align with the Trump administration’s political agenda, including the study of climate change and benefits of low-income food assistance,” she added.

Employees had a list of complaints about a move they have likened to Amazon’s search for a second headquarters, as the USDA examined bids from 139 cities.

That process was put on pause during the government shutdown, but on June 16 employees were told they had a month to decide whether they’d like to move to the Kansas City area or leave the agency.

Employees would then have two months to move to Kansas City — they must be there by the end of the fiscal year — but school in the area is slated to start Aug. 12, putting added pressure on those with families to quickly make a move.

Employees say they are getting conflicting information about how much of their moving costs will be covered by the government. Other key details about the move are also unknown so far, according to the employees.

The USDA said it was working to make the move as smooth as possible but did not respond to several specific questions about the move from The Hill.

“USDA has determinedly worked to ensure employees have the resources they need to make informed decisions about their employment and to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible,” the agency said in a statement.

Employees say morale is at an all-time low and they worry about the future of an agency that is already hemorrhaging staff and having trouble completing its work.

“Honestly, I’m not sure how we’re going to bounce back or if we will,” said Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist with ERS who is now a union steward. “This agency is the product of like 50 years of institutional knowledge and gathering up researchers who are very specialized in their fields.”

Employees also say there are contradictions between what the USDA says it hopes to achieve with the move and how it would actually impact the department.

“It was sort of get fired or go,” said Ariela Zycherman, a national program leader with NIFA who is still weighing a move to Kansas City.

“People keep saying, ‘Those East Coasters don’t want to come to Kansas or Missouri.’ The fact of matter is that’s not really the issue,” she said. “Many of us would move to Kansas City, but there are questions about future of agency and its effectiveness and questions about the way this was hastily rolled out and whether it will have long-term effects on our families’ well-being.”

The USDA has argued the move will allow employees to be closer to farmers — something employees say shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what they do.

“I think the biggest misconception around this is, we don’t serve individual farmers,” Dodson said. “Our stakeholders are primarily Congress and program leads and agencies and nonprofits in D.C. or people that come to meet with multiple entities in D.C.""

“I think our presence will be very much diminished. I think we’ll be quite literally out of sight and out of mind,” Dodson added.

The bipartisan Kansas and Missouri delegation pushed hard to bring the offices to the Kansas City area, calling it a hub for research and a talented workforce and touting the lower cost compared to Washington, D.C.

But employees say the hectic way the move has been handled has soured many about the USDA.

“I’ve never experienced morale like this in any job,” said Wesley Dean, a national program leader in sociology for NIFA. “My colleagues are deeply committed to the mission of the agency and see their positions as an opportunity to both shape the future of their scientific disciplines and to serve the American people.

“These highly motivated civil servants feel as if their expertise and dedication to the agency and the public has been undermined and dismissed by the department,” Dean added."
Opinion | All Presidents Are Deporters in Chief,https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/opinion/sunday/trump-deportations-immigration.html,"Here’s how a recent Times report described an immigrant detention facility in Clint, Tex. , that was built during the Obama administration but overfilled under Mr. Trump: “Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.”

This week , Mr. Trump announced a new series of raids by ICE in at least 10 cities, aiming to arrest thousands of people who have been issued deportation orders.

“We’re focused on criminals,” Mr. Trump sai d on Friday, dodging the truth that his administration’s hard-line policies make little to no distinction between people who pose a genuine risk and those who miss an immigration court date.

The administration, for instance, publicly warned of collateral arrests as part of the new raids, threatening to detain other unauthorized immigrants who happen to be on the scene (children or other relatives, perhaps), even if they are not the main targets of the raids.

Publicity over the raids has rattled immigrant communities, as the administration clearly intended. For Mr. Trump, deterrence of illegal immigration has been a guiding principle — if not by means of a wall, then by means of cruelty toward migrants, from the squalid conditions in detainee facilities to separating children from their parents.

“It’s the complete, 100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx, with a disregard for managing what’s happening,” a Department of Homeland Security official told The Times earlier this year. “We have a lot more families, a lot more unaccompanied children, and the focus has just been on how can we deter, rather than how can we handle.”

But deterrence alone can’t explain a slew of other moves — scaling back a program that protects the families of members of the military and veterans from being deported, for instance. It doesn’t explain the frantic — yet unsuccessful — effort to put a question about citizenship on the census, which experts agree would lead to an undercount of people in immigrant-heavy communities. Nor does deterrence explain removing deportation protections from nearly one million people who live in the country under the auspices of humanitarian programs or because they were brought to the country as children."
Communities no longer able to appeal pollution permits under forthcoming EPA rule: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453164-communities-no-longer-able-to-appeal-pollution-permits-under,"Changing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations could soon strip individuals and communities of the ability to challenge granted pollution permits while continuing to allow industry to appeal denials, The New York Times reported.

The rule the EPA is preparing to weaken would no longer allow community voices across the country to challenge decisions on how much pollution is legally allowed to be released at nearby power plants, according to the report.

Three people familiar with the draft plan, which has not yet been released, told the Times that industry stakeholders would still be allowed to appeal the EPA’s decisions to the Environmental Appeals Board.

The EPA did not confirm or deny the existence of the forthcoming rulemaking.

“EPA is always interested in improving its processes while maintaining environmental protection. Contrary to the speculation by certain parties, EPA is working to protect the public interest and transparently carry out its work,” an EPA spokesman said in a statement.

News of the rule change, first announced by the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility on Friday, came the same week President Trump Donald John TrumpEsper sidesteps question on whether he aligns more with Mattis or Trump Warren embraces Thiel label: 'Good' As tensions escalate, US must intensify pressure on Iran and the IAEA MORE held his environmental leadership speech at the White House. Trump preached the role his administration has played in bringing top-notch water and air protections to the U.S.

“What E.P.A. is proposing means communities and families no longer have the right to appeal a pollution permit that might affect them,” Patrice Simms, a former staff lawyer for the Environmental Appeals Board, told the Times.

Critics of the rule change say the appeals option offered communities a forum to push back on the EPA’s decisions without piling on legal fees and mounting lengthy legal cases.

Supporters of the change say it would eliminate red tape and speed up a process that ends up being decided by the courts anyway.

The rule proposal could be made public as soon as this week, according to the Times."
"Devin Nunes: Without jail time for Russia probe 'dirty cops', no Republican will trust DOJ for ‘generations'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-jail-dirty-cops-republicans-doj,"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said there will be massive political consequences if Justice Department officials don't face jail time for their conduct during the Russia investigation.

According to Nunes, the Russia investigation was an ""obstruction of justice trap,"" that started without evidence of collusion and ended in an ""awful situation"" that could only be fixed by jailing the people who ""perpetuated this hoax.""

""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" he told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on the latest ""Hemmer Time"" podcast. ""We're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

Nunes specifically mentioned Andrew Weissman, one of the Mueller team's top prosecutors who briefed AP reporters in 2017, before Mueller's team was assembled, on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation.""

Authorities, Nunes said, hid that fact from his committee -- something he said was inappropriate given that Weissman was briefed on the Steele dossier in the summer of 2016.

At Mueller's hearing, Nunes plans to ask him whether he knew that Weissmann had been briefed on the dossier. Weissmann's early involvement with the chain of custody, according to legal advice Nunes received, effectively disqualified him from serving on Mueller's team.

Nunes' comments came before former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was scheduled to testify on July 17 before the House Judiciary Committee -- a hearing Nunes suspected Democrats hoped would include ""nasty"" comments making President Trump ""look bad.""

That date, according to sources, could have been pushed back to July 24, although committee Democrats have maintained the hearing would take place on July 17.

While the committee's chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., joined other Democrats in continuing to pursue the Mueller report's findings, Republicans have attempted to refocus the debate on accountability for what Nunes described as ""dirty cops.""

REP. NUNES ON CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S GRILLING BY DOJ INVESTIGATORS: A LOT OF THE DOSSIER 'WAS JUST MADE UP'

Barr already started the investigation and Nunes, in April, sent a criminal referral notification telling the Justice Department in April that he had identified ""potential violations"" of the law. Those criminal referrals stemmed from the Intelligence Committee's investigation when Nunes was chair and Republicans held the House.

Nunes told Fox News host Bill Hemmer that he thought it was possible that the Russia investigation was a way for the House to develop an impeachment strategy. He accused DOJ officials of trying to drag out the investigation in order to find legal violations.

""They were trying to hold out this investigation as long as possible, bust people here and there for nickel and dime stuff -- like obstructing an investigation, lying to Congress -- and eventually they would get Trump,"" he said.

What the USDA Label Really Says,https://www.goodhousekeeping.com,"['Jaclyn London', 'Ms', 'Rd', 'Cdn', 'Good Housekeeping Institute', 'Director', 'Nutrition Lab', 'A Registered Dietitian With A Bachelor Of Arts Degree Northwestern University', 'A Master Of Science Degree In Clinical Nutrition New York University', 'Jaclyn']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a28224713/what-does-organic-mean/,"You see the word ""organic"" thrown around everywhere these days — whether it's on food, clothing, beauty products, and more. But what does it actually mean to call something organic? The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Organic Standards Board defines the term as this:

""Organic"" is a labeling term that denotes products produced under the authority of the Organic Foods Production Act. The principal guidelines for organic production are to use materials and practices that enhance the ecological balance of natural systems and that integrate the parts of the farming system into an ecological whole.

Okay ... So what does that definition actually mean for you? Here's what you really need to know about buying and eating organic food.

What exactly does organic mean?

To label a food as organic, it must meet the guidelines set by the USDA. These include:

Not using prohibited substances (most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) for three years prior to harvest

Not using genetically modified organisms (GMOs)

Raising animals in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (like grazing on pasture), feeding them 100% organic food, and not administering antibiotics or hormones

Omitting artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors from multi-ingredient, processed foods with some exceptions, like baking soda in baked goods

Organic agricultural production still uses pesticides and herbicides that USDA's organic certification standards have okayed. Just because something is labeled ""organic"" does not mean that no pesticides or herbicides were used. It simply means that the ones applied met the USDA's production standards for the term.

The definition of organic also limits the use of ""genetically modified organisms."" GMO crops have been genetically altered to withstand the application of herbicides and pesticides — chemicals that protect harvests from viruses and bugs. The introduction of GMOs into the food supply sparked a debate over their health and environmental implications. Anything bearing the USDA Organic Seal is automatically non-GMO.

What does organic food mean?

USDA

Contrary to popular belief, organic food relates back to agricultural production, not a specific nutrition- or health-related guideline. For a product to carry the USDA organic label, a third party must verify at least 95% of the ingredients as organic. The phrase ""made with organic ingredients"" means at least 70% of the ingredients used counted as organic.

Foods can still be organic even if they're not labeled as such. Since the standard requires third-party verification, there's a cost associated with the certification process. Food companies must consistently provide back-up documentation in order to use the ""USDA Organic"" seal. That makes it less desirable to smaller or newer brands that use organic production practices, but don't want to incur the costs of verification.



Is organic food really better?

Despite controversial headlines about this labeling claim, the agricultural practice used to produce food does not determine how nutritious it is for you, nor does it directly impact your state of health. Case in point: Organic cane sugar is still sugar. The nutrients you'll find within the food are what, over time, predominantly affect your health — not the growing methods used to make it. Also, organic products will cost more than their non-organic counterparts, which is a critical consideration for most of us on a budget.

There's also the question of whether or not genetically modifying crops are harmful to health. But to date, there's no substantial data to imply that GMO crops available on the consumer market pose a direct risk.



Tonic Photo Studios Getty Images

Does organic mean healthy?

Short answer? No. Growing methods do not universally make foods better or worse for you nutritionally. This is especially true when you consider eating a balanced diet overall. For example, USDA Organic beef is grass-fed, which implies that you'll find slightly more omega-3 fatty acids in it compared to conventionally raised cattle. But if you're also regularly consuming seafood, then you're already getting the omega-3's you need.

When you see alarmist headline about a specific pesticide used in conventional agriculture, it's almost always talking about exposure through proximity (i.e., field work), not ingesting the foods we eat. Some population studies show a correlation between buying organic food and better health, but it's important to consider the other factors that buying organic implies, including lifestyle and socioeconomic status. Since there's no specific, isolated link between the two, we simply cannot use the term ""organic"" to imply ""healthy"" — despite the fact that it's often marketed as such.

As for GMOs and your health? The most recent and comprehensive National Academy of Sciences report states that although genetically modified crops may vary in nutritional composition, the variation is no more than what would occur naturally among non-GMO crops. The report also analyzed data from large-scale studies since GMOs entered the food supply in the '90s, but did not find any associations with chronic disease incidence and dietary patterns.

The biggest issue with GMOs from a nutritional standpoint is the products in which they’re usually found: highly processed foods and beverages. The most predominant GMO crops — corn and soybeans — can go in packaged foods loaded with added sugar (e.g., sugary beverages made with corn syrup) and saturated fat.



Is anything really organic?

In food, yes. That's because the USDA requires companies to follow certain agricultural practices before getting verified. But in other types of products, that's not necessarily the case.

The Bottom Line: While we still don't know everything about GMOs and organic growing practices, there is one thing about this debate I can say with confidence: It's more important to know exactly what foods are wholesome, nutritious, and health-promoting overall rather than focusing on a specific label claim."

While a Change.org petition, calling for #JusticeforRocky, has gathered over 400,000 signatures within its first day, NY congressman Adriano Espaillat is working hard to help bring A$AP Rocky home.

Additionally, on Wednesday (July 10), the U.S. Rep. for NY’s Thirteenth Congressional District sent multiple letters to the U.S. State Department, U.S. Embassy in Sweden and the Swedish Ambassador in Washington, noting Rocky’s innocence and urging for justice.

Espaillat explains, “He’s part of a growing, young movement of artists that, first of all, I commend because they identify with the neighborhood where they live, which in this case is Harlem. Harlem is a neighborhood that is very special because Harlem is not just about the Apollo or 125th Street. It’s really about an attitude and a personality and a history and a legacy. And so, for him to be a young person and continue to identify with Harlem, and be a strong presence of the artist community in Harlem, is great. That’s why I’m going to bat for him.”

"Trump DOJ summit focuses on rise in anti-Semitic attacks, racial hatred",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Alex Swoyer']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/15/trump-doj-summit-focuses-rise-anti-semitic-attacks/,"President Trump’s Justice Department is aiming to cut down on anti-Semitic discrimination, hosting a summit in Washington, D.C., Monday to draw attention to the uptick in attacks against the Jewish community, with the attorney general calling racial hatred a cancer on society.

Attorney General William P. Barr said that although the anti-Semitic shootings at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last year and the shooting in April at Chabad of Poway in California made national news, other acts of discrimination against Jews have gone largely unreported.

He said his agency has seen a spike in violence against Orthodox Jews in New York City within the Crown Heights neighborhood. He also noted a Jewish cemetery in Massachusetts that had been vandalized, as well as college students who support Israel being attacked on campuses.

“I want to assure the Jewish community that the Department of Justice and the entire federal government stands with you and will not tolerate these attacks,” Mr. Barr said at the Justice Department’s Summit on Combatting Anti-Semitism.

According to the FBI, anti-Jewish hate crimes account for more than half of the hate crimes nationally each year. Jews have also faced discrimination against their businesses and through zoning laws in some areas across the country, the attorney general said.

“Today is about far more than criminal prosecutions. We need to combat anti-Semitism on all fronts as a government, but also as a society,” Mr. Barr said.

Monday’s summit at the Justice Department was the first to combat anti-Semitism since Mr. Trump came into office.

Other members of the president’s cabinet also spoke at the event. FBI Director Christopher Wray noted in March his agency probed 287 threatening phone calls, emails and bomb threats to Jewish Centers and the Anti-Defamation League.

Steven Mnuchin, the president’s Treasury Secretary, said he is proud his agency has used sanctions to disrupt funding and isolate human rights violations, while Secretary of the Department of Education Betsy DeVos said the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement is plaguing college campuses.

The BDS movement focuses on a boycott of Israel, with a special focus on economic interests.

“These campus bullies claim they sand for human rights, but we all know BDS stands for anti-Semitism,” Ms. DeVos said.

Inside Trump’s Border Wars,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jason Zengerle'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/magazine/immigration-department-of-homeland-security.html,"But it was also a remarkable opportunity. After all, Nielsen had a much thinner résumé than her predecessors at the job: former governors, judges and upper-echelon government lawyers. James Nealon, who worked with Nielsen as the department’s assistant secretary for international engagement, describes her as “a super staffer.” But it’s a general rule of Washington that staff members, even super staffers, don’t become cabinet officers — much less when they’re still in their 40s.

Not long after Nielsen was sworn in as homeland security secretary in December 2017, according to a current and a former administration official, McAleenan alerted her to a rise in illegal border crossings. If the trend continued, he warned, by the spring — when border crossings typically peak — the immigration system would most likely be so overwhelmed that the department would no longer be able to process, much less interdict, new arrivals. Together with Thomas Homan, then the acting director of ICE, and L. Francis Cissna, then the director of Citizenship and Immigration Services — the agency that handles the country’s legal immigration procedures — he urged Nielsen to take some sort of drastic action.

One option McAleenan, Homan and Cissna presented to Nielsen, according to the current and former administration officials, was instituting a policy of separating migrant children from their families. Because of a consent decree known as the Flores settlement, C.B.P. is prohibited from holding immigrant children caught illegally crossing the border with their guardians for more than 20 days. This meant that adult immigrants, if they illegally came across the border with their children, would be released — often immediately or at the longest after 20 days — when their children were required to be released. Separating the children from their parents, department officials argued, would allow C.B.P. to detain the adults longer.

According to former senior administration officials, Kelly, when he was homeland security secretary, had been urged by other administration officials to institute such a family-separation policy. Publicly, Kelly said he was considering such a move. “I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America to getting on this very, very dangerous network that brings them up through Mexico into the United States,” he told CNN in March 2017. But according to former senior administration officials, he privately rejected it, and the idea was tabled.

Now Nielsen rejected it as well. But as the border numbers kept rising, the pressure on Nielsen to do something only grew — and it was no longer coming from just her deputies. Toward the end of 2017, Gene Hamilton, Miller’s old ally at D.H.S., moved over to the Department of Justice, where he was reunited with Sessions, his old Senate boss. Not long after Hamilton’s arrival, the attorney general began to assert himself more aggressively on immigration matters. In early April 2018, Sessions announced that the Department of Justice would institute a policy of “zero tolerance” for undocumented immigrants. For the last two decades, under Democratic and Republican presidents, people who were caught crossing the border for the first time were typically charged with misdemeanors and then released. Under the zero-tolerance policy, all undocumented immigrants would be “met with the full prosecutorial power of the Department of Justice,” as Sessions put it.

The timing of the attorney general’s announcement caught Nielsen by surprise — and it presented her with a problem. For the Trump administration to be able to prosecute all undocumented immigrants, C.B.P. would have to refer their cases to the Justice Department, which would mean separating parents from their children while the parents awaited prosecution. Later that April, McAleenan, Homan and Cissna wrote Nielsen a memo recommending that D.H.S. start doing just that.

According to The Washington Post, which obtained a copy of the memo, they noted that the Trump administration had run a pilot zero-tolerance program along parts of the border in Texas and New Mexico for four months in 2017 and that the number of families trying to cross illegally had gone down 64 percent, only to rise again when the program was paused. After receiving the memo, Nielsen met with McAleenan, Homan and Cissna at the Ronald Reagan Building near the White House. There, according to former senior administration officials, she told them that she felt boxed in, but she agreed to their recommendation."
"A city in South Dakota has dozens of presidential statues.

A life-size bronze statue of Obama was unveiled Saturday in Rapid City. The sculpture, created by artist James Van Nuys, is part of a collection of figures honoring past US presidents throughout the city's downtown district.

But Obama's statue is slightly different than the others.

The City of Presidents project, the private group behind the statues, initially planned to release the statue within nine months and it took them about two years. Members had planned to show Obama only standing and waving when they decided to brainstorm more ideas.

""One of us said, 'This is boring. This is not going to have the wow factor,'"" said Dallerie Davis, the group's co-founder. ""A man waving is not a showstopper.""

Her primary victory for New York’s Fourteenth District seat—as a young woman of color beating out a long-established white male incumbent—was big news, and Ocasio-Cortez has been generating headlines almost daily ever since. Practically since the day she took her seat in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez became the hero of the Democratic left wing and a favored villain of Fox News and the right. She battled Nancy Pelosi to make the Green New Deal a priority and has been involved with a movement to launch primary challenges against centrist or right-leaning Democrats. Like Bernie Sanders, she embraces the label of democratic socialism and supports free college education for all Americans. She has called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She joined David Remnick in the New Yorker Radio Hour studio on July 5th, just after her trip to the border to examine migrant-detention facilities. Remnick and Ocasio-Cortez spoke about why she courted controversy by referring to some facilities as “concentration camps”; why she thinks the Department of Homeland Security is irredeemable; and whether Joe Biden is qualified to be President, given his comments about colleagues who supported forms of segregation. “Issues of race and gender are not extra-credit points in being a good Democrat,” she says. “They are a core part of the . . . competencies that a President needs. . . .

E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"

DOJ supports the NFL in Oakland’s lawsuit regarding the relocation of the Raiders,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com,['Posted Mike Florio'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/07/16/doj-supports-the-nfl-in-oaklands-lawsuit-regarding-the-relocation-of-the-raiders/,"Getty Images

The administration of Donald J. Trump continues to antagonize many Americans and American institutions. It no longer is antagonizing the NFL. Instead, it’s trying to help.

Sheilla Dingus of AdvocacyForFairnessInSports.org has tracked down the newest filing in the antitrust lawsuit initiated by the City of Oakland against the NFL and the Raiders. In the document, Oakland objects to the submission by the Department of Justice a “Statement of Interest” in the action against the NFL and the Raiders.

In short, the DOJ argues that Oakland should not be permitted to recover lost tax revenues through the antitrust laws. While not a full and complete attack on the overall legal effort, the DOJ’s position, if successful, would limit Oakland’s potential recovery — and it would limit the NFL’s potential exposure.

Oakland also points out that first contact from the DOJ came in early June, one day before a scheduled (but since postponed) hearing on the NFL’s effort to dismiss the entire case. (The hearing is currently set for Friday.) It’s unclear why the DOJ became interested in the case, or why that interest emerged so recently. Regardless, the bottom line is that the DOJ, under the ultimately control of Attorney General William Barr, has decided to get involved in the case, and to make an argument that would reduce the potential worst-case scenario for the NFL.

No matter how that happened, the days of the President repeatedly needling the NFL seem to be ancient history."

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Judges Sandra Ikuta and Jay Bybee, who ruled in the DOJ's favor, were appointees of President George W. Bush.

Resignation puts state Department of Human Services under the microscope.

Tim Walz he wanted to leave his job as commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, he said he wanted to do so immediately — to avoid drama and speculation.

Things didn’t exactly work out that way.

In a press release issued Monday morning, Walz’s office announced that Pam Wheelock would be appointed acting commissioner of the state’s largest agency. Wheelock has broad experience in government and nonprofits, including stints as Gov. Jesse Ventura’s finance commissioner and former St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman’s deputy mayor. But beneath that annnounced in the release was the real news: that Lourey would resign and leave the job. At the end of the day.

Six months as DHS commissioner is not a long tenure, even in a volatile job like state government Cabinet secretary. And Lourey’s quick departure, especially after giving up a state Senate seat lost to Republicans in a February special election, created plenty of drama. Coming a weekend after the resignation of two long-serving and well-regarded senior department executives, the move also spawned widespread speculation.

Was he fired? Did the governor ask for the resignation letter? How much notice was Walz given?

At a news conference Monday, Walz said Lourey was not fired; that he didn’t ask for the resignation; and that he found out about the decision the day before. Even if those answers were designed to tamp down speculation, the timing and verbage the DFL governor used Monday — and that Lourey used in his resignation letter — triggered a day of reading between the lines.

While that isn’t unusual for political appointees, the difference was that Lourey also didn’t have a good working relationship with the senior bureaucrats who are often relied upon to run the place.

Walz said Monday that the two officials who recently resigned, Deputy Commissioners Chuck Johnson and Claire Wilson, spoke late last week with his chief of staff, Chris Schmitter, about their reasons for leaving the department. “When two longtime, dedicated public servants say they’re going to leave service, I want to know that, too,” Walz said.

While Walz described them as “very respectful,” the two said they disagreed with the direction the agency was going under Lourey.

“I expressed my desire to try to keep both of them,” said Walz.

Neither Johnson or Wilson are leaving immediately, and Walz wasn’t ruling out the possibility that they would rescind those resignations. “The resignation letter of the commissioner is very self-aware that maybe this is the wrong leadership style at this time to achieve the goals we are looking for,” Walz said. “I think Commissioner Lourey said, ‘I got you through this, I helped you get this budget, I got the provider tax sunset removed, now it’s time for someone else’s skill set.’”

That letter to Walz, while thanking him for the opportunity and citing “the real change I pushed for in an agency that needs to grow in how it connects with and partners with the people we serve,” noted in its conclusion: “I believe a new leader is necessary to best execute your vision for human services and continue the critical work of improving the health of Minnesotan across the state.”

Lourey said through an agency spokesperson that he was not doing interviews or taking questions about his departure.

Walz rejected suggestions that the department is in chaos and used Wheelock’s willingness to take on the job as evidence. “I don’t think that acting Commissioner Wheelock saw an agency in crisis,” he said. “I think she saw an agency at a transition point.”

Another issue might have contributed to the timing of the announcement. Last week, the Pioneer-Press reported that the Department of Human Services was still paying Inspector General Carolyn Ham four months after putting her on leave. While the suggestion was that she was the subject of an investigation into how the department responded to allegations of fraud and theft in the Child Care Assistance Program, Ham said no investigation had begun.

On Monday, Walz said an investigation had begun but wouldn’t say when. Later, House GOP Leader Kurt Daudt said he’d been told that morning that the investigation had begun “very recently.”

Walz said he was restricted in what he could say but said that no state employee took money.

“The situation that happened with the Child Care Assistance Program is totally unacceptable,” Walz said. “And to be totally clear, no one in state government stole any money. Private businesses stole from the state of Minnesota and we were negligent — or it appears to me that we were negligent — in stopping that in a timely manner.”

The investigation, he said, is to understand why that happened.

But Walz also said there was no linkage between the CCAP issue and Lourey’s resignation. “I think there’s going to be a desire to find more drama than is there,” he said. “Those of you who know me know I don’t do drama. I think the situation is we have a complex agency, the skillset Commissioner Lourey possessed was incredibly helpful and was the catalyst to helping us get a budget done.”

Now, however, as policies and budgets are implemented, and as the CCAP problems are addressed, “I will take Commissioner Lourey at this word that he felt he was not the right person at this time to do that.”

While neither Johnson nor Wilson made public statements about concerns with the agency, another person who recently left the agency did. Dr. Jeff Schiff was the longtime medical director to the state Medicaid program before his job was eliminated last month. The Pioneer Press reported that he issued a statement last week after Johnson’s and Wilson’s resignations: “This event, following the reorganization that led to my departure, points to serious systemic issues with the leadership culture of the agency,” he said. “I call upon Governor Walz and Lieutenant Governor Flanagan to live up to their pledge of ‘One Minnesota,’ investigate, and act so that we can go back to being the healthiest state in the nation for all Minnesotans.”

Republican legislators had already scheduled a noon press conference to talk about the Johnson and Wilson resignations, arguing that it signaled disarray in the agency. Monday’s announcement changed the narrative a bit, but not the political message.

“Since Gov. Walz has taken office, the department has been embroiled in chaos,” said Rep. Mary Franson, R-Alexandria. She compared it to a dumpster fire. Daudt repeatedly termed the resignation of Lourey and whatever led up to it as a “scandal.” Daudt, R-Crown, said he has been around state government long enough to know commissioners don’t get fired, they get asked to resign.

The rapid action suggests that this has been “boiling up for a few days,” he said, and that the state is owed a more specific explanation of why Lourey resigned. “I can assure you that Commissioner Lourey didn’t give up a Senate seat to serve as commissioner for six months,” Daudt said.

And while he was willing to allow Walz some leeway since the CCAP fraud investigation covered his predecessor’s term in office, that will end soon. “There comes a time when fraud is overlooked enough that Gov. Walz will own that fraud,” Daudt said. “If he does nothing to fix the fraud, he becomes part of the fraud.”

Unlike Daudt and Franson, who are minority members of the House, Sen. Michelle Benson is a member of the Senate’s majority caucus, and as such controls a committee with oversight of the Department of Human Services. The Ham Lake Republican said she had a working relationship with Lourey, both when he served in the state Senate and then as commissioner. She termed it a “functional working relationship” and said he called her last week to tell her of the Johnson and Wilson resignations.

But she said her hopes that Lourey would be a “transformative leader” were not realized. “It just might be the case that DHS is too big of an entrenched bureaucracy, even for someone with Tony Lourey’s experience, to transform,” Benson said.

She renewed her call to break the agency up into parts and said Walz should call on experts from the private sector as he did to resolve delays and cost overruns in the MNLARS state licensing system. “It is time the governor grab the leadership and move this to a better place,” Benson said. “That’s all I want. In 18 months for the place to be noticeably and fundamentally better.”

Benson’s counterpart in the House, Health and Human Services Finance chair Tina Liebling, called the Lourey resignation disappointing and described him as “a great guy.”

But the job is a difficult one, she said, “maybe even harder than governor,” and that Lourey may not have known how tough it was until he was in the midst of it.

The DFLer said she too was surprised that the investigation into the office of inspector general and the CCAP issue either hadn’t begun or has just been begun. And she called the loss of Johnson and Wilson “a tremendous loss for the administration.” Johnson, she said, was respected by both parties in the Legislature. “He has always engendered a lot of comfort,” she said. “He knows the agency and he handles himself well.

“He’s the one you want in the room when there’s some tough issue,” she said.

But she rejected GOP suggestions that the situation at DHS represents disarray or chaos. “I’m as surprised as anyone. It is a short period of time,” she said. But compared to the comings and going of members of the Trump administration, it doesn’t suggest a lot of turnover. “It isn’t a disaster. I think it’s just an opportunity to rethink what the agency needs.”"

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.
