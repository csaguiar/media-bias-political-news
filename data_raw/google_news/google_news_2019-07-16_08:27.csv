Extra protection sought for certain lawmakers after Trump's comments about 'squad',https://www.foxnews.com,['Chad Pergram'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-squad-tweets-extra-protection-house-exclusive,"EXCLUSIVE – House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., was seeking extra protection for members of Congress on Monday after President Trump’s tweets and remarks about the progressive “squad.”

Trump’s remarks apparently were directed at four congresswomen: Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. All are American citizens and three of the four were born in the U.S.

Far from backing down, Trump on Monday dug in on comments he had initially made a day earlier on Twitter that if lawmakers “hate our country,” they can go back to their “broken and crime-infested” countries.

“If you’re not happy in the U.S., if you’re complaining all the time, you can leave, you can leave right now,” he said.

In the letter for House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving and Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger, Thompson argued that the Capitol Police Board should meet to “analyze the current threat environment and set thresholds for enhanced safety of Members.”

Thompson asked for a meeting within 48 hours and a classified readout of the meeting.

The letter was addressed to Stenger because he has headed the Capitol Police Board this year.

Thompson said security officials should set “thresholds for enhanced security for certain targeted Members, and evaluate threat streams with law enforcement partners in Member districts. Being proactive in this instance is vital to the safety of not only these targeted Members, but all Members of Congress.”

Fox News has been told that despite Thompson’s pleas, other lawmakers have faced more serious threats than members of the squad ahead of Trump's tweets."
A Blaring Message in Republicans’ Muted Criticism: It’s Trump’s Party,https://www.nytimes.com,['Carl Hulse'],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/republicans-trump-tweet.html,"WASHINGTON — The lack of widespread Republican condemnation of President Trump for his comments about four Democratic congresswomen of color illustrated both the tightening stranglehold Mr. Trump has on his party and the belief of many Republicans that an attack on progressivism should in fact be a central element of the 2020 campaign.

While a smattering of Republicans chastised Mr. Trump on Monday, most party leaders in the House and Senate and much of the rank-and-file remained quiet about the president’s weekend tweets directing dissenters to “go back” where they came from. He followed up on those comments on Monday with harsh language directed at “people who hate America” — an inflammatory accusation to be leveled against elected members of the House.

With Mr. Trump far more popular with Republican voters than incumbent Republican members of Congress, most are loath to cross the president and risk reprisals. The case of Representative Justin Amash, the Michigan lawmaker who was forced to leave the party after he dared to suggest Mr. Trump should be impeached, serves as a cautionary tale.

At the same time, many Republicans are seeking to label the four congresswomen and their ideas as “far left,” seeing it as a potential foundation of a sweeping critique of Democrats in 2020. In an appearance on Fox News, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called the four “a bunch of communists,” a step beyond the president, who said he was at the moment only willing to go so far as calling them “socialists.”"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

When President Trump tweeted his racist remarks Sunday, asking why certain Democratic congresswomen don't just ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,"" he did not just take aim at the four young women of color — three of whom were actually born in the U.S.

He did so using a taunt that has long, deeply entrenched roots in American history: Why don't you just go back where you came from?

The question doesn't always appear in those precise words, nor does it always surface in the same situations. And it doesn't always get directed at the same groups of people — far from it, in fact. But more often than not, it conveys the same sentiment: You — and others like you — are not welcome here.

""There have been different phrases that have been used,"" says Michael Cornfield, a scholar of rhetoric at George Washington University, ""but the idea that we don't have any more room for people, or those people don't look like us, this is a long, ugly strain in American history.""

Jennifer Wingard, a University of Houston professor who has looked at rhetoric and immigrant communities, traces this sentiment at least to 1798, when the U.S. passed a series of laws — together known as the the Alien and Sedition Acts — that were aimed at making citizenship more difficult for immigrants and deportation easier for U.S. authorities to carry out.

""The legislation is actually constructed for the ability to remove immigrants who are saying things against the U.S. government,"" she says, explaining that these laws were passed in a tumultuous political climate.

""We were starting to see different political parties and different politicians arguing for different ways that the government should be run. And it just happened that politically, they could try to maintain and try to withhold the status quo by putting it on the backs of immigrants.""

Those laws established a pattern, she says, which would resurface with new waves of immigration and new perceived threats — from the Great Famine in Ireland and the Spanish-American War, to the Great Depression and the attacks on Sept. 11.

""Every wave of immigration that gets in sees the next wave as the threat. That is the wave that is now going to take the jobs, that is now going to take things away,"" Wingard says. ""The latest flow in is always the one that seems the most threatening.""

Alan Kraut, a scholar at American University who is writing a history of anti-immigrant feeling in the U.S., says he saw this kind of thing play out firsthand when he was a child growing up in the Bronx.

""When kids had a fight in the street and the kids were from different ethnic groups, one kid would often say to the other: 'You and your parents go back where you came from,' "" Kraut recalls.

""You know, it could mean Brooklyn. But it could also mean go back where you came from — you know, Russian Jews who came to the United States, southern Italians who came to the United States, Puerto Ricans newly arrived,"" he continues. ""So when this came out of the mouth of this president who's from Queens, it sounded almost like a child saying that in my memory on the streets of New York.""

The process renews often, Wingard says, and she says the sentiment remains steady even if the names of the targeted groups change.

""There's a fancy theoretical term — it's called a palimpsest,"" says Jennifer Wingard, a rhetoric scholar at the University of Houston. A palimpsest, she explains, is a text that has been erased and overwritten — but that nevertheless continues to bear many of the markings and meanings largely concealed beneath the new writing.

""They carry these sentiments that we have seen over centuries, but then they get repurposed for the current moment — and a phrase like that [racist taunt] becomes almost like a shorthand for anti-immigrant sentiment,"" Wingard says. ""You know, 'go back where you came from' is the same as 'go back to your own country' is the same as 'you are not allowed here' is the same as 'no immigrants allowed.' Yet it carries all of this historical shorthand with it.""

Cornfield says it's partly the statement's variability that makes it so powerful.

""It plays to the fear that somehow America is getting too full or that the mixing of ethnicities and races would somehow aggravate issues,"" he says. ""It's a potent phrase and part of its potency is its ambiguity.""

Its simplicity, too.

""When you use a phrase like this, you're just asking people to forget about context and forget about policy choices,"" he adds, ""and just get angry at people who don't look or sound like you do."""
"After 2016 Bible Slip, Trump Lashed Out at ‘So-Called Christians,’ Book Says",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Jonathan Martin']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/trump-evangelical-christians.html,"Evangelical voters make up a core constituency for Mr. Trump. Without their support, he would not have won the presidency, his advisers acknowledge. And the president has sought ways to engage those supporters.

For his part, in 2016, Mr. Cruz was candid with friends about his view of evangelicals who backed Mr. Trump. “If you’re a faithful person, if you believe that Jesus Christ died for your sins, emerged from the grave three days later and gives eternal life, and you’re supporting Donald Trump,” the book quotes Mr. Cruz saying to friends, “I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with you.”

Mr. Cruz won the caucuses by a small margin, following questionable tactics that the Cruz campaign used against a third candidate, Ben Carson. When Mr. Cruz won, Mr. Trump, aboard his private plane, called the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, Jeff Kaufmann, and said, “I think you need to publicly disavow the result.” When Mr. Kaufmann said he could not do that, Mr. Trump was quiet for a moment, and then repeated: “You should disavow the result. Think about it, will you?”

Mr. Cruz was the last candidate standing against Mr. Trump deep into the primary election season. Mr. Trump clinched the nomination after the Indiana primary in May 2016, but some of his detractors within the Republican Party still hoped to persuade delegates to back Mr. Cruz at the national convention in Ohio that summer. That effort failed.

Since then, the two have joined forces, and Mr. Cruz has at times vociferously defended Mr. Trump. But the book goes into extensive detail on the various smears and humiliations of both Mr. Cruz and his wife, Heidi, that Mr. Trump doled out. That included extensive efforts by The National Enquirer, run by Mr. Trump’s ally David J. Pecker, to dig up dirt on Mr. Cruz."

The Trump administration plans to relocate most of the Bureau of Land Management’s D.C. workforce to west of the Rockies, part of its broader push to shift power away from Washington and shrink the size of the federal government.

The proposal to move roughly 300 employees from a key Interior Department agency — among them the majority of top managers — comes as Trump officials are forcibly reassigning career officials and upending operations across the federal government. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue finalized plans this summer to move about 550 jobs at two of his department’s scientific agencies from the nation’s capital to greater Kansas City. The White House is trying to abolish the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, and has threatened to furlough as many as 150 employees if Congress blocks it.

“The problem with Washington is too many policy makers are far removed from the people they are there to serve,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said in a statement supporting the land agency’s move. “Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is West of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters.”

But opponents argue that abrupt decisions to relocate or reassign federal workers have not been justified by sufficient analysis, can disrupt families’ lives and already have cost the government valuable expertise. BLM has about 360 employees in Washington, many of them supervisors, with 95 percent of its 9,260 employees working in the field.

“If I wanted to dismantle an agency, this would be in my playbook,” said Steve Ellis, who retired as BLM’s deputy director in 2016 after nearly four decades in government service. In a phone interview Monday, he said that transferring so many employees out of Washington could complicate the agency’s relationship with Capitol Hill, budget officials and other federal entities.

He noted that BLM dispatched all of its wildfire and aviation staff to Boise, Idaho, in the 1990s only to reestablish a wildland fire office in the District when lawmakers expected briefings after fires broke out in the West.

“It’s important for these agencies to have a meaningful footprint in D.C.,” Ellis said.

Margaret Weichert, Office of Management and Budget deputy director for management, said in a statement that the move will make the government more efficient and “better serve the American people.”

In a shift long sought by conservatives, Trump’s government has shed thousands of employees overall since he took office, with gains at the Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs but an exodus of civil servants at several other agencies, including Labor, Education, and Housing and Urban Development.

Jason A. Briefel, head of the Senior Executive Association that represents 6,000 top government leaders, said it is worth having a public conversation about how to reorganize different agencies. But he questioned whether the Trump administration has made a solid business case for some of these decisions.

“This isn’t just an Interior issue,” he said in an interview. “This is a government-wide issue.”

Interior’s plan for BLM, according to two people briefed on it who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, proposes dispersing about 225 staffers who report to headquarters to states including Colorado, Nevada and Utah over time, while reassigning another 75 to the bureau’s state offices. The rest of employees would remain in Washington to work on issues such as the bureau’s budget, regulations and Freedom of Information Act requests.

Some of the BLM top employees slated for a job transfer will move to Grand Junction, Colo., according to three federal officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision has not been formally announced. But many affected workers — who include some top officials, Senior Executive Service staffers and low-level managers — will move to other cities in the West.

Interior officials have been eyeing a possible move for BLM, which manages more than 10 percent of the nation’s land, for more than two years. A handful of Western states, such as Colorado and Utah, have sought to recruit the agency.

While administration officials defend the Agriculture Department and BLM moves as an effort to spread the federal workforce around, 85 percent of the 2.1 million federal employees already live outside the Washington area.

The idea of shifting the bureau west has received the support of some lawmakers, including the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, Rob Bishop (Utah), as well as Gardner and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.). In March 2018, the two senators from Colorado urged then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to look at Grand Junction, roughly 280 miles west of Denver.

Bishop said Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is “promoting a thoughtful, methodical approach that is a true win for the West. I’m pleased that a significant number of personnel will be coming to Utah and other Western states.”

But House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) accused Bernhardt of being secretive about his plans. Bernhardt’s hometown of Rifle, Colo., is not far from Grand Junction.

“Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s hometown just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,” Grijalva said. “The agency will lose a lot of good people because of this move, and I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here.”

Interior declined to comment on the relocation.

It remains unclear whether Congress would have to explicitly authorize the shift in personnel. The first stage of the move is expected to cost about $5 million, according to two government officials.

This is not the first time Interior has reassigned senior executives with little notice. In June 2017, political appointees reshuffled the assignments of more than three dozen career executives, with just 15 days’ notice of their job change. Interior’s Office of Inspector General investigated the matter but did not determine whether the moves were justified, citing the department’s incomplete records.

Denise Sheehan, who worked at Interior for 33 years before retiring last month from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in an interview that the round of reassignments had a “chilling effect,” limiting what career officials are comfortable saying to political appointees.

“I don’t know if that was intended or not, but that was definitely the effect. It’s the most toxic thing in the senior executive corps I have ever seen,” she said.

In many cases, reassigned federal staffers have chosen to leave the government because they hail from two-career families or for other personal reasons. A majority of scientists and researchers at the USDA agencies slated to move to Kansas City are choosing not to move, and Perdue’s plan has been dogged by questions about its cost and the motivation behind it.

“When you move large numbers of employees from one part of the country to another, you’re going to lose a lot of institutional knowledge,” said Ward Morrow, assistant general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union — with 530 members at BLM.

In other instances, the administration has shuttered parts of agencies altogether. The small Federal Labor Relations Authority, which adjudicates disputes between federal employees and their agencies, has closed regional offices in Dallas and Boston, citing declining workloads.

Under federal law, BLM will have to pay all relocation and real estate costs for employees who choose to move west, including what it takes to sell their homes in the Washington region and purchase a new one. Employees and their families will be entitled to four months of hotel stays on the government’s dime, federal personnel experts said, which could cost as much as $100,000 per employee.

The agency probably will offer retirement and buyout packages to employees who decide not to move, which could equal as much as a year’s salary depending on their age and years of service.

Scientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453193-scientists-flee-usda-as-research-agencies-move-to-kansas-city-area,"A Trump administration decision to move researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the Kansas City area is threatening to spark the flight of more than half of the staff selected to move, gutting the agency of its top scientific voices.

Staff have until midnight Monday to decide whether to uproot and join the department as it moves its research branches from Washington, D.C., lured by $26 million in promised incentives from state and local officials.

Critics see the move, set to be completed by Sept. 30, as yet another example of the Trump administration looking to sideline scientists and researchers, keeping them away from the corridors of power. Administration officials deny that, calling it a cost-saving move intended to have researchers closer to farmers.

The decision comes as other agencies are also planning to relocate parts of their teams amid suspicions about the move. For example, the Interior Department is expected to announce new headquarters for the Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

The move affects two wings of the USDA. Economic Research Service (ERS) employees analyze the agricultural market, but their research is much broader, including looking at food stamps, rural poverty and conservation.

National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) employees work with universities to fund research and coordinate the process that issues research grants on agriculture-related subjects, including climate change adaptation.

The two agencies voted to unionize in response to the move, as Democrats in both chambers and a number of groups that regularly work with the two agencies lobby to keep them in Washington.

Estimates tallied by employees show 70 percent of ERS employees designated for the Kansas City office will not be moving. For NIFA, 45 percent of those surveyed said they will not move. Overall, the move was expected to impact 547 staff between the two agencies.

But the numbers of staff refusing to move may grow. Some employees said staff at both agencies are trying not to tip their hands, saying they will move only if they do not find another job in the D.C. area.

So far, just 27 ERS staff out of 250 have committed to moving to the Kansas City area, according to the employee tallies.

The UDSA argues the move will save $300 million over 15 years, but critics have said their cost-benefit analysis was shoddy and did not follow guidelines.

A different cost-benefit analysis from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association found the move would cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million.

Democrats have blocked USDA funding from supporting the move and asked the agency to turn over information about its decisionmaking process, and they have sponsored legislation to keep the two agencies in Washington.

“I am appalled with the Trump administration’s decision to force hundreds of Washington-based USDA research staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods,” Rep. Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeFederal employees turn their backs on Agriculture secretary after relocation plans announced Congress should make Interior's Bernhardt 'manage the land to stop climate change' Hollywood stars celebrate #RightToBearArts at DC gala MORE (D-Maine), who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement when the move was announced.

“Many of these staffers believe their relocation is an effort to silence their research into topics that do not align with the Trump administration’s political agenda, including the study of climate change and benefits of low-income food assistance,” she added.

Employees had a list of complaints about a move they have likened to Amazon’s search for a second headquarters, as the USDA examined bids from 139 cities.

That process was put on pause during the government shutdown, but on June 16 employees were told they had a month to decide whether they’d like to move to the Kansas City area or leave the agency.

Employees would then have two months to move to Kansas City — they must be there by the end of the fiscal year — but school in the area is slated to start Aug. 12, putting added pressure on those with families to quickly make a move.

Employees say they are getting conflicting information about how much of their moving costs will be covered by the government. Other key details about the move are also unknown so far, according to the employees.

The USDA said it was working to make the move as smooth as possible but did not respond to several specific questions about the move from The Hill.

“USDA has determinedly worked to ensure employees have the resources they need to make informed decisions about their employment and to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible,” the agency said in a statement.

Employees say morale is at an all-time low and they worry about the future of an agency that is already hemorrhaging staff and having trouble completing its work.

“Honestly, I’m not sure how we’re going to bounce back or if we will,” said Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist with ERS who is now a union steward. “This agency is the product of like 50 years of institutional knowledge and gathering up researchers who are very specialized in their fields.”

Employees also say there are contradictions between what the USDA says it hopes to achieve with the move and how it would actually impact the department.

“It was sort of get fired or go,” said Ariela Zycherman, a national program leader with NIFA who is still weighing a move to Kansas City.

“People keep saying, ‘Those East Coasters don’t want to come to Kansas or Missouri.’ The fact of matter is that’s not really the issue,” she said. “Many of us would move to Kansas City, but there are questions about future of agency and its effectiveness and questions about the way this was hastily rolled out and whether it will have long-term effects on our families’ well-being.”

The USDA has argued the move will allow employees to be closer to farmers — something employees say shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what they do.

“I think the biggest misconception around this is, we don’t serve individual farmers,” Dodson said. “Our stakeholders are primarily Congress and program leads and agencies and nonprofits in D.C. or people that come to meet with multiple entities in D.C.""

“I think our presence will be very much diminished. I think we’ll be quite literally out of sight and out of mind,” Dodson added.

The bipartisan Kansas and Missouri delegation pushed hard to bring the offices to the Kansas City area, calling it a hub for research and a talented workforce and touting the lower cost compared to Washington, D.C.

But employees say the hectic way the move has been handled has soured many about the USDA.

“I’ve never experienced morale like this in any job,” said Wesley Dean, a national program leader in sociology for NIFA. “My colleagues are deeply committed to the mission of the agency and see their positions as an opportunity to both shape the future of their scientific disciplines and to serve the American people.

“These highly motivated civil servants feel as if their expertise and dedication to the agency and the public has been undermined and dismissed by the department,” Dean added."
"E.P.A. Broke Rules in Shake-Up of Science Panels, Federal Watchdog Says",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/climate/epa-advisory-panels-gao-report.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration failed to follow ethics rules last year when it dismissed academic members of Environmental Protection Agency advisory boards and replaced them with appointees connected to industry, a federal watchdog agency concluded Monday.

The agency, the Government Accountability Office, found that the administration “did not consistently ensure” that appointees to E.P.A. advisory panels met federal ethics requirements. It also concluded that Trump administration officials violated E.P.A. guidelines by not basing the appointments on recommendations made by career staff members.

Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s first E.P.A. administrator who resigned last year amid ethics scandals, remade the agency’s science advisory panels because he said they did not fairly represent the United States geographically, or the industries affected by regulations.

The percentage of academic scientists serving on one E.P.A. panel, the Scientific Advisory Board, dropped 27 percent during the first year of the Trump administration. Academics on the agency’s Board of Scientific Counselors dropped 45 percent. Investigators found that the percentage of academics on E.P.A. advisory boards remained stable around 83 percent during the first year President Barack Obama was in office ."

Watchdog finds EPA skirted rules when appointing industry leaders to science boards,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453178-watchdog-finds-epa-skirted-rules-when-appointing-industry-leaders,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) increased the number of industry representatives and consultants on its top scientific board and failed to ensure all those appointees met ethics requirements, a government watchdog found.

A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found the EPA did not follow the process for selecting the “best qualified and most appropriate candidates” for two important committees that advise on environmental regulations and also “did not ensure that all appointees met ethics requirements.”

The EPA’s Science Advisory Board (SAB), a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, is designed to guide the agency on its scientific processes.

Critics say it has been repeatedly targeted by the Trump administration.

“After a careful investigation, the non-partisan GAO confirms what we’ve been critical of all along: The Trump Administration is violating its own rules by putting industry officials in charge of crucially important science advisory boards,” the statement said.

The GAO report said there were “notable changes” to some committees, including an initial drop in the number of academics serving on the SAB.

It also highlighted numerous issues with following ethics guidelines.

“EPA also did not consistently ensure that members appointed as special government employees (SGE)—who are expected to provide their best judgment free from conflicts of interest and are required by federal regulations to disclose their financial interests—met federal ethics requirements,” the report said, adding that there should have been more periodic reviews of its ethics programs.

The EPA pushed back again the report.

“EPA has already provided GAO its thorough explanation on their conclusion that the Agency did not follow its own policy – the assertion is incorrect and should be removed from the report,” Michael Abboud, an EPA spokesman, said in a statement to The Hill. “Under this administration, EPA has doubled its career ethics attorney staff to ensure that all appointees meet financial disclosure requirements. Finally given the range of environmental and public health considerations across the country, EPA is proud of the fact that its chartered scientific advisory committees have the highest participation of state, local, and tribal experts than at any point in the Agency’s history. Further, legal challenges to the Agency’s FACA directive on Special Government Employees with EPA grants have been dismissed in three separate district courts.”

EPA’s SAB has pushed back against a proposal that would consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public, even as its membership has changed. The Trump administration has also proposed cutting one-third of boards like the SAB that advise agencies."

Trump Fans the Flames of a Racial Fire,https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-race.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump woke up on Sunday morning, gazed out at the nation he leads, saw the dry kindling of race relations and decided to throw a match on it. It was not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last. He has a pretty large carton of matches and a ready supply of kerosene.

His Twitter harangue goading Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the country they came from, even though most of them were actually born in the United States, shocked many. But it should have surprised few who have watched the way he has governed a multicultural, multiracial country the last two and a half years.

When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century. While others who occupied the White House at times skirted close to or even over the line, finding ways to appeal to the resentments of white Americans with subtle and not-so-subtle appeals, none of them in modern times fanned the flames as overtly, relentlessly and even eagerly as Mr. Trump.

His attack on the Democratic congresswomen came on the same day his administration was threatening mass roundups of immigrants living in the country illegally. And it came just days after he hosted some of the most incendiary right-wing voices on the internet at the White House and vowed to find another way to count citizens separately from noncitizens despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked him from adding a question to the once-a-decade census."
Pentagon silent on Turkey as Congress urges retaliation for Russian missile buy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/pentagon-silent-on-turkey-as-congress-urges-retaliation-for-russian-missile-buy,"STILL WAITING: The Pentagon on Friday appeared poised to bring the hammer down on Turkey after the NATO ally announced that — in clear defiance of U.S. warnings — it had accepted the first delivery of components of the Russian S-400 air defense system.

The Pentagon scheduled a rare on-camera, on-the-record briefing for 11:15 a.m. with Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, and David Trachtenberg, deputy undersecretary for policy, to give the department’s official response.

CONGRESS READY TO ACT: Members of Congress were weighing in , calling for the Trump administration to follow through on its months of threats to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that if he bought the sophisticated Russian system he would have to give up the American F-35 fighter jet and risked further economic sanctions.

The Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees issued a bipartisan statement. “Congress has made it clear that there must be consequences for President Erdogan’s misguided S-400 acquisition, a troubling signal of strategic alignment with Putin’s Russia and a threat to the F-35 program. As a result, we urge President Trump to fully implement sanctions as required by law under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,” said the statement signed by Jim Inhofe, Jack Reed, Jim Risch, and Bob Menendez, the respective chairmen and ranking members of both committees. “Additionally, while all F-35 material deliveries remain indefinitely suspended, we call on the Department of Defense to proceed with the termination of Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program.”

ESPER SAYS STAY TUNED: In a brief exchange with pool reporters, acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, ""We are aware of Turkey taking delivery of the S-400. Our position regarding the F-35 has not changed.”

Esper said he would be speaking later Friday with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar. “So there will be more to follow after that conversation,” he told reporters.

THEN, CRICKETS: The planned briefing by Lord and Trachtenberg was postponed and later canceled. There was no statement from the Pentagon, the State Department, or the White House on Turkey’s future with the F-35 program.

President Trump last spoke publicly on the issue at the G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, in which he blamed President Obama for the problem, claiming Turkey had no choice but to buy Russian missiles because Obama denied Turkey U.S. Patriot missile defenses. In fact, efforts by both the Obama and Trump administrations to sell Patriots to Turkey fell through in a dispute over technology transfer.

As of Monday morning, we are still waiting to hear how the situation will be resolved.

HAPPENING TODAY: All quiet on the Pentagon front as Mark Esper prepares for his expedited Senate confirmation hearing, set for 9:30 am tomorrow. As of this morning, Esper is still listed on the Pentagon’s website as acting defense secretary, even though the plan is for him to step aide as soon as his nomination is submitted and for Navy Secretary Richard Spencer to fill in until he gets a final vote in the Senate.

No events are listed on Esper’s public schedule. The indications are that Esper’s nomination will be submitted later today, in order to minimize the time Spencer will have to serve as his replacement.

The Senate Armed Services Committee agreed to waive the usual seven-day waiting period and put his confirmation on the fast track while still fully exercising its “advise and consent” responsibilities.

PARTISAN NDAA PASSES HOUSE: The debate over whether the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act was a partisan document seems settled by the fact it passed the House Friday 220-197 without a single Republican vote.

In contrast to the Senate version, the $733 billion House NDAA is loaded with a wish list of progressive initiatives that appear doomed to be defeated once the bill goes to conference committee, reports the Washington Examiner’s Susan Ferrechio. It also cuts $17 billion from the topline for defense.

“I predict the bill the bill that ends up on the president’s desk is going to look a lot more like the Senate bill than the bill that came out of the House,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana said Friday.

HOW PROGRESSIVE IS THE HOUSE NDAA?: Illinois Democrat Jan Schakowsky, a senior chief deputy whip, released this summary of the bill’s major provisions:



Includes a blanket prohibition on funding for the President’s wall on the southern border

Prohibits Department of Defense funds from aiding the President’s child separation policy

Provides Paid Family and Medical Leave for all government employees

Denies the President the unilateral authority to go to war in Iran

Repeals the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force war authority

Aids military families by providing increased resources for housing, childcare, and education

Requires DOD to help combat climate change

Stops DOD programs that significantly pollute the environment and provides a significant amount of funding for environmental cleanup

Accelerates the closure of the prison at Guantanamo Bay Cuba

Increases and aids diversity in the military

Reduces the size of our nuclear weapons program, and eliminates new low-yield nuclear weapons

Increases family planning services for military women and provides resources to combat sexual assault

Increases protections or unionized civilian defense employees

Requires and audit and increased fiscal responsibility for the Department overall

Prevents military assistance to groups or forces that are known to commit human rights violations

Helps hold Russia accountable for its interference in U.S. elections

Reverses the President’s ban on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces

WAR POWERS SHOWDOWN: The House bill includes a provision that would block new use of military force by the president without explicit permission from Congress, approving an amendment by a vote of 242 to 180 that prevents the president from using a 2001 war authorization to conduct future military action abroad.

An amendment that would also specifically curb Trump’s ability to authorize a military strike on Iran passed on a bipartisan vote of 251-to-170, with 27 Republicans voting for it along with all but 7 Democrats.

“We can’t let Trump and his warmongering cabinet drag us into another costly and destabilizing war in the Middle East,” said Barbara Lee of California, who sponsored the war authorization amendment.

‘VERY MISGUIDED’: Appearing on Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures, House Foreign Affairs Committee lead Republican Michael McCaul of Texas called the votes “very misguided.”

“I think it is a very dangerous, reckless policy by the Democrats to repeal the 2001 AUMF [Authorization for the Use of Military Force] with no replacement to it,” he told host Maria Bartiromo.

“In fact, every indication I have seen is he doesn't want to go to war with Iran,” McCaul said. “That's why he didn't respond back militarily after they shot down a U.S. military asset. He's trying to use a diplomatic route here. So, these are all ... I think very misguided.”

“I'm all for arguing about updating the 2001 AUMF after 9/11, but this would … illegalize all global counterterrorism operations in the world that we're conducting,” he added. “And then they want to repeal the 2002 [AUMF] with Iraq. And, of course, we know ISIS is still a threat in Iraq.”

ISIS WARNING: The latest “ sitrep ” from the Institute for the Study of War doubles down on its warning that ISIS is posed for a comeback in Iraq and Syria.

""The ISIS campaign in Iraq and Syria has demonstrated to ostensibly liberated communities that they are not safe, perpetuating conditions of fear and distrust that will make it increasingly difficult to establish durable and legitimate security and political structures across Iraq and Syria. ISIS’s next resurgence could be faster and even more devastating than 2014,” the group warned in its June report .

THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN: The Pentagon on Friday quietly released its latest congressionally mandated report on the war in Afghanistan, which puts a decidedly upbeat spin on how things are going in the wake of a number of deadly Taliban attacks and another U.S. soldier killed in combat.

The report credits U.S. Forces-Afghanistan commander Gen. Scott Miller with making changes in counter-terrorsim that have “restored the Coalition’s tactical initiative and put heavy pressure on the Taliban” and said the Afghan military “continued to improve its ability to fight the insurgents.”

Also of note was the ongoing effort by Zalmay Khalilzad, the special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, aimed at achieving a peace agreement “that safeguards the U.S. homeland and could lead to a reduction in the number of U.S. forces deployed in Afghanistan.”

AFGHANISTAN KIA: The Pentagon has identified the soldier killed in Afghanistan Saturday as Sgt. Maj. James G. “Ryan” Sartor, 40, of Teague, Texas. Sartor died from wounds sustained from enemy small arms fire during combat operations. Sartor, a Green Beret who had served several combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort Carson, Colorado.

His death is the 11th U.S. military fatality this year, including one death listed as “non-combat” by the Pentagon. In 2018, 14 U.S. troops died in Afghanistan.

"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

DHS inspector general confirms investigation into leaked ICE raids,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-confirms-investigation-into-leaked-ice-raids,"The Department of Homeland Security's independent Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement to call off a nationwide operation, according to the federal agency.

“Last month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) became aware of an apparent leak related to a planned enforcement operation. Leaks of law enforcement sensitive information jeopardize the safety of ICE officers and agents who have sworn an oath to uphold the law. ICE referred the incident to its Office of Professional Responsibility, which, in accordance with its normal procedures, referred it to the DHS Office of Inspector General,"" ICE said in a statement issued Monday morning.

The Washington Examiner was first to report on Friday that then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team had reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak.

""Everyone knows who they are investigating. Why didn't the acting secretary call for an investigation?"" a senior official told the Washington Examiner on Monday.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak. These sources charged he wanted to sabotage ICE’s months-long plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham two weeks ago, but last Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which Border Patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE carried out raids nationwide this past weekend, though reports suggested they were not of the magnitude anticipated."
Barack Obama Statue Added to South Dakota's 'City of Presidents' — and Daughter Sasha Is with Him,https://people.com,['Dave Quinn'],,,,https://people.com/politics/barack-obama-sasha-statue-south-dakota-city-of-presidents/,"Image zoom From left: Former President Barack Obama and his daughter Sasha Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty

A sweet moment of former President Barack Obama holding the hand of his daughter Sasha and waving at onlookers has been memorialized in a sculpture as part of Rapid City, South Dakota’s long-running “City of Presidents” project.

Since 2000, the western South Dakota city has been populating its streets and sidewalks with life-size bronze statues of the nation’s past commanders-in-chief — an art instillation meant to honor the legacy of the American presidency.

So far 43 former president have been added to the project, from the country’s first, George Washington, on to Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and, now, Obama.

Rapid City offers a “City of Presidents” map and interactive walking guide for the project. The pattern of placement for the presidents was chosen “to maintain a coherent structure and eliminate any sense of favoritism or political gain,” the city notes.

Each sculpture is privately funded and depicts the president in a pose specific to his personality.

Obama’s statute, which was unveiled on Saturday, was created by sculptor James Van Nuys over a two-year period.

According to CNN, Meyers was originally going to sculpt Obama, 57, standing and waving when his collaborators suggested he try something different.

“One of us said, ‘This is boring. This is not going to have the wow factor,’ ” Dallerie Davis, the group’s co-founder, told CNN. “A man waving is not a showstopper.”

RELATED: Barack Obama Gets a Street Named After Him in Los Angeles — a ‘Reminder … That No Dream Is Too Big’

The final sculpture was inspired by a photo of Obama and Sasha walking on a stage at Chicago’s Grant Park, after Obama was first elected president, Van Nuys told CNN.

Rapid City has yet to unveil the placement of the Obama statue but said on its website it will be placed by the end of the summer."

Barr condemned anti-Semitism and racism in a speech Monday at the Justice Department — comments that came a day after President Trump declared that some minority lawmakers should leave the country.

Barr, kicking off a day-long forum on combating anti-Semitism, decried “identity politics,” which he said sought to tear the fabric of American society, and he compared hatred based on religion or ethnicity to a cancer.

“A body politic must have an immune system that resists anti-Semitism and other forms of racial hatred,” said Barr. “My concern today is that under the banner of identity politics, some political factions are seeking to obtain power by dividing Americans, and they undermine the values that draw us together, such as a shared commitment to our country’s success.”

Barr’s speech fits into a broader argument made by conservatives over the years that Democrats use racial identity as a political wedge issue to demonize Republicans — but his critique could also apply to recent statements from Trump.

Over the weekend, Trump revived historically racist rhetoric when he tweeted that some Democratic members of Congress should “go back” to the countries they came from, and fix them before they try to run the U.S. government.

[Trump calls on minority congresswomen to apologize]

Trump’s remarks seemed aimed at four lawmakers who have been especially critical of him but have also fought battles over race inside their own party: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.).

Pressley was born in Cincinnati, Tlaib was born in Detroit, and Ocasio-Cortez was born in New York. Omar was born in Mogadishu, Somalia; her family fled the country amid civil war when she was a child, and she became a U.S. citizen as a teenager.

Throughout U.S. history, nativists have often used the “go back to your country” language against unpopular immigrant groups, such as Italian and Irish, as well as people of color.

Democrats denounced Trump’s comments as racist; Republicans have largely stayed silent.

Nothing in Barr’s comments were aimed directly at the president but were in keeping with broader conservative critiques of Democrats.

[Arrests in domestic terror probes outpace those inspired by Islamic extremists]

His speech focused primarily on the surge in anti-Semitism reflected in FBI hate crime data and more-localized reporting from the New York Police Department and elsewhere.

“I’m deeply concerned about the rise in hate crimes and political violence that we have seen in the last decade,” said Barr, who called anti-Semitism “the most ancient and stubborn form of racism.”

Barr said that horrific acts of violence such as the shooting last year in a Pittsburgh synagogue may capture the public’s attention, but that lesser forms of anti-Semitism often happen under the radar and need to be combated across society.

“In the United States today, we do not see state-organized violence, but increasingly we are seeing hate-inspired violence against the Jewish community orchestrated by individuals and groups,” he said. “We need to combat anti-Semitism on all fronts.”"
Communities no longer able to appeal pollution permits under forthcoming EPA rule: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453164-communities-no-longer-able-to-appeal-pollution-permits-under,"Changing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations could soon strip individuals and communities of the ability to challenge granted pollution permits while continuing to allow industry to appeal denials, The New York Times reported.

The rule the EPA is preparing to weaken would no longer allow community voices across the country to challenge decisions on how much pollution is legally allowed to be released at nearby power plants, according to the report.

Three people familiar with the draft plan, which has not yet been released, told the Times that industry stakeholders would still be allowed to appeal the EPA’s decisions to the Environmental Appeals Board.

The EPA did not confirm or deny the existence of the forthcoming rulemaking.

“EPA is always interested in improving its processes while maintaining environmental protection. Contrary to the speculation by certain parties, EPA is working to protect the public interest and transparently carry out its work,” an EPA spokesman said in a statement.

Trump preached the role his administration has played in bringing top-notch water and air protections to the U.S.

“What E.P.A. is proposing means communities and families no longer have the right to appeal a pollution permit that might affect them,” Patrice Simms, a former staff lawyer for the Environmental Appeals Board, told the Times.

Critics of the rule change say the appeals option offered communities a forum to push back on the EPA’s decisions without piling on legal fees and mounting lengthy legal cases.

Supporters of the change say it would eliminate red tape and speed up a process that ends up being decided by the courts anyway.

Democrats hammered Trump over Tubman $20 slow rollout. Obama set the timeline,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/democrats-hammered-trump-over-tubman-20-slow-rollout-obama-set-the-timeline,"Current and former Treasury officials that served in the Obama administration say the Harriet Tubman $20 bill's 2028 release date is consistent with plans and estimates crafted before President Trump took office.

Democrats accused Trump in June of delaying the release of the ""Tubman $20."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump ""refusing to honor"" Tubman is ""an insult to the hopes of millions.""

It is an insult to the hopes of millions that the Trump Administration is refusing to honor Harriet Tubman on our $20 bill. This unnecessary decision must be reversed. — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) June 20, 2019

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the White House’s reason for the late release date, to accommodate anti-counterfeiting and other safety measures, ""is simply not credible"" in a speech on the Senate floor.

There are no women or people of color on our paper currency today, and there haven’t been for more than a century. The plan to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 note was a long overdue way to rectify that disparity. https://t.co/znLBjoqweQ — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 20, 2019

The original timeline for the Tubman $20's release date was largely set under former President Barack Obama, according to the Washington Post.

Jack Lew, treasury secretary during Obama’s second term, declared in 2016 that the department would release a “final concept design” for the Tubman $20 in 2020. Officials inside the department doubted Lew’s claim based on a confidential 2013 report by the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence committee, which oversees the new designs for currency.

The committee estimated that a new $20 bill would not be fit for public circulation until around 2030. While a concept design is released earlier than the actual currency, it is usually made public a year before printing, according to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

“Those announcements were not grounded in reality. The U.S. had not at the time acquired the security features to redesign and protect the notes,” former bureau Director Larry Felix said, referring to hopes to release the Tubman $20 in 2020 alongside the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment that secured women’s right to vote.

Felix said that too much security work was left to be done on the design for it to be released so soon.

Neither a representative for Schumer nor Pelosi responded to a request for comment."

"Huawei, Still on Commerce Department Blacklist, Reportedly Planning U.S. Layoffs",https://gizmodo.com,"['Tom Mckay', 'About The Author', '... An Upperclassman Who Had Been Researching Terrorist Groups Online.', '- Washington Post']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/huawei-still-on-commerce-department-blacklist-reporte-1836359551,"Photo: Andy Wong (AP)

Chinese tech firm Huawei is planning on laying off hundreds of U.S. workers after landing on a Commerce Department blacklist that has savaged its ability to do business stateside, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.



The layoffs are expected to hit Futurewei Technologies, a Huawei research and development unit with divisions in California, Texas, and Washington state that employs roughly 850 people, per the Journal. Sources told the paper that hundreds of jobs are expected to be lost, although some Chinese nationals are “being given the option of returning home and staying with the company”:

Futurewei employees have faced restrictions communicating with colleagues in Huawei’s home offices in China following the May 16 Commerce Department decision to put Huawei on its so-called entity list, which blocked companies from supplying U.S.-sourced technology to Huawei without a license, according to these people. Several employees have already been notified of their dismissal, while additional planned cuts could be announced soon, these people said.

In May, the Trump administration added Huawei and 68 affiliates to an “entity list” that restricted transfers of U.S. technology to the company without government approval amid warnings from the intelligence community that the company, the world’s largest telecommunications gear supplier, could be acting as a proxy for Chinese espionage agencies. Other U.S. moves against Huawei have included allegations of trade theft, fraud, and violations of sanctions on Iran—all of this occurring alongside a brewing U.S.-China trade war that has resulted in economic damage to both sides. Huawei obviously denies the allegations and claims that the U.S. is resorting to unfair trade practices because it is outcompeting American firms.

While Donald Trump recently said after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, that he would relax sanctions on Huawei, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has clarified that the department would only issue licenses where “there is no threat to U.S. national security.” Huawei chairman Liang Hua recently told reporters in Shenzen, China that there has not been “any tangible change” to the situation. According to the Journal, the U.S. layoffs are in part because Futurewei’s R&D efforts “could amount to U.S.-sourced technology under Huawei’s entity listing,” and its ability to coordinate with its ownership in China has been seriously damaged.

Huawei Chairman Ren Zhengfei has also said that the company stands to lose $30 billion in revenue in 2019 and 2020 due to the restrictions, which have caused many American suppliers to sever ties and damaged the viability of its product lineup (including the cancellation of a new model of laptop and forcing it to quickly develop an alternative to Google’s official Android mobile OS). According to the Journal, Ren told a French newspaper that its own mobile OS, dubbed Hongmeng, was originally designed for use in telecom networks and “we don’t have a clear plan yet” for populating it with apps.

Opinion | All Presidents Are Deporters in Chief,https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/opinion/sunday/trump-deportations-immigration.html,"Here’s how a recent Times report described an immigrant detention facility in Clint, Tex. , that was built during the Obama administration but overfilled under Mr. Trump: “Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.”

This week , Mr. Trump announced a new series of raids by ICE in at least 10 cities, aiming to arrest thousands of people who have been issued deportation orders.

“We’re focused on criminals,” Mr. Trump sai d on Friday, dodging the truth that his administration’s hard-line policies make little to no distinction between people who pose a genuine risk and those who miss an immigration court date.

The administration, for instance, publicly warned of collateral arrests as part of the new raids, threatening to detain other unauthorized immigrants who happen to be on the scene (children or other relatives, perhaps), even if they are not the main targets of the raids.

Publicity over the raids has rattled immigrant communities, as the administration clearly intended. For Mr. Trump, deterrence of illegal immigration has been a guiding principle — if not by means of a wall, then by means of cruelty toward migrants, from the squalid conditions in detainee facilities to separating children from their parents.

“It’s the complete, 100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx, with a disregard for managing what’s happening,” a Department of Homeland Security official told The Times earlier this year. “We have a lot more families, a lot more unaccompanied children, and the focus has just been on how can we deter, rather than how can we handle.”

But deterrence alone can’t explain a slew of other moves — scaling back a program that protects the families of members of the military and veterans from being deported, for instance. It doesn’t explain the frantic — yet unsuccessful — effort to put a question about citizenship on the census, which experts agree would lead to an undercount of people in immigrant-heavy communities. Nor does deterrence explain removing deportation protections from nearly one million people who live in the country under the auspices of humanitarian programs or because they were brought to the country as children."
Devin Nunes: GOP will grill Mueller about top prosecutor's briefing with AP reporters,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-gop-will-grill-mueller-about-top-prosecutors-mystery-briefing-with-ap-reporters,"Rep. Devin Nunes said Republicans plan to grill former special counsel Robert Mueller about his top prosecutor when he testifies in an open setting later this month.

Andrew Weissmann, who was known as Mueller's ""pitbull,"" will be the subject of multiple lines of inquiry, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on an episode of the ""Hemmer Time"" podcast.

In a preview of what he and his GOP colleagues will ask on July 24, Nunes said Mueller will be pressed on why the FBI withheld from his panel that Weissmann briefed Associated Press reporters in 2017 on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation"" before the Mueller team had assembled. Nunes said the House Intelligence Committee, which was investigating Russian election interference, was never told why Weissmann was talking to these journalists.

He indicated this is significant as Weissmann was briefed on British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia, in the summer of 2016. Nunes said Weissmann ""was in the chain of custody of the major piece of evidence that started this investigation.""

The Daily Caller reported in July 2018 that documents show Weissmann arranged the April meeting with four AP reporters and other FBI officials meeting to discuss former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. In a pre-hearing trial, FBI special agent Jeffrey Pfeiffer suggested the meeting the FBI may have conducted its May 2017 raid of a storage locker bring rented by Manafort based on an AP tip.

“Associated Press journalists met with representatives from the Department of Justice in an effort to get information on stories they were reporting, as reporters do. During the course of the meeting, they asked DOJ representatives about a storage locker belonging to Paul Manafort, without sharing its name or location,"" AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton told the outlet.

Manafort is serving prison time after being found guilty of federal tax fraud, bank fraud, and foreign lobbying violations due to charges stemming from Mueller's investigation.

Calling the investigation an ""obstruction of justice trap"" that began without evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Nunes called for accountability. ""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" the California Republican said. ""I'll tell you — some of them better go to jail, or we're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

According to Michael Wolff's book Siege, Weissmann, who recently scored a book deal, led the initiative to draft a three-count obstruction of justice indictment against Trump, which Mueller's spokesman denied existed.

Mueller was originally scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees next week, but after members complained about strict limits for questioning, Democratic Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and Democratic Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California announced on Friday that a deal had been struck for a less stringent hearing to take place on July 24.

Trump disparaged Mueller and top ex-officials on Saturday, claiming that the special counsel's team engaged in ""illegal"" activity by deleting text messages exchanged between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. ""This is one of the most horrible abuses of all. Those texts between gaga lovers would have told the whole story. Illegal deletion by Mueller. They gave us 'the insurance policy,'"" Trump tweeted.

Strzok and Page were said to be involved in an affair as they sent each other text messages that displayed disdain for Trump while they were involved in the Hillary Clinton emails and Russia investigations. Strzok was fired from the FBI in August 2018 and Page resigned a couple months earlier.

Mueller’s report, released by the Justice Department with redactions in April, concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election but did not establish that any members of the Trump campaign criminally conspired with the Russians in these efforts. Mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice, but Attorney General William Barr and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was insufficient evidence for such a crime.

Barr is now engaged in investigating the origins of the Russia investigation and tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with leading the effort. That inquiry is being supplemented by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is looking into Steele and his dossier.

Steele's dossier on Trump was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

Four FISA warrant applications and renewals were filed from October 2016 through June 2017 against Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Clinton presidential campaign. Steele and Fusion GPS shopped the research around to various government figures, including one skeptical State Department official, as well as the media in the run-up to the 2016 election."
Homeland Security watchdog says conditions at border facilities haven't improved,https://www.cnn.com,['Priscilla Alvarez'],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/15/politics/department-homeland-security-ig-testimony-house-judiciary/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security inspector general reiterated Monday that it's still concerned about conditions at border facilities.

Over recent months, DHS officials warned of worsening conditions at the southern border amid a dramatic spike of apprehensions. Images included in internal watchdog reports, as well as anecdotes of migrants in standing-room only conditions, among others, brought those warnings to the forefront.

""We understand that the department is facing a difficult challenge; however, the department has not developed a long-term plan to address the issues within detention centers along the southern border,"" reads assistant IG for Special Reviews and Evaluations Diana R. Shaw's testimony , which was posted ahead of a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on detention at Customs and Border Protection facilities.

""The steps the department has taken to implement our recommendation to alleviate dangerous overcrowding continue to fall short,"" it continues.

The DHS IG also shared its concerns on Twitter Friday.

Surprise: Steven Mnuchin Doesn’t Think Trump’s Racist Tweets Are Racist,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Condé Nast', 'Bess Levin', 'Vanity Fair', 'Alison Durkee', 'Bess Levi']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/steven-mnuchin-trump-racist-tweets,"Pop-quiz: Knowing what we know about Steven Mnuchin—that he defended Trump’s praise of neo-Nazis; that he told lawmakers to just “trust” Trump when it comes to Russia; that he’s stonewalled any and all attempts by Democrats to get their hands on Trump’s tax returns; that he claimed Trump was justified in calling football players exercising their First Amendment rights “sons of bitches”; and that he generally views himself as chief presidential manservant—do you think he would publicly condemn Trump for a string of racist tweets against four freshman congresswomen? If you answered “um, is that even a question,” you’re correct!

During a press conference with reporters on Monday, the Treasury secretary was asked if Trump’s objectively racist tweets that four congresswomen of color should “go back” to the “crime infested” countries they “originally came from” were, in fact, racist. To which Mnuchin, whose own father is brought to tears at the mention of his son’s association with Trump, responded: “I don’t find them racist. The president just went on and clarified his comments. I think he speaks for himself on that, and he was very clear.” (In fact, when Trump “clarified” his comments it was to claim, falsely, that the four lawmakers—three of whom were born in the United States and all of whom are U.S. citizens—“hate our country” and that Rep. Ilhan Omar says “wonderful” things about Al-Qaeda.

Pressed again as to whether or not he personally took issue with the tweets, Mnuchin repeated that “the president clarified his comment,” adding, “I understand what the president’s comment is. I'm not concerned by the president’s comment.”

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Judges Sandra Ikuta and Jay Bybee, who ruled in the DOJ's favor, were appointees of President George W. Bush.

I had a very busy week, and I forgot.

Oh, yes, I am sure I would certainly very loudly denounce them as would my colleagues, but you see I cannot yet, because I died.

Also I don’t know what a tweet is.

Also a big bird flew through the window and scooped up my phone in its beak and dropped it into a river, so even if I was going to, you see now I cannot!

Also I am becoming a bird.

Also CAW! CAW! CAW! NO FURTHER QUESTIONS!

Also I have this condition where if anyone forces me to think hard at all about anything the president has said or done, I start to melt and then catch fire.

Seriously, my whole worldview is hanging by a very fragile thread! Please, nothing further.

Also I am invisible. You cannot see or hear me.

Also I would, but I am not a statesman any more! I spend all my time on John Boehner’s riding mower going around his lawn in slow circles with a martini! You have come to the wrong place, cowboy! I haven’t done that sort of thing for a long time!

Also I made a vow of silence unto the Lord. Oops!

Also, oh, no, I suddenly forgot how to read, so the words in front of me are all meaningless now, little squiggling black worms in milk.

Also there was a power outage somewhere in the country, so out of respect, I could not, absolutely could not, turn on my phone.

Also my phone fell out the window.

Also the Internet, I hear, fell into a lake.

Also I didn’t see you there.

I did denounce him already, surely I did! I am no coward! Did you not see it? Well, it was there! Oh, this racist remark? This new one? No, that was — never mind.

I would have denounced him, but you see, I was attending a rally to express support for his views.

I got stuck.

Out of respect for my wife, I cannot say anything positive about another woman, even a colleague.

I will denounce him, absolutely I’m going to, I swear as soon as I put on my glasses. *Throws glasses out window, steps on them*

I would, but the cat got my tongue and then the cat died STILL STUCK IN THAT POSITION!

Je ne parle pas l’anglais!

I would denounce his comments, but aren’t you the ones always saying his tweets are a scheme to distract you from the the real issues?

I would, but I agree with them.

Espaillat explains, “He’s part of a growing, young movement of artists that, first of all, I commend because they identify with the neighborhood where they live, which in this case is Harlem. Harlem is a neighborhood that is very special because Harlem is not just about the Apollo or 125th Street. It’s really about an attitude and a personality and a history and a legacy. And so, for him to be a young person and continue to identify with Harlem, and be a strong presence of the artist community in Harlem, is great. That’s why I’m going to bat for him.”

New York Times: EPA to limit ability to oppose pollution permits,https://www.cnn.com,['Devan Cole'],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/15/politics/epa-pollution-permits-regulation-changes/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency is working to change rules that allow individuals or community advocates to fight agency-issued permits that regulate how much pollution can be released by area power plants and factories, The New York Times reported.

The Times, citing conversations with three unnamed people familiar with the plans, said the potential changes could come as early as this week. According to the paper, the regulations, which were created during George H. W. Bush's administration, allowed individuals or community advocates to appeal the permits before a panel of judges within the agency. The changes would eliminate that ability but allow the permit holders to ""appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution,"" according to the paper.

The Times' report, published Friday, said the documents for the changes have ""been largely completed,"" and ""the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment,"" a period the paper said could last 60 to 90 days.

Patrice Simms, a former staff lawyer for the agency's appeals board who now works as an environmental attorney, and Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard, told the paper that the potential changes could give companies ""a broader role in influencing the EPA to issue more lenient pollution permits,"" and could be especially harmful to ""poor and minority communities, which are statistically more likely to be located near polluting sites.""

""What EPA is proposing means communities and families no longer have the right to appeal a pollution permit that might affect them,"" Simms said, according to the Times. He added that when the EPA issues pollution permits, ""they may or may not get it right,"" according to the paper.

Homeland Security case crosses paths with Asian spa investigation,https://www.krdo.com,['Stephanie Sierra'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.krdo.com/news/top-stories/homeland-security-case-crosses-paths-with-asian-spa-investigation/1094700272,"Homeland Security case crosses paths with Asian spa investigation

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. - From prostitution to human trafficking, our monthslong investigation into Asian Spas in El Paso County found us on the trail of a Korean woman who was the target of a Homeland Security investigation.

It all started at Paris Spa in Colorado Springs.

We surveilled this business when it was bustling with customers four months ago, but now it sits quiet and closed.

Do you remember this woman? Her name is Hye Kyeung Seo.

We showed her before in this surveillance clip taken back in April as she was taking a smoke break outside. We didn't know who she was at the time, let alone her connection to the spa until months later when we saw her again at the Colorado Springs Airport.

Seo was handcuffed by Homeland Security. We'll explain more about that later.

Warning: this material is graphic.

We've kept a special eye on Paris Spa given the volume and explicit nature of its reviews and ads,

clearly showing these women are expected to provide oral and vaginal sex.

The reviews prompted complaints from neighboring businesses and property owners. Then, our journey got much deeper with a tip.

It painted a very clear picture of what else could be happening behind closed doors at Paris Spa.

""She's doing... she's doing... these bad things. I don't like how she does a sexual job, you know. Like a sex manufacturer, like those kinds of job. I don't like it,"" said a source close to Paris Spa.

Those are the words of our source, who asked to remain anonymous due to her fear of retaliation from the enterprise.

But our source had enough evidence to suggest Seo would bring women from Korea to come serve as sex workers at Paris spa, receiving little money in return.

""I wish she would just stop doing this kind of job... that's it,"" she said.

But the tip wasn't just about the brothel. During this conversation with our source, she said Seo regularly money laundered upwards of $100,000 back to Korea every three months.

""I don't like what she's doing,"" she said.

So our team showed up at the Colorado Springs Airport on May 30 to speak with Seo directly.

We knew she was flying out on a 5 p.m. Frontier flight to Las Vegas. We were about to walk through the airport doors when we got a call from police to stand back and post up inside the airport by the Frontier Airlines check-in desk.

From then on, it played out just as our source said it would. Seo was traveling with her sister and nephew.

Meanwhile, our team was sending updates to police on their whereabouts.

Shortly after, Seo walked out of an elevator handcuffed by Homeland Security. We didn't realize at the time, we were in the middle of a sting by the feds.

So Stephanie followed Homeland Security as they brought Seo through the airport and into a black SUV.

We later learned after Seo's arrest that she was brought to the ICE Detention Center in Aurora, yet it's unclear what charges, if any, she will be facing before being deported back to Korea.

We do know Seo was in the U.S. illegally. We also know ICE investigates human trafficking, sex trafficking, and money laundering.

But it's unclear just how long Seo will be held here. Despite the fact that she was clearly arrested, the DOJ reports no formal charges are currently filed against her.

It made us ask the question: could she be used as an informant?

It's possible. According to Mary Laderhome, a social worker in the anti-trafficking movement.



""We know there are different nuances with this issue. Is she being forced to run this brothel? Is she herself being trafficked? We don't always know from the surface level - what an experience looks like,"" said Laderhome.

Following the bust, Paris Spa closed, but we don't know what happened to the sex workers forced to work and live inside.

""Every survivor I've met wants a better life, they want to not be exploited, they want to have access to employment, they want to live and have access to education and live just as we all do,"" Laderhome said.

We can only hope the women working at Paris Spa were properly rescued with an opportunity for a better life.

Part II

Meet Frank Polland.

He's the property manager of ""Springs Massage"" in Colorado Springs.

Our team researched and tracked down all 36 property owners, like Polland, who are leasing to spas in greater Colorado Springs.

""Very respectfully sir, I'm just pointing out as the property manager we want to hold you accountable and I think you should take another look at this establishment,"" we said.

""Oh, I'm accountable. I'm accountable,"" Polland said.

We then went on to explain the explicit nature of the reviews posted online about Springs Massage. Yet Polland denies there is any illegal activity going on.

""We don't have any illegal activities going on at this shopping center at all,"" he said to us three times.

According to RubMaps.com, a site that reviews erotic parlors, there have been 43 reviews that were made by men over the past couple of years detailing oral and vaginal sex for sale. These reviews grade the women on their physical appearance, hygiene, and even breast size.

""My question to you, are [your relatives who own the property] going to continue to look the other way and allow this kind of activity to go on?"" we asked.

""I'm the property manager, and I'll look into that,"" Polland said.

So in the meantime, I paid a visit to Springs Massage to see for myself. I asked for a woman named ""Lucy"" one of the women reviewed online.

""Is Lucy here,"" Stephanie asked.

""I don't know Lucy, I'm sorry,"" said the woman working inside Springs Massage.

""How many people work here?""

""Just me""

""How long have you worked here? Where did you come from?"" we asked

""Less than a week. I came from San Diego,"" the woman said.

Most of these women are trafficked from Asia into the U.S. through big cities on the west coast. They're forced to provide sex for extra money and deny it.

""Is sex for sale here?"" Stephanie asked.

""Who? Oh, ahh, no,"" the woman said.

There are red flags that indicate signs of a criminal enterprise. We talked with Julee Bellar, the chairman of the Human Trafficking Taskforce of Southern Colorado, who said these property owners need to be held accountable.

""They need to step up,"" said Bellar. ""If they rent to a business, they need to know what's going on in that business. And they need to be beyond sure.""

So our team wanted to reach out to every single listed property owner that's leasing to a spa in our area. We traveled all across the state knocking on doors, asking them directly if they're aware of what's going on.

Many of them didn't want to talk or slammed the door in our face. Yet, some did acknowledge they will terminate their lease at the end of their contract.

Following our coverage three spas have shut down:

Justice Dept. asks Supreme Court to lift border wall ruling,https://www.politico.com,['Josh Gerstein'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/supreme-court-trump-border-wall-1415651,"Construction of a portion of the border wall between Mexico and New Mexico in April 2018. | Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images) legal Justice Dept. asks Supreme Court to lift border wall ruling

The Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to step in to lift court orders blocking President Donald Trump from proceeding with his plan to spend billions of dollars on border wall construction despite Congress’ efforts to limit that spending.

Administration lawyers filed a stay application Friday afternoon seeking to lift an Oakland-based federal judge’s order blocking border wall projects in California, Arizona and New Mexico.

Story Continued Below

Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the high court that the injunction is impairing federal officials’ ability to cut drug trafficking across the border with Mexico.

“The harm to the government and the public from enjoining DOD’s use of the transferred funds during litigation is significant. The injunction frustrates the government’s ability to stop the flow of drugs across the border in known drug-smuggling corridors,” Francisco wrote.

Justice Elena Kagan gave the environmental and border groups that obtained the injunction until next Friday to respond to the request.

The current injunction puts on hold about $2.5 billion Trump’s plan sought to spend through a provision allowing available Defense Department construction funds to be spent on unforeseen needs.

However, the language Congress passed adding that flexibility says that authority can’t be used for budget items previously denied by lawmakers. Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border wall work in the current budget, and nothing for the specific projects covered by the injunction, but Trump aides devised a plan to spend more than $8 billion on the broad effort.

Trump’s move in May, which included efforts to open up funding by declaring a state of emergency, immediately drew a series of lawsuits from environmentalists, border residents, states and the House of Representatives. The suits argue Trump is acting illegally by spending funds without the approval of Congress, which must approve all appropriations under the Constitution.

Last week, a federal appeals court panel voted, 2-1, to deny the Justice Department’s stay request.

“The Constitution assigns to Congress the power of the purse. Under the Appropriations Clause, it is Congress that is to make decisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars,” 9th Circuit Judges Richard Clifton and Michelle Friedland wrote. “Congress did not appropriate money to build the border barriers Defendants seek to build here. Congress presumably decided such construction at this time was not in the public interest. It is not for us to reach a different conclusion.”

The appeals judges were unsparing about some of the Trump administration’s arguments. Clifton and Friedland deemed “not credible” the Justice Department’s contention that Congress had not denied the administration the funds it was seeking to spend.

The groups that obtained the injunction, the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said they’ll urge the justices not to lift the order.

“The courts have twice ruled against Trump’s requests to stay this important court order stopping construction of his ruinous wall. Now he is asking the Supreme Court to step in and save his wall, but we will continue to vehemently fight these tactics,” Sierra Club attorney Gloria Smith said.

The Justice Department filing with the high court asks the justices to rule on the application by July 26 to allow the funding process to be completed by September 30. Previous filings from the administration said that process needed to begin by early July to be carried out while the funds are still available.

However, administration lawyers also told the Supreme Court on Friday they’ve discovered a mechanism that might allow that process to be compressed, permitting officials to formally obligate funds for the border projects closer to the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30."

E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"
Former DHS chief warns immigrants not to open doors for ICE without a warrant,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeh-johnson-on-face-the-nation-former-dhs-chief-warns-immigrants-not-to-open-doors-for-ice-without-a-warrant/,"Jeh Johnson, who led the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during President Obama's second term, advised undocumented immigrants they are not required to open the doors of their homes to immigration authorities unless agents produce a warrant signed by a judge.

""If someone from ICE ERO comes to someone's home — unless they have a warrant — that person is not required to admit them,"" Johnson said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, referring to the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) which is responsible for apprehending people the government seeks to deport.

ICE was slated to begin a new wave of roundups on Sunday targeting about 2,000 undocumented families with open deportation orders living in major U.S. cities. The operations were first publicly announced last month by President Trump, who postponed them for a few weeks.

To prepare for the raids — which have left many undocumented immigrants living in constant fear — advocacy groups and Democrats have mobilized to mount a high-profile campaign designed to inform people who could be targeted about their rights and other information, one of them being Johnson's advice.

Pro-immigrant organizations want to make sure people are not opening their doors to ICE agents who do not have a search and seizure warrant signed by a judge. When conducting roundups, ICE agents often produce an administration warrant — but attorneys say that by itself does not give them the right to enter private property to apprehend someone.

Johnson also noted that just because someone is apprehended, that does not mean the person is automatically deported without access to any legal recourse.

""They have a right to a lawyer and they should not be deported from this country unless there has been a final order of deportation by an immigration judge after the individuals had an opportunity to go through the appellate process and make whatever claims for asylum they have,"" he said.

In fact, he suggested that some of deportations of those who are apprehended by ICE during the looming sweeps will be delayed or stopped as attorneys file motions to reopen their cases in immigration court. He noted that judges often grant new hearings for those who were ordered deported without being present in the courtroom. Attorneys have said that many people miss court because of bureaucratic errors, like their notices to appear being sent late or to the wrong address.

""Very often if someone's ordered deported in absentia without being present in court they have a right to a rehearing,"" Johnson said. ""And so it's important for people particularly today and over the next week to know exactly what their rights are.""

Like Obama, when Johnson was at the helm of DHS, he came under fire from progressive and pro-immigrant activists for the millions of deportations during their administration, as well as for his handling of the 2014 surge of unaccompanied migrant children from Central America coming to the U.S.-Mexico border. He and other Obama-era officials have noted that many of those deported during those years had criminal convictions and were migrants who had recently crossed into the U.S. illegally."

The panel of judges asked the Justice Department to file a brief in the case by Aug. 6, and for each party to respond to that filing by Aug. 20.

The judges, who heard oral arguments in the case on Friday, had asked Trump’s personal attorney William Consovoy at the time why the DOJ wasn’t involved in the case.

They pointed to previous lawsuits that targeted the president in a personal capacity where the DOJ had gotten involved.

“If the arguments here are really about the office of the presidency, why is the Department of Justice not participating?” D.C. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, asked.

Consovoy told the judges that he did not know why the DOJ wasn't involved in the case, but stated that, because the subpoena had targeted Trump’s private records, it made sense for the president’s personal lawyers to be involved.

If the DOJ does file a brief, administration lawyers will go on the record as to whether they believe lawmakers have the authority to obtain Trump’s private financial documents.

The deadlines in Monday’s order also suggest that a ruling won’t be made in the case before the end of August.

Updated at 1:09 p.m. ET

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.
