Opinion | Killing the Pax Americana,https://www.nytimes.com,['Paul Krugman'],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/opinion/killing-the-pax-americana.html,"O.K., they weren’t supposed to start the trade war until I got back from vacation. And I really have too many kilometers to cover and hills to climb to weigh in on a regular basis or at great length. But since I’m currently sitting in an outdoor cafe with my coffee and croissant, I thought I might take a few minutes to address two misconceptions that, I believe, are coloring discussion of the trade conflict.

By the way, I don’t mean Trump’s misconceptions. As far as I can tell, he isn’t getting a single thing about trade policy right. He doesn’t know how tariffs work, or who pays them. He doesn’t understand what bilateral trade imbalances mean, or what causes them. He has a zero-sum view of trade that flies in the face of everything we’ve learned over the past two centuries. And to the (small) extent that he is making any coherent demands on China, they’re demands China can’t/won’t meet.

But Trump’s critics, while vastly more accurate than he is, also, I think, get a few things wrong, or at least overstate some risks while understating others. On one side, the short-run costs of trade war tend to be overstated. On the other, the long-term consequences of what’s happening are bigger than most people seem to realize.

In the short run, a tariff is a tax. Period. The macroeconomic consequences of a tariff should therefore be seen as comparable to the macroeconomic consequences of any tax increase. True, this tax increase is more regressive than, say, a tax on high incomes, or a wealth tax. This means that it falls on people who will be forced to cut their spending, and is therefore likely to have a bigger negative bang per buck than the positive bang for buck from the 2017 tax cut. But we’re still talking, at least so far, about a tax hike that is only a fraction of a percent of GDP."
Florida takes shape as Joe Biden’s firewall,https://www.politico.com,"['Marc Caputo', 'Andrew Restuccia', 'Daniel Lippman', 'Eliana Johnson', 'Darren Samuelsohn']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/11/joe-biden-florida-1317604,"Joe Biden's ties to Florida Democrats have helped him blitz past his fellow 2020 hopefuls. | Chris O'Meara/AP Photo 2020 Elections Florida takes shape as Joe Biden’s firewall The former vice president is crushing the Democratic field in the nation’s third-largest state.

MIAMI — Florida, with its hordes of older voters and establishment-oriented Democratic Party, doesn’t just look like Biden Country. Judging from the initial reaction to his presidential bid in the nation’s third-largest state, it’s shaping up to be his firewall.

Joe Biden is crushing the Democratic field here, including Bernie Sanders, in the latest polling. More than one-third of Democratic state legislators endorsed him almost as soon as he announced his candidacy, a testament to state political ties that stretch back decades and span generations.

Story Continued Below

“Biden is in a class all on his own in Florida,” said pollster Ryan Tyson, who just completed a survey of Florida Democrats.

In prior Democratic presidential primaries, Florida didn’t matter nearly as much to the outcome as it figures to next year. The crowded 2020 field increases the likelihood of a drawn-out primary season that remains unsettled when the state votes in mid-March.

By then, the roster of 21 candidates will be considerably winnowed. And the remaining campaigns could be drained of resources since Florida’s March 17 primary comes two weeks after Super Tuesday — which will include California this time.

If Biden can generate momentum in the early-voting states and remain popular in Florida -- which, with 10 major media markets, can be wildly expensive to advertise in — rival campaigns will have to make some hard decisions about the value of competing hard here.

Pollster Fernand Amandi, who surveyed the Florida primary in March , said that as long as Biden wins at least two of the first early states and holds his own in the other preceding states, Florida is poised to give him an outsized advantage.

“In that scenario Florida becomes the state where Biden clinches the nomination or where the anti-Biden candidate can really make a statement,” said Amandi, who worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 primary campaign in Florida and President Obama’s general election campaigns in 2008 and 2012. “If Biden can win Florida, he becomes the presumptive nominee. Not only is Joe Biden the frontrunner in Florida. This is his to lose. Could he still lose it? Yes. But this will be a nomination he loses, not one that’s taken away from him.”

According to the new poll of 800 primary voters from Tyson’s firm, Tel Opinion Research , Biden leads Sanders by more than 2-to-1: 39 percent to 16 percent. Everyone else is in the low single digits.

Fueling Biden’s dominance: Biden is popular with older white voters, who tend to form the bulk of the state primary electorate. And he is running well among African-Americans, who could comprise about a quarter of the primary electorate — they back Biden with 46 percent of the vote.

Last year, Biden was one of the most sought-after endorsers for Democrats in the state, and he backed 15 candidates across the ballot, from a major mayoral race in St. Petersburg to the national watched contest for Florida governor.

""Vice President Biden no doubt holds a starting line advantage in Florida because we know him — that's why I was thrilled to have him campaign for me,” said 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum. “But it's early and I'm sure he knows he's going to have to earn this nomination — with his policy ideas, his story, and by convincing Floridians he's best equipped to lead us out of the darkness of Donald Trump's presidency.""

One of Gillum’s closest allies, state Rep. Shevrin Jones, said he’s backing Biden because the former vice president is a “battle-tested leader ... who can speak to every demographic and stand toe to toe” with Trump.

An African-American lawmaker, Jones said black voters he knows “equate him” with President Obama.

In the just-completed Tel Opinion Research survey, Tyson noted in an analysis that “Biden is demonstrating real strength with African-American voters,” with 85 percent holding a favorable view of him and only 7 percent having an unfavorable view.

“These strong image numbers are also translating to the open-ended ballot as he is pulling 46% of African-Americans in this sample,” Tyson wrote, pointing out that the two African-American senators in the race are barely registering with black voters. “What’s even more remarkable is Biden is pulling half of the African-American electorate even though Kamala Harris & Cory Booker both have 80% total name ID with this critical demographic.”

Among all Florida Democratic voters, Biden has an 81 percent favorability rating in the poll, with 50 percent holding a “very favorable” opinion — a sign of deep support. In contrast, Sanders has a 68 percent favorability rating, with 32 percent viewing him very favorably.

The numbers from Tyson, a Tallahassee-based Republican, are in line with what top Democrats are seeing on the ground and in their own private polling.

“Ryan Tyson does good polls, but I don’t need one of his polls to tell me Biden is dominating in Florida,” laughed one top Democrat who spoke anonymously because he’s officially neutral in the race and is involved with voter-registration and turnout efforts on behalf of other Democrats.

Robbie Mook, manager of Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, acknowledged Biden’s advantage but said there is a lot of time until the state’s March primary.

""It’s Biden’s to lose today but with 10 months left, any poll is worth about as much as a fortune cookie,” said Mook. “A former vice president is leading by a big margin in a big state ten months before Super Tuesday. It is neither surprising nor predictive of what will happen, just ask Rudy Giuliani,” who tried to make Florida his firewall in 2008 and didn’t win one contest in the GOP primary that year."
"Trump Has a Strong Economy to Proclaim. In Wisconsin, It Just Might Work.",https://www.nytimes.com,['Jeremy W. Peters'],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/us/politics/trump-economy-2020-wisconsin.html,"COLFAX, Wis. — President Trump came to Wisconsin late last month to boast about the state’s unemployment rate, which has been at or near 3 percent for more than a year. “It’s never been this low before. Ever, ever, ever,” he said. (Fact check: true.)

It’s a message that strikes a chord with Bubba Benson, who lives paycheck to paycheck but says that is still better than where he was a few years ago after getting laid off from a shoe warehouse “when all the jobs went to Mexico.” His new job at a plastics manufacturing plant covers the bills and pays good overtime. There are even a few extra bucks in his paycheck now, which he credits to Mr. Trump’s tax cut.

“It didn’t let me go out and buy a new house,” Mr. Benson said as he leaned on the bar at the Outhouse, a watering hole on Main Street in this village of about 1,100 people. “But that wasn’t what it was for.”

As 21 candidates compete to become the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2020, Mr. Trump is running on the strongest economy of any president seeking re-election since Bill Clinton in 1996, and arguably since Richard M. Nixon in 1972. Job creation is strong and last month the unemployment rate dipped to its lowest point in half a century, 3.6 percent."
Trump asked Don McGahn to publicly state he didn’t obstruct justice. McGahn refused.,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/11/18581249/donald-trump-don-mcgahn-obstruction-justice-statement,"Don McGahn, a former White House counsel named in the Mueller report’s section on potential obstruction of justice by the Trump administration, rejected a request from President Trump to publicly declare that he doesn’t believe Trump obstructed justice.

McGahn, who left the Trump White House in 2018, provided Robert Mueller’s team with 30 hours of testimony over the course of the special counsel’s investigation into links between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign and potential obstruction of justice by the Trump administration.

As Vox’s Aaron Rupar explained, McGahn told Mueller the president asked him to fire the special counsel, something McGahn refused to do:

McGahn told Mueller that in June 2017 — one month after Mueller’s appointment — the president reacted to reports that Mueller was investigating him for obstruction of justice by calling him at home and “direct[ing] him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflict of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.” In January 2018, the New York Times reported that Trump ordered McGahn to have the Justice Department fire Mueller the previous June. According to what McGahn told Mueller, Trump reacted to the report by asking McGahn to fabricate evidence that could be used to refute it. “The President then directed [then-White House official Rob] Porter to tell McGahn to create a record to make clear that the President never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel,” the report says. “McGahn shrugged off the request, explaining that the media reports were true.”

This incident was further investigated by Mueller, and was eventually included in his report as one of 10 times Trump may have obstructed justice.

Following the release of the Mueller report last month, the president wanted McGahn to publicly state that he did not consider the request to remove Mueller from the Russia investigation obstruction of justice, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal report.

McGahn refused to do so.

“We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister,” William Burck, McGahn’s personal attorney, said. “It was a request, professionally and cordially made.”

Sources told the Journal McGahn had several reasons for deciding not to make the statement.

First, he felt he had said everything he needed to say on the matter in his testimony to Mueller. Second, he didn’t want to further comment on that testimony, particularly in a brief way. Third, he felt any comment he could have made had already been rendered meaningless by Attorney General William Barr’s decision that the “evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”

McGahn is a central figure in a subpoena fight between the Trump and Democrats

One Trump administration request McGahn has honored was refusing to comply with a House Judiciary Committee subpoena last week. The committee wants McGahn to turn over documents from his time as White House counsel.

The White House does not want these documents released to the committee, or anyone else, and Pat Cipollone, the current White House counsel, said that any documents in McGahn’s possession are protected by President Trump’s executive privilege.

New York’s Rep. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the committee, disagreed with this assessment, and threatened to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress. The House Judiciary Committee has already voted to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt.

“Mr. McGahn is required to appear and provide testimony before the committee absent a court order authorizing noncompliance, as well as provide a privilege log for any documents withheld,” Nadler said Tuesday. “Otherwise, the committee will have no choice but to resort to contempt proceedings to ensure that it has access to the information it requires to fulfill its constitutionally mandated duties.”

McGahn was expected to testify before Congress on May 21, but it is not clear if his hearing will go on as planned.

President Trump has dismissed Congressional investigations into his administration as politically driven and has instructed his subordinates to ignore subpoenas on more than 30 separate occasions.

“There is no reason to go any further,” Trump told the Washington Post. “Especially in Congress where it’s very partisan.”"
Washington is flirting with a debt crisis. No one has a plan to stop it,https://www.cnn.com,"['Haley Byrd', 'Phil Mattingly']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/11/politics/congress-debt-ceiling/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The US government is hurtling toward a potential financial crisis , and no one in Washington seems to know how to stop it.

As lawmakers trade fire over contempt votes and impeachment, there's been no progress toward reaching a budget agreement or extending the federal government's ability to borrow before September, when the money runs out . That's raising the ugly prospect of more than $100 billion in mandatory cuts as well as an unprecedented default on US debt -- a situation that could trigger a worldwide economic catastrophe.

It's a mess everyone knows is coming, and yet no one seems to have a plan -- at least at the moment -- for averting disaster.

""It's one of those cartoonish anvil-over-head moments,"" one senior GOP congressional aide told CNN. ""We all look around knowingly like 'Man, we're about to get crushed by this,' but nobody's really sure how to get out from underneath it right now.""

Even the battle lines aren't totally clear at this point. There's brewing frustration between President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, as well as questions about what House Democrats will agree to.

The fight over disaster relief

The latest sign of the dysfunction gripping Congress came this week, when Republicans and Democrats continued to flounder in months-long negotiations over disaster aid for states recently hit by hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires, typically a subject that can easily win bipartisan consensus but has instead repeatedly fallen apart over unrelated issues.

""If we can't do this, what the heck can we do on something much bigger?"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby asked after a phone call with White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney . ""I hope this is not a preview of coming events.""

The Alabama Republican said he told Mulvaney that the inability to pass the aid bill was not a good sign for the tougher negotiations ahead.

""This is the longest I remember I've ever seen something this important not be resolved,"" Shelby added. ""But I said, 'This is small — very important, but small — compared to what we're going to have to face if we don't get some direction.'""

The US government has careened from one fiscal and spending crisis to another for nearly a decade. But as last winter's record-breaking shutdown demonstrated, the wild card now is Trump, whose unpredictable negotiating style has at times left Congress flailing. The President has clashed with Democrats for months over including funding for Puerto Rico in the disaster bill, and his administration has further strained talks with attempts to include Trump's requested $4.5 billion for border security, a move vehemently opposed by Democrats.

Shelby pointed to the $100 billion in automatic spending cuts that will be triggered come October if Congress can't reach a deal to raise budget caps for discretionary spending -- that is, almost everything outside of Social Security and Medicare.

Congress reached a two-year deal to raise the caps in 2017. If lawmakers don't approve another hike, the budget will have to fall back down to 2011 levels.

Deadlines can drive dealmaking

Lawmakers -- and specifically the top Appropriations members in both chambers -- have wriggled out of impossible negotiations before, generally managing to pull proverbial rabbits out of their hats at the last moment. And, despite the winter shutdown, the 2018 budget process was the most successful in decades, with more than 75 percent of the government funded through a regular process before the end of the fiscal year.

Unlike the disaster aid package, the spending and debt ceiling negotiations come with a hard deadline -- and hard consequences for failing to meet it. For Republicans, it would mean dramatic cuts to defense programs, a central GOP priority. Democrats would have to accept equally painful cuts to domestic programs, which have long been their top priority in talks.

Deadlines, said several aides and lawmakers who talked to CNN for the story, have a way of sharpening the urgency for negotiators on all sides, and a default on US debt is generally considered something members of both parties would prefer to avoid.

But Shelby is worried his colleagues — and the White House — aren't paying enough attention to the dangers ahead.

One problem: Trump may not realize how damaging a budget crisis and default would be.

Shelby, who raised the issue at Republicans' regular policy lunch this week, said he and his staff are working on a document with the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget that lays out the effects plainly for all to see. He told CNN once it is finished, he plans to bring it to Trump directly to underscore the stakes.

""I told our caucus yesterday that this will be draconian. They probably haven't thought about it much because they think we'll take care of it,"" Shelby told CNN earlier this week.

But he acknowledged that time is working against everyone.

""Here it is June coming up, and wow, we've got some mountains to climb,"" he said.

The three-legged stool

The talks are playing out in the wake of Trump's tax reform, which increased the deficit. The President -- who long ago proclaimed himself ""the King of Debt"" -- has nevertheless promised to raise defense spending, and White House officials have actively sought ways to increase the military budget without Congress, drawing objections from Democrats.

In recent months the White House has toyed with letting the automatic budget cuts take effect in the name of fiscal restraint. It was an idea openly broached by White House representatives at meeting of senior GOP staffers earlier this year, two people familiar with the conversation told CNN. They mentioned other ways to secure money to make up for the defense cuts — none of which were considered plausible by staff in attendance, the people said.

Mulvaney has also made clear in conversations with congressional Republicans that he objects to removing caps on domestic spending, according to multiple senators and GOP aides -- though Democrats who control the House have made clear that is a non-starter.

Congressional leaders have attempted to jump start discussion. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, announced publicly last month the creation of a bipartisan staff-level working group to formulate a two-year budget deal and expressed optimism an agreement could be reached. It was an idea that came in the wake of a previously unreported meeting between Trump, McConnell and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy -- one that reflected significant unease across the GOP conference about the looming automatic defense cuts, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The staff-level group, which is made up of the policy directors of the four top leaders on Capitol Hill, has met twice, but it's unclear how much progress has been made.

Democrats, burned by the shutdown, have called for negotiations to stay on the Hill.

""I think that the only way we'll get a budget is the way we've gotten one the last two years, if the President stays out of it,"" Schumer told CNN. ""I think if you talk to my Republican colleagues, and they told you what they're telling us, they'd tell you the same thing.""

But Shelby, who has clashed with Mulvaney in past negotiations and has a close and effective working relationship with his Democratic Appropriations counterpart Sen. Patrick Leahy, made clear the White House has to stay involved. Shelby's efforts to brief and keep Trump in the loop were considered a key reason the President finally agreed to end the shutdown fight.

""We've got a three-legged stool,"" Shelby said. ""Democrat House. Republican White House and president. Republican Senate. We've gotta have all those to hold up the stool.""

Lawmakers have until September to keep the government open and head off a repeat of this past winter's meltdown. That partial shutdown left about 800,000 federal employees unpaid over the holidays, as well as an unknown number of government contractors who did not receive back pay. The shutdown, which originated with a fight over funding for a border wall, ended after staffing issues with air traffic controllers caused flight delays in New York and around the country's major airports, creating political blowback for the President.

Extraordinary measures are only a temporary fix

Less discussion seems to be going on around the debt issue. Since the first World War, Congress has tried to limit federal borrowing, and has routinely raised the borrowing limit as the US government debt has grown. The debt limit was suspended in 2015, after Republicans danced with default amid a fight with the Obama administration.

The limits went back into effect in March, but the US government has been able to use so-called ""extraordinary measures"" to keep paying its bills. Those measures are expected to run out in early fall.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has called for lawmakers to raise the debt limit as soon as possible, but lawmakers have so far been unwilling to give up leverage over hot-button issues like immigration -- though top Democrats have also indicated they're unwilling to risk US creditworthiness.

""America is not going to welch on its debts and what it owes. So I think we ought not to use that as a political issue,"" House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer said Wednesday. ""But, and this is a big but, we need to avoid a crisis of shutting down the government as happened under the Republican leadership in the last Congress, which bled over to this Congress. As a result, I am urging that we do both in a bipartisan, constructive way.""

Asked whether that meant he wanted to deal with the debt limit alongside appropriations legislation, Hoyer said he was open to any approach that would get a deal done.

Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, said Shelby's warning should serve as a wakeup call for both chambers.

""Senator Shelby is telling everybody in this chamber what they need to know, that we need to get out of partisan gamesmanship and get focused on governing the country: moving Approps bills, taking care of the debt ceiling,"" he said.

""Both sides seem to think they can leverage these things into something, and I don't think you can,"" Cole added. ""Every time you do, you end up in a government shutdown."""
"Dems fume as Trump moves to amend DC's July 4 celebration, possibly address the nation",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Lukas Mikelionis', 'Muriel Bowser', 'Mayor Of Washington', 'Lukas Mikelionis Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-fume-as-trump-moves-to-amend-july-4-celebrations-address-the-nation,"President Trump has apparently taken charge of this year’s Fourth of July celebration in Washington, D.C., and will possibly give a personal address, angering some Democrats who fear the president will politicize the holiday.

City officials in the nation's capital were notified of Trump’s plan to address the nation on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and move the traditional fireworks display from the Capitol Reflecting Pool to the nearby West Potomac Park, the Washington Post reported.

JOHN STOSSEL: THE FOURTH OF JULY IS NOT ABOUT BARBECUES, FIREWORKS OR EVEN PATRIOTISM. IT'S ABOUT THIS…

But the plans, which the administration says will allow more people to attend, have raised logistical concerns among officials as they make preparations for the holiday, which is fast approaching.

“We have a lot of people come to the Fourth of July. Logistically, over the years, the kinks have been worked out,” Mayor Muriel Bowser told the Post. “We don’t want to throw off what already works.”

“We have a lot of people come to the Fourth of July. Logistically, over the years, the kinks have been worked out. We don’t want to throw off what already works.” — Muriel Bowser, mayor of Washington, D.C.

The move to amend the July 4 celebrations in Washington comes after Trump floated the possibility of holding a military parade, an idea he got when he attended Bastille Day celebrations in France.

But the military parade idea was dropped after senior White House and Pentagon leaders estimated it would cost $92 million.

“When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up!” Trump tweeted.

TRUMP MILITARY PARADE PLANS UNRAVEL OVER COSTS

Trump’s plans are being criticized not only for imposing a burden on the city logistically, but also for political reasons.

Rep. Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat who chairs the House Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, told the newspaper that Trump’s address would undermine the spirit of the celebration.

“It’s not about any one president. It’s about how our nation came to be, because of a hardy band of brave men and women,” she said.

House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns,https://www.npr.org,['Kelsey Snell'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721876476/house-democrats-subpoena-trump-tax-returns,"House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns

Updated at 7:56 p.m. ET

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the — 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""
Secretary Pompeo to Meet With Putin as President Trump Seeks Better Russia Ties -- Again,http://time.com,"['Nick Wadhams', 'Ilya Arkhipov']",,,,http://time.com/5587644/pompeo-putin-trump-russia/,"U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo leaves for Moscow on Sunday, with President Donald Trump again calling for improved ties now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finished his investigation.

Pompeo will meet U.S. diplomats at the American Embassy in Moscow on Monday before continuing to Sochi for talks with President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials. The secretary has 48 hours — the entire length of the trip — to cram in discussions of disputes between the two nations, involving Ukraine, Venezuela and Syria and other issues, along with continued accusations of election interference.

With the Mueller inquiry wrapped up, Trump has returned to signaling his interest in improving U.S.-Russia ties, speaking with Putin for more than an hour last week and tweeting that there is “tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia.” The two leaders had kept their distance as Mueller’s probe into the 2016 U.S. election and allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia heated up.

“Clearly since the Mueller report came out, Trump is feeling unconstrained about what he’s wanted all along — a new relationship with Moscow where all the bad issues get swept aside and the two leaders ‘get down to business,”’ said Andrew Weiss, the former director for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs on the National Security Council who’s now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“What that means in practice is really fuzzy because the agenda largely consists of issues where the U.S. and Russia are at loggerheads,” Weiss said.

Trump spoke with Putin briefly on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Argentina in December. That meeting rekindled criticism of their summit last July in Helsinki, where the American president appeared to take Putin’s side over the conclusions of his own intelligence agencies when asked about evidence Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

Pompeo could use his trip to start laying the groundwork for a meeting between Trump and Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 forum in Japan set for late June. Such an encounter would still be fraught, especially since Trump has appeared reluctant to confront Putin on the meddling accusations, which the Mueller report reaffirmed.

“The Mueller report confirmed accusations of Russian meddling,” said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a Kremlin-founded think tank. “The report to some extent rehabilitates Trump but doesn’t rehabilitate Moscow at all. For Russia, nothing has really changed.”

A senior State Department official, speaking to reporters on Friday, said Pompeo would raise a range of topics, including continuing concerns about Russian election meddling, Moscow’s role in propping up Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the American desire for more sweeping arms control agreements that include countries like China, not just Russia and the U.S.

The official argued that U.S. policy is to seek a better relationship with Moscow while also acknowledging that Russia has been responsible for several acts of aggression on the world stage.

One challenge, as it’s been throughout Trump’s presidency, is that while he may want better ties with Russia, relations between the two countries have seldom been worse and show little prospect of improving.

Besides contesting support for Maduro, there is the issue of the U.S. withdrawal from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in February. The administration is also angry at Russia over its detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors in the Sea of Azov last November and the poisoning of a former spy in the U.K. last year. In addition, American businessman Michael Calvey remains under house arrest in Moscow over allegations of fraud, a charge he rejects.

The president’s latest tweet on Russia also highlighted the dissonant tone the Trump administration has struck toward the country. While Pompeo blamed Russia for Maduro’s refusal to leave power despite pressure from the U.S., Trump said after his call with Putin that the Russian leader wasn’t looking to “get involved” in the crisis in Venezuela.

Trump’s calls will find a receptive audience. After the Mueller report came out, Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachyov urged the president to “take the risk” and seize the opportunity to reset relations.

“Putin has always bet personally on Trump, with whom he has a way of bonding to the point of manipulation,” said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat and foreign policy analyst in Moscow. “Putin knows Trump likes him, while his administration does not. In Trump he trusts.”

US DoJ Charges Group of Individuals Who Stole $2.5 Mln in Crypto Via SIM Swapping,https://cointelegraph.com,['Ana Berman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-charges-group-of-individuals-who-stole-25-mln-in-crypto-via-sim-swapping,"The United States Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment on May 9 that charges a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider and his colleague from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Angie Salazar announced the charges in the Eastern District of Michigan. Per Salazar, the investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations on two continents.

According to the indictment, five Americans and an Irishman are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Another three, who reportedly are the former employees of mobile phone providers, are charged in a criminal complaint with the wire fraud related to “The Community.”

As described in the document, the hacking group used SIM swapping — a type of identity theft attack that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication. The perpetrator usually gains control of a target's mobile phone by convincing or bribing the employee of the mobile provider to swap the phone number to a SIM card controlled by the hackers.

After successfully swapping the numbers of their victims, “The Community” managed to gain access to their various online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets. As a result of fraud, approximately $2.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to wallets controlled by the hacking group. Attorney Schneider clarified that in this case, three mobile phone service provider employees purportedly helped swappers to steal money.

The charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison each. Meanwhile, a conviction of aggravated identity theft could add up to two years in prison for the defendants .

According to Irish news website The Journal, a 20-year-old man from Dublin was arrested in Ireland upon the request of the U.S. authorities and is currently awaiting extradition.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in November 2018, a law enforcement group dedicated to fighting cybercrime released a report on SIM swapping, stating that it had become increasingly popular in California.

Meanwhile, in January, a 21-year old American was accused of stealing almost $24 million in crypto via SIM swapping. And in February, a New York resident was indicted in what constituted the jurisdiction’s first SIM-swapping prosecution."

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as “preliminary,” after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat — these findings and conclusions are “preliminary” and have “not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.”

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: “The findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.”

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a “welcome” change.

“The previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‘preliminary’ would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,” Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. “It is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.”

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: “Many journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.”

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that “removing ‘preliminary’ from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.”

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have “agency-specific policies” that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department’s internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several “flags” that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of “prominent issues,” include “significant” scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request “corrections” and “changes,” if the scientific publication falls under the category of “prominent issues” or policy implications.

“It is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,” Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal “stakeholders” request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return “the REVISED PUBLICATION” for “ACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,” the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA’s scientific integrity rules and “helps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.”

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review “into a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.” Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, “just about any output” from that agency could be flagged, she said.

USDA’s “interests apparently concern consistency with prevailing policy,” Offutt said, “not the public’s access to the best, unbiased science and analysis.”

Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves,https://www.politico.com,['Zack Colman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/10/epa-air-chief-3238271,"The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues. ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves

A secretive utility industry coalition formerly represented by a top official at the Environmental Protection Agency is dissolving amid investigations into whether its members received special treatment from the Trump administration.

The Utility Air Regulatory Group has been under scrutiny from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was seeking information on the relationship between power companies, EPA air chief Bill Wehrum and the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, which represented the group.

Story Continued Below

UARG has frequently argued against tighter air pollution and climate regulations; Wehrum is undoing many of the policies at EPA that the group targeted when he represented it at Hunton.

The group released a statement Friday saying its ""membership has decided to disband the organization following a wind down period."" The statement said a committee would be formed to handle ""the completion/fulfillment of UARG's existing obligations and support of members as they continue to cooperate with the Congressional inquiry.""

In a separate statement, Hunton said it was ""proud to have been part of"" UARG's efforts to shape federal air pollution rules through public comments and other participation in the regulatory process.

Wehrum represented UARG until 2017, when he was nominated by President Donald Trump to be EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, a position that has allowed him to oversee many of his former clients' top regulatory priorities.

Membership in UARG was first reported by POLITICO, which obtained internal organization documents showing Hunton billed power companies $8.2 million in dues for 2017. Several utilities had already fled the organization before it was terminated Friday.

The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues.

Wehrum he has stayed in frequent contact with former colleagues at Hunton and other companies affiliated with the group. But he said he did not violate his ethics agreement, as he recused himself for dealing with “particular matters” related to UARG.

The House committee is investigating how power companies paid for UARG dues and whether the group's members had undue influence over EPA policy. Consumer advocates allege utility customers often foot the bill, which some power companies have confirmed; American Electric Power told Inside EPA that ratepayers financed membership.

Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), as well as Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), welcomed the group's dissolution, but said it wouldn't affect their investigation.

""Important questions remain about whether EPA officials William Wehrum and David Harlow continue to advance their former coal industry clients’ agenda at EPA, and we intend to see those questions through,” the three lawmakers said in a statement Friday evening.

UARG had existed since the 1970s but became aggressively litigious during the Obama administration.

One of its major achievements was a 2014 Supreme Court ruling, UARG v. EPA, in which Justice Antonin Scalia scolded EPA for seeking an “enormous and transformative expansion” of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

UARG challenged many other major EPA regulations from the Obama era, including carbon rules for existing and future coal plants, a mercury rule for coal plants, the updated ozone standard, haze cleanup plans and safety rules for industrial chemical facilities. Most of those lawsuits hadn't been settled before the Trump administration took power. EPA is now revising or repealing most of those rules.

And UARG is helping defend EPA in at least six ongoing lawsuits, including over several changes to air permitting policies and the agency's rejection of pollution complaints from downwind states.

It is unclear how UARG’s dissolution will affect those cases.

U.S. says Huawei lawyer's prior work at Justice Department poses conflicts,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-huawei-tech/us-says-huawei-lawyers-prior-work-at-justice-department-poses-conflicts-idUSKCN1SG2GU,"(Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd lawyer James Cole’s prior work at the U.S. Department of Justice created conflicts of interest that should disqualify him from defending the Chinese company in a case of alleged bank fraud and sanctions violations, U.S. prosecutors said in a filing on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign board of Huawei at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) Asia 2018 in Shanghai, China June 14, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo

Last week, the prosecutors filed a motion to disqualify Cole, who served as deputy attorney general, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, between 2011 and 2015. But the motion was sealed and classified, and prosecutors did not make public the reasons behind the move.

“There is a ‘substantial risk’ that Cole could use ‘confidential factual information’ obtained while serving as DAG to ‘materially advance’ Huawei’s current defense strategy,” the prosecutors said, according to a redacted copy of the U.S. motion filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.

Cole was not immediately available for comment. But in a statement Huawei said the U.S. wants to strip the company of counsel of its choice while concealing the facts on why.

“The Justice Department’s motion to disqualify Jim Cole makes a mockery of the adversarial process,” the statement said.

“The government has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter. Now, two years later, not only does the Justice Department seek to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice, but it does so while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The case against Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has ratcheted up tensions between Beijing and Washington as the world’s top two economic powers try to negotiate a trade deal.

The company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in December at the behest of U.S. authorities for her role in the alleged fraud. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.

In Friday’s filing, U.S. prosecutors said Cole’s representation of Huawei poses “irresolvable conflicts of interest.”

As deputy attorney general, Cole “personally supervised and participated in aspects of” an investigation that caused the conflicts, the prosecutors said in the filing.

Details of that probe were redacted, but the filing said the Huawei prosecution is “substantially related” to the matter.

The prosecutors said Cole possessed information from his government work related to his Huawei representation that he could not reveal, and this created the risk he would rely on the information in breach his duties to the Justice Department.

Secondly, because the nature of the conflict is classified, the prosecutors said, Huawei cannot obtain enough information for them to waive any conflict.

The case against Huawei and Meng accuses them of conspiring to defraud HSBC Holdings Plc and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a company that operated in Iran, putting the banks at risk of penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions laws.

Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner. The United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei’s Iran business.

U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system.

Last month, prosecutors said they planned to use information about Huawei in the case that was obtained through secret surveillance.

Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in Brooklyn on March 14."
"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve",https://www.npr.org,['Tim Mak'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721763041/exclusive-documents-detail-meetings-of-russians-with-treasury-federal-reserve,"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pavel Ptitsin/AP Pavel Ptitsin/AP

Newly obtained documents describe what happened when two now-infamous Russians took their outreach campaign into the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2015.

Alexander Torshin, then a Russian central banker, brought his protégée, Maria Butina, for meetings with senior officials and even sought another with the then-chair of the Fed, the documents confirm.

Agency officials described what happened before and since in internal materials obtained by NPR under the Freedom of Information Act. The fact of the meetings has previously been reported, but their contents have not been fully described until now.

Torshin has since been sanctioned by the Treasury Department and cannot return to the United States.

Butina, meanwhile, has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to serve as a Russian agent and has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.

In an interview with NPR on Thursday, Butina called her meetings with government officials, politicians and the National Rifle Association ""civil diplomacy, this unofficial channel of diplomacy"" and said it was meant to build relationships between the U.S. and Russian governments — and ultimately to promote peace.

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department declined to comment for this story.

The 'gun fanatic'

Torshin and Butina sought to build bridges between the Russian government and influential Americans via their enthusiasm for gun rights. Both had life memberships in the National Rifle Association.

At the same time, Russia was stepping up its broader campaign of influence against the United States.

So in 2015, after the chill in relations between Washington and Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Torshin sought to take advantage of his connection to Russia's central bank.

Paul Saunders, who was then the executive director of a D.C.-based think tank called the Center for the National Interest, reached out to officials with the Treasury and the Fed to help organize meetings.

""Because we were about a year into U.S. sanctions on Russia following their annexation of Crimea, we thought it would be interesting for Americans to hear from a Russian central bank official about the status of the Russian financial system,"" Saunders told NPR. ""We were certainly not at that time aware of any derogatory information about Torshin.""

Saunders helped broker a meeting for Torshin and Butina with Nathan Sheets, then the undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs.

Treasury aide Erik Woodhouse consulted with a number of officials inside its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the White House's National Security Council, but no red flags were raised about the meeting, which ultimately took place on April 7, 2015.

A few years later, after Butina was arrested, a Treasury Department staffer wrote about what took place.

According to that newly revealed account, the discussion wasn't so much about banking as about denying Russia's involvement in the shoot-down of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner and amplifying Torshin's support for guns.

""The meeting was supposed to be about economics, but the guy just went on and on about how the Russians didn't shoot down MH17 for an hour or so,"" the Treasury Department official wrote, referring to the Malaysia Airlines flight.

""The guy was also a gun fanatic and said he was a 'life member of the NRA.' In fact I think he was even in town for personal business tied to the NRA.""

Saunders also reached out to request a meeting between then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Torshin in March 2015.

Yellen's office passed on the meeting and suggested that Torshin instead meet with Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer. Following the approval of an adviser, Fischer took the meeting on April 8, 2015, without further investigation into Torshin's background.

""They are in the United States to attend the NRA's annual meeting,"" the meeting's official notes read. Both Russians pointed out, as part of their introduction, that they were ""life members"" of the NRA.

This meeting did turn to economic issues, including discussions about Russian credit and inflation.

Butina, now in custody at a detention center in Alexandria, Va., said the meetings were unremarkable.

Of her meeting with Fischer, she said: ""Torshin put it straight: that he is here as an NRA member and he's just interested in meeting similar-minded people. ... I don't remember, even, the details of this conversation, because it wasn't significant at all.""

The sanctions

After months of investigations and headlines about Russia's influence campaign against the United States, Torshin was placed under sanction by the U.S. government in 2018.

In the evidentiary package that designated Torshin as a target for U.S. sanctions — also obtained by NPR — the Treasury Department established that Torshin was a Russian government official who could be targeted under existing sanctions authorities.

But the package also highlighted Torshin's alleged links with Russian organized crime.

Citing public sources such as Crime Russia, a news website focusing on Russian corruption, and El País, a Spanish newspaper, the document noted that Torshin was in ""frequent contact"" with Alexander Romanov, who heads the Taganskaya organized crime group, between August 2012 to May 2013.

""Torshin may have personally given instructions to members of the Taganskaya on money laundering methods using Spanish bank accounts and real estate,"" the evidentiary package reads.

The package cites no classified or governmental sources, but experts say the inclusion of references to Torshin's alleged organized crime links suggests the U.S. government had reason to believe the allegation was truthful.

""There's a whole process that is used for determining what is included in an evidentiary package. By including it, they view it as credible and relevant to designating him with sanctions,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, who formerly served as a senior adviser to the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

""This information is strictly ancillary to the legal authorities needed to sanction Torshin, but they want to put it out there for government officials to be aware of.""

Butina told NPR that she once asked Torshin about these alleged links, but she said she didn't believe they were true.

""I have no knowledge about this, absolutely none. ... One time I asked him about it, and he denied it ... a couple of years ago,"" she said. ""I don't believe he has this type of personality."""

“The President’s pronouncement amounts to a direct assault on the constitutional order and on Congress’s constitutional oversight and legislative interest with regard to the President and his Administration,” wrote Nadler, whose committee voted Wednesday to find Barr in contempt of Congress.

Nadler wrote that the Judiciary panel is willing to continue engaging with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reach an agreement on the Mueller materials for which the committee has issued a subpoena, expressing disappointment at the Justice Department’s “precipitous end to our active accommodation discussions.”

“Notwithstanding the President’s admitted intent to block all congressional subpoenas, the Committee remains prepared to meet with the Department to ascertain if an accommodation can be reached that is consistent with the prerogatives of the Committee and the Department,” Nadler wrote. “My staff is ready, willing and able to meet with your staff in an effort to achieve a suitable compromise.”

Nadler’s letter came two days after the Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to recommend Barr be held in contempt for not complying with a congressional subpoena for Mueller’s report and evidence after in-person negotiations with DOJ failed to resolve an impasse. The Justice Department has said that complying with the subpoena would amount to violating the law and would compromise ongoing investigations.

On a recommendation from Barr, Trump asserted executive privilege over Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence on Wednesday ahead of the contempt vote. The Justice Department argued in a letter to Nadler that day that the committee had forced the administration’s hand.

“As we have repeatedly explained, the attorney general could not comply with your subpoena in its current form without violating the law, court rules and court orders, and without threatening the independence of the Department of Justice’s prosecutorial functions,” wrote Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd. “Accordingly, this is to advise you that the president has asserted executive privilege over the entirety of the subpoenaed materials.”

House Democrats have demanded access to Mueller’s full report, a redacted version of which Barr released publicly on April 18. Democrats have also criticized Barr for his handling of the report, accusing him of bias in his memo detailing Mueller’s conclusions.

Barr has allowed the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees as well as Gang of Eight intelligence lawmakers to review a less-redacted version of the report in a secure room, provided they don’t discuss it. Barr has also declined to join Democrats in petitioning for the release of grand jury material from the report, which is subject to secrecy rules absent a court order.

At a meeting Tuesday, DOJ said it would allow more staffers to view the report and allow lawmakers who review it to talk about it amongst themselves and keep their notes on it. The Judiciary Committee issued a counteroffer the same day, asking that all members of the Judiciary and Intelligence committees be able to immediately review the less-redacted version.

Nadler also noted in his letter that the committee “agreed to postpone the contempt resolution markup if the Department simply agreed to discuss producing only the underlying evidence and materials referenced in the report.”

It is unclear whether the Justice Department will be open to continuing discussions with the committee following Wednesday’s contempt resolution vote.

The DOJ did not immediately return a request for comment on Nadler’s latest letter.

Nadler’s letter noted that “the full House has not yet taken action on this matter.”

Democratic House leaders have signaled they want to move the resolution to the floor for a vote by the full chamber soon."

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)

The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Trump’s plans to expand fossil-fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior’s Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico’s Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

“So that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,” he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. “What I hope is, as an organization we learn from any error we make.”

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee next week, to factor climate change into the department’s decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation’s carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

“The law requires us to analyze those things,” he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. “It doesn’t say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.”

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president’s order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said that he expected to get a briefing on this week’s U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world’s plants and animals are at risk of extinction, but added that Interior and the Commerce Department still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

“We didn’t start doing them to not do them,” he said.

As he pursues the administration’s agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on Interior.

“We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,” McCollum said. “Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what’s the bare minimum.”

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately on Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

“You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,” he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary’s office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska’s Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

“I’m not somebody who would put somebody else’s stuff up,” Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose’s entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. “His neck meat alone was 135 pounds.”"
DOJ charges Chinese hacker for 'one of the worst data breaches in history' which took 79 million people’s personal data from Anthem health insurers,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Bill Bostock'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-hacker-stole-data-78-million-anthem-doj-say-2019-5,"A Chinese national has been charged with orchestrating the biggest data hack in US healthcare history, in which 79 million people had their personal information stolen.

Wang Fujie, 32, was charged with hacking US health insurance giant Anthem, and three other unnamed US businesses, between February 2014 and January 2015, a Department of Justice press (DOJ) release said Thursday.

In the four-count indictment cited by the DOJ, Wang, who also goes by Dennis Wang, is said to have ""used sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses without authorization.""

He was charged alongside another man, referred to in the indictment as John Doe.

The men are then accused of installing malware and seeking out the personal information of 79 million Anthem customers, as well as their ""confidential business information.""

They were detected in January 2015, the indictment said.

The stolen data included names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information, and income data, the indictment said.

Anthem paid the US government $16 million as a result of the privacy violation in October 2018.

One of the techniques Wang is said to have used was a ""spearfishing"" email, a targeted message designed to trick the recipient into treating it as legitimate.

Emails with hyperlinks were sent to employees of the four companies, the DOJ said. If they clicked on the link it installed malware which opened a back door to the company's computer server, the indictment said.

Wang and the other man were both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.

In a statement, DOJ assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski said: ""The allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history.""

""These defendants allegedly attacked US businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII (personally identifiable information).""

In February 2015, Bloomberg reported that the FBI believes the hack was sponsored by the Chinese government.

An Anthem spokeswoman told Business Insider in an emailed statement:

""We are grateful for the support and partnership of the FBI and extended law enforcement team in investigating the sophisticated cyber-attack that Anthem was a victim of in February 2015, and are pleased with the action taken today.""

""There is no evidence that information obtained through the 2015 cyber-attack targeting Anthem has resulted in fraud."""

The president noted that it could be ""a very big situation"" for Biden, who has led the Democratic presidential primary field in polling since he launched his campaign last month.

""Because he’s a Democrat it’s about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican, it would be a lot bigger,"" Trump alleged.

Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last week called for an investigation into Biden for his previous ties to Ukraine after The New York Times reported that while Biden was vice president in 2016, he allegedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor. The prosecutor, who had been accused of ignoring corruption in his own office, was later voted out.

Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of an energy company that the prosecutor had been looking into, according to the newspaper.

However, Giuliani changed course late Friday, announcing that he had canceled his trip. The reversal came after Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of seeking aid from a foreign government.

Biden, the front-runner among a crowded field of Democrats vying for the White House in 2020, had a 32-point lead over his competitors in a Hill-HarrisX poll released earlier this week.

Biden also surpassed Trump by six points in the first poll published after the former vice president officially announced his candidacy in April."

"London’s mayor says Trump ‘not in same class’ as Obama and Bush, not worthy of state visit to Britain",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Adam Taylor', 'Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects', 'May At Pm']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/10/londons-mayor-says-trump-not-same-class-obama-bush-not-worthy-uk-state-visit/,"

Ahead of President Trump’s state visit to Britain on June 3, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says he believes the U.S. leader is not “in the same class” as his predecessors and is not worthy of the honor.

“Of course we should have a close relationship with the president of the United States, but we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet; we shouldn’t have a state banquet,” Khan said Friday, during an interview with LBC, a British talk-radio station.

“History tells us only two presidents have had a state visit,” Khan said. “President Trump is not in the same class as those two.”

Trump visited Britain last July, but that trip was not considered a state visit, even though he did visit the queen at Windsor Castle.

[Trump finally gets his British state visit — but tensions that led to delay remain]

Khan’s comments reflected widespread skepticism about the Trump administration in the British capital ahead of a long-delayed state trip next month. They also raised the possibility that Trump, who has criticized and insulted the mayor of London before, may retaliate, reigniting a war of words that would likely make his visit to the city more contentious.

British Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invite for a state visit to Trump during a visit to Washington in January 2017, just days after the president had taken office. “I am delighted that the president has accepted that invitation,” she told a White House news conference.

The only two state visits to Britain by U.S. presidents in the past were in 2011, when President Barack Obama visited, and in 2003, when President George W. Bush visited. State visits are formal trips to Britain by heads of state from countries overseas, with considerable pomp and circumstance that is not afforded to less formal visits by world leaders.

However, as relations between Trump and May grew difficult, Trump’s state visit to Britain was repeatedly delayed. When Trump finally made a brief visit to London in July 2018 — a working visit, rather than a state visit — he was greeted by protests and a giant blimp that depicted Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper.

Though a state visit was finally announced last month, most indications suggest that Trump remains unpopular in Britain. Polling data from the firm YouGov suggested only 1 in 5 people had a positive view of the U.S. president, while 67 percent had a negative opinion.

A spat between Trump and Khan, London’s mayor since May 2016, may not have helped the U.S. leader’s reputation in the British capital. Even before Trump was elected, Khan, a Labour Party member, had criticized him, telling Time magazine that because he is a Muslim, he would be stopped from going to the United States under Trump’s proposed Muslim travel ban.

Trump later responded by calling Khan “rude” and “ignorant” on “Good Morning Britain.”

After Trump’s inauguration, the president criticized the London mayor’s response to a number of terrorist attacks in the British capital. In November 2017, Trump shared anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist, prompting a rare rebuke from May.

Khan has called for Trump’s state visit invitation to be rescinded. In his interview with LBC this week, he stated that the visit was not necessary. “It’s possible to have a working relationship without the need to have a state banquet and roll out the red carpet,” Khan said.

Though Khan is not invited to the state banquet, he said he agrees with the sentiment of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has said he will refuse to attend the dinner. In a statement released in April, Labour’s Corbyn said that Trump “rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric.”

Khan also told LBC that one issue he had with Trump was the coarse language he used about women, which he felt emboldened others to target women and particularly female politicians.

“The impression is being given that you can get away from it — that you get a get-out-of-jail card. But it’s worse than that,” Khan said, referring to Trump’s comments about women who had accused him of sexual assault. “There’s a boasting and bragging, it’s almost like a green light for others to behave badly.”

Khan said that he hoped that May would raise some of these issues when Trump visits, though not necessarily in “Hugh Grant-type, public scene,” referencing a fictional faceoff between a U.S. president and prime minister during a news conference in the movie “Love Actually.”

“We’re their closest mates, we have a special relationship. That gives us a responsibility to call people out who we otherwise wouldn’t do so,” Khan said. “Your relationship with your best mate is different with your relationship with a mate or an acquaintance. Your standards that you expect from them are higher.”"
Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A decision on where in the West — possibly Utah — to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it’s moving. I can’t tell you where it’s going, but it’s moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they’ll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That’s an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that’s consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you’re only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don’t know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That’s why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain’t there in the first place,"" he said. ""There’s coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn’t exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We’re going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don’t have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don’t have? You don’t have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We’re trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."
"Trump's new plan to aid American farmers faces many hurdles, says ex-USDA chief",https://www.cnbc.com,['Jeff Daniels'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/trumps-new-plan-to-aid-farmers-faces-many-hurdles-says-ex-usda-chief.html,"President Donald Trump Carlos Barria | Reuters

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue on Friday said President Donald Trump has directed his agency to work on a plan to help farmers impacted by the ongoing trade war with China. Perdue didn't offer further details on a possible plan but Trump via Twitter on Friday indicated that the U.S. could use some of the money from tariffs on Chinese goods to buy $15 billion worth of agricultural products from American farmers, or ""far more than China buys now."" The president also said U.S. agricultural products could be shopped ""to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance.""

The Department of Agriculture declined to comment on plans it might have under consideration. However, a former USDA secretary, Tom Vilsack, told CNBC that the administration has ""very limited options"" although it could some funds by tapping into the Commodity Credit Corp., a federal agency given authority during the Great Depression. ""The secretary's options are limited given the size of the challenge,"" said Vilsack, currently president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, a trade group. Vilsack also suggested the program may require congressional approval, although a trade mitigation plan the USDA unveiled last year for American farmers impacted by retaliatory tariffs didn't require it. Vilsack added, ""They could do something. Whether they could do it to the extent that he's [Trump] suggested I think would require some congressional authorization and direction. I don't think there's enough flexibility in the USDA budget to be able to carve up and be able to identify $15 billion.""

Last July, Perdue unveiled a $12 billion trade aid program for American farmers that included trade promotion, food purchases, and direct payments to producers of soybeans, pork, corn, cotton, dairy and several other commodities. That earlier program utilized the CCC for so-called market facilitation payments to farmers, with the top five commodities being soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton and sorghum. ""I think what the president was talking about was buying a bunch of soybeans,"" said Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served in the USDA during the Obama administration. ""And even if the secretary can identify the resources to purchase crops and products, getting them to countries requires a second step by USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] and the State Department."" Soybeans have been hard hit by Chinese tariffs, falling near 10-year lows on Monday amid the threat of an escalated trade war with China. Before the trade war, China was buying more than $12 billion worth of U.S. soybeans annually, or roughly 1 in 3 rows of soybeans grown on the nation's farms. Last year, China bought about $3.2 billion worth of U.S. soybeans, according to USDA data. But China last year imposed 25% tariffs on a variety of agricultural products including soybeans — a top commodity in many states where Trump received strong support during the 2016 presidential election. Trump's suggestion that the U.S. government buy $15 billion worth of agricultural products comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are targeting the Midwest states for support. Meantime, Vilsack said it may be difficult for the administration to move quickly on the plan for other reasons. For one, he said some countries might not want to take the food commodities because it could have negative repercussions domestically. ""They would prefer to take cash because they don't want to disrupt their own agricultural economy by having foreign crops come in and displace domestically produced crops,"" he said.

Better late than never: House bill would pause statute of limitations on presidential crimes,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/house-bill-would-pause-statute-of-limitations-on-presidential-crimes-79c8aad87d27/,"Impeachment is currently the only option for holding a sitting president accountable for their crimes, but a group of Democratic lawmakers wants to make sure that presidents don’t become immune to criminal charges altogether, simply because they can’t be indicted while in office.

Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Ted Deutch (D-FL), and Eric Swalwell (D-CA) this week introduced the “No President Is Above The Law Act.” Its premise is simple: if a sitting president committed a crime — either before or while in office — the statute of limitations for prosecuting that crime will be paused until they’re no longer in office.

The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has concluded that “a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution.” That’s because there are certain functions only a sitting president can perform, and a president in court or in jail would not be able to perform them. And only impeachment can actually remove a president from office.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report specifically relied on this guidance in its conclusion not to indict President Donald Trump, despite outlining at least 10 episodes involving Trump that may have constituted obstruction of justice. Mueller specifically deferred the handling of these concerns to Congress, writing, “The conclusion that Congress may apply obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.”

But as ThinkProgress has previously noted, the Founding Fathers did not anticipate politics becoming so partisan that a political party would use its power to protect a criminal president. Even if the House at some point takes up articles of impeachment against Trump for these crimes, the likelihood of two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate voting to convict him is minimal at best.

Given the unique political obstacles to convicting a president through impeachment, this leaves the question of whether there can ever be any other accountability for a president who commits crimes. The answer is that a president could still be indicted after they’re no longer in office. But that’s only if the statute of limitations — which is five years for most federal offenses — hasn’t run out on their crimes. Hypothetically, a two-term president would be completely immune to prosecution for federal crimes committed before they were in office or during much of their presidency.

That’s where the new legislation comes in. The reasoning behind the bill is that if a president can’t be indicted while they’re in office, then the statute of limitations should not apply while they’re in office either. That way, when their term is over, they can still be held accountable for crimes they committed through the standard judicial processes — no impeachment required.

In a statement accompanying the introduction of the bill, all three lawmakers expressed concern with the OLC’s opinion that a sitting president can’t be indicted, with Swalwell openly stating his disagreement. All agreed with what Mueller himself declared, which is that “no person is above the law” — not even the president.

Or as Nadler put it, “The presidency is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.”

Nadler chairs the House Judiciary Committee, on which both Deutch and Swalwell also sit. This week, the committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena turning over the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence, and requesting Barr work with lawmakers to petition a judge for any grand jury material.

Trump has now asserted executive privilege over the full report, an attempt to block one branch of the government from conducting oversight of another. However safe he might be in the Senate, Trump appears determined to block the House from accessing any additional information that might further justify impeachment proceedings."
"Border apprehensions to surpass last 13 year totals in 122 days, DHS heightens funding plea",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/border-crossings-to-surpass-last-13-year-totals-in-122-days-dhs-heightens-funding-plea,"The Department of Homeland Security is forecasting that border apprehensions of illegal immigrants will surpass the totals of the last 13 years in just 122 days, prompting a new push for President Trump’s $4.5 billion in emergency funding to handle the crisis.

To add an exclamation point on the administration's plea for Congress to pitch in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is leading a weekend trip with acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to the Texas-Mexico border to oversee Homeland Security-Pentagon operations at the increasingly dangerous and populated border, according to law enforcement officials.

The trip by the nation’s two top border security officials comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection released shocking new April border arrest numbers. The agency said it apprehended 109,144 in April, up from 103,719 in March.

Officials said the surge will surpass the totals of the last 13 fiscal years in early September. Arrests topped the fiscal 2014 totals last weekend.

An average of 3,891 illegal immigrants are apprehended every day, according to officials.

McAleenan and Shanahan are set to arrive in McAllen, Texas, Saturday. They plan to oversee Homeland Security and Defense Department joint missions, meet with officers and first responders, and inspect the humanitarian operations, according to officials. It is McAleenan’s third trip to the border as acting secretary and Shanahan’s second.

Some of those humanitarian operations are running short of congressionally approved funding. Trump has asked for an emergency appropriation of $4.5 billion and border lawmakers, like Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, have urged Senate leaders to act on the request.

At a House hearing last month, McAleenan listed what is needed to end the surge, adding, “Given the scale of the crisis, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year, which is why the administration will be seeking supplemental funding to support ongoing surge operations, and provide critical humanitarian assistance for migrants.”

Homeland Security would get about $1.2 billion of the $4.5 billion:



$391 million for humanitarian assistance that will fund processing centers at the border, transportation requirements, feeding and care of those in custody, and other needs

$530 million for operations support on the border, such as personnel expenses, detention beds, transportation, and investigatory resources to counter human smuggling and trafficking

$178 million for information technology system upgrades and law enforcement pay adjustments to manage the ongoing surge

“The problem we face is huge, short-term fixes will not cut it, and we need sustained investment and additional emergency support at the southwest border to overcome the humanitarian and security crisis. The president’s budget will do that,” said McAleenan, a longtime border official.

Democrats have started to express support for more spending at the border, but action has been slow on the president’s request."
"Facing Democratic resistance, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt promotes oil and gas drilling",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Juliet Eilperin', 'The Washington Post']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/05/10/facing-democratic/,"Washington • The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Donald Trump’s plans to expand fossil-fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior’s Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico’s Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

""So that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,"" he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. ""What I hope is, as an organization we learn from any error we make.""

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee next week, to factor climate change into the department's decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation's carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

""The law requires us to analyze those things,"" he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. ""It doesn't say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.""

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president's order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said that he expected to get a briefing on this week's U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world's plants and animals are at risk of extinction, but added that Interior and the Commerce Department still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

""We didn't start doing them to not do them,"" he said.

As he pursues the administration's agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on Interior.

Article continues below

""We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,"" McCollum said. ""Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what's the bare minimum.""

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately on Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

""You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,"" he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary's office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska's Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

“I’m not somebody who would put somebody else’s stuff up,” Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose’s entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. “His neck meat alone was 135 pounds.”"

""Based upon his outstanding service to the Country and his demonstrated ability to lead, President Trump intends to nominate Patrick M. Shanahan to be the Secretary of Defense,"" Sanders said in a statement.

Shortly after the announcement, Shanahan issued a statement saying he was ""honored"" to be chosen as the Pentagon's permanent head. The former Boeing executive said in comments to reporters after the announcement that he had been informed of the decision earlier Thursday.

""If confirmed by the Senate, I will continue the aggressive implementation of our National Defense Strategy,"" Shanahan said in a statement. ""I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe.""

Shanahan took over the job in an acting role following the December resignation of Mattis, who left the administration over a series of policy differences with Trump, particularly over the President's initial decision to withdraw US troops from Syria.

Rosenstein was honored at the Robert F. Kennedy Building Thursday, following submitting his resignation to President Trump last month. Rosenstein sat on stage between Attorney General Bill Barr, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and FBI Director Christopher Wray—all of whom touted Rosenstein’s record and character throughout his career, but specifically over the last two years.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HOLD BARR IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER MUELLER FILES

“Rod, you did your duty as it fell upon you,” Sessions, who resigned last year after the midterm elections, said on Thursday. “You didn’t ask for it—that’s for sure.”

Rosenstein, 54, previously served as deputy assistant attorney general and a U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland. But during the Trump administration, he became deputy attorney general to Sessions. Rosenstein ultimately took oversight of the Russia investigation upon Sessions’ recusal in early 2017 due to his work with the Trump campaign.

Sessions added that Rosenstein “didn’t start” the investigation, and noted that sometimes, “these things just become unstoppable.”

“Decisions had to be made, and those decisions fell to him,” Sessions continued, adding that decisions were made “all in accordance with procedures of the Justice Department.”

“Rod understood better than most that justice would be best served by appointing a special counsel.”

He added: “You have honorably overseen this process, which has affirmed the rule of law and achieved a degree of justice.”

Sessions called Rosenstein a “friend and a loyal partner,” and reminisced on their “many wonderful times"" together.

Wray also praised Rosenstein and thanked him for his “dedication and service.""

“I have been grateful for Rod’s counsel and support,” Wray said. “A friend whose service has weathered the test of time.”

Rosenstein submitted his resignation following the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Rosenstein worked alongside Barr and Mueller, to determine which portions of the report could be released to Congress and to the public, and which needed redactions to protect sources and methods and grand jury material.

Barr himself has fallen under intense scrutiny over the handling of the report. The House Judiciary Committee this week voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the full Mueller report and underlying documents.

But Barr praised Rosenstein on Thursday and said he has been “fortunate” to work with him.

“It’s been a real privilege and pleasure to have him with me these last several weeks,” Barr said, adding that Rosenstein has “exceptional intelligence, sound judgment crafted from experience, composure even amid scrutiny” and an “upbeat spirit” and “sense of humor.”

“He is an exceptional leader,” Barr said and presented Rosenstein with a flag that was flown above the main Justice Department.

Rosenstein fell into the political crosshairs throughout his tenure and was on the receiving end of the president’s ire over the Russia investigation.

Early on in his oversight of the probe, on May 8, 2017, at his recommendation, Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Just a week later, Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller and took oversight of that probe until November 2018, when former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker took over.

IMPRISONING BILL BARR IS LEFT'S NEW RALLYING CRY: 'HAVE HIM LOCKED UP'

Rumors of Rosenstein’s resignation, or even firing, swirled for months—especially after Trump accused him of pursuing a “treasonous” plot against him. Last year, a report revealed that during a meeting, Rosenstein suggested wearing a “wire” to record the president - some of those there said he was joking - and suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The meeting reportedly took place in the days after Comey’s firing.

Fox News learned that the meeting included several high-profile FBI officials, including former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI counsel Lisa Page on May 16, 2017. Mueller was appointed as special counsel the following day. Rosenstein, though, repeatedly denied pursuing a recording of the president and pushed back on claims of considering invoking the amendment.

But last month, Rosenstein officially resigned, and thanked Trump for “the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens.’”

On Thursday, after thanking his Justice Department colleagues, Rosenstein took the podium and said: “I leave here confident that justice is in good hands. It’s in your hands.”

Suicides on VA properties sound the alarm on veteran care,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Dean Reynolds'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-military-veteran-suicides-on-veterans-affairs-properties-sound-the-alarm-on-veteran-care/,"Veterans can talk with a trained counselor through the Veterans Crisis Line.

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Justin Miller Miller family

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."
"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."
U.S. says Huawei lawyer's prior work at Justice Department poses conflicts,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-huawei-tech/u-s-says-huawei-lawyers-prior-work-at-justice-department-poses-conflict-idUSKCN1SG2GU,"(Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd lawyer James Cole’s prior work at the U.S. Department of Justice created conflicts of interest that should disqualify him from defending the Chinese company in a case of alleged bank fraud and sanctions violations, U.S. prosecutors said in a filing on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign board of Huawei at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) Asia 2018 in Shanghai, China June 14, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo

Last week, the prosecutors filed a motion to disqualify Cole, who served as deputy attorney general, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, between 2011 and 2015. But the motion was sealed and classified, and prosecutors did not make public the reasons behind the move.

“There is a ‘substantial risk’ that Cole could use ‘confidential factual information’ obtained while serving as DAG to ‘materially advance’ Huawei’s current defense strategy,” the prosecutors said, according to a redacted copy of the U.S. motion filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.

Cole was not immediately available for comment. But in a statement Huawei said the U.S. wants to strip the company of counsel of its choice while concealing the facts on why.

“The Justice Department’s motion to disqualify Jim Cole makes a mockery of the adversarial process,” the statement said.

“The government has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter. Now, two years later, not only does the Justice Department seek to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice, but it does so while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The case against Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has ratcheted up tensions between Beijing and Washington as the world’s top two economic powers try to negotiate a trade deal.

The company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in December at the behest of U.S. authorities for her role in the alleged fraud. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.

In Friday’s filing, U.S. prosecutors said Cole’s representation of Huawei poses “irresolvable conflicts of interest.”

As deputy attorney general, Cole “personally supervised and participated in aspects of” an investigation that caused the conflicts, the prosecutors said in the filing.

Details of that probe were redacted, but the filing said the Huawei prosecution is “substantially related” to the matter.

The prosecutors said Cole possessed information from his government work related to his Huawei representation that he could not reveal, and this created the risk he would rely on the information in breach his duties to the Justice Department.

Secondly, because the nature of the conflict is classified, the prosecutors said, Huawei cannot obtain enough information for them to waive any conflict.

The case against Huawei and Meng accuses them of conspiring to defraud HSBC Holdings Plc and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a company that operated in Iran, putting the banks at risk of penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions laws.

Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner. The United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei’s Iran business.

U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system.

Last month, prosecutors said they planned to use information about Huawei in the case that was obtained through secret surveillance.

Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in Brooklyn on March 14."
Opinion | The Next President Should Not Be a Man,https://www.nytimes.com,['Farhad Manjoo'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/opinion/woman-president.html,"Meanwhile, every man who’s running will somehow have to come up with a credible answer to this simple question: After everything we’ve just learned about how gender bias has systematically decimated female leadership in America, can you give us one good reason for the next president to be yet another man?

I’ve spent a lot of time chatting with people in and out of politics about this question, and I really haven’t heard a good answer to it. And so I’ve come to harbor the opposite bias. It would be a terrible mistake for the Democrats to nominate a man as their standard-bearer against Trump, and it would be tragic for the United States to elect a man to the presidency in 2020 — not just Trump but any man, whether Biden or Beto or Buttigieg or Bernie.

This isn’t because all the men who are running are terrible. It’s because, in key ways, a man, even your favorite man, would be a lesser advocate than many of the women for some of the most important social and political issues of the day. A male candidate’s very maleness would damage a central pillar of the best political arguments against Trump. And if he wins, his gender’s enduring blindness to issues involving women in society might stunt urgent and necessary political action.

Let’s start with the political calculus. Though the 2016 race was besotted with gender bias, it’s a mistake to conclude that Americans will not vote for a woman over Donald Trump, because what happened in 2016 was that a majority of Americans voted for a woman over Donald Trump.

And in the past few years, the political climate for female candidates has only grown more favorable. In the spiraling revelations of #MeToo, much of the nation (especially men) suddenly saw the damaging pervasiveness of misogyny in every part of society.

Today, gender politics are at the core of all politics. There is a huge gender gap — most voters in 2018 were women, and about 60 percent of them voted for Democrats — and much of the money, organization and energy on the left has been driven by a broad, reawakened feminism. And not just on the left: According to Gallup, the “way women are treated in U.S. society” was among the most important issues to voters in 2018, above gun policy, taxes, wealth inequality and Russian involvement in American politics.

This reawakened feminism should turn reflexive bias on its head. The women who are running this year are broadly qualified to occupy the White House. They’ve won statewide races, they’ve survived brutal primaries, they’ve advanced novel and pathbreaking public policy ideas. I can’t see many of the male candidates making a strong case that he would be a more effective advocate for the feminist energy now fueling the left than any of these talented women."
"State Department should be investigated too, for actions overseas",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'L. Todd Wood']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/9/state-department-should-be-investigated-too-for-ac/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

With the investigations of the investigators beginning under the watch of Attorney General William Barr at the Justice Department, we would like to highlight that it has not just been the FBI, and America’s other intelligence agencies, who were corrupted during the Obama administration.

The State Department is also knee deep in the Deep State with Obama holdovers working their seditious black magic in the cubicles of Foggy Bottom and around the world.

We have written extensively on these pages about the corrupt actions of Ambassador *Donald Lu in Albania, where he used the powers of his office to interfere in the political discourse of a foreign country, supporting the socialist government of Prime Minister Edi Rama, a man who is so close to Leftist philanthropist and activist George Soros that he was invited to his wedding. Mr. Lu even went so far as to cancel American visas of Albanian opposition figures in his bid to curry favor with the far left and ensure socialist rule. He has since left Albania for Kyrgyzstan, where he is up to his old tricks, once again interfering in local affairs and pushing the globalist agenda, right under the nose of the leadership in Washington.

Mr. Lu’s supposed replacement for Albania, former State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Kathleen Ann Kavalec, had her nomination withdrawn from consideration in Congress after information surfaced that she was connected to the Fusian GPS attempted coup by the Deep State.

The current U.S. Charge d’affaires Leyla Moses-Ones was caught blatantly and arrogantly tweeting against her boss, President Trump last year. More precisely, she retweeted a disloyal Twitter ramble about Mr. Trump by possibly soon to be indicted former head of the FBI, James Comey. Once exposed, Moses-Ones’ tweet was swiftly deleted.

We have also written about how the American embassy in Tirana has been actively involved in ‘judicial reform’ in Albania, which has led to complete lawlessness in the country of oligarch rule, because no constitutional court has been empaneled. That was the goal all along of course. The law was written by Soros consultants.

Former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power, meanwhile, was caught ‘unmasking’ scores of Americans during her tenure with the Obama administration. This situation has not really been delved into by authorities, as the Trump-Russia hoax has sucked most of the oxygen from the room for the past two and a half years. Ms. Power’s actions should be investigated, however. Why in the world would the ambassador to the United Nations need to unmask American citizens via FISA surveillance? Hopefully we will know the answer to that question one day.

Just this week, the American representative to Ukraine, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, was forced out two months early from her post. The allegation is that she played a role in State Department collusion with the Ukrainian government to ensure the election of Hillary Clinton in 2016 by releasing damaging information on Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.

Reports are that Ukraine’s prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko declared that Ms. Yovanovitch actually gave him a “list of people whom we should not prosecute” during their first meeting. Of course, these were allegedly all Obama administration officials.

The Soros’ cancer runs deep and wide throughout the State Department, where American tax dollars are a convenient piggy bank for his army of NGOs around the world which routinely are granted large amounts of money to work the open borders and open society globalist agenda.

This has to stop.

Americans are tired of big government working behind their backs for other nations and other agendas rather than Trump’s America First. To fully drain the swamp, Foggy Bottom needs to receive a visit from the Trump plumber.

U.S. charges ex-intelligence analyst with leaking classified documents,https://www.reuters.com,"['Sarah N. Lynch', 'Min Read']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-analyst/us-arrests-ex-analyst-alleges-leaks-of-classified-information-idUSKCN1SF1I2,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former intelligence analyst was arrested on Thursday over allegations he illegally obtained and disclosed classified national defense information about a U.S. drone strike program to a journalist, the U.S. Department of Justice said.

FILE PHOTO: A police vehicle blocks an entrance into the National Security Administration (NSA) facility in Fort Meade, Maryland, U.S. March 30, 2015. REUTERS/Gary Cameron/File Photo/File Photo

The analyst, Daniel Everette Hale, 31, of Nashville, Tennessee, had worked at the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and began communicating with the reporter starting in 2013, the department said.

Classified documents were later published by the reporter’s online news outlet, the government alleged.

The indictment does not name the publication or journalist; however, the description appeared to match that of Jeremy Scahill of the Intercept.

In October 2015, the Intercept published a series written by Scahill and other reporters called “The Drone Papers.”

In that series, the Intercept revealed that it had a source that had leaked classified documents because the source felt the American public “has a right to understand the process by which people are placed on kill lists and ultimately assassinated.”

The charges unsealed against Hale on Thursday marked the latest in a broad crackdown on media leaks by the Justice Department that started when Jeff Sessions was Attorney General.

During the Trump administration, the government has filed several criminal cases against leakers, including former intelligence analyst Reality Winner who divulged a report about Russian interference in the 2016 election also to the Intercept news website.

Jesselyn Radack, an attorney for Hale, told Reuters that the case against her client had been “dormant” for the last few years, but has since been revived.

“His case is part of a coordinated campaign to reinvigorate the draconian Espionage Act and deprive the public of information about some of our most controversial government programs,” she said.

The Intercept, in a statement, said it would not confirm the identity of anonymous sources, but it condemned the administration for bringing the case.

The leaked documents at the heart of the case against Hale, the Intercept said, “are of vital public importance, and activity related to their disclosure is protected by the First Amendment.”

Hale, who had served in the U.S. Air Force, is charged with five criminal counts, each carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, the Justice Department said.

According to the indictment, Hale was assigned to work at the NSA while serving on Air Force active duty from December 2011 to May 2013, and later that year also worked as a defense contractor assigned to the NGA.

In April 2013 while he was still at the NSA, prosecutors say Hale met a reporter at a book tour event in Washington.

The next month, Hale confided to a friend that the reporter wanted him to “tell my story about working with drones ... and the use of drones,” according to the indictment.

After multiple meetings with the reporter, the government said, in February 2014 Hale printed six documents from his classified computer related to his work at NGA and then texted the reporter to see if they could meet in Washington.

The documents were later published by the reporter’s online news outlet, the indictment says.

Hale is accused of printing a total of 36 top secret documents from his computer, nine of which were related to his NGA work.

Of those, he allegedly provided 17 to the reporter or to the reporter’s news outlet."
James Comey on DOJ inspector general's Trump-Russia investigation: 'Let's hear it',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/james-comey-on-doj-inspector-generals-trump-russia-probe-lets-hear-it,"Former FBI Director James Comey said on Thursday he is confident that Justice Department's Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation will not find that he or others around him at the FBI did anything wrong, but ""if the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it.""

At a CNN town hall Thursday night, exactly two years after he was fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017, Comey said no matter what is found by Horowitz's probe or by the investigation being conducted by Attorney General William Barr, ""they should be transparent about it.""

Comey and the FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse.

CNN’s Anderson Cooper told Comey that “the inspector general, the attorney general, they're now obviously looking into the origins of the investigation into the president and his campaign.” He asked Comey: “Are you confident you did everything by the book, and that the FBI, the people around you did everything by the book?”

[ Related: DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI’s use of unverified Steele dossier]

Comey said he was confident that he, and the FBI more broadly, had done nothing wrong, replying, “Yes. No doubt in my mind. But that doesn't mean I'm against review of it. That's totally fine.”

Cooper then pressed him further, asking, “So you think the inspector general will find nothing inappropriate?”

Comey said, “I don't think so. At least not that I know of. But if they do, they do. And they should be transparent about it.”

The Justice Department inspector general is looking into alleged FISA abuse related to surveillance of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The watchdog is also investigating the FBI’s reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier. That research was compiled at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The dossier was a key part of FISA applications and renewals; Comey signed off on three of them.

[ Also read: Barr says 'multiple criminal leak investigations underway']

Cooper told Comey that “CNN has spoken to people within the FBI that say they have concerns that the inspector general could find something, and that they are bracing for what may be uncovered.”

Comey emphasized he looked forward to the results of the investigation and stressed that he was unaware of any wrongdoing by himself or by the FBI. “Again, I'm a big believer in the truth. If the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it. I don't know of anything like that,"" he said.

Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the Justice Department and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation during 2016 was criticized in a voluminous report released by Horowitz in June 2018, which Cooper reminded Comey of by saying that the Justice Department inspector general “called your decision not to inform the bosses about the Clinton press conference, they called it extraordinary, insubordinate.” Cooper further reminded him that “they also said your letter to Congress about reopening the Clinton emails investigation to the emails was based on your personal views even if it meant rejecting long-standing department policy or practice.”

Comey replied, “Yeah, that's fair criticism.”

Cooper then asked, “Is it true? Extraordinary and insubordinate and that it rejected long-standing policy practices?”

“Yes, except for the insubordinate part,” Comey contended.

Barr has said Horowitz’s Trump-Russia investigation into the actions of the Justice Department and FBI should be completed in either May or June."
Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"

His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/treasury-secretary-mnuchin-denies-house-dems-request-for-trumps-tax-returns,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a letter Monday, denied House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal's request for President Trump's tax returns, saying the request lacked a “legitimate legislative purpose.”

“As you have recognized, the Committee’s request is unprecedented, and it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers,” the letter read.

Mnuchin told the Massachusetts Democrat he'd relied on the advice of the Justice Department. He concluded that the department was “not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.”

“The Department of Justice has informed us that it intends to memorialize its advice in a published legal opinion as soon as practicable. Out of respect for the deadlines previously set by the Committee, and consistent with our commitment to a prompt response, I am informing you now that the Department may not lawfully fulfill the Committee’s request,” the letter read.

The move, which was expected, is sure to set in motion a legal battle over Trump’s tax returns. The likely options available to Democrats would be to subpoena the Internal Revenue Service for the returns or to file a lawsuit.

Neal originally demanded access to Trump’s tax returns in early April under a law that said the IRS “shall furnish” the returns of any taxpayer to a handful of top lawmakers, including the chair of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.

The White House and the president’s attorneys declined to comment on the deadline to turn over Trump’s returns. Trump already has signaled he has no intention of turning over the much-coveted records.

The president has long told confidants that he was under audit and therefore could not release his taxes. But in recent weeks, he has added to the argument, telling advisers that the American people elected him once without seeing his taxes and would do so again, three White House officials and Republicans told The Associated Press anonymously.

DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI’s use of unverified Steele dossier,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-homing-in-on-fbis-use-of-unverified-steele-dossier,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating the FBI’s reliance on the unverified dossier produced by British ex-spy Christopher Steele in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate “despite questions about [Steele’s] credibility.""

Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reports Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele, described as a “key source”, who was used to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants against former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

This is part of Horowitz’s broad investigation into alleged FISA abuse and more.

Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS, which had reached out to and contracted Steele.

The new Wall Street Journal report says the inspector general’s office “has been asking why the FBI continued to cite Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications.” And a specific focus of Horowitz’s team is apparently “a news report cited extensively in the [FISA] applications that appeared to bolster Steele’s credibility… [which] said U.S. intelligence officials were investigating allegations similar to those Steele had raised.”

The “news report” was written by Yahoo News journalist Michael Isikoff, who said he was stunned when he learned that his September 2016 article for Yahoo News was used in the FISA applications targeting Carter Page to bolster Steele’s credibility, despite his source being Steele himself. Iskoff said “it’s self-referential” and “it seems a little odd that they would cite the Yahoo News story about the matter they are investigating themselves based on the same material that had been separately presented to the FBI.”

Isikoff personally met with Steele in person in September 2016. Also at the meeting was Isikoff’s “old friend” Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS. The three of them talked about Trump and Russia and Steele provided him with some of his research.

Isikoff now admits that everyone should have been more cautious about Steele’s information. “I think it’s fair to say that all of us should have approached this, in retrospect, with more skepticism, particularly when we didn’t know where it was coming from,” Isikoff said. “We knew that Steele compiled it, but that Steele did not hear these allegations himself. Somebody else heard them from others and then passed them along. That’s thirdhand stuff, which is not usually the kind you want for publishing.”

In the FISA renewal applications, which spanned until June 2017, the FBI continued to insist that it didn’t think Steele was Isikoff’s source even though Steele himself had said that he was by the spring of 2017.

The Wall Street Journal report says “investigators have also asked about an internal FBI evaluation of Steele’s credibility that found his reporting had been ‘minimally corroborated’ even as it also said he had provided information ‘of value’ to the U.S. intelligence community.” The report says “the evaluation was reflected in a ‘human source validation report’ written by a unit of the FBI after the bureau cut off its relationship with Steele in October 2016… because of his disclosures to the media about his work for the FBI.”

Heavily redacted FBI records unearthed through Freedom of Information Act litigation in 2018 show that Steele was cut off as a confidential human source because of his improper disclosures to third parties and that his “handling agent advised [Steele] that [Confidential Human Source] was not to operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the FBI.”

According to a New York Times report from April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

For its part, Fusion GPS told the Washington Examiner that it stands by Steele’s dossier, claiming that “to our knowledge, nothing in the Steele memoranda has been disproven.”

Journalist Bob Woodward has been calling Steele’s dossier “garbage” for more than two years. And former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman said: “I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago… It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.” A number of Steele’s biggest claims — including its allegation from ""Kremlin insiders"" that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers — were knocked down by special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Attorney General William Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the DOJ and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

Barr has said Horowitz’s investigation should be completed in either May or June."
AG Kaul shifts direction of Wisconsin Department of Justice,https://www.channel3000.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.channel3000.com/news/politics/ag-kaul-shifts-direction-of-wisconsin-department-of-justice/1076948249,"MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin's new Democratic attorney general is shifting the state Justice Department away from his Republican predecessor's conservative stances on everything from health care to high-capacity wells.

Josh Kaul defeated Attorney General Brad Schimel in November as part of a Democratic sweep of all statewide offices.

In his first four months in office, Kaul has fulfilled his campaign promise to withdraw Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act.

He has also switched sides in lawsuits over whether the state Department of Natural Resources can legally impose tighter regulations on factory farms and high-capacity wells, re-aligning with environmental advocacy group Clean Wisconsin.

Republicans say Kaul can't be trusted to defend GOP-passed laws. But Kaul says he's not being ideological, he just views the law differently.

WASDE Analysis: Bears Overrun the Grain Markets,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/wasde-analysis-bears-overrun-the-grain-markets/,"On the bearish-to-bullish scale (with 1 being bearish and 10 being bullish), Ted Seifried would give the today’s round of USDA reports a 2 or 3.

The May 2019 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report from USDA provided additional negative news for the corn and soybean markets, which are already being dragged lower by negative trade news and planting delays.

Corn: Huge Ending Stocks Push Prices Lower

USDA says the U.S. feed-grain outlook for 2019/20 is for larger production and domestic use, lower exports and greater ending stocks.

The corn crop is projected at 15.0 billion bu., up from last year and the second largest on record behind 2016/17.

The yield projection of 176.0 bu. per acre is based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal planting progress and summer growing season weather, estimated using the 1988-2018 time period.

Total corn supplies are forecast record high at 17.2 billion bushels.

The season-average farm price is projected at $3.30 per bushel, down 20 cents from 2018/19 and the lowest since 2006/07.

Soybeans: High Supplies Sink Prices

USDA says the 2019/20 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports and slightly lower ending stocks compared to 2018/19.

The soybean crop is projected at 4,150 million bu., down 394 million from last year’s record crop.

With sharply higher beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected at 5,165 million bu., up 3% from 2018/19.

The season-average soybean price is projected at $8.10 per bushel, down 45 cents from the 2018/19 forecast.

“At face value, when you look at the numbers, they are quite a bit larger than what the trade was expecting, especially for new-crop corn carryover,” says Seifried, chief market strategist and vice president with Zaner Ag Hedge Group. “That’s where the real bearishness is coming from.”

The trade was hoping to see stronger domestic demand numbers and maybe even a better export number for corn, he explains.

“Corn was supposed to be the bullish story in the grains,” he says. “This report really says ‘No,’ to that.”

Seifried says farmers need to pay attention to the asterisks USDA included in the reports. For corn, USDA points out that the acreage and yield projections are based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal mid-May planting progress and summer growing season weather.

“That mid-May planting progress is very much in question,” he says. “While we have a bit of sticker shock on the demand side of the corn balance sheet because of the sheer size of ending stocks, the asterisk is fairly important because we are very concerned about whether we're going to get planting done.”

The disappointing part of the report, Seifried points out, is that the starting point for production is so high.

“So even if I’m going to chop off 1.5 million acres of corn that may not get planted due to the weather and if cut the yield down just a little bit, the downside mobility in the corn carryover is fairly limited unless we find some new demand,” he says. “How do we do that? We have a big South American corn crop and strong U.S. dollar. Where do we find more corn demand? I don't know what how we could get much more bearish than where we are right now, unless ASF comes to North America.”

With the May USDA reports, Seifried encourages farmers to rethink their price targets for corn and soybeans.

“With this report, we have to lower our expectations,” he says. “We're hoping to see some price recovery to sell. If we do, we need to be fairly aggressive on selling.”

As for the monthly Crop Production report, USDA forecast winter wheat production at 1.27 billion bu., which is up 7% from 2018. As of May 1, the United States yield is forecast at 50.3 bu. per acre, up 2.4 bu. from last year's average yield of 47.9 bu. per acre.

Seifried says the wheat numbers were close to trade expectations, with no surprises."
State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"
"Schiff, Nunes send joint letter blasting DOJ for stonewalling on documents",https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-nunes-send-joint-letter-blasting-doj-for-stonewalling-on-documents,"The leaders of the House Intelligence Committee have threatened to issue a rare bipartisan subpoena that would compel the Justice Department to turn over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's complete and unredacted report on the Russia investigation, as well as allow Mueller himself to brief the committee about the probe.

Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., initially requested ""all materials ... obtained or produced by the Special Counsel's Office in the course of the investigation"" in a March 27 letter to Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. After receiving no response, Schiff and Nunes repeated their request in a second letter dated April 25, one week after Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress and the public.

""[A]s the report makes clear, the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee 'fully and currently informed' of this important foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information, as required by law,"" Schiff and Nunes wrote in the April letter. ""The Department and the Bureau did not keep the Committee apprised of this information ... contrary to long-standing practice regarding significant counterintelligence matters.""

DEMS WHO FUMED AT NUNES FOR JEOPARDIZING 'SOURCES AND METHODS' NOW DEMAND MUELLER REPORT IN FULL

The second letter from Nunes and Schiff gave the Justice Department until May 2 to cooperate with their requests or ""the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee's request.""

A committee aide told Fox News on Tuesday that ""the [Justice] Department has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony,"" even after Schiff and Nunes sent their second letter.

""An accommodations process must go both ways, and the Committee will soon start the compulsory process since the Department has not even begun to comply,"" the aide said.

The letters mark a rare showing of bipartisan agreement between Schiff and Nunes, who have repeatedly been at loggerheads over the Russia investigation. On March 28, the committee's nine Republican members -- including Nunes -- requested that Schiff step down as chairman over his repeated claims in the media that there was ""more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Last week, Schiff called for Barr to resign as attorney general over his handling of the Mueller report, writing in a USA Today op-ed that Barr ""misled the country about an investigation implicating the president.

""Then he lied to Congress,"" Schiff wrote in the piece published last Friday. ""Then he did something worse: He effectively said that the president of the United States is above the law.""

Labor Dispute Opens New Front in Fight to Privatize the VA,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/labor-dispute-veterans-affairs-privatization.html,"Robert Wilkie. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn’t privatize the VA’s health-care services. He’s since repeated that promise to veterans themselves. “The private sector cannot replicate VA’s expertise in things like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, rehabilitative services, prosthetics, audiology, services for the blind, suicide prevention,” he told members of the American Legion in 2018.

But Wilkie was nominated by President Trump, who has surrounded himself with advocates for the privatization of the VA since taking office. His decision to fire Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin, an Obama appointee who opposed privatization, may not have had as much to do with Shulkin’s alleged spending improprieties as it did with months of sustained lobbying against the secretary from allies of Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-backed advocacy group supports an expansion of private-sector care for veterans — and Wilkie, since his confirmation, has deviated little from that goal.

On Wilkie’s watch, the VA has begun to shrink. (The VA reached out following publication to dispute this, stating: ‘Since last quarter, VA achieved a net increase of 3,043 employees and maintained a vacancy rate of approximately 11 percent.”) The department, which provides free or low-cost health care to around 9 million enrolled veterans as part of its mission to support former service members, has nearly 49,000 unfilled vacancies. Meanwhile, the Mission Act, which will expand the VA’s privatized community-care network for eligible veterans, is scheduled to take effect in June.

Now, a nascent contract dispute between the VA and the American Federation of Government Employees may bolster fears that Wilkie’s reforms are privatization in all but name. On Thursday, the VA submitted a proposal to renegotiate its collective-bargaining agreement with the AFGE, which represents around 250,000 department employees. The department’s proposals would drastically reduce the amount of time employees are allowed to spend on union business during the workday, among other changes. In a press release, the VA said it hoped to reduce staffers’ union time from 1 million hours per year to around 10,000, a change that would, it claimed, direct “more than $48 million per year” back to aiding veterans. The press release was otherwise light on detail, though in it, Secretary Wilkie described this as “a reset” of the VA’s relationship with the AFGE. “With VA facing thousands of vacancies, these proposals could add more than 1 million man-hours per year back into our work force — a vital influx of resources that would make an almost immediate difference for veterans and the employees who care for them,” Wilkie said.

These restrictions on union time would make it difficult, if not quite impossible, for staff to conduct legally permissible union business during work hours. And the VA’s plan goes even further. According to a copy of the proposal package provided by the union, the VA wants to eliminate 28 provisions of the department’s current collective-bargaining agreement. Union representatives would lose their offices inside VA facilities, and could no longer use VA equipment to carry out their duties. The department’s new contract with AFGE would last for ten years, but only the VA could make changes to it during that time; the union would be prohibited from doing the same. The VA seeks to weaken the grievance procedures set out in its previous agreement with AFGE. Communication between the union and the department would have to take place entirely at the national level. Employees who need to file grievances, for example, would no longer be able to do so at the local level. The union believes this could create a bottleneck that would slow the processing of employee grievances. The union also alleges that at least two of the VA’s proposals — to require the union to pay for the time management spends on union business, and to pay attorneys’ fees to the VA — would violate existing labor law.

Contacted for comment, VA press secretary Curt Cashour directed New York to a May 2 editorial published by Wilkie on InsideSources.com. In it, the secretary said that the department’s reforms would “make sure that the contract does not interfere with the department’s ability to take action against poor performers” and eliminate language in the previous agreement that “has effectively allowed the union to co-manage the VA.”

Asked specifically about the union’s claim that some of the proposals are illegal, Cashour said, “When department employees and attorneys — at the demand of the union — are required to cease providing medical care and support for veteran services, to prepare for and engage in union-demanded activities such as grievances, disciplinary appeals, or arbitration, it’s only fair for the union to reimburse taxpayers for this time spent not taking care of veterans.”

David Cann, AFGE’s director of field services and education, told New York on Monday that the VA’s proposals “are unique.” He added, “What I’m seeing out of the VA is the most both-barrels anti-union effort that I’ve seen in my time with AFGE.” The VA’s proposals resemble executive orders that Trump signed last May. One would have significantly reduced the amount of time that federal workers are allowed to spend on union business. AFGE sued the administration and won an injunction in August that blocked certain provisions of the orders from going forward. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, and the case is ongoing. “For whatever reason, the VA is acting in contravention of that injunction, and proposing limitations on the rights of members that are exactly the same as what the court has said they’re not allowed to do,” Cann said.

The VA’s proposal package seems to be “a clear case of failing to bargain in good faith, which is an unfair labor practice under the relevant statute,” Joseph Slater, the Eugene M. Balk professor of law and values at the University of Toledo, told New York in an email. Slater, who has reviewed a summary of the VA’s proposals, added that provisions “strike me as illegal bargaining proposals on their own,” including the provision that would allow only the VA to make changes to the contract once it’s in place. “The ten-year duration is clearly trying to lock in extreme terms for an unusually long time, which is commonly held to be bargaining in bad faith. Eliminating procedures and appropriate arrangements generally seems legally dicey to me too, as those are statutory rights,” he continued.

“I could go on,” he concluded, “but this is a set of radical, unworkable proposals that no union would agree to.”

The VA isn’t the first federal agency to call for a draconian renegotiation of its collective-bargaining agreement with AFGE. The Social Security Administration has proposed similar changes to its union contract, down to the removal of union representatives from their offices inside SSA buildings. Contract negotiations with AFGE may become not just a backdoor for the Trump administration to get around the injunction, but the locus at which its antipathy to the federal workforce meets its hostility toward unions.

The first two years of Trump’s presidency have already been difficult for the federal workforce. One of Trump’s first actions as president was to implement a temporary federal hiring freeze. He’s overseen two significant government shutdowns, the most recent of which lasted for five weeks and cost federal employees two pay periods. (Though federal workers received back pay after the government reopened, many federal contractors did not.) The VA isn’t the only federal agency facing a staffing crisis, either. Though the status of the VA’s workforce has a clear, disproportionate effect on veterans, so too does the state of the federal workforce at large. A third of federal employees are veterans. Cann told New York that AFGE believes that figure is even higher for employees of the VA.

But the fact that Wilkie is pursuing certain conflict with AFGE, instead of filling his department’s vacancies, kindles a fear specific to the VA: that the secretary intends to let the VA atrophy and funnel more and more veterans into private medical care. “If we really want to fix the VA so badly, let’s start hiring, and fill up some of those 49,000 [staff] vacancies,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town hall co-sponsored by National Nurses United and CommonDefense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group.

There’s no question that the VA suffers from systemic problems. Twenty-four veterans have died by suicide on VA campuses during the last 18 months, the Military Times reported in April. The department’s tech problems are so pronounced that implementation of the Mission Act may prove disastrous. According to ProPublica, a planned tool to help determine which veterans are eligible for private community care is so unreliable that “it threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.” Nevertheless, a joint study from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the White River Junction VA Medical Center found that VA medical facilities achieve health-care outcomes that are consistently as good as, or even better than, private alternatives in 121 regional markets. In polling, veterans themselves reliably oppose privatization, though they’re less hostile to the notion of some community-based choices as a supplement to the VA’s public services. The American Legion, like every other major veterans’ service organization, opposes privatization of the VA.

Alexander McCoy, the political director of Common Defense and a former Marine, told New York that his organization is watching the labor dispute closely. “The secretary of Veterans Affairs and Trump are trying to use veterans as props for union-busting,” he said. “This isn’t about improving our health care or fixing problems with the VA. They’re punishing workers for their own campaign to starve the VA.”

Kate Hoit, an Army veteran affiliated with VoteVets, a progressive organization that has repeatedly sued the Trump administration for its handling of the VA, agreed. “First and foremost, our concerns rest in the fact that the changes in the collective bargaining agreement will make the VA a worse place to work and therefore result in worse care for veterans,” Hoit said in a statement to New York.

Private-sector unions, too, worry that the VA’s contract proposals belie its commitment to privatization. Sara Nelson, who heads the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and called for a general strike in response to the latest government shutdown, said that it’s “no surprise” that the Trump administration would target AFGE’s VA members, who have traditionally enjoyed a robust contract. “It’s all a direct attack on VA workers and their union,” Nelson said in a statement to New York. “Why? Because they are the ones demanding accountability at the VA, they are the ones blowing the whistle on waste and fraud, they are the ones standing in the way of privatization. That’s the ultimate goal: privatize the VA so the giant health care corporations can reap the billions spent on caring for our veterans, ignoring the fact that veterans overwhelmingly prefer the VA to private healthcare.”

AFGE will likely need all the support it can get. Slater, the law professor, cautioned that if the union wanted to file an unfair labor practices charge against the VA, it may have difficulty finding relief. Trump took until March of this year to nominate a general counsel to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the body responsible for addressing labor grievances against federal agencies. Unions have already criticized Trump’s FLRA pick, Catherine Bird. National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon told Bloomberg Law that Bird, who formerly worked in the office of general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services, was “directly involved in the agency’s bad faith bargaining last year.” Reardon added that his union has filed four grievances against HHS for unfair labor practices. Even if Bird is confirmed, Bloomberg Law said she’ll have to process an extensive backlog of cases because the office has been vacant for two years.

Federal law also prohibits VA employees from going on strike, which further restricts AFGE’s options as it navigates contract negotiations. But Cann said that the union is considering other forms of direct action. “Getting people involved, doing petitions, doing informational rallies, applying pressure on the agency by pointing out their hypocrisy and their anti-union animus, reaching out to the handful of friends we have on the Hill, we plan on doing all of that,” he said, adding, “We’re counting on employees who care so much about the work they do as caregivers to veterans to be willing to stand up, and get involved in this campaign, and object to having their voices silenced.”

Trump admin considers deporting families with removal orders,https://www.channel3000.com,"['Priscilla Alvarez', 'Evan Perez', 'Pamela Brown', 'Jim Acosta']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.channel3000.com/news/politics/national-politics/trump-admin-considers-deporting-families-with-removal-orders/1077055999,"Evelio Contreras/CNN

The Trump administration is considering deporting migrant families with court-ordered removals, a move that senior Department of Homeland Security officials have resisted in the past, multiple officials tell CNN.

The idea, described as a way to ""send a message"" to smugglers, is ""under serious consideration,"" according to a senior administration official. Another source said there are ongoing discussions within the department. A separate source tells CNN no immediate action is being taken.

The Department of Homeland Security, suffering from a lack of resources, is unable to deport all those who are ordered to be removed from the country and has said it focuses on the people it deems the most dangerous.

However, that could change as a massive influx of migrant families make their way into the country illegally over the southern border.

As part of the consideration, the administration has been looking at an operation rolled out in the late years of Barack Obama's presidency -- and revived in President Donald Trump's first year in office -- that also targeted family units. Obama initially focused on felons.

White House senior adviser Stephen Miller has been a proponent of the new initiative, according to three US officials. The senior administration official said Miller wasn't alone in pushing for it.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had rejected the plan because the policy of the department was to prioritize criminals for deportation, said one of the officials. DHS, stung by the fallout over family separations, has been wary of public backlash for targeting families, according to the official.

But Miller has been pushing anew for the family deportations under acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the official added.

McAleenan has also been resisting it, one of the sources said. Part of the concern is that it could hurt negotiations with Democrats for Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding, which has been strapped for resources, as well as the political optics, according to the source.

The source said those resisting know that the storyline will be family separations once again. But the administration has been discussing and grappling with how to handle families who are defying court orders for removal or aren't showing up on their court dates.

The source said the administration has been looking at Obama-era policies such as Operation Border Guardian/Border Resolve, which targeted family units for removal amid an uptick in families and unaccompanied minors attempting to cross the border. DHS revived the operation early in the Trump administration.

There are no current plans to implement the targeting of families, the source added. The White House referred requests for comment to DHS. DHS declined to comment.

In April, nearly 100,000 migrants, many of whom were families, were apprehended at the southern border, according to Customs and Border Protection data.

There are ongoing discussions about the removal of families with orders at the agency level, according to a DHS official.

The families expected to be targeted are those who recently entered the United States and were placed in an expedited family docket, the official said.

Last year, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the nation's immigration courts, announced that it had begun tracking family cases filed by DHS in 10 immigration court locations: Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York City and San Francisco.

The cases are being expedited to try to process the families in under a year.

From September 24, 2018, through April 26, 2019, more than 40,000 cases were marked as so-called ""family-unit"" cases, a DHS designation, according to Executive Office for Immigration Review data. Roughly 8,000 cases have been marked completed. Of those, 7,724 cases ended with removal orders, 6,764 of which were ordered removed because they did not attend their immigration hearings."
