Trump Administration Hardens Its Attack on Climate Science,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Coral Davenport', 'Mark Landler']",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/us/politics/trump-climate-science.html,"The administration’s prime target has been the National Climate Assessment, produced by an interagency task force roughly every four years since 2000. Government scientists used computer-generated models in their most recent report to project that if fossil fuel emissions continue unchecked, the earth’s atmosphere could warm by as much as eight degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. That would lead to drastically higher sea levels, more devastating storms and droughts, crop failures, food losses and severe health consequences.

Work on the next report, which is expected to be released in 2021 or 2022, has already begun. But from now on, officials said, such worst-case scenario projections will not automatically be included in the National Climate Assessment or in some other scientific reports produced by the government.

“What we have here is a pretty blatant attempt to politicize the science — to push the science in a direction that’s consistent with their politics,” said Philip B. Duffy, the president of the Woods Hole Research Center, who served on a National Academy of Sciences panel that reviewed the government’s most recent National Climate Assessment. “It reminds me of the Soviet Union.”

In an email, James Hewitt, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, defended the proposed changes.

“The previous use of inaccurate modeling that focuses on worst-case emissions scenarios, that does not reflect real-world conditions, needs to be thoroughly re-examined and tested if such information is going to serve as the scientific foundation of nationwide decision-making now and in the future,” Mr. Hewitt said.

However, the goal of political appointees in the Trump administration is not just to change the climate assessment’s methodology, which has broad scientific consensus, but also to question its conclusions by creating a new climate review panel. That effort is led by a 79-year-old physicist who had a respected career at Princeton but has become better known in recent years for attacking the science of man-made climate change and for defending the virtues of carbon dioxide — sometimes to an awkward degree."
Trump Embraces Right-Wing One America News Network to Make Fox News Jealous,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Asawin Suebsaeng'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-embraces-right-wing-one-america-news-network-to-make-fox-news-jealous,"One evening last week, Neil W. McCabe, a Breitbart veteran who now works as a weekend White House correspondent at One America News Network (OAN), found himself in the lobby bar area of Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The hotel is a top hangout for Donald Trump’s fans, administration officials, campaign brass, Republican staffers, and the like. And as he mingled in the lobby, McCabe started talking to one of those denizens: Meredith Hope, an avowed Trump supporter and designer who runs a jewelry and accessories business in the Palm Beach and D.C. markets.

Hope, a “Trumpette,” showed McCabe one of the MAGA 2020 scarves she had designed, prompting him to praise her product and hand her his business card.

“Hey, OAN!” she said, after peeking at the card. “The president told me to watch One America News.”

McCabe was taken aback. “I said, ‘Really?’ and she said ‘Absolutely,’” he recalled.

Hope later corroborated the conversation to The Daily Beast, adding that when Trump had visited Mar-a-Lago this past Easter weekend, she exchanged a few words with the president. It was then that Trump started talking about different TV networks, and brought up OAN. The jewelry designer didn’t initially recognize the network’s name and asked the president about it.

“He then told me I should watch it, and complimented it,” Hope said.

Most news networks would shudder at receiving compliments from the powerful politicians they cover. But for OAN, it is a triumph.

For years, the channel has tried to supplant Fox as a dominant force in conservative media. For the past two years, it has prolifically churned out glowing coverage of the Trump administration and its achievements. OAN’s top executives have beseeched the president on Twitter to forget about Fox and to signal-boost them instead. And in the first year of Trump’s presidency, the network produced a commercial mocking CNN’s “Facts First” apple-and-banana ad campaign, and declaring OAN the “Real News.”

The overt flattery seems to be paying off. Fox News is still the president’s favorite media behemoth. But OAN’s team has been catching his eye. This year, Trump has tuned in more often than ever to OAN, two sources close to him say. There’s been a conspicuous uptick in his public promotion of OAN’s segments, including on his personal Twitter account. And, it appears, he’s even pitching the network to those roaming the halls at Mar-a-Lago.

Others outside the network have noticed this trend. According to a source familiar with the matter, over the last six months OAN has seen a clear rise in the number of groups strategically pitching stories to the channel in the hope of catching the president's attention. It’s similar to the way that activists and conservatives have often used their airtime on Fox News to get their causes in front of the cable news-obsessed president.

McCabe, for example, said that the legal team of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher—a Navy SEAL platoon leader set to stand trial for allegedly gunning down civilians and knifing a captured ISIS fighter—worked to get One America News to cover their story, as a way to get it noticed by sympathetic audiences including President Trump . McCabe, for his part, has interviewed Gallagher’s wife, attorney, and brother for OAN.

OAN wasn’t always a respected channel for those in and around Trump’s political orbit. In fact, the president himself use to routinely deride it. One former White House official recalled that early on in the administration, Trump described mocked OAN for the production value of its broadcasts: “Such great words, such awful visuals.”

According to another source, early last year Trump was sitting in the White House and killing time by flipping through TV channels. Soon enough, he landed on OAN, and paused for a moment and squinted at the screen while leaning in.

“What the hell is this?” Trump said, as he began critiquing what he saw as the poor production values and lighting of a particular show, according to this source with direct knowledge of the exchange. After roughly a minute of mocking the look of the right-wing, vehemently pro-Trump cable news network, the president clicked back to Fox.

Despite churning out content that left Trump unimpressed, OAN kept at it. The network, which was launched in 2013—two years before Trump’s makeover and takeover of the Republican Party—has produced flattering segments on “why Christians support Donald Trump,” why the supposed Obama-era “SPYGATE” effort to monitor the 2016 Trump campaign is the real scandal, and why the 45th president is one of the all-time American greats. Beyond the positive coverage, OAN also took to different forms of direct appeals. In late March, for instance, a seemingly bitter and snubbed network tweeted, “President Trump recently gave a speech, thanking his supporters in the media. Not a single mention of One America News -- one of his GREATEST [email protected] calls bullshit...” (The tweet has since been deleted.)

That Trump eventually warmed up to their product may affirm his love for praise of himself on TV. But multiple people—including those close to Trump—say there is a secondary motive as well: He wants to put Fox News in its place.

Over the past few months, Trump has repeatedly voiced his displeasure at certain on-air talent and journalists at Fox News, arguing that the cable channel has not shown the fealty he expects from a like-minded broadcaster. The Daily Beast reported last month that since at least March, the president has been telling White House officials to help him “keep an eye on” Fox News and to monitor it for even the slightest sign of a leftward shift.

Recently, President Trump knocked Fox for hosting 2020 Democratic hopefuls, such as Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), for town hall events. And earlier this month, Trump whipped up his crowd at a Pennsylvania rally into booing Fox, alleging to the audience, “They’re putting more Democrats on than Republicans,” and that “something strange is going on at Fox, folks! Something very strange!”

The president’s embrace of OAN, one source close to Trump said, was in part done to make the Fox News brass jealous, with the source comparing the situation to showing off a new girlfriend.

If the brass at OAN had any problems being the president’s fallback lover, they haven’t shown it. If anything, they’ve viewed it as an opportunity. “Fox News has hired Paul Ryan and Donna Brazile. Is [CNN’s] Jim Acosta next?” Robert Herring, OAN’s chief executive, posted to Twitter in March, tagging, “@realDonaldTrump” for good measure. In November, Herring announced his network would file an amicus brief in favor of the Trump administration when CNN sued President Trump over Acosta’s revoked White House “hard pass” press credential. (Fox News, for its part, sided with CNN in this case.)

Staff at OAN have done everything they can to maintain close ties to the upper echelons of Trumpworld, even when it ends up backfiring. Shortly after Trump won, OAN and Herring jumped at the chance to hire his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. It took barely half a year for OAN to fire Lewandowski, in part because he angered OAN leadership by continuing to appear frequently on competitors—such as Fox. Last year, OAN brought on board Carter Page—the former Trump campaign foreign-policy adviser who found himself at the center of multiple probes into potential ties between Team Trump and Russian officials—to host his very own TV special. And according to a source familiar with the situation, OAN approached Hope Hicks, Trump’s former comms czar, about taking a position at the network, shortly after it was announced that she would depart the White House. Hicks declined (though she did recommend other Trumpy names for a possible OAN gig). She eventually ended up landing a top comms position at the corporate parent of Fox News.

As One America News forges its path in the Trump era, it’s increasingly adopted the traits of the president it supports and defends: chief among them, a clear antagonism toward media that isn’t fully in the tank for Trumpism.

Reached for comment on this story, OAN president Charles Herring, Robert’s son, told The Daily Beast, “Let’s not kid ourselves, anything that you write will be negative. I don’t see any effort to ‘report,’ but rather attack. I realize that ‘advocacy’ is your primary mission.”

The younger Herring then proceeded to plug some rehearsal footage for the then upcoming OAN show, Headlines Tonight with Drew Berquist, a right-wing comedy show about the day’s big headlines, and then said, “One America News outperforms CNN Headline News, CNBC, Fox Business, Bloomberg, Fusion, BBC World News and others.”

Trump: 'Sleepy Joe Biden' hasn't 'apologized' for involvement in 1994 crime law,https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-sleepy-joe-biden-1994-crime-law,"President Trump late Monday criticized former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner among Democrats seeking to unseat Trump in 2020, for his support of a controversial 1994 crime bill, saying he hasn't ""apologized"" for supporting it.

Trump tweeted that his own criminal justice reform legislation - The First Step Act - ""had tremendous support"" and ""fixed"" problems in the law Biden championed.

Biden, who in the late 1980s became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee as Delaware senator, said at the time his aim was to pass legislation that would combat violent crime.

The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, signed by then-President Bill Clinton, was seen by many analysts as the culmination of efforts of those like Biden.

BIDEN TOPS TRUMP BY DOUBLE DIGITS IN NEW PENNSYLVANIA POLL

However, in the decades that followed, critics blamed the law for an increase in prison populations among other developments.

A 2015 headline in the New York Times, published in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, claimed that Biden's ""role in '90s crime law could haunt any presidential bid.""

In his tweet Monday, Trump claimed African-Americans ""will not be able to vote"" for Biden because of his support for the crime bill.

""I, on the other hand, was responsible for criminal justice reform, which had tremendous support, [and] helped fix the bad 1994 bill,"" Trump continued.

Trump claimed ""anyone associated"" with the bill ""will not have a chance of being elected.""

He revisited his recent nickname for the former vice president, labeling him ""Sleepy Joe Biden"" in the tweet.

""That was a dark period in American history,"" Trump wrote. ""But has Sleepy Joe apologized? No.""

In 2016, Hillary Clinton, then a presidential candidate, apologized for some of the law's ""unintended"" consequences but stood by what she called the ""positive aspects,"" like its efforts to prevent violence against women. Clinton was first lady at the time of the crime bill's passage.

Iran hits out at US after Trump nuclear weapons comment,https://www.aljazeera.com,[],,,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/iran-hits-trump-nuclear-weapons-comment-190527234526280.html,"Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has hit out at the United States after President Donald Trump said Washington was not looking for ""regime change"" in Iran but was only interested in preventing Tehran from getting nuclear weapons.

In a Twitter post on Monday, Zarif insisted Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons and accused the US, which has recently beefed up its military presence in the Middle East, of causing regional tensions and ""hurting the Iranian people"".

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ""long ago said we're not seeking nuclear weapons - by issuing a fatwa (edict) banning them"", Zarif tweeted.

Ayatollah @khamenei_ir long ago said we're not seeking nuclear weapons—by issuing a fatwa (edict) banning them.#B_Team's #EconomicTerrorism is hurting the Iranian people & causing tension in the region. Actions—not words—will show whether or not that's @realDonaldTrump's intent — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) May 27, 2019

His comments came after Trump said on Monday during a trip to Japan that a deal with Iran on its nuclear programme was possible, crediting economic sanctions for curbing activities Washington has said are behind a spate of attacks in the Middle East.

190515103122141

""We aren't looking for regime change - I just want to make that clear. We are looking for no nuclear weapons,"" Trump told reporters during a news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo.

""I really believe that Iran would like to make a deal, and I think that's very smart of them, and I think that's a possibility to happen,"" he said.

""It has a chance to be a great country with the same leadership.""

In response, Zarif tweeted: ""Actions - not words - will show whether or not that's @realDonaldTrump's intent,"" Zarif added, referencing the US president's Twitter handle.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in October the US was seeking ""regime change"" in Iran, adding that the Trump administration was the most hostile that the Islamic Republic had faced in its four decades.

Al Jazeera's Zein Basravi, reporting from Tehran, said Iranian leaders were likely ""to see the softer rhetoric from Trump as insincere, pointing to aggressive economic sanctions and a military build-up in the region as the true measures of US intentions towards to Iran"".

He added: ""Experts say that in the absence of any real goals, talking with the US would be just for the sake of talking. So as long as a reduction of sanctions remains highly unlikely Iranian leaders are expected to maintain the policy of not negotiating with the Trump White House.

""For the moment, they are focusing their diplomatic energy on reaching out to regional partners to try to strike up some kind of security cooperation that endeavours to elbow out the US.""

Tensions have risen between the two countries after a US decision earlier this month to send an aircraft carrier attack force and B-52 bombers in a show of force against what Washington's leaders said they believed was an imminent Iranian plan to attack US assets.

The US, a firm backer of Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia, has also announced plans to deploy an additional 1,500 troops to the Middle East, prompting fears of a conflict.

190526091112937

It says the latest reinforcements are in response to a ""campaign"" of recent attacks including a rocket launched into the Green Zone in Baghdad, explosive devices that damaged four tankers near the entrance to the Gulf, and drone attacks by Yemeni rebels on a key Saudi oil pipeline.

Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks.

Trump, on a four-day visit to Japan, welcomed Abe's help in dealing with Iran after broadcaster NHK said the prime minister was considering a trip to Tehran as early as mid-June. Iran said a visit was unlikely in the near future.

""I know for a fact that the prime minister is very close with the leadership of Iran, and we'll see what happens,"" Trump said.

At his joint news conference with Trump, Abe said Japan would do what it could on the Iran issue.

Trump last year withdrew the US from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, and is ratcheting up sanctions seeking to end Iran's international sales of crude oil and strangle its economy.

Japan was a major buyer of Iranian oil for decades before US sanctions which Trump said were taking effect.

""They were fighting in many locations,"" he said of Iran. ""Now they are pulling back because they have serious economic problems."""
Trade War Sparks Fears of China Weaponizing U.S. Treasuries,https://www.ozy.com,['Joe Rennison'],,,,https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/trade-war-sparks-fears-of-china-weaponizing-us-treasuries/94604,"Beijing’s recent sales of securities are triggering concerns that it might dump U.S. securities for leverage in the ongoing spat with Washington.

It was an unnerving piece of data for investors two weeks back, buried halfway down an esoteric spreadsheet released by the U.S. government that tracks how many Treasuries foreign investors buy and sell. China, the largest foreign creditor to the U.S. government with total Treasury holdings in excess of $1.2 trillion, sold $20 billion of securities with a maturity exceeding one year in March, according to U.S. government data. The sales amounted to China’s largest retreat from the market in more than two years.

The move came shortly before tensions over trade between Beijing and Washington heated up again, with the U.S. slapping additional tariffs on the country’s imports, and Chinese officials retaliating with measures of their own. What’s more, the sales could not be explained away by the typical ebb and flow of China’s Treasury holdings that result from managing its large reserves to keep the currency stable.

If China starts dumping its Treasuries, it would cause huge financial instability. Mark Sobel, former Treasury Department official

The data reignited fears that Beijing may weaponize its holdings as part of the trade war, wreaking havoc with the biggest bond market in the world, pushing interest rates higher and increasing the U.S. government’s cost of borrowing.

“If China starts dumping its Treasuries, it would cause huge financial instability,” says Mark Sobel, a former Treasury Department official who spent nearly four decades at the agency, adding that he considered this an unlikely scenario.

China’s holdings of Treasuries are inextricably linked to the country’s trade with the U.S. China receives dollars in payment for its exports to America, and then needs to invest that money somewhere. The Treasury market has long been China’s destination of choice because the market is not only big enough to host its enormous reserves but it also offers a better return than other supersafe investments. Moreover, China avoids currency fluctuations that could come from selling those dollars to buy other assets.

As a result, China’s Treasury holdings typically dip if its reserves fall. It has also sold Treasuries over the past year to support its beaten-down currency, as tariff talk has intensified. On this occasion, though, neither of those forces appears to have been a factor. To some analysts, it seems as though China simply decided to sell.

“One should take notice of a month of sales during a period when reserves appear to be stable by most indicators,” says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Treasury Department official. “It is certainly something that warrants attention.”

While concerns are mounting, investors and analysts are wary of jumping to conclusions. Setser cautioned that the March data is a snapshot and not yet a trend. Moreover, few see any alternative for China, other than remaining invested in Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is currently 2.42 percent, well above the negative yields on equivalent German and Japanese sovereign bonds and still markedly higher than the 1.03 percent offered on 10-year gilts in the U.K. Other markets are also much smaller than the U.S. Treasury market, meaning they would struggle to digest any inflows from China’s massive holdings.

“Even if this were to be a threat, it’s a very noncredible one,” says Sonal Desai, chief investment officer for fixed income at Franklin Templeton in California. “What else [is China] going to buy?”

Meanwhile, there are few signs that recent bouts of selling by China have pushed U.S. interest rates higher. In the second half of 2011, China ramped up its sales of Treasuries but interest rates dropped too. The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled from a peak of 3.74 percent earlier in the year to 1.88 percent by the year-end, amid a general bout of risk aversion caused by Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.

In 2016, China sought to prop up its currency and sold a net $160 billion of long-term Treasuries, with its holdings hitting the lowest since 2010 in November that year. Ten-year interest rates did rise in the U.S. — from 2.30 percent to 2.44 percent over the course of the year — but that seemed spurred primarily by the election of President Donald Trump, which brought renewed hopes of growth for the economy.

In March this year, during the latest round of selling, the 10-year Treasury yield slipped 30 basis points over the month to 2.41 percent.

Still, few disagree that if China wanted to cause an upset in U.S. interest rates by heavy selling of Treasuries, it probably could. The catch is that it would lead to a revaluation of the country’s own U.S. bonds as it sold.

“China selling its Treasury holdings is a nuclear option, because it will hurt their own portfolio,” says Shawn Matthews, a former Cantor Fitzgerald trading head who launched his own hedge fund, Hondius Capital Management, last year.

“It depends on what the goal is,” says Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. “If the goal is to disturb the U.S. Treasury market, then they may not care about inflicting self-harm.”"

TRI-CITIES (WJHL) - The United States Department of Labor has accepted a letter from the USDA, saying the Forest Service will withdraw from operating Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (CCC).

According to a release from the U.S. Labor Department, ""this action creates an opportunity to serve a greater number of students at higher performing centers at a lower cost to taxpayers by modernizing and reforming part of the Job Corps program.""

The USDA says the mission for CCCs is to ""train eligible youth, ages 16 to 24 with educational, social and vocational skills, while assisting in the conservation of the Nation's public natural resources.""

A review was performed at all CCCs going over outcome measurements, internal controls, ongoing needs, and other items.

According to the department, 16 centers will continue under a new contract operator or partnership.

Locally, Jacobs Creek CCC will continue to operate in Bristol, Tennessee.

The 16 centers under new management are featured below:

Angell CCC in Yachats, Oregon; Boxelder CCC in Nemo, South Dakota; Centennial CCC in Nampa, Idaho; Collbran CCC in Collbran, Colorado; Columbia Basin CCC in Moses Lake, Washington; Curlew CCC in Curlew, Washington; Great Onyx CCC in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky; Harpers Ferry CCC in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; Lyndon Johnson CCC in Franklin, North Carolina; Jacobs Creek CCC in Bristol, Tennessee; Mingo CCC in Puxico, Missouri; Pine Ridge CCC in Chadron, Nebraska; Schenck CCC in Pisgah Forest, North Carolina; Trapper Creek CCC in Darby, Montana; Weber Basin CCC in Ogden, Utah; and Wolf Creek CCC in Glide, Oregon.

A Federal Register notice will propose nine CCCs to close. Locally, the Flatwoods CCC in Coeburn, Virginia will be up for deactivation.

The nine CCCs up for deactivation are: Anaconda CCC in Anaconda, Montana; Blackwell CCC in Laona, Wisconsin; Cass CCC in Ozark, Arkansas; Flatwoods CCC in Coeburn, Virginia; Fort Simcoe CCC in White Swan, Washington; Frenchburg CCC in Frenchburg, Kentucky; Oconaluftee CCC in Cherokee, North Carolina; Pine Knot CCC in Pine Knot, Kentucky; and Timber Lake CCC in Estacada, Oregon."
"Edmund Morris, acclaimed presidential biographer of Roosevelt and Reagan, has died at 78",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Brian Pascus'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/edmund-morris-died-acclaimed-biographer-presidents-theodore-roosevelt-ronald-reagan-dead-age-78/,"Edmund Morris, the famed author who wrote acclaimed presidential biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, died Friday in Danbury, Connecticut, according to The New York Times. The cause of death was not disclosed, though The Times did report the 78-year-old was at a hospital following a stroke he suffered Thursday.

Morris was a true master of biographical literature. He won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and the 1980 National Book Award for biography for his first book, ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt."" The book was the first in a trilogy of works exploring the 26th president's life, the others being ""Theodore Rex,"" published in 2001 and ""Colonel Roosevelt,"" published in 2010.

Edmund Morris, author of ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" poses at Random House in New York, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 1999. Morris said he welcomes the controversy over the literary technique he uses in the biography, in which he makes himself a fictional character in Reagan's early life and invents a few other people, too. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler) MARTY LEDERHANDLER

In 1999, he published his most controversial work, ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" an authorized biography written in an experimental style. Starting in 1985, Morris had been granted ""fly-on-the-wall"" privileges by the Reagan White House, allowing him to interview the President and First Lady and their children. He wrote the biography to include a fictional Edmund Morris who was added to the narrative as an observer and one of Reagan's childhood friends. Within the book, the fictional Edmund Morris told the story of the 40th president's life from his childhood in Illinois to the White House. While some praised the book, others were not so kind.

Morris was born May 27, 1940 in Nairobi, Kenya, the son of South African parents. He married Sylvia Jukes Morris in 1968. According to the author's Penguin Random House biography page, Morris worked as an advertising copywriter in London before immigrating to the United States in 1968. His other biographies included a work on Ludwig von Beethoven titled ""Beethoven: The Universal Composer"" as well as a collection of essays.

According to The New York Times, he is survived by his wife, a brother, Eric and a sister, Judy Davidowitz."
Department of Homeland Security Detains Miami Activist at Homestead Facility for Migrant Children,https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Brittany Shammas'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/homestead-shelter-for-migrant-children-alessandra-mondolfi-detained-by-homeland-security-11181156,"Alessandra Mondolfi was painting hearts on a poster board outside of the Homestead child migrant camp last Friday when she spotted a pair of law enforcement officers walking toward her. An artist and activist who's part of a group of protesters maintaining an almost daily presence outside the facility, Mondolfi was working on a memorial to migrant children who have died in custody. ""Here they come,"" one of the other activists said as the officers approached.

The two men — one in a Department of Homeland Security police uniform, the other in plainclothes — asked Mondolfi her name, then pushed her against a car and cuffed her, she says. They then allegedly put her in the back of a car and questioned her for about an hour, asking, bizarrely, whether she had aliases or a neck tattoo, and if she knew the names of the other protesters. Then, about an hour after first approaching Mondolfi, the men let her go.

Days later, it's still unclear why she was detained. DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Mondolfi says the Miami-Dade Police Department and, weirdly, the Miami-Dade Schools Police, sent squad cars to the scene. The El Paso Police Department has a warrant out for Mondolfi's arrest over a protest she and other activists held at the U.S. Border Patrol Museum. But why would DHS be involved in a state-level case?

Mondolfi has a theory for why she was detained: it was done to rattle her after months of protesting. She notes it was her group that spotted John Kelly — former Homeland Security chief and White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump — touring the shelter last month, around the same time congresswomen were being denied entry. Soon after his visit became public, CBS News confirmed Kelly had joined the board of Caliburn International, the for-profit company that runs the place.

""They are trying to scare me, intimidate me,"" Mondolfi says.

Her detainment comes amidst a series of instances of the government watching and prosecuting protesters. Earlier this year, the Intercept revealed that DHS had monitored anti-family separation protests held across the country, treating them as if they were security threats. A contractor working with the agency reviewed demonstrations across South Florida, from West Palm Beach to Miami. The information was shared with DHS and state-level law enforcement.

Meanwhile, two University of Arizona students were arrested in late March for protesting the appearance of Customs and Border Protection officers. The Arizona Republic reported they were among people who stood outside the event calling the officials “murderers” and “an extension of the K.K.K.” A group of protesters followed the agents as they left the presentation, calling them ""Murder Patrol."" Anti-Dakota Access Pipeline protesters have also been arrested.

At the Homestead shelter, another protester was detained on April 24. That day, MDPD officers handcuffed a New York man named Joshua Rubin and put him in the back of a squad car. Rubin said the cops told him he was being stopped on suspicion of trespassing. He refused to give them his name, he said, because he was on a county road. Eventually he identified himself and was released. MDPD told New Times it had no record of Rubin's detainment.

""You have to expect, when you're protesting, that people are going to try and get you to go away,"" said Rubin, who for months held a one-man vigil outside a camp for migrant teenagers in Texas. ""But the extent to which it's happening here is more extreme.""

Mondolfi says Homeland Security officers began showing up at the facility several weeks ago. When the two men approached her last Friday, they asked for her ID, but it was in her car. She says she asked to go get it, but instead ended up in the back of a police car being questioned. The MDPD and schools police cars showed up.

Daisy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, tells New Times there is no record of a call for service on that date, and questioned whether a photo provided by protesters was actually taken on the date in question. MDPD did not respond to a request for information.

USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"
47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans,https://www.npr.org,['Cat Schuknecht'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727002406/47-states-call-on-betsy-devos-to-forgive-student-loans-for-disabled-veterans,"47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Updated Sunday at 2:14 p.m. ET

On Friday, three days before Memorial Day, attorneys general for 47 states wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to automatically forgive student loans for eligible disabled veterans.

The Department of Education has identified more than 42,000 veterans who qualify for a federal program known as Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, or TPD, that offers to relieve borrowers from repaying certain government student loans. These veterans, the letter says, shoulder over $1 billion in education debt that could be forgiven.

To get the benefit, veterans must first apply for the program. According to information obtained by the group Veterans Education Success through a Freedom of Information Act request, almost 60 percent of eligible veterans had defaulted on a loan payment as of April 2018. Yet only about 20 percent had applied to the loan forgiveness program.

The attorneys general want that to change. In the letter — which was also signed by attorneys general for the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories — they propose making the forgiveness program automatic for veterans who have been identified by the Department of Education.

""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,"" the letter reads. ""There is no statutory or legal requirement that the Department of Education demand that eligible veterans affirmatively apply for TPD discharges before the Department will forgive their loans.""

In a statement to NPR, the Education Department said it recognized the sacrifices that veterans make for their country, adding that it has worked to streamline the TPD discharge process.

""While we have worked to make this process as easy and as seamless as possible for veterans, the last thing we want to do is cause unintended consequences for them,"" according to the statement.

The department said discharges could raise veterans' tax bills or inhibit them from taking out more student loans.

In their letter to DeVos, the attorneys general dismissed the department's concern about increasing borrowers' tax bills.

""[F]ederal tax law now excludes loan discharges for disabled borrowers from taxable income, and most states' tax codes do likewise,"" said the letter. ""Moreover, we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill.""

The letter from the attorneys general follows at least two other similar letters that Republican and Democratic members of Congress sent to DeVos last year."
Trump Takes Credit for Obama’s Gains for Vets,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/05/27/trump-takes-credit-for-obamas-gains-for-vets/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful on the occasion of Memorial Day, President Donald Trump and his Veterans Affairs secretary are claiming full credit for health care improvements that were underway before they took office.

Trump said he passed a private-sector health care program, Veterans Choice, after failed attempts by past presidents for the last “45 years.” That’s not true. The Choice program, which allows veterans to see doctors outside the government-run VA system at taxpayer expense, was first passed in 2014 under President Barack Obama.

Trump’s VA secretary, Robert Wilkie, also is distorting the facts. Faulting previous “bad leadership” at VA, Wilkie suggested it was his own efforts that improved waiting times at VA medical centers and brought new offerings of same-day mental health service. The problem: The study cited by Wilkie on wait times covers the period from 2014 to 2017, before Wilkie took the helm as VA secretary. Same-day mental health services at VA were started during the Obama administration under Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin.

A look at the claims:

TRUMP: “We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability to give our veterans the care that they deserve and they have been trying to pass these things for 45 years.” — Montoursville, Pennsylvania, rally on May 20.

THE FACTS: Wrong. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to get Congress to pass Veterans Choice; Obama did it in the wake of a scandal at VA’s medical center in Phoenix, where some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) to a VA facility.

Trump did expand eligibility for the program. Now, starting June 6, veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.

Still, VA’s top health official, Dr. Richard Stone, described the new program’s start to “almost be a non-event” in testimony to Congress. That’s in part because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at VA. In 2018, 34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians, down from 36 percent in 2017.

Also key to the Choice program’s success is an overhaul of VA’s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of them with private physicians, a process expected to take up to 10 years. Wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded Choice program is “years” away.

WILKIE: “The first thing I did was change out the leadership at VA. … (The president) also allowed me to change out leadership in the VA centers. If someone wasn’t walking the post, getting to know the people who work for her or him, or getting to know those veterans, they had to leave. And, as a result, the Journal of the American Medical Association this year said that our waiting times are now as good or better than any in the private sector.” — interview Thursday with Fox News.

THE FACTS: It’s true that a study by the medical association came out in January that found wait times at VA medical centers on average were better than the private sector. But the improvement wasn’t a “result” of anything that Wilkie did: The study involved a period largely covering the Obama administration — and before Wilkie became acting VA secretary in late March 2018.

In fact, in a VA press release in January announcing the study’s results, Wilkie credits the department’s “concerted” effort to improve access to care “since 2014.”

The study covered four specialties, primary care, dermatology, cardiology and orthopedics.

It found that in 2014, the average wait time at VA medical centers was 22.5 days, compared with 18.7 days in the private sector, which was not statistically different. By 2017, the wait time at VA improved to 17.7 days, while increasing to 29.8 days for private doctors. Wait times at VA medical centers were shorter in all specialties except orthopedics.

According to the study, the number of patients seen yearly in VA increased slightly between 2014 and 2017, to about 5.1 million. VA patient satisfaction also rose, according to patient surveys cited in the study.

WILKIE: The VA “had suffered from bad leadership. And that’s a bipartisan comment. And the second thing I had to do was make sure that as we approach our veteran population that we make sure that they are at the center, their needs are at the center of what we do … I think we’ve had it backwards at VA for many years. … One of the things that we’re doing at VA is that we have same-day mental health service. … It is huge.” — interview with Fox News.

THE FACTS: Same-day mental health service started at VA before Trump took office in January 2017, let alone Wilkie.

VA’s effort to provide same-day primary and mental-health care when medically necessary at every VA medical center was publicized in April 2016 under the Obama administration. At the time, Shulkin was helping lead the effort as VA’s top health official. By late 2016, the department’s blog announced that the goal of same-day mental health services would be achieved by year’s end.

A Dec. 23, 2016, article in the Harvard Business Review cites new same-day services at all VA hospitals as evidence of notable progress at the department. Shulkin, who was then named by Trump to be his VA secretary, told Congress in late January 2017 the services already were fully in place.

Trump selected Wilkie to be his VA secretary after firing Shulkin in March 2018 because of ethics charges and internal rebellion at the department over the role of private care for veterans. Trump’s initial replacement choice, White House doctor Ronny Jackson, withdrew after allegations of workplace misconduct surfaced. While Wilkie has been credited by both parties in Congress for bringing stability to the department, the VA improvements he attributes to himself this past week are misplaced."
Mark Meadows views fresh 'Strzok coverup' material at DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-views-fresh-strzok-coverup-material-at-doj,"Rep. Mark Meadows said he was at the Justice Department to review new information about former FBI agent Peter Strzok.

The North Carolina Republican was spotted at Justice Department headquarters in D.C. with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday.

Asked by a reporter why he was there, Meadows said, ""I was reviewing text messages and new correspondence that pertains to the Strzok coverup.""

Hours after their visit, President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Meadows and Jordan's visit to the Justice Department also comes after House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes said he learned that an August 2016 text from Strzok about an ""insurance policy"" had to do with the FBI's use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Both Strzok and Lisa Page, who are no longer with the FBI, have been a focus of GOP investigators concerned about potential bias within the Justice Department and FBI."

WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show that Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog.

The decision by Mr. Pruitt was notable because it came as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was campaigning for a third term and trying to bring a Foxconn factory, and thousands of new manufacturing jobs, to a part of the state where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.

Mr. Walker ultimately lost his re-election bid to Tony Evers, a Democrat. And Foxconn , the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, announced in January that it was reconsidering its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, though the company later said it would build a smaller factory in the state.

But, in spring 2018, as the governor’s race was heating up, Mr. Walker championed the Foxconn deal and the 13,000 jobs it promised to create. The factory, however, also threatened to create a new source of pollution in the region."

Among the charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images legal DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

Story Continued Below

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

USDA to shift some inspector tasks to pork plant workers — in everything but name,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

The Agriculture Department is attempting to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

At a Smithfield hog plant in central Illinois, federal meat inspectors examine pig carcasses on the slaughter line, remove diseased and contaminated meat, and mark it “condemned.” They have the exclusive responsibility for performing this work.

At another hog plant about 75 miles away, JBS USA Food Co. employees are part of a long-running test program in which they perform tasks similar to those done by federal inspectors. When plant employees do this food safety work, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says they are “sorting” and “removing” or “disposing” of the meat, not inspecting or condemning it.

The shift in language is central to the USDA’s efforts to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors.

The proposed new inspection system transfers some responsibilities that traditionally have been handled by USDA inspectors to employees of pork plants. The USDA says it has studied the new inspection system for 20 years and that pork products from the test plants are at least as safe as those produced by traditional inspection. They say federal inspectors will spend less time visually assessing pork and more time ensuring sanitary conditions are maintained throughout the plant.

Several food safety lawyers, Democratic members of Congress and a former agriculture official say that the USDA is using sleight-of-hand tactics to get around legal mandates that have been in place for more than a century. Those mandates require federal regulators to inspect — and either pass or condemn — every live hog that arrives at a slaughterhouse and every hog carcass on the slaughter line.

“They are playing these linguistics games,” said Rena Steinzor, a food safety expert who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “What they are doing is illegal. If they have a problem with the statute because they think it’s a waste of energy for federal inspectors to eyeball every single animal, they could go to Congress. . . . The Constitution requires them to do that, not gut the law by regulation.”

The test hog-inspection program is expected to expand this summer after the agency approves new rules. Certain pork plants would have the option of using the new inspection system. Thirty-five plants plan to join the five test plants in using the new program; they would produce 90 percent of the pork consumed in the United States.

The number of federal inspectors on hog slaughter lines at the plants new to the program will be reduced from 365 to 218, a 40 percent cut, according to a USDA analysis published in the Federal Register. The overall number of inspectors at those plants will drop from 400 to 288, a decline of 28 percent, according to figures provided by the USDA.

The new rules will allow slaughter-line speeds to run as fast as the plant desires. The current cap on line speed is 1,106 hogs per hour, or 18 per minute.

Records show there have been no serious public health problems or pork food poisoning outbreaks linked to the test plants. Critics of the test plants say they have more food safety problems than the traditional plants; the USDA disputes that.

A half-dozen food safety groups, along with the USDA inspectors’ union, say they are concerned that increased line speeds and federal staff reductions on those lines will cause diseased and contaminated meat to slip by the remaining inspectors. They also cite an inherent conflict of interest among plant employees because they work for pork producers and not the public. Training for those workers, they point out, is also done entirely at the plant owners’ discretion.

Pat Basu, a former chief veterinarian for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) who retired in 2018, is critical of the proposed regulation. He says the agency is using semantic tricks as it reassigns duties to plant employees that the law says inspectors should perform.

“These are word games they are playing,” Basu said. “What they are really doing is removing hogs that are diseased and contaminated. Why are these suddenly not inspections?”

USDA officials say that they are modernizing the inspection process and that the new system will not violate existing laws and regulations. They say the agency has the authority to change how federal inspections are performed so long as a carcass-by-carcass inspection is performed on all of the hogs presented by the plant as fit for human consumption.

“In the proposed rules, we are just giving the plant employees the opportunity to more fully execute their [food safety] plan before we make that final verification that the product is safe,” said Phil Bronstein, an assistant administrator with the FSIS.

Bronstein acknowledged that under the proposed rules, the number of USDA inspectors on the slaughter line in most large plants will be reduced from seven to three. Bronstein said the remaining inspectors would be more experienced and have a higher level of training. Also, the number of USDA inspectors who will roam large plants to ensure sanitation procedures are in place and to check on animal welfare will grow from one to two, officials said.

At least 17 members of Congress, all Democrats, have stated their opposition to the new system. “It is appalling to watch the Trump Administration and [USDA] leadership justify their gutting of hog slaughter inspections with meaningless technicalities and semantics,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee and chair of the Food Safety Caucus, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Who do they think they are fooling? This giveaway to corporate special interests means company-based employees will carry out responsibilities that are currently performed by government inspectors.”

Defining inspection

In addition to the term “condemnation,” other transferred tasks have also been given different names under the proposed new program, records show.

For example, when plant workers have examined a hog’s head and internal organs, looking for and removing signs of disease and contamination, they have “trimmed dressing defects and contamination, and identified pathology defects on the carcasses,” the proposed regulation says. They have not inspected the animal, the USDA says.

“The agency has trivialized what we have done and what we do by calling it sorting and other consumer protections,” said Charles “Stan” Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which represents inspectors. “The plant workers are clearly expected to do food safety inspections.” Painter said that given the increased role plant workers will have on slaughter lines, he believes federal inspectors are “now nothing more than window dressing at the end of the line.”

The USDA has long used different terminology for the same tasks, depending on whether they were performed by federal inspectors or employees in the test plants. But it has become more steadfast in asserting the need for others to adopt its language, and the proposed new inspection system has focused attention on the matter.

The proposed regulation emphasizes that plant employees’ primary jobs involve “non-food safety standards concerned primarily with diseases of no public health significance.”

However, records show that nearly every transferred task involves food safety issues. For example, when plant workers are removing defects, such as blemishes, from a carcass, they might also trim abscesses that could be a sign of a serious disease or trim spots with fecal contamination that may contain dangerous pathogens.

When they remove internal organs and examine them, they are looking for signs of disease such as septicemia, which would mean the entire carcass could be filled with harmful bacteria.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

“They are, in a sense, performing part of the inspection process, doing a pre-screening,” said Daniel Kovich, director of science and technology with the National Pork Producers Council. “Yes, they are looking at it, and they are supposed to move things from the line that are not supposed to pass inspection. But only FSIS can inspect an animal.”

In an interview, USDA officials acknowledged that many of the tasks handled by plant workers would be related to food safety but said they are not inspections.

Although there is no cap on how fast line speeds may run, the USDA anticipates about a 12.5 percent increase at the large plants under the new system, records show.

Zach Corrigan, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Food & Water Watch, said that means the fewer remaining inspectors would need to examine an average of 6.1 heads per minute versus about 2.7 heads per minute in the traditional system.

Corrigan said the new system places a heavy burden on the USDA inspectors who remain on the line and must inspect every carcass. He said the new system will sometimes make it impossible for the USDA to comply with the law.

“The definition of inspection is a ‘critical appraisal,’ ” said Corrigan, citing a 2000 court case that dealt with USDA inspections. “That legal threshold cannot be met when you remove inspectors from the lines and you increase the line speeds.” He called the USDA’s varying terms for the same food safety tasks “Orwellian doublespeak.”

The USDA said a 2002 legal ruling found that the hog test program did not violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act. However, that court decision was limited to the test program and said it “may not necessarily foreshadow the outcome of judicial review of such future regulations.”

The USDA says only a federal inspector or veterinarian has the power to place the department’s mark of inspection on the pork — under the traditional and the alternative new system.

The department also says the word “inspection” is a technical term and can be applied only to situations in which a USDA inspector or veterinarian has performed a food safety oversight task. At meat plants, veterinarians are typically the highest-ranking federal official.

In response to a recent Washington Post article that said the proposed rules would shift much of the power and responsibility for food safety inspections at hog plants to plant employees, the USDA wrote: “By law, only federal inspection personnel conduct inspections of animals, carcasses and parts — and USDA inspection personnel inspect every carcass and part before it leaves the slaughterhouse and processing plant.”

However, inside the test pork plants, USDA inspectors use the term “inspector” — as in “TS [trimming and sorting] inspector” — to refer to their plant employee counterparts. For example, in a 2013 citation for a food safety violation, a USDA inspector said a diseased hog had “passed all three of your TS inspectors” without them spotting the problem, and the carcass had to be condemned.

And in job advertisements, owners of the test pork plants consistently call some employees inspectors or use the word inspector in job descriptions. In a recent job posting by JBS, “quality control inspector” was used as a job title, and it said tasks include performing “various quality control functions including but not limited to line inspection, audits.” JBS did not respond to several requests for comment.

Spotting problems

Five USDA inspectors said in sworn affidavits, taken by the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, that plant workers routinely miss problems in the test plants that they believe are potential food hazards.

They also said plant workers aren’t in a position to stand up to plant supervisors when they do spot problems.

“On numerous occasions, I witnessed them fail to spot abscesses, lesions, fecal matter and other defects that would render an animal unsafe or unwholesome,” said one inspector, who was not named. “Furthermore, plant inspectors don’t actually want to shut off the line to deal with the problems they spot on the job. . . . Obviously their employer will terminate them if they do it too many times.”

Outside evaluations of the test plants have exposed problems. The most recent review was done in 2018 by Food & Water Watch. In its assessment, the group compared USDA inspection reports from the five test plants with those of five comparably sized traditional plants.

The group received copies of citations from 2013 to 2016 through a Freedom of Information Act request. In all, more than 3,500 citations were issued by USDA inspectors to the 10 plants. Food & Water Watch determined that 73 percent of citations issued for a carcass contaminated with feces, bile, hair or dirt were at the five test plants.

In the five test plants, 32 citations were issued after inspectors spotted carcasses that were “so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.” Five comparably sized traditional hog plants received no citations for this offense, which is considered to be one of the most serious food safety violations because it can lead to possible recalls and food-poisoning outbreaks.

Carmen Rottenberg, who runs the FSIS, said the evaluation was not a meaningful comparison. She said citations to the test plants were higher because plant workers had assumed more responsibilities. When they fail to properly perform these new jobs, she said, the plants are then cited for those failures.

“We are holding the plants accountable for a lot more tasks,” Rottenberg said.

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Inspection reports illustrate some of the problems USDA inspectors found with the work done by plant employees.

At one test pork plant in Michigan, employees assigned to remove sick and diseased live hogs overlooked one that had collapsed and died, then presented it to USDA inspectors as fit for slaughter.

At an Illinois test plant, its workers failed to identify more than a dozen abscesses in the internal organs of a slaughtered hog — a clear sign that the entire carcass was contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

And in Minnesota, employees at a test plant overlooked patches of yellow and green material on the chest wall and hindquarters of a hog carcass. It was fecal matter that could have contained dangerous pathogens.

The Food & Water Watch evaluation followed two independent government audits of the test program that were critical of the alternative inspection system. In 2013, the USDA’s inspector general found that three of the five test plants were among the worst in the nation for food safety and sanitary problems. Also in 2013, the Government Accountability Office raised food safety concerns due to the faster line speeds in those plants.

In the USDA’s self assessment the following year, the agency said its data showed the test plants “are performing as well as comparable large [traditional] market hog establishments and are meeting FSIS expectations.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) and 16 other Democratic lawmakers opposed to the new inspection system asked the USDA inspector general’s office last month to investigate whether the department properly disclosed data on worker safety during the public review and comment period for the proposed regulations.

In a statement to The Post, Kaptur cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that say 1 in 6 Americans get sick and 3,000 die because of foodborne diseases each year: “If we are to improve those numbers, we cannot hand over the integrity of inspections to an industry focused more on profit and less on human and animal welfare.”"
EPA wants to triple level of rocket fuel chemical allowed in drinking water,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-rocket-fuel-chemical-drinking-water-e6ee56c9ee13/,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to raise the threshold for a chemical found in rocket fuel to triple the previous limit allowed in drinking water supplies. This is the first new drinking water rule introduced by the agency since the George W. Bush administration.

In the EPA’s latest move to weaken environmental and health protections, it released a notice on Thursday requesting public comment on its proposal to raise the maximum level allowed for the chemical perchlorate — which is linked to thyroid problems — to 56 micrograms per liter.

This is three times higher than what the EPA previously recommended as a safe level for drinking water (15 micrograms per liter). The previous recommendation was just an advisory to help guide states, as opposed to an enforceable limit, which is what the agency is now proposing.

In addition to this change, the EPA is seeking comment on three other alternate options: setting the level to 18 micrograms per liter, to 90 micrograms per liter, or simply abolishing the rule regulating perchlorate in drinking water.

The news comes after a decade-long delay following a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) demanding the EPA set an enforceable standard for the chemical.

“This is enough to make you sick—literally,” Erik Olson, senior director for health and food at NRDC, said in a statement on the new proposed limits. “As a result, millions of Americans will be at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of this toxic chemical in their drinking water.”

In addition to rocket fuel, perchlorate is found in fireworks, airbags, matches, signal flares, some food packaging, and munitions. Health risks from exposure include disruption to the thyroid’s ability to produce hormones needed for normal growth and development, along with potentially causing reproductive problems.

According to NRDC, scientists recommend a limit that is “10 to more than 50 times lower” than what the EPA is currently proposing. Two states currently have much stricter, enforceable standards than required by the EPA: California (at 6 micrograms per liter) and Massachusetts (at 2 micrograms per liter).

The EPA’s proposal comes as the agency has been dragging its feet on implementing a similar legally enforceable standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a group of man-made chemicals that are toxic to humans and can increase the risk of cancer — in drinking water. Currently there is no maximum level for PFAS chemicals under EPA rules. Numerous communities in 43 states are currently suffering from the toxic chemical polluting their water.

These delays or weakening of chemical standards come despite EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler recent arguments that water issues are the world’s leading environmental crisis.

“This is another Trump administration gift to polluters and water utilities that have lobbied to be off the hook for cleaning up the problem,” Olson said of the proposed change to perchlorate.

The Trump EPA features several top officials who once worked for the chemical industry. This includes a former Koch Industries staffer, David Dunlap, who worked on water and chemical policy and now serves as deputy EPA assistant administrator for research and development, and a former chemical industry attorney, Steven Cook, who oversees Superfund sites. Meanwhile, Nancy Beck, the Trump administration appointee who oversees the EPA’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups.

What’s more, a 2009 House Committee report found that Beck, a former Bush administration official, was slowing progress in confirming the health threats from chemicals like perchlorate found in drinking water. The committee concluded she had been “inappropriately intervening in agency science.”

Ties to the chemical industry also extend to Wheeler. In a letter sent to the EPA administrator last month, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D- MD), accused Wheeler of failing to disclose his previous lobbying on behalf of Darling Ingredients, which is involved in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA."

WASHINGTON — Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan is slated to meet with his Chinese counterpart in Singapore next week, according to a senior defense official.

The meeting, which is expected to take place on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit, comes as the world's two largest economies exchange tit-for-tat tariffs in an ongoing trade war.

""We're doing a pull aside with the Chinese counterpart at Shangri-La,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The official said this is the first time since 2011 that the Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe will be at the defense summit, having in recent years sent lower level officials.

The meeting plans come as the U.S. seeks to persuade partners to ban Huawei products from 5G telecommunications networks, warning that the Chinese technology poses a national security risk.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford has previously said that if U.S. allies proceed with Huawei's equipment, intelligence cooperation could be undermined.

""One of the things that underlines an alliance is the ability to share information, and when we share information with allies and partners we have to have common standards of information assurance,"" Dunford told a House Appropriations subcommittee earlier this month. ""We have to be sure that our secrets are protected, whether it be intelligence or technology transfer.""

Echoing Dunford's sentiments, Shanahan told lawmakers at the hearing that ""China aims to steal its way to a China-controlled global technological infrastructure, including 5G.""

""Huawei exemplifies the Chinese Communist Party's systemic, organized and state-driven approach to achieve global leadership in advanced technology,"" he said.

Last year, the Pentagon halted sales of Huawei and ZTE mobile phones and modems on military bases around the world due to potential security risks.

""These devices may pose an unacceptable risk to the department's personnel and mission,"" wrote Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Eastburn. The Pentagon reaffirmed Wednesday its policy on banning the devices still stands."
Trump climbs into a sumo ring to present a 60-pound ‘President’s Cup’ in highlight of Japan trip,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ashley Parker', 'White House Reporter', 'Simon Denyer', 'Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan', 'North Korea', 'South Korea.']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-presents-gilded-presidents-cup-to-sumo-champion-in-a-highlight-of-his-japan-trip/2019/05/26/fca43394-7e37-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html,"Finally, after a full day of matches, perhaps the biggest star of all — weighing in at 243 pounds, according to his most recent physical — climbed into the sumo ring.

President Trump stepped into the dohyo shortly after 5:30 p.m. Sunday to present the “President’s Cup” — a roughly 4½ -foot, more than 60-pound trophy that served as a physical manifestation of the gilded, ceremonial nature of Trump’s four-day trip here.

The president seemed to enjoy his low-key star turn at Ryogoku Kokugikan stadium, exclaiming afterward, “That was an incredible evening at sumo.”

“Sumo wrestling,” he marveled later.

[Trump is presenting a sumo trophy in Japan. France beat him to it nearly 20 years ago.]

Trump took in just five matches — some lasting but several seconds — alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday evening. But he spent the morning putting on a show of his own; at roughly 7:30 a.m. local time, the president fired off a tweet that, in a single social media missive, undercut his national security adviser, reaffirmed his ties with a dictator and attacked a domestic political rival on foreign soil, while misspelling the rival’s name.

“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump wrote, in a second tweet that corrected his initial misspelling of former vice president Joe Biden’s last name. “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?”

Less than a day earlier, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, had argued the opposite to reporters here, warning there is “no doubt” North Korea’s missile tests violated United Nations Security Council resolutions and adding that Trump was determined to maintain sanctions pressure on the regime until it backs down.

In a conference call with reporters before Trump departed for Japan, a senior administration official had promised a “substantive” trip, with “some substantive things to announce.” But until the president made news with his impromptu tweet Sunday morning, Trump’s appearance at the sumo championship seemed to be one of the main events of his visit.

Indeed, Trump spent his first full day in Japan largely as a tourist. Earlier in the day, the president and Abe had played golf at Mobara Country Club in Chiba — complete with selfies and double cheeseburgers made with U.S. beef — and after the sumo championship, the two leaders and their wives headed for dinner of traditional Japanese grilled fare known as robatayaki. (The menu seemed specifically designed for Trump’s generally bland tastes — a five-course meal that included buttered potatoes, grilled chicken, Wagyu beef with vegetables and vanilla ice cream).

Trump’s planned appearance at the sumo match was relatively restrained for a president who became a household name as a reality TV star and often seems to thrive amid chaos and even encourage it. Gone were his days as a World Wrestling Entertainment personality who, in 2007, clotheslined WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and faux-pounded him, ringside, before shaving him bald in a viral pay-per-view moment.

Instead, Trump entered the sumo ring after donning slippers — no shoes are allowed in the dohyo — and read from a scroll, the “certificate of commemoration” in honor of the 25-year-old victor, Asanoyama.

“In honor of your outstanding achievement as sumo grand champion, I hereby award you the President’s Cup,” Trump said.

A sumo official helped him lift the heavy cup and hand it to Asanoyama, who bowed several times. The president shook his hand, clapped, at one point bowed slightly himself, and exited the ring.

Perhaps the most dramatic moment of Trump’s award presentation came before the president was even onstage; the silver trophy — which features an eagle atop it, wings high, and which was displayed Sunday afternoon to some fanfare in the lobby of the hotel where the president is staying — was brought out draped in white cloth, and the crowd gasped when its covering was removed.

Jaime Tiktin, 54, a tourist from Mexico City, said it was a “strange surprise” to learn that Trump would be attending the sumo match. Tiktin said he read in the Japan Times that the Japanese “kind of made up this prize to make him feel good,” but he noted that Trump seemed subdued.

“He didn’t smile at all; he didn’t do any gestures,” Tiktin said. “It was kind of strange to see him not moving his lips at all.”

Tiktin and his wife — who came bearing a homemade “Viva Mexico” sign — said they are not fans of Trump because of the way he has treated Mexicans, but they added that Trump was apparently trying to abide by sumo protocol. “I think he was being respectful,” Tiktin said. “I hate to say that, but I think he was respectful.”

In the run-up to the sumo championship, Trump prompted some griping among the Japanese. Some were annoyed that he and his wife, Melania, received special treatment and were allowed to sit in chairs close to the ring. Normally, attendees on the lower levels sit on cushions, called zabutons, and VIPs opt for seats on the second floor designed specifically for them. There was also concern the president’s entourage and large security detail would take away seats from Japanese sumo fans.

One widely shared article in the Japanese news media pointed out that the Japan Sumo Association is happy to follow many anachronistic traditions, such as forbidding women from standing in the ring. The article asked rhetorically, “Is not it against their traditions to let Trump sit on a seat by the ring and wear slippers into the ring to present his cup?” (Sumo wrestlers fight barefoot, though slippers were an acceptable alternative to shoes for Trump.)

The zabutons — which spectators often throw into the air to cheer or show their dissatisfaction after a spectacular match — also posed a potential security headache. Sankei, a Japanese daily, even featured a story, complete with a photo of a flying zabuton, headlined, “Mr. Trump to watch the final day matches. Fear of zabuton.”

But in the end, Trump proved more a curiosity than a nuisance, the mere mention of his name almost invariably prompting giggles among the spectators.

“He’s a crazy guy, yeah?” said Ryugo Kato, 45, a Tokyo resident.

Kato said he thought Trump should have sat on the floor if he wanted to be close to the ring. “That’s the way this place is set up,” Kato said. “He should respect the custom. It’s the culture.”

Nonetheless, he also welcomed Trump to the match. “If he wants to come, fine,” Kato said. “There’s nothing wrong with watching the sport and paying some respect to Japan’s national sport.”

Asanoyama, for his part, seemed to be a potential Trump convert. According to Nikkan Sports, in an interview Saturday, the champion said, “I am going to check Wikipedia for Trump-san,” apparently to be better prepared.

By Sunday, asked after his victory about being the first person to receive the “President’s Cup,” Asanoyama was emotional.

“I was overjoyed,” he said. “It was almost too much to say in words.”

USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth,https://www.politico.com,['Catherine Boudreau'],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/agriculture-dept-ends-job-corps-conservation-centers-1472208,"The program — known as the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. Employment USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has decided to end a U.S. Forest Service work program that trains at-risk youth to be first responders to natural disasters, maintain national forests and work on rural infrastructure projects.

The program — known for operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. As part of the move, the department intends to close nine of 25 centers, according to a statement released Friday. The action could lead to a significant cut of the number of Forest Service employees.

Story Continued Below

“There are reasons why the secretary made this decision,” Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen told staff members during a conference call announcing the move on Friday morning, less than an hour before the Department of Labor’s news release. She said she learned of the decision only four days ago.

“Perdue has a goal of efficient and effective government,” Christiansen said, adding that the secretary believes the mission of the program better aligns with the Labor Department. The Forest Service’s Civilian Conservation Centers is the only Labor Department Jobs Corps initiative operated by federal employees.

“This was a high-level policy discussion and decision. It in no way reflects on your excellent work and dedication,” Christiansen said.

Perdue, in a letter to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, wrote the move would help the Forest Service prioritize its “core natural resource mission to improve the condition and resilience of our nation’s forests, and step away from activities and programs that are not essential to that core mission.”

Forest Service officials did not disclose how many employees will be affected by the change, which is expected to be completed by September. However, a spokesperson for the National Federation of Federal Employees, the union representing Forest Service workers, told POLITICO that as many as 1,065 workers could be let go.

Another Forest Service official on the conference call said the agency will request authority for a reduction in force, which must go through the Office of Personnel Management because of the size of the staff cuts. The Civilian Conservation Centers closing are in states such as Montana, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Forest Service official said that agency will try to help employees find other jobs within the department and push “voluntary separation incentives,” or buyouts.

The Labor Department said 16 of the 25 centers will be replaced by new contract operators or a partnership overseen by DOL. The announcement added that the “new operators will implement new policies and approaches that will offer students the skills they need to earn an independent living and succeed in meaningful in-demand jobs.”

The Civilian Conservation Corps dates to the Great Depression but was disbanded during World War II. The current iteration was designed during the Johnson administration as part of its Jobs Corps effort. Today, thousands of young people aged 16 to 24 from low-income communities participate in the program.

“During hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, these students are some of the first people to respond,” said Brittany Holder, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Federal Employees. The organization, in a recent review of the Civilian Conservation Corps, found that in 2017, more than 300 students were sent to wildfire assignments, providing about 200,000 hours of support, among a range of other services.

The union argues the program has been a success and that the administration is misrepresenting data to make its case to privatize the centers. The Trump administration — in annual budget requests — and Republican lawmakers have criticized the program as being wasteful of taxpayer money and having little accountability.

“They have no plan for the students, no idea how to stop the loss of 613,000 hours of student service, and are not concerned about the impact on rural jobs and local economies,” Beverly Tobin-Ford, the union’s Forest Service Council vice president, said in April. “It’s as if this administration just decided to do this without reservation or any forethought.”

Ingraham exclusive: Homeland Security boss defends against family-separation accusations at border,https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ingraham-exclusive-dhs-head-defends-against-family-separation-accusat-at-the-border,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security is disputing accusations that U.S. authorities are continuing to separate children from their families.

""First of all, that is not happening. We're separating children in maybe one case a day out of the 3,000 families arriving,"" Kevin McAleenan said Thursday in an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""It's very rare,"" he added. ""It's for the safety of the child first and foremost.""

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

McAleenan, 47, a native of Hawaii, was appointed to DHS by President Trump in April, after the departure of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He previously served as a commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a unit of DHS.

On Thursday's show, McAleenan responded to a clip of MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski talking about family separations on Thursday morning.

""This is our responsibility as a country and as a nation,"" Brzezinski said. ""We are not being given answers as to what is happening to small, young children, to teenagers, to girls, to boys [who were] being taken away from their families, from their parents and left alone in our custody.""

McAleenan also discussed his recent appearances on Capitol Hill asking for funding, including a hearing where Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that children in U.S. custody were living in poor conditions and alluded to news reports that several children in U.S. custody had died.

McAleenan told Ingraham that he objected to Underwood's depiction of the situation.

""It's a sad state of affairs in our politics but we have an actual crisis and we have solutions on the table and clarity of what the men and women on the border need from Congress and yet that is the kind of thing we are hearing,"" McAleenan said.

McAleenan also spoke about illnesses afflicting migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""We are seeing younger children arriving sicker every single day. We had an H1N1 outbreak yesterday at McAllen [Texas] station, the infectious disease with the teenager who passed away on Monday. It looks like he had the flu, a very virulent strain of the flu, H1N1. We have seen measles, we've seen mumps, folks in ICE custody that are quarantined due to mumps. It's a tremendous challenge,"" McAleenan said, adding that the situation with smugglers exacerbates the illnesses."

In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.

The chairmen’s letter cited a Reuters article on April 17 about how the administration’s annual report to Congress on global compliance with international arms control accords provoked a dispute with U.S. intelligence agencies and some State Department officials.

The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.

A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”

The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S.-Iranian tensions rose following U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and his reimposition of tough economic sanctions. They sharpened earlier this month after Trump tightened sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports.

Strains further deepened with Saudi Arabia accusing Iran of ordering armed drone attacks on two oil pumping stations and the May 12 sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. government sources said Washington strongly suspects militias with ties to Tehran were behind those attacks as well as a rocket strike in Baghdad’s Green Zone.

Iran denied involvement in the incidents.

In their May 16 letter to Pompeo, the three chairmen said they were “deeply concerned” the arms control report may have been produced by political appointees “disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning.”

The State Department, they noted, was legally bound to submit to Congress a “detailed report” on compliance by the United States and other countries with international arms control accords.

Instead, they wrote, this year’s report was only 12 pages long, “contains no meaningful discussion” of U.S. and Russian compliance with such agreements and “consists largely of hypotheticals or opinion.”

Several sources told Reuters that the report made them wonder if the administration was painting Iran in the darkest light possible, much as the George W. Bush administration used bogus and exaggerated intelligence to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq."
The Harriet Tubman $20 bill was set for 2020. Now the Trump administration says it won't happen for years,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Jason Silverstein'],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harriet-tubman-20-dollar-bill-2020-release-delayed-trump-administration-treasury-secretary-steve-mnuchin-2019-05-23/,"Don't bet on seeing a Harriet Tubman $20 bill anytime soon. The redesigned bill bearing Tubman's face, which was supposed to debut next year, will not be coming out for nearly a decade, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said.

Planning started years ago to have Tubman replace former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. Tubman, who was born into slavery and became a noted abolitionist and political activist, would be the first black woman to have her face on U.S. currency. The new bill was scheduled to be released in 2020 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.

But Mnuchin said Wednesday that it won't be happening under the Trump administration.

""It's not a decision that is likely to come until way past my term, even if I serve the second term for the president,"" Mnuchin told the House Financial Services Committee. ""So I'm not focused on that for the moment.""

In the Women on 20s grassroots campaign, which inspired bills in the House and the Senate, Harriet Tubman came out the frontrunner to replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, after more than 600,000 people cast ballots. WomenOn20s.org

Mnuchin said a redesign of the bill's security features will still come out in 2020. But the issue of changing how the bill looks ""most likely"" won't come up again until 2026, he said, and the new $20 bill won't be printed until 2028.

Mnuchin did not explain why the Tubman bill won't be produced on his watch. He also did not state whether he personally supports seeing Tubman on the money. ""I've made no decision as it relates to that,"" he said.

Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who grilled Mnuchin about the Tubman plan, tweeted after the hearing: ""People other than white men built this county. And Sec Mnuchin agrees, yet he refuses to update our #currency.""

People other than white men built this county. And Sec Mnuchin agrees, yet he refuses to update our #currency. #HarrietTubman #MarianAnderson & #EleanorRoosevelt are iconic Americans & its past time that our 💵 reflects that. #RepresentationMatters | https://t.co/nJmhiktHPm pic.twitter.com/hKQSR3Gl8P — Rep Ayanna Pressley (@RepPressley) May 22, 2019

Mnuchin's predecessor in the Obama administration, Jack Lew, oversaw a 10-month process in which the public suggested hundreds of people whose portraits could appear on U.S. bills. He said that process ""inspired"" him to put Tubman on the $20 bill. The Treasury Department announced in April 2016 that it would work on getting the new bill out ""as quickly as possible.""

President Trump said during the 2016 campaign that he did not support putting Tubman on the 20, calling the plan ""pure political correctness."" He suggested instead having Tubman on ""the $2 bill"" or ""another bill.""

DOJ Attorneys Reportedly Ready to Block T-Mobile/Sprint Merger,https://gizmodo.com,"['Dell Cameron', 'About The Author', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Tech Policy', 'Email', 'Dell Gizmodo.Com', 'Xmpp', 'Dell Jabber.Ccc.De']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/doj-attorneys-reportedly-ready-to-block-t-mobile-sprint-1834961808,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"

President Donald Trump won’t release White House visitor logs, he refuses to hand over his tax returns, he made staffers sign non-disclosure agreements and he’s balking at congressional investigators.

Yet during a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday, he again proclaimed himself “the most transparent president” in U.S. history, adding to the reporters gathered before him, “I think most of you would agree.”

It may be true that Trump reveals more of his personal thoughts and emotions than any of his predecessors. But by most other measures of presidential transparency, including the congressional oversight at issue during his White House appearance Wednesday, Trump operates behind dark-tinted windows.

The end to White House visitor logs, a way for the public to see who is getting direct access to the most powerful man in America, is a break from Obama administration practice. He’s the first president in decades not to release his tax returns. No modern White House has held as few daily press briefings as Trump’s, a ritual his Pentagon and State Department have also largely phased out. And while many presidents have battled Congressional oversight requests, Trump has dismissed the queries of House Democrats as illegitimate partisan inquests.

All of which has many critics saying that Trump has it backwards.

“It is for sure the least transparent administration in modern history,” said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a prominent Washington consumer advocacy group.

Norm Ornstein, a longtime government reform advocate and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called the Trump administration “the opposite of transparent.” Trump’s statement, he deadpanned, “made me laugh -- before I cried again.”

Even by the standards of Trump’s penchant for embellishment and falsehoods, Trump’s claim of unprecedented transparency — which he and his aides have made repeatedly — is particularly outrageous to the cadre of outside groups who’ve spent the last 2.5 years clashing with an administration they view as deeply secretive.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2659/1155968404_6039857995001_6039857592001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

There is no universal definition of government transparency. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defines transparency as “the disclosure of government information” that can be used to “hold the federal government more accountable for its actions or inactions.”

Measured by that sort of standard, critics say, Trump has fallen far short.

Within the first year of Trump’s presidency, the federal government denied or censored more public information requests than at any time in the last decade. And Freedom of Information Act lawsuits intended to force the administration to turn over records reached a record high last year, increasing by nearly 70 percent compared with the last full fiscal year of President Barack Obama’s term.

“There’s only one way in which he’s the most transparent president and that’s that we can see him broadcasting his thoughts on Twitter when he gets angry in the morning,” said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government accountability group. “Otherwise, it’s ridiculous.”

White House officials counter that Trump is more accessible than any modern president, broadcasting his thoughts to his millions of followers everyday, answering shouted questions from reporters and granting regular print, television and radio interviews. By that measure, the public likely has a better understanding of Trump’s minute-to-minute opinions than they did of other recent presidents, who were often reluctant to spout off in public until their ideas had been vetted by their advisers.

Though White House aides hold up Trump as a pillar of accessibility, they have also sought to tightly control Trump’s interactions with the media. Trump’s exclusive interviews tend to be with friendly news outlets. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last appeared in the press briefing room in April to answer children’s questions during “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day,” and White House officials argued that her answers should be off the record.

Watchdog groups said accessibility alone isn’t enough to claim the transparency mantle.

“I don’t think that’s meaningful transparency,” said Liz Hempowicz, public policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, adding that the true transparency requires a government-wide commitment across federal agencies.

Hempowicz and other experts noted that the lack of transparency at federal agencies has massive consequences for the public, but often gets less attention than Trump’s headline-grabbing statements.

Just this week, for example, the Washington Post disclosed the existence of an internal Defense Department memo restricting the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress. And POLITICO recently detailed efforts by the Agriculture Department to reassign nearly all its researchers who study the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps, in what employees call a crackdown on economists whose assessments don’t square with Trump’s policies.

Then there is Trump’s categorical rejection of House Democratic oversight requests, including the extraordinary use of lawsuits to fight back against his investigators.

Trump’s claims of unprecedented transparency seem to be increasing as he grows more frustrated with the investigations encircling him. Aides and associates say Trump is furious that the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report has not dampened appetites for more investigation into subjects like his finances and tax returns.

“The President was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation. He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations,” White House spokesman Steven Groves said in a statement. “The White House and the Administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting Executive Branch rights and privileges. In addition, the President and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day.”

On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of engaging in a “cover-up,” countering that his administration had cooperated extensively with Mueller’s inquiries. Trump did give current and former staffers the green-light to participate with Mueller, although he himself refused to sit for an in-person interview, answering written questions instead.

“I think most of you would agree to this,” Trump said after abruptly ending a meeting with Democrats and vowing not to work with them until they end their investigations. “I’m the most transparent president, probably, in the history of this country. And instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said I was doing a cover-up. I don’t do cover-ups.”

Trump isn’t the first president to throw around transparency-related superlatives. Soon after winning the presidency, Barack Obama vowed to make his administration the most transparent in history. And he did take steps toward that goal, including through the first-ever release of White House visitor logs. But watchdog groups often complained that Obama was betraying that promise when he blocked access to records or his Justice Department prosecuted government leakers.

“The [Obama] administration’s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I’ve seen since the Nixon administration,” former Washington Post editor Len Downie wrote in a 2013 report.

“It’s unwise for a president to make a statement like that” unless he can back it up, Hempowicz said of Obama’s boast, noting that good government groups criticized the 44th president throughout his time in office. “It makes it very easy for us to push back.”"

For those who enjoy heading south of the border for vacations, the U.S. Department of State has updated travel warnings for Mexican states where tourists are more vulnerable to crime.

Ahead of Memorial Day weekend, the Mexican state of Tamaulipas - which borders south Texas - is on the list of Do Not Travel states because of high crime and possible kidnapping.

Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common in the state.

The first quarter of 2019 set a new record for homicides in Mexico, where violent crime has claimed more than 250,000 lives since 2006, according to the Associated press.

The State Department cautioned people on where not to go and also offered tips on how to avoid becoming a victim.

The Mexico Travel Advisory is divided into four levels of caution from the least dangerous – the ""exercise normal precautions"" list, to the most dangerous – the ""do not travel"" list.

“Current projections are that more than 1 million people will have crossed our southern border illegally this year. Our constituents, the American public, are confounded as to why more is not being done by your Department,” the letter said.

Proposals include expanding a training program for border patrol agents to conduct fear interviews, where an undocumented immigrant is referred to an asylum officer if they express fear of returning to their home country.

Other proposals include limiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement's parole policy, limiting work authorization to only those whose asylum applications have been approved, increasing asylum fees and terminating the Flores settlement agreement.

“As the President continues to show leadership on this issue, we strongly encourage you to exercise the same manner of enthusiasm for fixing this crisis,” the letter says. “Included in this letter are proposals that would undoubtedly slow the surge at the border and provide context for long term immigration solutions.”

The group of immigration hard-liners also called for a third country agreement to be negotiated to allow undocumented immigrants to be relocated to another country that didn’t pose a threat in addition to enforcing “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which would require individuals from Central America to remain in Mexico while they await their immigration hearings."

The Agriculture Department is moving nearly all its researchers into the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps – subjects of controversial Trump administration initiatives – outside of Washington, part of what employees claim is a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.

Since last year, employees in the department’s Economic Research Service have awaited news of which members of their agency would be forced to relocate, after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stunned them by declaring he was moving most of the agency to a location outside the capital. The announcement sparked claims that Perdue was trying to pressure economists into leaving the agency rather than move their families.

Story Continued Below

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington, but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person if they made the cut.

But current and former employees compiled one anyway, covering all 279 people on staff, 76 of whom are being allowed to stay in Washington.

Morning Agriculture A daily briefing on agriculture and food policy — in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.

The current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, say the specialties of those who are being asked to move corresponds closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with the president’s policies, including tax policies, climate change, and the farm economy. The list, shared exclusively with POLITICO, shows a clear emphasis was placed on keeping employees whose work covers relatively non-controversial issues like crop planting over those whose research focused on areas sensitive to the administration.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told POLITICO, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

A former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved put it this way: “You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS. They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/1491/1155968404_5997228199001_5997114904001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

A USDA spokesman declined to directly address the employees’ allegation of political bias, but provided a written statement from Perdue saying that the moves were not prompted by the work being done by ERS

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our . . . employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government,” Perdue said. “These changes are more steps down the path to better service to our customers, and will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone. . .”

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run. And we are increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from land-grant universities.”

But employees claim the department’s leadership, including Perdue, turned against the research service after an estimate early last year suggested that the Republican-backed tax plan would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers.

Perdue’s decision to move ERS came several months after news outlets highlighted the USDA study on the Republican tax changes. In response to Perdue’s move, cities from all over the country submitted bids to host the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which will also move. The finalists, announced May 3, were the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Accompanying his announcement of a final selection, which is expected as early as this week, Perdue has promised to provide Congress with a cost-benefit analysis detailing why USDA says the move makes financial sense.

The impending announcement comes as pressure builds on Capitol Hill to stop the move. On Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider a spending bill that includes a provision barring the Agriculture Department from moving the two agencies out of the national capital zone. It also would block Perdue’s decision to put ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, a move that placed oversight of the agency closer to the secretary’s office.

Employees said that moving nearly all researchers out of Washington would have a clear impact on the agency’s work. Researchers said they usually draw on information from other USDA divisions, members of Congress and Washington-based stakeholder groups, which would be more difficult from a remote location. Allowing 76 members of the agency to stay in Washington while the other left also impacts morale, they said, and limits collaboration.

Among the employees staying in Washington are senior analysts who conduct global market and crop-outlook estimates and administrative personnel. According to the list, approximately 49 percent of agricultural economists will be allowed to remain in Washington, compared with 14 percent of researchers.

Rumors had been swirling among staff for months about who would be allowed to remain in Washington when all ERS employees were called into an auditorium in March to be briefed by Acting Administrator Chris Hartley. He then read aloud the names of those who qualified to stay. But it wasn’t until employees compiled a full roster of who was staying and going that they got a clear picture of how the agency would be split up.

Decisions on who would stay in Washington were made by ERS leadership and approved by Perdue, according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” document distributed at the March meeting. The FAQ states that “every ERS employee had the ability to provide input” on the move. Senior managers “proposed critical ERS functions” that they believed needed to remain in Washington.

Some employees said that description of the decision-making process validates their concerns that Perdue was behind the move.

“They went in and handpicked who they wanted and called them ‘critical,’” said a current ERS employee.

Neil Conklin, a former senior administrator at ERS under the George W. Bush administration, said the agency stands to be fundamentally changed by the relocation.

“This is going to be very destructive of the agency, as certainly as we’ve known it,” Conklin said.

For the past 151 years on the fourth Monday of May, we have honored the great soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen who have fallen.

Much has changed, but the generations of brave men and women willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom have endured, and the sanctity with which we regard these individuals has remained.

There are many millions of veterans, however, who returned home from war to find a country unable to provide them access to basic human rights such as quality civilian employment opportunities, health care and education. In recent years alone, 20.4 million men and women risked their lives for their country and, in return, many were refused fundamental care by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The VA fell into disarray under the Obama administration. President Obama tried to establish reform with initiatives such as the Veterans Choice Program to expand health care options and reduce wait time for medical appointments to a maximum of 30 days. This policy was great in theory, but in practice the Government Accountability Office found that some veterans waited up to 70 days for care and many died as a result.

Why was this happening? Some VA personnel neglected their duties by falsifying wait times for medical care and ignoring major systemic issues in the medical network with no accountability.

When President Trump took office in 2017, he pledged that the men and women who uphold our country’s freedoms no longer would be ignored by their government. In June 2017, he signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This legislation resulted in the removal, demotion or suspension of more than 4,000 employees who exhibited substandard performance. By weeding out the under-performers, veterans have been left with a better-functioning VA.

The Trump administration continues to move forward with efforts to expand VA accountability like the implementation of the “Access and Quality Tool,” a platform that allows veterans to view wait times and assess quality-of-care data when choosing health care providers. As a result, wait times have improved and are comparable to the private sector.

There is a prevalence of mental illness in the veteran community that was not effectively addressed under Obama. Thirty one percent of active duty and reserve military personnel who were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have experienced some form of mental illness or have reported experiencing a traumatic brain injury, but only 30 percent of those servicemembers will get treatment. The 70 percent who go untreated are forced to cope and, sadly, 22 veterans die by suicide every day in the United States, on average. Substance abuse precedes approximately 30 percent of all veteran suicides and about 20 percent of high-risk behavior deaths.

The stigma surrounding mental health treatment has created a substantial access gap in coverage, meaning many people who need to be receiving treatment may not be. In an effort to create more accessible options, President Trump secured $73.1 billion in funding for VA mental health services, opioid abuse prevention, suicide prevention and rural veterans’ health initiatives.

Veterans’ choices and access to medical care have expanded with the VA Mission act, making it easier for veterans to find treatment in their own communities and providing access to walk-in clinics for immediate care.

The president also signed an executive order requiring Homeland Security, Defense and Veterans Affairs secretaries to construct a joint plan that affords veterans access to mental health treatment.

The transition from a uniformed life to a civilian one is not easy, but President Trump has worked to ensure that veterans have access to quality job opportunities. The jobless rate for all veterans fell to an 18-year low of 3.5 percent in 2018, from its peak at 9.9 percent in 2011.

President Obama once said, “Our nation owes a debt to its fallen heroes that we can never fully repay.” Although that is true, it is with gratitude that we honor the fallen heroes whose bravery and sacrifice has ensured our freedom. Not just this day but every day, we must choose to honor their memory by caring for those soldiers who did return home. As President Trump said, “We will not rest until all of America’s great veterans receive the care they’ve earned through their incredible service and sacrifice to our country.”

"Intelligence community to provide ""appropriate"" information to DOJ for Russia review",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/intelligence-community-to-provide-appropriate-information-to-doj-russia-review-barr-declassification/,"President Trump's decision to empower Attorney General William Barr with sweeping declassification authorities has seeded a simmering conflict between the Department of Justice and the intelligence community that centers on the president's long-held objections to investigations launched into links between his 2016 campaign and Russia.

Mr. Trump on Thursday granted Barr ""full and complete authority"" to declassify government secrets and instructed the intelligence community to ""quickly and fully"" cooperate with Barr's review of the investigation into Russia's 2016 interference.

In doing so, the president is allowing Barr to declassify information of which other agencies — including the CIA, FBI and NSA — are the custodians, and whose public release would typically be determined by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

In a carefully-worded statement released Friday, DNI Dan Coats seemed to assert some of his own jurisdiction by indicating the intelligence community would provide the Department of Justice with all ""appropriate"" information related to its review, while implying excessive, inappropriate or politically-motivated demands would meet with pushback.

""I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the [intelligence community] in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk,"" Coats said.

""The [intelligence community] will continue to faithfully execute its mission of providing timely, apolitical intelligence to the president and policymakers,"" he said.

For almost as long as he has been in office, the president has maintained that his campaign was improperly surveilled. With encouragement from supporters in congress and conservative media, he has inched closer to publishing classified materials he believes will prove his assertions.

Critics of the president warn that Barr could use his power to selectively release information that, devoid of context, supports the president's case while damaging some of Mr. Trump's self-identified nemeses — individuals Trump believes were politically motivated to derail his campaign.

Those opposed to the move say they see in it echoes of the attorney general's handling of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's findings — which Barr at first distilled into a mostly favorable, abbreviated summary before releasing the far more damaging but still redacted full report itself.

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said the attorney general had ""already shown that he has no problem selectively releasing information in order to mislead the American people.""

""People risk their lives to gather the intelligence material that President Trump and Attorney General Barr are so eager to politicize,"" the Democrat, who represents Virginia, said.

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called Mr. Trump's move an ""abuse of power"" whose underlying intention was to ""weaponize and politicize the nation's intelligence and law enforcement entities."" He said the committee would conduct ""vigorous oversight"" of any steps to ""selectively reveal and distort classified information.""

But allies of the president, including Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California have previously urged Mr. Trump to take the steps he has now deputized Barr to take. Nunes is the former chairman and now ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. He has claimed the roughly 20 classified pages of a surveillance warrant application for former Trump campaign associate Carter Page could undermine the FBI's work and suggest an abuse of procedure.

In September the president indicated in a pair of tweets that he was close to declassifying a number of items related to the Russia probe, but after a meeting with the Justice department and calls from unspecified ""key allies"" declined to move forward. He told Fox News in an interview at the time, ""I want to wait until after the election.""

During remarks to reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump explicitly named countries he suggested had played a role in triggering or fueling the investigation.

""I hope [Barr] looks at the [United Kingdom] and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country,"" Mr. Trump said.

Both the United Kingdom and Australia are part of the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing group that also includes the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Mueller's report confirmed that the FBI's inquiry was triggered by an Australian diplomat's tip that former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos knew before it was public that Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The two met in 2016 in London, where CIA director Gina Haspel was station chief at the time.

Former national security officials said the public disclosure of intelligence contributions made by allies could damage those strategic relationships.

""It is yet another step that will raise questions among our allies and partners about whether to share sensitive intelligence with us,"" said CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, who served as the CIA's deputy director and is now the host of Intelligence Matters.

He added that the president's move overall had led to a further ""destruction of norms that weakens our intelligence community.""

""It's very unusual — unprecedented in my experience — for a non-intelligence community officer to be given absolute declassification authority over the intelligence community,"" said David Kris, who led the DOJ's national security division and now heads the Culper Partners consulting firm.

""This extraordinary assignment and the reaction it has provoked show how far we have moved from historical norms,"" he said."
Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

FORMER OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ON INCREASING NUMBER OF BORDER APPREHENSIONS

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., first allowed Underwood's words to remain on the record, stating that ""the language is approprite and that it should not be taken down.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Underwood later took to Twitter to comment on what happened.

""For over a year, it’s been clear that policies at the border have harmed the physical and mental health of migrant children,"" she said. ""I believe, at this point, failure to change these broken policies based on that knowledge is intentional and unacceptable.""

U.S. considers duties on countries that undervalue currency: Commerce Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Lawder', 'Min Read']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-currency/us-considers-duties-on-countries-that-undervalue-currency-commerce-department-idUSKCN1ST2TU,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it was proposing a new rule to impose anti-subsidy duties on products from countries that undervalue their currencies against the dollar, another move that could slap higher tariffs on Chinese products.

The new rule also could put goods from other countries at risk of higher tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, India, Germany and Switzerland.

Those countries, along with China, were all listed on the Treasury Department’s semi-annual currency report’s “monitoring list”, which tracks currency market interventions, high global current account surpluses and high bilateral trade surpluses.

The department said its proposed rule would amend the normal countervailing duty process to include new criteria for currency undervaluation. Trump administration officials have long viewed China’s yuan as undervalued against the dollar, despite the U.S.-China trade war, which foreign currency experts say has hurt the yuan’s value.

“This change puts foreign exporters on notice that the Department of Commerce can countervail currency subsidies that harm U.S. industries,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.

“Foreign nations would no longer be able to use currency policies to the disadvantage of American workers and businesses,” he said.

It was a step toward making good on a campaign promise by U.S. President Donald Trump to address unfair currency practices, Ross said.

The department did not identify the specific criteria that it would use to evaluate whether U.S. pricing of a product was artificially low because of currency undervaluation."
Northport VA hospital gets new director,https://www.newsday.com,['Martin C. Evans'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.newsday.com/news/health/northport-va-medical-center-director-antonio-sanchez-1.31504710,"The Northport VA Medical Center is getting a new director after nearly a year under the leadership of an interim chief.

Dr. Antonio Sanchez, 51, is an 18-year employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs and currently is chief of staff of the VA Caribbean Healthcare System based in Puerto Rico, the agency said Friday. He served as acting director of the Caribbean system for roughly two years, from December 2016 to January 2019.

Sanchez, a psychiatrist, will take over Northport's top job from interim head Dr. Cathy Cruise in the next 45 to 60 days, said Dr. Joan E. McInerney, who oversees the VA's New York regional office.

He will be responsible for everything, from managing 1,800 employees and a multimillion-dollar budget to ensuring the care of more than 30,000 patients a year and running a string of satellite clinics that stretch from Valley Stream to Riverhead.

In the past few years, the medical center has been dogged by crumbling infrastructure and high turnover in virtually all its key administrative roles.

In an interview from San Juan, Sanchez talked about the many challenges of Long Island's only veterans hospital.

“That is part of the excitement of arriving there,” Sanchez said. “There are issues we need to address … so I’ll be pretty busy.”

Sanchez said he spent four or five days at the medical center a few weeks ago, meeting with McInerney and other regional leaders.

McInerney praised Sanchez, pointing out what she described as his ""sound leadership qualities and proven experience.""

Two members of Long Island's congressional delegation didn't comment on Sanchez directly but did speak about the medical center and the VA broadly.

“Northport has had a lot of turnover in the last two and a half years,"" said Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove). ""The Northport VA historically has been one of the best VAs in the country. It’s had a rough few years, and I hope this new leadership can turn it around.”

Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) criticized VA leaders for not keeping members of Congress up to speed on developments at Northport. He said he hadn't been told that Cruise was going to be replaced.

“Obviously there have been real problems there, so I think it would help them to contact us early and bring us in,” King said. “It would have been a show of good faith to let us know beforehand.”

King pressed for a meeting between the Long Island delegation and the incoming director as soon as possible.

Sanchez has a New York connection: He did his undergraduate studies at SUNY Brockport upstate. He received both a medical degree and a master's degree in Healthcare Services Administration from the University of Puerto Rico's School of Medicine. He is a fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives and a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.

Sanchez joined the VA in August 2000 as a staff psychiatrist at the Caribbean system. He served as the system's chief of psychiatry service from June 2006 to July 2009, according to the VA.

As psychiatry service chief, Sanchez improved access to mental health care and established a foundation to expand more programs for veterans.

Sanchez's next VA position was interim chief of staff. He then was chief of staff until he began his time as acting director.

Cruise, a Huntington native, became Northport's acting director in July after director Scott Guermonprez resigned a year into his tenure, citing personal and family reasons. She also holds the title of chief of staff.

Since 2016, when Cruise arrived from the VA’s New York regional office, the medical center has had four medical center directors, three chiefs of staff and three nursing department directors, as well as the heads of the human resources department and physical plant.

And the 91-year-old medical center is showing its age. Last year brought two crises, for example. In January 2018, Northport had to close a homeless shelter on its campus after the heating system went out. A month later, the hospital had to shut down all five of its operating rooms to repair the air conditioning. The homeless shelter is still closed and isn't expected to open until at least October.

In September, three months after Cruise took over, the VA's independent watchdog released the findings of a yearlong investigation into nursing shortages at the medical center. Northport’s senior leaders, the report said, knew about the staffing shortages, mismanaged the nurses to fill the gaps and allowed overtime costs to balloon to $1.5 million in 2017, a nearly $750,000 increase from the year before.

In an addendum to the report, Cruise told the VA's Office of the Inspector General that she agreed with the findings and would address the staffing shortages.

One project that Cruise will turn over to Sanchez is the consolidation of more operations into the hospital, one of nearly two dozen buildings on the 268-acre campus.

A consolidation will improve communication between employees and their supervisors and will limit the need for patients with several medical conditions to go to several buildings for care, Cruise said.

In an interview in late December, Cruise had made it clear that she wanted the job of director.

The new director will face other challenges.

Health analysts warn that growing pressure to increase the privatization of VA health care — allowing more veterans to see private doctors paid for by federal dollars — could divert resources during a time when the agency is already stressed by staffing shortages and squeezed to keep up with the latest technology.

Already, more than 2 million veterans have used VA health dollars to schedule 41 million appointments under the Veterans Choice Act, signed by President Barack Obama in 2014. Under the program, for example, a veteran could see a private doctor if the nearest VA hospital was too far away or if the VA couldn't provide care within 30 days of requesting an appointment.

And that outsourcing is expected to increase under the VA Mission Act of 2018, which President Donald Trump signed in June to replace the Veterans Choice Act. Many of the new law's provisions build on the 2014 legislation, especially on the timeliness of appointments and distance of travel."
Parrot selected by U.S. Department of Defense to take part in the development of the next-generation of Short Range Reconnaissance drone for the U.S. Army,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parrot-selected-u-department-defense-063000787.html,"Parrot selected by U.S. Department of Defense to take part in the development of the next-generation of Short Range Reconnaissance drone for the U.S. Army

The U.S. Army Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Aviation’s Project Manager, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, partnered with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Army’s Maneuver Center of Excellence to identify and prototype new drone capabilities with commercial companies that specialize in on-demand, “eye in the sky” technologies. In this process, the U.S. Army is partnering with the Pentagon’s internal startup accelerator to adapt small commercial drones for the battlefield.

Parrot, the leading European drone group, is one of the 6 companies1 that have met the standards set in the solicitation issued in November 20182 to develop and prototype the next generation of small-unit surveillance drone.

The Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) effort has recently awarded $11 million in funding to six companies to prototype and evaluate drones that can provide the Soldier on the ground with a rapidly deployable scouting capability to gain situational awareness beyond the next terrain feature. The drones would be expected to fly for 30 minutes straight at a range of up to three kilometers, according to the original solicitation. Officials also specified the aircraft should weigh three pounds or less, take less than 2 minutes to assemble and fit inside a soldier’s standard-issue rucksack.

“Parrot is proud to have been selected by the Army to work on this highly strategic project,” said Henri Seydoux, founder and CEO of Parrot. “The United States has always been a major market for the Parrot Group whether it is for our well-known consumer range or our advanced professional offering. We have always been at the forefront creating advanced, easy to use, compact and reliable drone-based solutions. We also perfectly understand how small unmanned aircraft, such as the Parrot ANAFI platform, has the potential to become a key part of the defense system. We look forward to focusing our advanced R&D on meeting the high standards set by the U.S. Army, to integrate drone efficiency in their day to day operations and support the world leading army defense system”.

Parrot has been the first company to develop the civil drone market and to invest, earlier than any other, in commercial drone solutions creating the leading European drone group. This contract underlines the technological innovations and premier position Parrot has in the global drone market and the excellence of the company’s researches and developments and is testament to Parrot’s global strategy and positioning, particularly in the commercial and Defense & Security drone development.

Atlanta Braves Latin American scouting records requested by Justice Department,https://tomahawktake.com,"['Jonathan Magel', 'Alan Carpenter', 'Scott Polacek']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://tomahawktake.com/2019/05/26/atlanta-braves-latin-american-scouting-records-subpoenaed-by-doj/,"Atlanta Braves must send Latin American scouting reports to the Department of Justice.

According to a report in the Washington Post, The US Department of Justice (DoJ) served subpoenas on the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Diego Padres “seeking records relating to scouting and signing of players from Latin America.”

While this report is dated May 23rd, there was no indication of when these subpoenas were actually issued, though the investigation is known to have been in progress for close to a year now.

Last September Jeff Passan reported that a Federal Grand Jury subpoenaed officials from several teams including “at least one former Atlanta Braves official as well as people involved with the signing of Cuban star Hector Olivera.”

Agents from the FBI have spearheaded the investigation, according to sources familiar with it, and lawyers from the Department of Justice who specialize in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases – which typically involve bribery of foreign officials – are involved as well.

This news comes just a year after MLB severely sanctioned the Atlanta Braves for their actions in Latin America during the John Coppolella/John Hart regime.

Alan wondered at the time why Gordon Blakeley’s name never appeared in Passan’s post, as he helped the Yankees scout and sign in Latin America before coming to Atlanta to assist Coppolella. We may now have an answer,

What’s it all about Alfie?

The probe centers on something called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which Alan explained in layman’s terms in his original post.

the provisions of the FCPA are an attempt to level the playing field for those doing business internationally by telling US citizens that they can’t pay a bribe to (or anything that looks like there’s a bribe) to a ‘foreign official’ to facilitate a business transaction.

In the Post article, Hobson says that more than a dozen people associated with the game, including scouts and a former MLB official (Bud Selig comes to mind) testified before the Grand Jury, as well as players and at least one agent.

The DoJ indicted a native Cuban agent Bart Hernandez sports and trainer Julio Estrada also from Cuba. At their trial, documents produced suggested the New York Yankees were aware crimes were being committed.

… State Department document summarized an August 2012 interview … between a U.S. consulate official and a Cuban pitcher, Omar Luis … (that Luis) “Was directly recruited from Cuba by the Yankees,” the State Department official wrote. When asked about how he got residency in Haiti, the report said the player replied, “The Yankees contacted a Haitian functionary who make [sic] it all happen.”

Blakeley left the Yankees in 2014 and joined the Atlanta Braves."

Trump’s EPA is ‘cooking the books’ to justify its attack on clean air rules,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-epa-is-cooking-the-books-to-justify-its-attack-on-clean-air-rules/,"Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to distort the way it measures the benefits of some of the agency’s most impactful policies, regulations that safeguard human health by limiting air pollution. The primary beneficiary of such distortion? The coal industry.

When the government evaluates the health and financial benefits of clean air, the calculation typically incorporates the number of lives saved and the scale of reduced health impacts thanks to reducing pollution — also known as “co-benefits.” Incorporating these factors into a cost-benefit analysis forms the very foundation upon which many environmental protections are based.

But now, experts warn the EPA is opening the door to industry challenges to these clean air rules by changing the way it evaluates the long-accepted science on the risk of particulate matter — microscopic particles polluting the air that are linked to increased heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory disease.

The agency may also be laying the groundwork, experts say, for using these “biased and misleading” calculations in other policy contexts. That fear was stoked by a new EPA memo released this week, ushering in a formal process to change the way the agency calculates its cost-benefit analysis across a slew of issues, from water pollution to pesticides.

Advertisement

It is well-established that reducing air pollution saves lives — a fact backed up by numerous scientific studies and government reports. In fact, a 2017 report from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) found that out of all federal rules, the EPA’s had the “highest estimated benefits as well as the highest estimated costs.” The costs and benefits capture everything from the new equipment required by power plants to the co-benefits from Americans’ reduced exposure to pollution.

What’s more, regulations designed to improve air quality accounted for over 95% of the benefits from EPA rules. When it comes to fine particle pollution, OMB said the benefits of regulation “far exceed” the costs.

Nonetheless, the EPA is now arguing that the calculation used to determine the costs and benefits of air pollution regulations needs to be changed. The agency is exaggerating the costs of these rules while downplaying their ecological, climate, financial, and health benefits so that it can more easily defend its sweeping rollback of environmental protections — changes that are often in line with industry demands.

The EPA’s proposed revisions to this math would reduce the number of lives at risk from repealing the Clean Power Plan and drastically downgrade the projected benefits of retaining the Mercury and Air Toxics standards (MATS) regulating power plant pollution. By eliminating the use of co-benefits, these policy changes don’t look as bad.

“Both approaches are means by which unscrupulous agency officials can cook the cost-benefit books and distort the debate about the value of health and environmental protections,” James Pew, a staff attorney at EarthJustice, told ThinkProgress. “They’re a way to rationalize rolling back these protections, or not establishing them in the first place.”

On Tuesday, the EPA released a memo directing four agency offices to “rectify… inconsistencies” regarding the process for calculating risks and benefits. This includes offices overseeing air pollution, water pollution, land contamination (including Superfund sites), and chemicals and pesticides.

The direction, issued to staff on May 13, codifies and expands an effort to effectively “cook the books” that was initiated by former Administrator Scott Pruitt. In April 2018, Pruitt told attendees at a meeting held at the Heritage Foundation – a think tank known for promoting climate science denial – that he would stop counting the co-benefits of environmental policies.

It is “potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits.”

This trend in fudging the numbers goes back to 2017, when the EPA under Pruitt made what appeared to be a few small changes to a metric known as the social cost of carbon – a figure that agencies use to determine the climate benefits of a particular regulation. In this case, the EPA argued it should only have to calculate how methane emissions reductions benefit the United States alone, a complete reversal from how these costs are typically calculated.

One of the main regulations currently in the agency’s cross-hairs is the MATS rule; introduced in 2011, it established federal limits on hazardous pollution from power plants. The regulation targets chemicals like mercury that can cause serious health impacts such as tremors, respiratory failure, and death. Coal plants are the biggest emitters of this toxic pollution.

The EPA’s own calculations show these regulations save upwards of 17,000 lives each year. Yet the agency is now arguing that the policy is too costly, claiming it costs industry $9.6 billion per year while only producing up to $6 million in benefits — significantly fewer benefits than what the Obama administration said the policy creates.

Advertisement

According the Obama-era calculations, the MATS rule would save $80 billion, in part due the co-benefits of costs avoided through fewer hospital visits and other health care spending resulting from poor air quality.

Among these benefits are ones that come from reducing pollution 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller (PM 2.5, for context, is 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair). While pollution standards set a limit on how much of this pollution is allowed, scientists argue there is no safe level, as even the tiniest particles in very small quantities are believed to impact the brains of unborn children.

But Trump’s EPA doesn’t see it that way, arguing these co-benefits are a stretch for what can be considered cost savings — and that regulating mercury from power plants is therefore not “appropriate and necessary.”

It’s a “biased and misleading estimate of costs and benefits,” Michael Livermore, associate professor of law at University of Virginia, said during a House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday regarding the proposed changes to MATS.

“The purpose of cost-benefit analysis is to understand consequences of agency decisions,” Livermore told lawmakers. “By excluding a large category… [you’re] turning a blind eye to an enormous category of consequences,” he said of the number of lives at risk from pollution.

Just hours later, the EPA released its memo to expand its cost-benefit revisions.

Meanwhile, regarding the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, the New York Times reported Monday that “the EPA plans to get thousands of pollution deaths off the books by changing its math.”

An EPA impact analysis released last August found that repealing the Clean Power Plan and replacing it with a new rule – the Affordable Clean Energy plan – would lead to an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.

The agency was ridiculed at the time for this admission, and now appears to be trying to reverse course. By adopting a different analytical method, according to the Times, the EPA will be able to reduce this number in order to defend its rollback of the Clean Power Plan.

Many experts, however, warn that there is no scientific basis to the EPA’s reported approach of assuming there are little to no health benefits from reducing pollution as much as possible. The methodology is expected to be made public in June as part of its Affordable Clean Energy rule roll-out.

“The EPA’s current agenda is to mislead and misrepresent the harms of the current Trump rollback agenda,” John Walke, clean air director and senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told ThinkProgress.

“But,” he added, “there’s also a future dimension – to handcuff the EPA and prevent them from protecting Americans and the environment.”

Targeting the science-based economics supporting air pollution regulations “would have very, very broad impacts,” Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, told ThinkProgress.

Revesz says the EPA is undercutting the science in three ways, under what he calls the “dirty trinity” — methods that are “extraordinarily flawed and inconsistent with what administrations [both Democrat and Republican]… have done for decades.”

The first method is by calling into question the co-benefits. “I see what the agency proposed in MATS as potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits,” he said, pointing to the EPA’s memo released this week calling on the four offices to reevaluate their cost-benefit analysis.

The next method is by calling into question the benefit of reducing particle pollution to below the national ambient air quality standards on PM 2.5. According to Revesz, the EPA’s logic espoused by the head of air quality, Bill Wehrum, is essentially to say there’s no extra benefit of reducing levels of PM 2.5 below what’s required under the national standards. This “flies in the face” of what previous administrations have done and what science has established, Revesz said.

Finally, he said the administration is trying to call into question previous studies on the harmful health impacts of particle pollution.

The impact of such a “comprehensive attack,” said NRDC’s Walke, is that “the outcome of the agency’s tortured analysis would indicate that greater protections are not justified.”

The proposed changes aren’t just opposed by scientists, environmentalists, and legal experts. They’re also, in the context of MATS, opposed by the utility industry, which has already spent billions of dollars to upgrade its facilities to be in line with the pollution rules. If MATS were to be halted, they would risk not recuperating the costs put into these upgrades.

So why do something so widely opposed? Janet McCabe, former acting EPA air chief, was posed this very question on Tuesday. “I don’t know, but I can think of two reasons why they would do this,” she told lawmakers during the MATS hearing. One of these is to “inaugurate this new way of looking at benefits, and devaluing the full range of benefits.”

The other, she said, is that “this administration has made very clear they will do everything they can to help the coal industry, and this rule is top of that list.”

While it’s hard to know exactly what is going through the minds of EPA officials when introducing these changes, the broader theme across their actions points to an industry-friendly agenda.

Given the widespread opposition to these proposed changes, Pew said, “it appears [EPA Administrator] Wheeler and Wehrum are acting in the interests of a very narrow group of companies, such as Murray Energy, Wheeler’s former client, that want the MATS rule to be withdrawn.”

In 2016, coal giant Murray Energy filed a lawsuit asking a federal appeals court to evaluate the EPA’s finding that it was “appropriate and necessary” to regulate power plants under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The lawsuit was seen as a way to challenge the EPA’s longstanding practice of considering co-benefits in its cost analysis for regulatory decisions.

As for the new math on the Clean Power Plan’s repeal, that too is tied to a former client of an EPA official.

In 2015, the Utility Air Regulatory Group — which is known for fighting clean air policies and lobbying against the Clean Power Plan — was represented by Wehrum, then a corporate lawyer at Hunton & Williams. The firm filed comments to the EPA on behalf of UARG, arguing that recognizing the benefits of saving lives and reducing PM 2.5 pollution below required levels “fail a common sense test.”

According to the Times this week, Wehrum echoed this logic, arguing that the premise that you can save billions by reducing pollution in areas that already meet the national standard “doesn’t make any sense.”

While the administration is taking the initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan, it claims it is not actually going to roll back MATS itself.

Some critics remain skeptical, however, and argue that by undoing the science that supports MATS, the EPA is opening the door for industry to challenge the rule all together — why have a rule if the agency’s own math says there aren’t many benefits?

Asked whether the EPA understands it is leaving this standard legally vulnerable, McCabe said she thinks it does. “If people think the EPA is not going to be asked to move forward to vacate the rule… they are mistaken,” she said. “The request will come immediately.”

It’s a “deeply cynical strategy,” Walke told ThinkProgress of the EPA’s attempt to undo the science while at the same time claiming it wants to keep MATS in place.

Doing this could “encourage litigation” by Murray Energy and others to undo the MATS rule, Pew said. “If that litigation were successful, there would be a race to the bottom for power companies to turn off or turn down their pollution controls.”

Coal company Peabody Energy has also indicated that the end result of the agency’s reevaluation to its cost calculations could be the entire undoing of the sweeping toxic pollution rule.

The chances of this type of lawsuit being successful, however, are hard to predict. But many expect it would be a long-fought battle — and that those fighting to keep the pollution controls in place would be able to point to the EPA’s questionable cost calculations and the established science to argue in support of the rules.

“I don’t think, in the end, they’ll be able to survive judicial scrutiny,” said Revesz, who believes the intention is designed to open the door to undermine co-benefits across policy areas rather than spur litigation.

The probability that the courts would uphold the EPA’s “flawed economic analysis” is “very low” he explained, because these actions are “inconsistent with regulatory practice, economics, science. They make no logical sense.”"
