Trump -- Kap should get job 'if he's good enough',https://www.espn.com,"['Jake Trotter', 'Mike Wells', 'Jenna Laine', 'Paul Gutierrez', 'Todd Archer', 'Courtney Cronin', 'Jeremy Fowler', 'Rob Demovsky', 'Turron Davenport', 'Tristan H. Cockcroft']",,,,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27355790/trump-kap-get-job-good-enough,"President Donald Trump said Friday that he would ""love"" to see Colin Kaepernick return to the NFL ""if he's good enough.""

The president was asked about Kaepernick during a meeting with the media outside the White House. Kaepernick, who last played for the San Francisco 49ers in 2016, posted a video to Twitter and Instagram on Wednesday showing himself in a gym and saying he is ""still ready"" after two-plus seasons out of the NFL.

Asked about Kaepernick's return, Trump said: ""Only if he's good enough. ... If he was good enough, they'd hire him. Why wouldn't he play if he was good enough?

""I think if he was good enough, I know the owners, I know Bob Kraft, I know so many of the owners, if he's good enough, they'd sign him,"" Trump said. ""So if he's good enough, I know these people -- they would sign him in a heartbeat. They will do anything they can to win games.

""Frankly, I'd love to see Kaepernick come in, if he's good enough. But I don't want to see him come in because somebody thinks it's a good PR move. If he's good enough, he will be in.""

Kaepernick drew national attention in 2016 when he sat, and later knelt, during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality in the United States. In the video released Wednesday, he was shown in a gym exercising, saying ""5 a.m., five days a week, for three years. Still ready."" The clip started with a countdown saying he had been ""denied work for 889 days.""

In 2017, at a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, Trump criticized NFL players who protested during the national anthem, suggesting that team owners release the players. He said the protests were ""hurting the game"" and that fans who were offended should walk out of games. Trump did not mention Kaepernick or any other NFL players by name at the rally, but earlier in 2017, he took credit for the fact that Kaepernick had not been signed.

Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March 2017 and has not been signed since. In October 2017, Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL under the collective bargaining agreement, alleging collusion against signing him to a contract. Both his grievance and that of current Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid were settled in February, with the Wall Street Journal reporting they would receive less than $10 million total."
Trump unloads on Biden: ‘Joe is not playing with a full deck’,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-hed-be-thrilled-if-biden-is-the-nominee-joe-is-not-playing-with-a-full-deck,"President Trump on Friday unloaded into Democratic 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden, saying he would be ""thrilled"" if the former vice president was his opponent next year and mocking him for his most recent gaffes on the campaign trail.

“Look, Joe is not playing with a full deck,” Trump told reporters outside the White House. “He made that comment and I said 'whoa.'""

BIDEN SAYS 'POOR KIDS' JUST AS BRIGHT AS 'WHITE KIDS' IN LATEST GAFFE

“This is not somebody you can have as your president, but if he got the nomination I’d be thrilled,” he said.

Trump was responding to mistakes made by Biden on the campaign trail Thursday when he told a crowd in Iowa that “poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.” Biden quickly corrected himself after some applause from the crowd at the Asian & Latino Coalition PAC, and finished, “wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids.”

His campaign was also quick to respond to Trump’s zinger with one of its own on Friday.

“Donald Trump’s deck is all jokers,” a campaign aide told Fox News.

Trump has delighted in making fun of Biden for what he sees as Biden’s declining mental capacity. Earlier this week, responding to Biden comparing his rhetoric to that of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace, Trump said that Biden has “truly lost his fastball, that I can tell you.”

On Friday, Trump kept returning to mocking the former Delaware senator, when he was asked about Democratic claims that he is a white nationalist.

“They call anyone a racist that when they run out of cards...they've got candidates,” he said. “Joe Biden can’t answer a simple question, something's going wrong with him.”

He then went on to make reference to the recent testimony of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who at times appeared to be struggling through the hearing at which he testified.

“A lot of people think he's the one who wanted Bob Mueller to testify,” Trump said. “Because it made Joe look intelligent.”

Rep. Nadler confirms that the impeachment inquiry Trump has feared is here,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Amber Phillips', 'Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress', 'August At Am']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/09/impeachment-inquiry-trump-has-feared-is-here/,"

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) (Andrew Harnik/AP)

House Democrats have begun impeachment proceedings against President Trump. A key Democrat admitted as much Thursday.

“This is formal impeachment proceedings,” the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), told CNN on Thursday, after weeks of dancing around whether his committee would formally consider impeaching Trump.

“We are investigating all the evidence, gathering the evidence,” Nadler added. “And we will [at the] conclusion of this — hopefully by the end of the year — vote to vote articles of impeachment to the House floor. Or we won’t. That’s a decision that we’ll have to make. But that’s exactly the process we’re in right now.”

His statement makes clear what a lawsuit filed Wednesday by his committee states: that the “Judiciary Committee is now determining whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the President based on the obstructive conduct described by the Special Counsel.”

In fact, Democrats may have already begun an impeachment inquiry without most people noticing and without the fanfare (and potential political backlash) of a big announcement that it’s happening. In a court filing in late July to get the full, unredacted Mueller report, the Judiciary Committee argued that it needed the information because it “is conducting an investigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.” Since then, Democrats’ language has only become stronger in court filings, culminating with Nadler’s statement that impeachment proceedings have begun.

[Connolly, member of House Oversight Committee, joins call for impeachment inquiry into Trump]

What that means: Democrats are taking the first step in this process. They have launched an impeachment inquiry to investigate what, if any, “high crimes and misdemeanors” Trump may have committed. If the investigation concludes that he has, the committee will draw up articles of impeachment and the Judiciary Committee and then the full House vote on it.

This is happening at the start of Congress’s August Recess (which is going to stretch until Sept. 9). So between now and then, any action will happen only in the courts. Once Congress is back, they can hold hearings highlighting the Mueller report, but their key witness and key documents could still be tied up in a legal battle.

If they get to the step of voting on articles of impeachment, we don’t know how that would fare. There are 30 Democrats who represent districts Trump won in 2016; only one of those backs an impeachment inquiry. More than 100 Democrats don’t even publicly support an impeachment inquiry; many of them represent swing or Republican-leaning districts. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has resisted informal impeachment proceedings because she fears it could cost Democrats the House next year.

Still, getting to this early stage in the process is the last thing Trump wanted. Not that he is in any real risk of getting kicked out of office. For that to happen, the Senate would have to hold a trial and two-thirds of the 100 members would have to vote to convict him. The Senate is controlled by Republicans largely loyal to Trump.

But when Democrats took back the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections, his team feared getting tied up in time-consuming investigations launched by House Democrats; investigations that have the potential to air some of Trump’s dirty laundry.

Impeachment proceedings are the most intense, and dramatic, kind of congressional investigation.

Consider: Democrats are already investigating issues including whether Trump obstructed justice in the special counsel investigation, whether he had a role in illegal hush-money payments during the campaign, whether his business had money laundering ties to Russia, and much more. Trump has resisted handing over information in 20 investigations, leading to legal battles.

[The 6 most potentially damaging investigations into Trump, ranked]

Most recently, House Democrats are suing Trump’s administration to try to get his tax returns and suing to get Trump’s former White House counsel, Donald McGahn, to testify about key moments in the Mueller report. (That’s the lawsuit they filed Wednesday where they said McGahn’s testimony is key for considering impeachment.) All that is in addition going to court to get the unredacted Mueller report.

Many of these investigations could get wrapped up into an impeachment investigation. And because that investigation carries the weighty “i” word, it guarantees news coverage and eyeballs on all future hearings Democrats have in this committee.

A catalyst for embracing the impeachment term seems to have been former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s III testimony in July to two House committees, where he laid out what his report found: that Trump’s campaign welcomed Russia’s help and Trump may have obstructed justice.

“We all looked up after Robert S. Mueller III’s testimony and realized that we are in an impeachment inquiry,” Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, told New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg.

“In every meaningful way, our investigation is an impeachment inquiry,” Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote in an op-ed in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, right as a majority of House Democrats said they supported taking the first step toward impeachment.

Arguing in under-the-radar court filings that the committee is beginning an impeachment inquiry is one thing. It could be a legal strategy that doesn’t carry much political weight. The “i” word strengthens Democrats’ case to get grand jury information underlying the Mueller report, or to force McGahn to testify, since Congress can argue it, too, is a judiciary body conducting a court proceeding, and it needs evidence to do that.

But having the chairman of the committee key to impeachment openly, and clearly, stating that an impeachment inquiry has started escalates things. The impeachment inquiry that Trump has feared is here."
State Department foreign service officer resigns in blistering criticism of Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/fso-resigns-washington-post-op-ed/index.html,"(CNN) A foreign service officer resigned from the State Department effective Thursday, writing in a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post that he could no longer serve in ""The Complacent State,"" particularly in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.

Chuck Park wrote in the op-ed that during his almost 10 years in the foreign service he ""worked to spread what (he) believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance.""

""But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home,"" he wrote.

Park said that after the election of President Donald Trump, he had remained ""complacent"" and had ""let career perks silence (his) conscience.""

""I let free housing, the countdown to a pension and the prestige of representing a powerful nation overseas distract me from ideals that once seemed so clear to me. I can't do that anymore,"" Park wrote.

""My son, born in El Paso on the American side of that same Rio Grande where the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter were discovered, in the same city where 22 people were just killed by a gunman whose purported 'manifesto' echoed the inflammatory language of our President, turned 7 this month. I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration. That's why I choose to resign,"" he said.

In an email to CNN, Park clarified that he made the decision to resign before the El Paso shooting, ""though it certainly reaffirmed it.""

Writing in the Post, Park noted that he has not seen an ""organized resistance from within"" to the Trump presidency, but rather ""The Complacent State.""

""Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore,"" he wrote.

""One thing I agree with the conspiracy theorists about: The Deep State, if it did exist, would be wrong,"" he said, noting that foreign service officers pledge to serve at the pleasure of the President -- or else they should quit.

Park told CNN that the reception to the piece has been ""almost uniformly positive"" with ""some mea culpas from personal friends still in the service; some offers of support as I transition to whatever is next.""

Asked why he chose to highlight his resignation in such a public way, Park said, ""I meant the piece more as allocution than a call to action or challenge to people in a similar situation, though most have read it as the latter.""

""Though we are keeping the metaphorical lights on, we are not the heroes that some make us out to be. The real 'resistance' must come from American voters in 2020,"" he said.

Park's cutting public rebuke is the latest by a former diplomat of the sitting President.

John Feeley, the former US ambassador to Panama, retired in March 2018. He wrote in The Washington Post that he made his decision shortly after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, noting ""The President's failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who provoked the violence made me realize that my values were not his values.""

""I resigned because the traditional core values of the United States, as manifested in the President's National Security Strategy and his foreign policies, have been warped and betrayed. I could no longer represent him personally and remain faithful to my beliefs about what makes America truly great,"" Feeley wrote.

Roberta Jacobson, who resigned as US ambassador to Mexico in May 2018, told NPR shortly after that Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policies were ""draconian and frankly un-American.""

She said ""part of the impetus"" for her departure ""was the increasing difficulty I had in trying to defend some of these policies and in trying to work with a Mexican government that was quite keen to work with us, only to see that sort of blown up periodically by tweets or rallies about the wall or about, you know, characterizing Mexicans, which was not what I experienced.""

Jacobson also penned a New York Times op-ed later that year detailing the ""disorder"" of working under the Trump administration and warning of deteriorating trust between Mexico and the US.

James Melville stepped down as US ambassador to Estonia in 2018 because he ""could no longer support President Trump's policies and rhetoric regarding NATO, our European allies and Russia."""
EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"The Trump administration has reauthorized the use of controversial traps dubbed “cyanide bombs” to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals across the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it would allow, on an interim basis, the use of M-44 devices, which trap wildlife with bait before spraying sodium cyanide into their mouths, according to CBS News.

The spring-loaded devices, which have killed more than wild animals since they were first introduced in the 1960s, have been blasted as inhumane.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“While the EPA added some restrictions, these deadly devices have caused too much harm to remain in use. We need a permanent nationwide ban to protect people, pets and imperiled wildlife from this poison,” she said.

The EPA has updated its rules to include some restrictions on the use of the devices, including banning their placement within 100 feet of a public road or pathway, increased from 50 feet. Warning signs also must be placed within 15 feet of each device, decreased from 25 feet.

A final decision on the use of the M-44s is expected to come down after 2021.

In 2017, a child was temporarily blinded and three pet dogs killed in two incidents involving the use of M-44s in Idaho and Wyoming, the BBC reported.

Canyon Mansfield’s family successfully sued the US government for $150,000 last year. One of the devices had been placed near their property in Pocatello, Idaho, and his dog triggered the device, The Guardian reported.

The EPA allows use of the devices by Wildlife Services, the animal-killing program of the US Department of Agriculture — and also authorizes their use by state agencies in South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Texas.

Last year, Wildlife Services got rid of over 1.5 million native animals — from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers, according to The Guardian. About 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s.

At the end of last year, the EPA proposed the renewed use of sodium cyanide, allowing time for public comment until March, CBS News reported.

More than 99.9 percent of the comments urged the agency to ban M-44s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity and Western Environmental Law Center.

“The overwhelming majority of comments from the general public, including the more than 20,000 letters from the write-in campaign, did not support the continued registration of sodium cyanide predacide uses (M-44 devices),” the EPA wrote in its proposal."
Early FBI interviews of DOJ contact with author of Trump dossier released,https://www.cnn.com,"['Katelyn Polantz', 'Jeremy Herb']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/doj-contact-trump-dossier-author/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department on Thursday night released 34 pages of memos from interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who was in contact with the author of the unsubstantiated 2016 dossier about Donald Trump and his presidential campaign.

Judicial Watch, a right-leaning group that advocates for government transparency, obtained the documents through a federal public records lawsuit. The memos are called 302s, an internal FBI moniker for its notes of interviews. In all, 12 FBI memos about Ohr were released, from interviews in late 2016 though spring 2017.

The release is among the few internal documents available -- besides FBI memos about an interview with former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the Mueller report itself -- that show investigators' early approaches to the Russia investigation.

The memos -- and Judicial Watch's interpretation of them -- highlight how Ohr wanted to share information with the FBI and how the FBI was gathering leads on Russians and the Trump campaign in late 2016 and early 2017. The disclosure of the memos on Thursday largely retreads and aligns with what Ohr and others have told House committees.

Judicial Watch and others have criticized Ohr, calling him a government official with a conflict of interest in 2016 who wanted to help federal agencies probe Trump's campaign by funneling them damaging and unfounded opposition research.

DOJ Official Behind Failed Census Citizenship Question To Leave Department,https://www.npr.org,['Hansi Lo Wang'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/749573662/doj-official-behind-failed-census-citizenship-question-to-leave-department,"DOJ Official Behind Failed Census Citizenship Question To Leave Department

Updated at 9:48 p.m. ET

John Gore, the main Justice Department official behind the Trump administration's failed push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, is set to leave the department Friday.

A person familiar with the matter tells NPR Gore plans to spend time with his family while he is ""discerning next steps.""

Gore, who has been serving as the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, is among the administration officials currently facing allegations of providing false testimony and concealing evidence as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question. In a recent court filing, Gore denied the claims made by advocacy groups represented by the ACLU, New York Civil Liberties Union and the Arnold & Porter.

Gore did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call requesting comment.

A partner at the law firm Jones Day before he joined the administration in 2017, Gore previously led the Civil Rights Division as its acting head. He ghostwrote the Justice Department letter to the Census Bureau that formally requested a citizenship question, which three federal courts have permanently blocked from 2020 census forms.

That letter, which was sent to the bureau in December 2017, claimed the administration wanted to add the question to the census in order to better protect the voting rights of racial minorities — a justification that a majority of the Supreme Court found to appear ""contrived"" and three lower courts have dismissed as a sham.

Pressed by plaintiffs' attorney Dale Ho of the ACLU during a deposition this past October, Gore testified that including the question is ""not necessary"" for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.

Earlier last year, Gore was criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers for failing to appear at a House Oversight committee hearing after he was invited to testify about the DOJ's request for a citizenship question. When he finally showed up at a follow-up hearing, he refused to answer lawmakers' questions beyond information that was publicly available.

Gore did later provide a written response to a question from Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic committee member from California, about the confidentiality of census responses. Current federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from sharing information identifying individuals until 72 years after the information is collected, and the data cannot be used against individuals.

An internal email released as part of the citizenship question lawsuits later showed that Gore and his staff crafted an intentionally vague response after discussing that the sharing of individuals' census information with law enforcement and national security officers may ""come up later for renewed debate."""
Prosecutor who helped craft Jeffrey Epstein plea deal resigns from DOJ,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/08/prosecutor-who-helped-craft-jeffrey-epstein-plea-deal-resigns-from-doj/,"A prosecutor who is being probed for helping negotiate the secret plea deal that allowed pedophile Jeffrey Epstein to avoid federal charges in 2008 has resigned from the Justice Department, her lawyer said Thursday.

A. Marie Villafaña will leave her post to join the federal Department of Health and Human Services — a move she had long planned, her attorney, Jonathan Biran, said.

“She is grateful for her career in the Justice Department and excited for a new opportunity at Health and Human Services,” Biran said.

Villafaña worked with several other federal prosecutors and her former boss, Alexander Acosta, to ditch a federal indictment of Epstein in 2008 and to charge him at the state level with minor prostitution charges, the Miami Herald reported.

Epstein was arrested in New Jersey in July and hit with federal sex-trafficking charges.

The Justice Department is now probing whether Acosta — President Trump’s former labor secretary — and other federal prosecutors including Villafaña illegally negotiated the plea deal that allowed Epstein to escape federal prosecution in 2008."
Ex-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe Sues Over What He Calls Wrongful Firing,https://www.npr.org,['Carrie Johnson'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/693598382/ex-deputy-fbi-director-andrew-mccabe-sues-over-what-he-calls-wrongful-firing,"Ex-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe Sues Over What He Calls Wrongful Firing

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP

Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has sued the Trump administration for what he calls his ""unlawful"" termination, arguing that his firing last year was the result of improper political interference by the president.

""It was Trump's unconstitutional plan and scheme to discredit and remove DOJ and FBI employees who were deemed to be his partisan opponents because they were not politically loyal to him,"" the complaint alleges.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed McCabe in March 2018, only hours before his 50th birthday, when his full law enforcement pension would have vested. McCabe's filing argues that he is ""entitled to his full law enforcement pension and all other benefits, privileges, and rights currently being withheld.""

In explaining the firing in April 2018, the Justice Department cited a ""lack of candor"" in McCabe's interviews with investigators looking into a 2016 media leak in the waning weeks of the presidential campaign.

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said the leak about investigations into Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation advanced McCabe's ""personal interests"" at the expense of the department's leadership.

McCabe has said those allegations were a pretext to get rid of him after months of abuse from President Trump, who had singled him out as a political scapegoat in the 2016 campaign. After McCabe's dismissal, Trump wrote on Twitter that it was a ""great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.""

To McCabe, the termination 26 hours before his scheduled retirement had everything to do with his role in protecting the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016.

McCabe said he was ""singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,"" he said in a statement last year.

Comey said he supported McCabe after his firing. But in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, Comey also said his ouster seemed appropriate, given the circumstances.

""This is what accountability looks like,"" Comey said.

Comey also said that the process had been infected with ""corrosive doubt"" because of Trump's attacks on McCabe in the past. Trump targeted McCabe in part because his wife had unsuccessfully run for state office in Virginia with support from Democrats.

Trump and Republicans said that meant McCabe was a Democrat and accordingly biased against the president, which McCabe has all along denied.

The U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., and a grand jury there have been considering whether McCabe may have broken any laws. So far no charges have been filed."
VA cuts off Van Nuys assisted living home that reported visit to veteran who had died,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'Gale Holland Is A Staff Writer For The Los Angeles Times Covering Homelessness', 'Poverty. She Has Also Worked For The Paper As An Editor', 'Columnist', 'Is A Recipient Of The Worth Bingham Investigative Reporting Award.']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-08/va-cuts-off-retirement-home-van-nuys,"Federal officials pulled veterans from a Van Nuys assisted living home after finding that the facility had reported a social worker visiting a veteran who had been dead for four days, according to a report released Thursday.

The investigation by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs also found serious medication errors at the California Villa home. A 100-year-old veteran with sepsis was denied prescribed antibiotics because they were “not covered by Medicare” and ended up hospitalized a second time, the report said.

Another veteran received a double dose of medication and a third was denied prescription drugs and charged $5 a meal because he preferred eating in his room rather than the cafeteria.

Authorities from Washington, D.C., blamed the VA’s Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System for failing to investigate and address “serious residential care concerns” at the facility, but added that program administrators had not reported the problems to upper management.

The healthcare system had California Villa on an approved list, and helped place veterans there, but suspended referrals and relocated most of their clients during the investigation in 2018.

The investigation was initiated by the U.S. Special Counsel based on whistleblower complaints.

“I am shocked that such lax oversight of facilities providing critical care for vulnerable veterans ever occurred,” Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner said in a letter Thursday to the White House. The investigation findings were also relayed to congressional oversight committees.

The California Department of Social Services had sought to revoke California Villa’s license after finding that the facility in 2017 had not addressed serious safety issues stemming from a resident’s repeated assaults on other residents, which resulted in at least one hospitalization, state records show.

The state agency also found that staff did not adequately clean feces from the furniture.

A new license for the facility was issued in March under the name California Green Tree Villa Ast Lvg & Memory Care. It is licensed for 200 residents.

Administrator Jacqueline Beltran said the facility changed hands Aug. 1, and added that she would relay questions to the new owners, who did not respond.

Kerner, in his letter, said VA investigators found California Villa facilities in “disrepair” and its medicine room disorganized.

The false report of the visit to a dead veteran stemmed from a misidentification by California Villa staff, investigators said.

The veteran was living on a locked ward for residents with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, or who were at risk of wandering. When a case worker arrived for a visit, California Villa staff directed her to the wrong resident, the investigation found. After the mix-up was discovered, an addendum was added to the veteran’s case notes saying “Please delete, wrong veteran.”

Investigators said the confusion called into question whether other residents had received incorrect medication.

The VA investigators did not uphold a whistleblower complaint that a VA manager had improper relationships with patients.

Werner praised the whistleblowers for bringing the problems to light and said one of them hoped the VA would investigate further allegations of a bedbug infestation and other problems."

White House rebuffed attempts by DHS to make combating domestic terrorism a higher priority,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jake Tapper', 'Anchor', 'Chief Washington Correspondent']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/white-house-domestic-terrorism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House officials rebuffed efforts by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, current and former senior administration officials as well as other sources close to the Trump administration tell CNN.

""Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism,"" one senior source close to the Trump administration tells CNN. ""The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home. They had major ideological blinders on.""

The National Counterterrorism Strategy , issued last fall, states that ""Radical Islamist terrorists remain the primary transnational terrorist threat to the United States and its vital national interests,"" which few experts dispute. What seems glaring to these officials is the minimizing of the threat of domestic terrorism, which they say was on their radar as a growing problem.

""Ultimately the White House just added one paragraph about domestic terrorism as a throw-away line,"" a senior source involved in the discussion told CNN. That paragraph mentions ""other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism."" It made no mention of white supremacists. (A separate paragraph in the report mentions investigating domestic terrorists with connections to overseas terrorists, but that does not seem to be a reference to white supremacists.)

The document mentions that domestic terrorism is on the rise, but the subject is only briefly addressed, all the more stark given that FBI Director Christopher Wray's July testimony that there have been almost as many domestic terror arrests in the first three quarters of the fiscal year -- about 100 -- as there have been arrests connected to international terror.

The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington. It names Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray, as well as the DOJ and FBI, as defendants. It comes the same week that another longtime FBI official who was fired from the bureau, Peter Strzok, brought suit alleging unlawful termination.

McCabe, who served in the FBI for more than two decades, alleged that President Donald Trump schemed to ""discredit and remove DOJ and FBI employees who were deemed to be his partisan opponents because they were not politically loyal to him.""

McCabe's public firing by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 16, 2018 was a ""critical element"" of the scheme, according to the suit. It says that the reason given for his firing — that he violated the law and FBI media rules by disclosing information related to an investigation into Hillary Clinton — was a pretext."
"Kevin McAleenan prepared to resign in June, felt undermined by subordinates",https://www.cnn.com,"['Geneva Sands', 'Priscilla Alvarez', 'Pamela Brown', 'Jeremy Diamond']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/mcaleenan-immigration-hardliners-white-house/index.html,"Washington (CNN) On Friday, June 21, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign.

Days earlier, President Donald Trump had issued a vague threat to deport ""millions"" of undocumented immigrants, providing few details of the effort and surprising officials within his own administration. McAleenan was concerned that the operation was half-baked and too far-reaching in scope. And he felt undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President over the issue that Trump cares most about, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Then-acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Mark Morgan had begun hyping an upcoming operation targeting undocumented migrant families for deportation and was speaking directly with the President about it, according to a source familiar with the situation.

Arriving at the White House, McAleenan met with the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and his deputy Emma Doyle, to make his case. The raids, he said, would anger Democrats and jeopardize the administration's request for emergency funding for the border; they should be conducted in phases rather than all at once; and he argued the department needed more time to build out the proper messaging, said a former senior administration official.

On June 22, Trump suspended the operation, citing objections from Democratic lawmakers. But it's not clear Democratic objections drove his decision and sources said Trump's decision to postpone the operation allayed McAleenan's concerns that his advice as the DHS chief was not being heeded. And, days later, Congress passed the $4.5 billion emergency border funding bill that McAleenan thought the ICE raids could undermine.

Immigration hardliners accused McAleenan, without direct evidence, of leaking details of the ICE operation, charges he has denied. The operation targeting 2,000 families ordered removed by an immigration judge eventually took place a month later, but fell short of its goal -- resulting in the arrest of 35 migrants

The episode put into view the tensions within the Department of Homeland Security and the rocky relationship between McAleenan and the White House. McAleenan, who has been increasingly surrounded by Trump loyalists and immigration hardliners, has at times been frustrated that some officials go around him, as he has grappled for control of the department, multiple administration officials tell CNN.

McAleenan took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was pushed out of her role at the urging of White House senior adviser and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. McAleenan, who was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, had the backing of the President's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.

But while Trump elevated McAleenan, he still sees the acting secretary -- a career official who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- as having an allegiance to the previous administration.

In a meeting with congressional Democrats about the government shutdown earlier this year, the President referred to McAleenan, then at CBP, as an ""Obama guy,"" Axios first reported in April.

McAleenan served under the former president, eventually rising through the ranks to the highest-ranking career position at Customs and Border Protection.

The President often still makes comments that McAleenan should go talk to Democrats since he knows how to deal with them, according to a source.

The relationship, however, runs hot and cold based on the numbers of migrants crossing the border and headlines the President doesn't like, sources tell CNN.

Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley praised McAleenan in a statement after this story published.

""In just a short time at the helm of DHS, Acting Secretary McAleenan has already substantially reduced illegal border-crossings, greatly expanded regional burden sharing, advanced vitally-important regulations, and significantly boosted the rapid removal and return of illegal aliens -- despite relentless obstruction from activist far-left judges and belligerently open-borders Democrat Lawmakers,"" Gidley said in a statement.

Four months into the role, McAleenan has had to navigate a migration crisis at the southern border and a White House that has shunned the traditional policy processes, all while leading the third largest federal department in the wake of a purge that left DHS and many of its component agencies without permanent leadership.

""It's arguably the most politically-charged job in government right now,"" said a senior DHS official about the acting secretary role.

In recent months, the three main immigration components in DHS have had a change in leadership -- Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The President's decision to swap out leadership appeared to be motivated by his desire to go in a ""tougher direction,"" as he once said, amid a swell of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border.

Trump's personnel choices have, on occasion, have had ideological conflicts with McAleenan. In addition to Morgan, Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia state attorney general, took over as acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services in June.

The White House, led by Mulvaney, previously looked into replacing McAleenan with Cuccinelli, who's been a public face on television on the President's policies, as acting secretary. A senior administration official said that option is no longer being considered.

A White House official told CNN that the ""President expects the acting secretary to continue his work"" on ""many additional policy changes,"" regulations, and foreign cooperative agreements.

However, McAleenan isn't expected to be offered the permanent secretary position, according to sources.

""There's still some apprehension. Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" said a DHS official about concerns over more leadership changes to come.

Trump told Fox News in June that McAleenan was ""doing a nice job,"" when asked about whether he will nominate him for the permanent secretary role.

""McAleenan, he is doing a very nice job. We're going to see. I've got to get used to him because it's a very important thing to me, the border. We need strong people at the border. And if people aren't strong, they're not going to do a good job.""

Despite the uncertainty that an acting role brings, multiple current and former DHS officials have praised McAleenan's depth of knowledge, operational experience and leadership.

""I think it's really hard being acting,"" said a former official. ""He is taking, if you will, taking the bull by the horns and spent his time doing the job.""

Trump focuses on numbers

US-Mexico border apprehension numbers are particularly important to Trump, who reviews the numbers at the beginning of each month and views them as a barometer of the situation along the southern border, according to administration officials.

Under his tenure as acting secretary, border apprehensions continued to soar to their highest level in a decade -- more than 130,000 -- before falling 20% in June and 24% in July , a drop that McAleenan attributes in part to a recent agreement with Mexico on immigration enforcement.

The numbers continue to go down for now, according to a source familiar with the trajectory, though they still exceed levels a year ago.

The White House has taken a retaliatory approach to immigration, rolling out policies that seek to discourage those who journey to the US-Mexico border. In March, the US announced it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, which the President accused of having ""set up"" migrant caravans for entry into the US.

McAleenan, who has been a proponent of regional investment in Central America, was not supportive of the move to freeze aid to the Northern Triangle, according to a former administration official.

During a visit to Guatemala at the end of May, McAleenan told CNN Trump was looking for investments that have a return on US interests, including the ability to address the causes of migration. The ""key measure"" of success is whether aid leads to a halt of migration to the US, he said.

""I think there's some very valid aid efforts that are ongoing but we got to assess them all carefully and make sure we're making the right investments,"" he said.

The architect at the core of the administration's immigration policies is White House senior adviser Miller, who had a hand in the purge within DHS earlier this year.

""I don't think anybody that works in the [immigration enforcement] space is eager to participate with him,"" said a former administration official, referring to Miller.

But McAleenan ""understands what Stephen's role is,"" the official added. Still, the two have clashed over Miller's attempts to make personnel changes within DHS, like placing Morgan into the role of acting CBP chief, according to a source familiar with the disagreement.

But McAleenan has forged a relationship with Kushner, the President's son-in-law, according to current and former administration officials, who released a proposal to reform the country's immigration system earlier this year.

During White House meetings, ""you could tell"" they had a ""close working relationship,"" said a former official.

A department roiled by turnover

Since assuming the acting secretary role, McAleenan has focused almost all of his public attention on immigration issues, while running a department that is also responsible for terrorism prevention, election security and natural disaster response. The acting secretary recently canceled a trip to London to travel to Guatemala to work on a new asylum deal that would return most migrants to Guatemala if they did not try to seek asylum there before journeying to the US.

At the end of July, Trump, standing behind McAleenan announced the asylum deal in the Oval Office.

The tension within the department's leadership ranks has become evident over time amid conflicting immigration views.

""The clash of those two views has caused a dysfunctional relationship within the leadership"" at the department, said the source, referring to diverging views on immigration enforcement. ""How do you repair the working relationships between the White House, and the [DHS] components? That seems ambitious, 'they are pretty frayed.'""

Morgan, who clashed with McAleenan over the raids, has since moved to Customs and Border Protection as acting commissioner, replacing John Sanders.

Sanders left the administration in part over concerns about the administration's rhetoric on ICE deportations, after the White House chose Morgan to serve at the acting commissioner, according to a source familiar with the personnel change.

McAleenan fought to keep Sanders at CBP, according to the source. With his departure McAleenan lost an ally at DHS.

""We've been surprised by the twists and turns in personnel,"" said a senior DHS official, who added that leadership appears to be in a ""decent place now."""
George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats,https://thehill.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/456619-george-soross-secret-2016-access-to-state-exposes-big-money-hypocrisy-of-democrats,"Liberal mega-donor George Soros made some big bets during the last U.S. presidential election. One was that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonJames Comey shows our criminal justice system works as intended The Hill's Morning Report — Will Congress do anything on gun control? Booker, Harris attend services with pastor who called homosexuality a sin MORE would win the presidency. Another was that he could reshape Ukraine’s government to his liking, and that his business empire might find fertile ground in that former Soviet state.

So when Donald Trump’s improbable march to the White House picked up steam in the spring of 2016, Team Soros marched to the top of the State Department to protect some of those investments, according to newly released department memos providing a rare glimpse into the Democratic donor’s extraordinary access to the Obama administration.

Then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland received repeated calls, emails and meeting requests from Soros, according to the memos obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the conservative group Citizens United.

On May 25, 2016, for example, Chris Canavan of the Soros Fund Management firm provided Nuland a written briefing under the heading “Russia sovereign bond issue.” At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinNATO's China problem GOP group targets McConnell over election security bills in new ad George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats MORE’s regime posed a threat to Soros’s vision for Ukraine.

“Toria, here is my take on Russia’s foray into the bond markets this week, based on the market chatter I’ve been able to pick up,” Canavan wrote in an email, released with heavy redactions hiding most of his advice to Nuland.

Canavan worked on the for-profit side of the Soros empire, and his cozy nickname relationship with the top State official responsible for Russia and Ukraine policy speaks volumes about the access Soros was afforded.

Six days later, the nonprofit side of the Soros empire rang the same doorbell. Soros and his top foundation official in Ukraine scored a hastily arranged call with Nuland to discuss European migration policy.

“Many thanks for sorting today’s call on such short notice — much appreciated,” a Soros official wrote Nuland’s aide. “During the call, Mr. Soros promised A/S Nuland he would send her his draft article on migration policy for the New York Review of Books.”

Few people in the world could command the attention of one of America’s busiest, most influential diplomats for a pre-publication read of a column. Soros apparently was one of those few.

A little over a week later, Soros's team reached out again to Nuland, this time seeking to discuss “EU visa liberalization for Ukraine and Georgia” after meeting in Brussels with a top European Union official. According to the emails to State, Soros’s team wanted the U.S. to intervene to get the EU to ease visa rules to help Ukraine, as that country pursued reforms advocated by Soros.

Nuland wrote back, alerting Soros’s top policy adviser on Eurasia, Jeff Goldstein, to a key piece of intelligence: One EU country “has changed its mind” and she was “happy to discuss this further.”

“We are working it. Not sure whether intervention by GS would help,” Nuland answered in response to Soros’s pressure.

Soros is arguably one of the largest, most influential donors of his generation, giving away as much as $1 billion a year to nonprofit and political causes and leaving an indelible imprint on policy positions of liberals worldwide. His reach and influence range from two dozen prosecutors he helped to elect in the United States, to fellows he helped train at the State Department, to global media institutions that he supports to the tune of $26 million annually.

His many admirers in America — including such financial beneficiaries as Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, as well as many of the 2020 presidential candidates — all advocate to eliminate the corrupting influence of big political money and the access that big donors win inside government. Often, those liberals suggest it’s a Republican problem.

But the 2016 State memos offer a powerful irony: In many ways, Soros is emblematic of the very financial influence and access that liberals seek to eliminate.

People close to Soros told me in interviews that he often had contact with government officials during the Obama years, including a 2010 meeting with Clinton at State. But they acknowledged the flurry with Nuland in spring 2016 was unusual both for its frequency and its intensity.

They said the exchanges were driven by Soros’s concerns about Ukraine’s future, not politics or business.

“George Soros is the founder of an organization that gives away a billion dollars a year to promote democracy and human rights around the world. It is for that reason that people at the State Department speak to him, not because he is a political donor,” top Soros aide Michael Vachon told me.

But a close examination of internal Soros organization documents show a close alignment of his political, business and philanthropic interests, especially in 2016.

Federal election records show Soros was one of the top 10 donors to Clinton’s 2016 election effort, giving a whopping $10.6 million to her campaign and the super PACs supporting it.

And when Soros sought to build U.S. pressure on Ukraine policy in 2016, he turned to Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, as a prelude to Nuland.

“Both the migration crisis and Ukraine are part of his view of Europe as falling apart, and the U.S. as ultimately not doing enough to prevent the political disintegration of its most important ally,” Vachon wrote Podesta in a March 2016 email that U.S. officials say was hacked by Russia and published by WikiLeaks. That email sought a meeting with the Clinton campaign chairman.

Politics and policy intertwined.

Likewise, Soros set out a bold vision in an internal 2014 memo for his Open Society Foundation to help root out corruption in Ukraine and build a “civil society” after the Maidan Revolution ousted the country’s Russia-friendly president. It worked with U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials to leverage the so-called Kleptocracy Initiative to fight corruption. The initiative enabled DOJ to prosecute or seek asset forfeitures from foreigners suspected of corruption, even if the crimes didn’t technically occur on U.S. soil.

Such initiatives are noble in principle. But in Ukraine, some targets had political and business implications as well.

For example, one DOJ investigation in 2014 targeted Ukrainian oligarch Dmitri Firtash. He and Soros both have significant energy interests in Europe — and rival plans to rebuild Ukraine. After Firtash’s indictment, Soros’s business announced plans to invest $1 billion in Ukraine.

Since then, significant problems have arisen with the DOJ’s case, thwarting efforts to extradite Firtash to the U.S. for trial.

Arguably, philanthropy and business collided.

On another front, a Ukrainian nonprofit funded in part by Soros was a cheerleader for the discovery of documents in Ukraine during the 2016 election that showed then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortDOJ releases notes from official Bruce Ohr's Russia probe interviews George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats Judge dismisses one of two charges against former Obama White House counsel MORE received millions in payments from Ukraine’s Russia-friendly political machine. The revelations led to Manafort’s resignation and eventual prosecution.

This time, philanthropy and politics found common ground for the Clinton-backing Soros.

And when Ukraine’s general prosecutor sought to investigate one of the country's nonprofits partially funded by Soros during 2016, the State Department pressured Ukrainian officials to drop the case.

Politics, philanthropy and governance were all intertwined.

Whatever political persuasion you hold, Soros’s election-year contacts at State speak volumes about the fact that big-money access to those in power is a bipartisan phenomenon.

"Trump administration moves to limit state powers to block pipelines, terminals",https://www.reuters.com,"['Valerie', 'Min Read']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-energy/trump-administration-moves-to-limit-state-powers-to-block-pipelines-terminals-idUSKCN1UZ1QV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday unveiled a proposal that would curb state powers to block pipelines and other energy projects, part of the Trump administration’s effort to boost domestic oil, gas and coal development.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen/File Photo

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency move drew swift criticism from New York's governor and an organization representing progressive states. It comes four months after President Donald Trump ordered the EPA here to change a section of the U.S. Clean Water Act that states like New York and Washington have used to delay pipelines and terminals.

“When implemented, this proposal will streamline the process for constructing new energy infrastructure projects that are good for American families, American workers, and the American economy,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a press release announcing the move.

The EPA's proposal is centered on changes to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which allows states and tribes to block energy projects on environmental grounds, it said www.epa.gov/cwa-401.

In its 163-page proposal, the EPA said a section 401 review “must be limited to considerations of water quality.”

Trump and EPA chief Andrew Wheeler have accused some states of denying permits for reasons that go beyond water protection such as climate change impacts.

The proposal says a state or authorized tribe must act on a

section 401 certification request “within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed one year” in an effort to speed up the permitting process.

The Trump administration has criticized New York for its decision to delay and block an interstate gas pipeline, Williams Cos Inc’s Constitution line from Pennsylvania, accusing the state of creating bottlenecks and supply disruptions.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called the EPA’s proposal “hostile”. It is “a gross overreach of federal authority that undermines New York’s ability to protect our water quality and our environment,” he said in a statement.

“It’s a hypocritical double standard,” said David Hayes, director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center, part of the New York University Law School, which coordinates policy with state attorneys general.

He said the proposal runs counter to the administration’s promises to support so-called “cooperative federalism” that gives states broad authority to decide policy.

“The Trump administration gives lip service to ‘cooperative federalism,’ but it practices ‘fair-weather federalism,” he said.

In 2017, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat and 2020 candidate for president, used the 401 provision to block a permit for the Millennium Bulk Terminal, a coal export facility that would have expanded the ability of companies to send Western coal to Asian markets.

Inslee said in April that Trump’s executive orders to weaken state powers would put the country on a “fatal path” of unconstrained fossil fuel use and hold back clean energy development."

There are times when retired Staff Sgt. Matt Lammers doesn't look like he needs anyone's help — like when he was competing, and winning, races at the Department of Defense Warrior Games in Tampa, Fla., this summer.

""We don't like to say the word 'can't' in our family,"" says Matt, who lost both his legs above the knee and his left arm to an explosion during his second deployment to Iraq in 2007.

Then he goes on to list all the things he just can't do without help from his wife, Alicia.

""She helps me shower. ... She helps me transfer in my wheelchair, drives me to my appointments,"" says Matt, while on a break between events at the games. ""I'd honestly say, not to be smart, but the question is, What she doesn't do?""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

Matt won medals at the games in Tampa for sitting volleyball, swimming and indoor rowing. At the end of the games, the U.S. Army gave him the ""heart of the team"" award. But he and his wife almost didn't attend, because they were short on cash to make the trip after Alicia was cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs' caregiver program last December because Matt had not ""consistently engaged in treatment,"" according to a letter from the VA. Alicia had been Matt's official caregiver for most of eight years.

""It felt like a stab in the back, like what I do is not worth it in their opinion, like I'm not part of their team like I thought I was,"" she says.

Uneven standards and implementation

The VA program provides support and a stipend to caregivers for post-Sept. 11 veterans, usually a wife or parent. It got going in 2011 and was instantly popular among vets as recognition of the billions of dollars worth of labor performed by family members for disabled veterans through the decades. The program was prepared for only a small number of applications and was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of veterans who applied.

Almost from the start, that meant problems with uneven standards and implementation around the United States. NPR has reported on hundreds of caregivers being arbitrarily cut from the program; so has the Government Accountability Office and the VA's inspector general. Twice in two years, the VA has frozen the process of discharging people from the caregiver program, most recently last Dec. 20.

""It is essential that we get this right,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said at the time. ""This affects one of our most vulnerable veteran populations, and we need to make sure we have consistency on how we process and evaluate benefit applications across VA.""

Unfortunately for Matt and Alicia, that freeze came six days after a letter from the VA in Fayetteville, N.C., on Dec. 14.

""I got a letter saying that I was out of the program because the veteran hasn't shown any progress since 2011,"" said Alicia. ""I asked them, 'What do you mean by progress?' ""

That question is at the heart of a fundamental problem with the way the VA caregiver program was created. Originally it was intended as a temporary intervention.

""Well, amputations and paralysis are permanent conditions,"" says Sherman Gillums, a former Marine who is paraplegic. ""It's not about recovery. It's about sustaining your life. Even if they're cut off from the program, they're still needing that care.""

Gillums is with the group AMVETS, but he's also on the VA's caregiver advisory committee. He's concerned that the VA needs to change the ""recovery based"" model now, before a planned expansion to older vets that could double or even triple the number of caregivers enrolled. And he says the program should be permanent for catastrophically injured vets such as Matt.

""No significant improvement""

Not that Matt's case is without its complications. Besides his missing limbs, Matt has PTSD and brain injuries.

""Not just the physical but the mental disabilities too — that is very challenging. It's every day. It's a constant change,"" says Alicia.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

She says that's why the VA's assessment that Matt hasn't improved hurt. He's doing better now than he has in years. He has struggled in the past with drug abuse and even ended up homeless. He has been abusive to his wife and others, sometimes physically.

""He has progress daily,"" says Alicia. ""But sometimes he has bad days or weeks. ... Life is like that.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

The Fayetteville VA told the couple in the Dec. 14 letter that ""there has been no significant improvement"" since Matt entered the program in 2011 and that he ""has not consistently engaged in treatment.""

In response to a query from NPR, the Fayetteville VA said that for Matt, the program ""was no longer in his best interest. He refused to follow his care plan, seriously endangering his health and that of those around him.""

The VA was alluding to his abusive behavior in the past. But Alicia says she has stuck with him through that.

""I'm not leaving. I'm still with him, and I'm still gonna do what I do,"" she says. ""I still have to help him. I still have to drive him. I still have to take him to appointments. I'm still gonna do this if you pay me or not.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

The VA also reached out to the couple and encouraged them to follow the VA's care plan and then reapply for the caregiver program in six months. They say they will, but Matt says he's still stung by the assessment that he hasn't made progress since 2011.

""All three of my limbs are still amputated, as they were June, 10 June 2007. Those have not grown back,"" says Matt. ""I wouldn't change anything for the world. I'm not complaining. I don't get hung up on injuries, but what they exactly expect from us triple amputees, single amputees, paras ... I don't, I can't really comprehend that."""
Donald Trump says he's done more than other presidents to solve the gun problem. Has he?,https://www.politifact.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hes-done-more-other-presidents-s/,"Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot.""

As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump accepted the endorsement of the National Rifle Association and released a Facebook video headlined by the remark, ""I won’t let them take away our guns!!""

Now, as president, he wants to be seen as a problem-solver on gun policy.

At a media availability on Aug. 4 following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, a reporter asked President Donald Trump, ""The gun problem – what are you going to do about it? How are you going to address it?""

Trump responded, ""We’re talking to a lot of people, and a lot of things are in the works, and a lot of good things. And we have done much more than most administrations. And it’s ... really not talked about very much, but we’ve done, actually, a lot. But perhaps more has to be done.""

We wondered whether it’s accurate that Trump and his administration have ""done much more than most administrations"" to curb gun violence.

We found that Trump has made two concrete moves that tightened gun policy and has taken additional actions on other aspects of curbing mass shootings. This is more than some of his predecessors have done. However, this tells only part of the story, because Trump and his administration have simultaneously advanced more policies that would expand gun rights or prevent efforts to limit gun rights.

Limits on gun rights

Trump has clearly acted to limit gun rights in two cases.

• Using regulatory powers to bypass Congress, Trump in 2018 acted to ban bump stocks, an accessory that uses recoil to effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic one. This technique was used by the shooter who killed 58 people and injured almost 900 attending a music festival in Las Vegas in 2017.

• Trump signed a large federal spending bill that included language to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. The legislation had received bipartisan support in Congress.

In addition, under Trump, the federal government has increased prosecutions of firearms offenses. (See our fact-check.)

The Trump campaign said he deserves credit for actions beyond the scope of guns specifically. They cited his signing of the STOP School Violence Act, which authorizes more than $1 billion in grant funding through 2028 to support violence-prevention programs in schools. The campaign also pointed to Trump’s establishment of the Federal Commission on School Safety. (The commission released a final report in December 2018.)

Expansions of gun rights and opposition to tightening gun rules

Still, the Trump administration’s gun-specific efforts have tended to focus on expanding gun rights or opposing tighter limits on them. Some examples:

• He signed legislation to overturn a rule enacted under President Barack Obama that made it harder for some mentally ill people to obtain guns. (Advocates for disabled Americans and civil-liberties groups joined with gun advocates in supporting Trump’s action.)

• Trump in 2019 threatened to veto bills passed by the House to require federal background checks for all gun sales. (A veto has not been necessary since the measures remain stalled in the Senate.)

• Trump’s Interior Department reversed a ban on hunting with lead ammunition in national parks and other federal lands.

• Trump’s Interior Department formally proposed a rule to expand hunting on federal lands.

• Trump’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives delayed an Obama-era rule to make gun-safety devices more readily available where firearms are sold.

• Trump’s Justice Department formally sided with plaintiffs seeking to overturn New York City restrictions on transporting handguns at the Supreme Court.

So, for Trump to focus solely on his efforts to limit gun rights ignores the more numerous examples in which he has sought to expand gun rights or prevent restrictions of gun rights.

""The Trump administration has been mostly missing in action on enhanced gun control,"" said Harold (Jay) Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida.

How Trump’s efforts to restrict gun rights compare to previous presidents

The universe of comparable presidents is actually pretty small. In the past 50 years, only two presidents — Bill Clinton and Obama, both Democrats — made tightening gun policies a significant item on their policy agendas.

In 1993, Clinton signed the Brady Bill, which heightened requirements for background checks, and the following year, he signed the assault weapons ban, which sunsetted after 10 years in 2004.

Obama, for his part, pursued gun control policies, especially after the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. But facing a Republican-controlled Congress opposed to gun control, such efforts went nowhere.

Instead, between 2013 and 2016, Obama undertook executive actions on mental health treatment, strengthened background checks, restarting federal gun research that had been frozen for years, funding additional federal agents, tracing guns found during investigations to determine trafficking patterns, and guiding U.S. attorneys to go after felons looking to buy guns or people lying in order to pass background checks.

""Trump has not had a pro-control record, although most previous presidents have not done much more"" than he has, said Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck.

However, experts caution against a direct comparison between Obama’s record and Trump’s.

""During Obama's administration, there were at least four bills to close the ‘gun show loophole,’ two attempts to renew the assault weapons ban, two attempts to ban high-capacity magazines, two to ban ‘build them yourself’ assault rifle kits, and one to ban imported assault weapons,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. ""Every single one of these 11 bills died on the floor of either the House or Senate, so it was never an option for Obama to sign them into law.""

Given that Republicans — the more consistently pro-gun party — have controlled either the presidency or at least one chamber of Congress for most of the past quarter-century, ""it’s not really surprising that more restrictions have not been passed at the federal level,"" Schildkraut said.

Our ruling

Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" Trump said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot.""

Trump has banned bump stocks, supported a bipartisan effort to improve the background-check database, and prioritized gun-related prosecutions. This number does compare favorably to what some other recent presidents have accomplished.

At the same time, Trump’s comment ignores that his administration has pursued multiple efforts to expand gun laws and regulations or to block efforts to tighten them.

“Approximately 30 detained aliens were released yesterday on humanitarian grounds at the individual sites,” said the US Attorney’s Office for the state’s Southern District in a press release Thursday.

“Another 270 detained aliens were released after being processed by HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] at the National Guard base in Pearl and returned to the place where they were originally encountered.”

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency conducted the raids on Wednesday at seven food processing plants throughout central Mississippi. About 680 people were said to have been detained.

ICE agents asked the workers when they arrived at the immigration processing center whether they had any children who were at school or child care and needed to be picked up, according to DOJ officials.

It is believed that “all children were with at least one of their parents as of last night,” they said.

“In order to make it possible for detained aliens to contact family members and address childcare issues, HSI made cell phones available for use by detained aliens to make arrangements for the care of their children or other dependents,” explained the US attorney’s office. “In addition, HSI had liaison officers working with the school districts to facilitate this process.

“As part of HSI procedures pursuant to this operation, if HSI encountered two alien parents with minor children at home, HSI released one of the parents on humanitarian grounds and returned that individual to the place from which they were arrested,” the DOJ release added. “HSI similarly released any single alien parent with minor children at home on humanitarian grounds and physically returned that person to the place where he or she was originally detained.”

Wednesday’s raids unfolded early in the morning in the cities and towns of Bay Springs, Carthage, Canton, Morton, Pelahatchie and Sebastapol.

Federal officials failed to notify the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services before detaining the workers with children, according to the Clarion-Ledger.

“We’ve been up all night trying to figure this out,” said MDCPS spokesperson Lea Anne Brandon on Thursday.

A rep for ICE confirmed the failed correspondence with the Clarion-Ledger.

“Law enforcement arrests people every day who may have children,” said agency spokesperson Bryan Cox. “Protocols and procedures [were] in place” and ICE coordinated with school officials to reunite the kids with their parents."

The State Department has put on leave an employee of its energy bureau after reports that he has been an active member of a white supremacist group for more than five years, two sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.

Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer for the department’s Bureau of Energy Resources, was linked to the Washington D.C.-area chapter of a white supremacist organization and published racist propaganda online, according to a report published Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate speech.

Story Continued Below

In a May 2018 episode of a white nationalist podcast, Gebert, speaking under a pseudonym, called for white people to establish “a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,” according to the SPLC report.

“We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,” the report quoted him saying.

Attempts to contact Gebert were unsuccessful. Twitter accounts that SPLC described in its report as belonging to Gebert and that have posted anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi messages were deleted as of Wednesday afternoon.

A State Department spokesperson did not reply to questions about Gebert‘s employment status.

“The Department of State cannot comment on personnel issues but is committed to providing an inclusive workplace,” a department spokesperson said.

Gebert started working at the bureau as a career employee in 2013, according to a posting in the George Washington alumni magazine the SPLC cited. He worked on energy issues involving Pakistan and India during his time there, former co-workers told POLITICO.

Former State Department officials expressed surprise that security screenings had not flagged Gebert’s involvement with the hate groups. Gebert would have undergone a routine screening before starting his position and another at his five-year work anniversary, said Amos Hochstein, who served as special envoy and coordinator for the State Department’s international energy affairs from 2014 to 2017 and was Gebert’s boss.

“It is inconceivable he got security clearance twice,” Hochstein told POLITICO. “If Gebert was Muslim or a person of color, it would have been caught. Neo-Nazis are not all shaved heads and tattoos, they are hiding in plain sight. I'm horrified Gebert worked for me at the State Department.“

A State Department spokesman did not respond to questions about the department’s security clearance practices.

EPA proposes downgrading Denver and northern Front Range to “serious” violator of air quality standards,https://www.denverpost.com,"['Jessica Seaman', 'Jessica Seaman Covers Health For The Denver Post. A Native Of North Carolina', 'Jessica Joined The Post After Stints As A Reporter In Greensboro', 'North Carolina', 'Little Rock', 'Arkansas. She Is A Graduate Of Unc-Chapel Hill.']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/08/colorado-air-quality-violations-epa/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it wants to reclassify the region encompassing Denver and the northern Front Range as a “serious” violator of federal health standards after ozone levels failed to meet air quality standards.

The move, which will require public comment, was expected as Gov. Jared Polis earlier this year directed state air officials to not pursue an exemption that would have reduced Colorado’s responsibility under the federal Clean Air Act.

The Denver region has been classified as a “moderate” violator of ozone standards since 2016. That region, as classified by the EPA, includes Denver, Greeley, Fort Collins and Loveland.

“We recognize how vital it is for the department to act and assertively reduce ozone pollution in the Denver Metro/North Front Range area — as well as throughout Colorado,” said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of the state health department, in a statement.

“With the backing of the state legislature and governor, we are moving forward on developing strategies to reduce emissions from oil and gas facilities, electrify the vehicle fleet and look for other ways to reduce pollutants that cause ozone.”

The EPA is making its decision to reclassify the Denver area based on air quality data collected between 2015 and 2017. The new designation will require new measures to be implemented to reduce emissions, according to a news release.

When Polis opted to forgo an exemption, he ordered work to reduce pollution in the state through measures that include using electric vehicles, adopting renewable energy and reducing oil and gas emissions.

Polis, in a statement, said his administration didn’t seek the exemption because it was time “to stop sugar-coating the bad state of our air quality.”

“Seniors and kids have been affected the most by our smog this summer,” he said. “Moving to ‘serious’ status finally helps us stop sweeping our air quality crisis under the rug and gives us additional tools to move urgently to make our air cleaner.”

The move comes as air quality in the Front Range has worsened in recent years, including as oil and gas companies have expanded in Colorado, causing ozone readings to exceed the 2008 health standards.

Other sources of ozone air pollution include cars and pollution from other states and countries. In Colorado, some air pollution has come from China, possibly from coal-burning power plants.

Ozone affects lung tissue and can aggravate diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, and it can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the EPA.

“EPA is proposing this action as required by the Clean Air Act,” said Gregory Sopkin, EPA Regional Administrator, in a statement. “We will continue to support the state as they revise plans and implement new measures that will reduce ozone-forming emissions across the many sources contributing to air quality impairment along Colorado’s Front Range.”

The agency will be accepting public comments on the proposal for 30 days starting Aug. 15. It will also hold a public hearing at its office in Denver on Sept. 6, the news release said."
Majority of employees report 'hostile work environment' created by St. Pete housing agency CEO,https://www.tampabay.com,"[""Christopher O'Donnell""]",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.tampabay.com/breaking-news/majority-of-employees-report-hostile-work-environment-created-by-st-pete-housing-agency-ceo-20190809/,"ST. PETERSBURG — The St. Petersburg Housing Authority is hiring an outside investigator to look into employee reports of a hostile work environment ""orchestrated"" by agency CEO Tony Love.

The complaints from a majority of staffers at every level emerged during a review of the troubled agency conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Even though the review is ongoing, HUD officials felt it necessary to warn the Housing Authority's governing board that the treatment of staffers is putting the agency at significant legal risk.

""A topic that was consistent from the majority of the staff at every level was 'hostile work environment,' "" Elis Wilson-Henri, HUD public housing regional director for the southeast, wrote in an email to Housing Authority board members.

He has ordered the board to respond with a proposed plan to investigate and deal with the allegations.

Board Chairwoman Stephanie Owens said the housing authority has contracted with law firm Saxon Gilmore to hire an outside investigator. Its senior partner, Ricardo Gilmore, already serves as special counsel to several housing authorities, including Tampa's.

""We’re very concerned,"" Owens said. ""We take those types of allegations very seriously and recognize the importance of taking immediate action and that’s what we’ve done.""

The investigation could be another setback for Love, who has faced criticism after a series of missteps including charging a board member for public records and a Tampa Bay Times investigation that revealed he lived rent-free for nine months in an apartment designated for low-income families.

It also may detract from his recent success in winning coveted tax credits from the state to help refinance the redevelopment of Jordan Park. The credits were awarded last week by the Florida Housing Finance Corp. They can be sold to companies to raise funds for the public housing project's redevelopment.

Housing Authority spokesman Michelle Ligon said neither Love nor the agency would comment until the HUD review is complete.

Complaints about Love's management style, particularly of female employees, has emerged as a problem before.

In 2016, at least two senior staff complained about his treatment of women in anonymous questionnaires they were asked to fill out as part of Love's first evaluation as CEO.

That prompted board members to insist that Love work with Massachusetts housing consultant Leo Dauwer on his people skills, for which Dauwer's firm was paid $3,600.

In a five-hour meeting with the consultant, Love acknowledged he “screamed’’ at staffers and on one occasion made them do non-agency work for him.

But complaints have continued this year. In February, one was filed with human resources by Robin Adams, the authority's asset management officer. She reported needing counseling to deal with the “extreme stress” and anxiety caused by Love, who is paid $157,000 annually to run the agency.

“Mr. Love has consistently verbally abused, harassed and degraded me and other senior staff members, especially female staff members, through one-way interrogations, baseless chastising, insults and bullying,” she wrote. Some six months after the complaint was filed, it was still pending.

HUD decided to conduct a review of the Housing Authority after it used agency funds to sue Mayor Rick Kriseman and the City of St. Petersburg when council members voted to remove three board members for lax oversight. The board members removed from office were staunch allies of Love.

The agency's lawsuit argued that charges of misconduct and neglect of duty cited to justify removal were a ""pretext"" so Kriseman can appoint commissioners who will fire Love.

A judge dismissed the lawsuit, leaving the Housing Authority with at least $27,000 in legal fees.

Wilson-Henri, the HUD official, also told board members in his email that its review has raised some concerns about the Housing Authority's spending. It did not provide any examples.

Still, board members voted at a special meeting earlier this week to lower the threshold for agency spending without prior board approval from $150,000 to $20,000.

""This gives the board closer and more tight checks and balances,"" Owens said.

Trump Criticized DOD’s Potential Cloud Deal With Amazon. Now The Program Is On Hold,https://dailycaller.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://dailycaller.com/2019/08/07/trump-amazon-dod/,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is under fire as lawmakers are questioning why Amazon’s cloud technology was unable to detect the Capital One hack.

The company is being scrutinized after President Donald Trump’s criticisms prompted the DOD to put a hold on a program giving Amazon the ability to build out the agency’s cloud technology.

DOD’s decision to place a hold on the $10 billion program also comes as critics of Amazon’s role in the project manage to impress upon Trump how deeply Bezos was involved.

President Donald Trump’s growing skepticism of a potential Department of Defense cloud computing program with Amazon comes as CEO Jeff Bezos fields questions about why his company’s technology was unable to prevent the Capital One hack.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper is now reviewing accusations of unfairness in the contract process for the program, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), the Pentagon announced on Aug. 1. His decision came after Trump ratcheted up criticism of the project. Amazon and Microsoft are the only two finalists.

Amazon, which is expected to land the program, is now wrestling with questions from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, who wants to know why the company’s cloud computing technology was unable to prevent Capital One hack. The company stored the 106 million Capital One credit-card records an accused hacker allegedly stole.

Capital One blamed the incident on “a specific configuration vulnerability” in the way it uses Amazon’s cloud. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday how the accused hacker was allegedly able to exploit a weakness in some misconfigured networks that cloud security experts frequently warn about. Amazon has not replied to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Conservatives and other experts warn that relying on one cloud system creates severe security risks.

“The use of multiple cloud solutions follows industry-wide best practices utilized by most Fortune 500 companies. Mr. [Trey] Hodgkins [of IT Alliance for Public Sector] noted that by using multiple providers, the cybersecurity and functionality of the JEDI system would be improved, costs would decrease through increased competition,” conservative groups wrote in a May 16 letter to Russell Vought, the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget.

Esper’s review is expected to delay awarding the JEDI contract, which would give the Pentagon a single cloud computing system for data ranging from personnel statistics to intelligence information rather than the hundreds the military currently uses. (RELATED: Trump Says He’s Getting A Lot Of Complaints About DOD’s $10 Billion Cloud Project)

Controversy has plagued the cloud computing program. Computing giant Oracle, for instance, alleged in a May 31 complaint that former DOD official Deap Ubhi was offered shares in Amazon and a salary with the big tech giant while he was finding a company to help build out JEDI. Ubhi never recused himself, according to the document.

Instead, “he spent weeks as a DoD official, downloading the JEDI Google drive to his laptop, meeting with AWS competitors as a DoD official, requesting and participating cloud meetings … and obtaining submissions from JEDI competitors,” Oracle noted in its document, referring to Amazon Web Services, the arm responsible for implementing the system.

Other reports revealed similar problems. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis attended a 2017 event with Teresa Carlson, vice president of Amazon’s worldwide public sector services. The dinner ultimately helped forge another meeting in August 2017 between Mattis and Bezos, The Wall Street Journal reported in July, citing emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

White House officials recently showed Trump a document that connects Ubhi and others to a ploy awarding Amazon the 10-year contract, CNN reported in July, citing documents. The document is identical to one from Oracle lobbyist Kenneth Glueck, an executive vice president with the company. The DCNF has independently confirmed the existence of the flow charts.

Trump has gotten more public in his criticisms. “So I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid,” the president said during a July interview. He was referring to complaints conservative have made recently about a $10 billion winner-take-all cloud computing contract. The president also retweeted a Fox News segment on July 22 criticizing the JEDI contract as “The Bezos Bailout.”

Now it is reported that Comey himself has been found by Horowitz to have shared government memos containing potentially classified information with The New York Times, yet the Justice Department does not intend to charge him with a crime for it.

Are our senior government officials simply above the law that us mere citizens of this nation remain subject to? The answer is no. While it may appear confusing and unfair to many Americans, this is really the criminal justice system functioning the way it was intended.

A basic tenet within our system is that prosecutors wield discretion, recognizing that with limited resources there is no way every potential violation can be prosecuted. This prosecutorial discretion is not absolute or subject to exercise on a whim. There are factors set forth by Justice Department policy that must be considered in the decision whether to prosecute or decline a case. These include, among others, the nature of the offense, the quality of the evidence, the past history of the alleged perpetrator, and the likelihood that the behavior will occur in the future.

ADVERTISEMENT

For certain crimes, a critical component of this prosecutorial analysis is the question of intent. Actions can be the result of poor decision making, negligence, or mistake, yet they may not rise to the level of criminality if the perpetrator did not willfully violate the law. Whether a prosecutor thinks the evidence exists to prove intent is a judgment call that must be made on a case by case basis. That is another reason, when it comes to federal employees, that misconduct may result in disciplinary options up to and including termination but still not end with any criminal charges.

Then there is the question of whether political ramifications should have an impact on whether to bring charges. Prosecutors and officials within the Justice Department are supposed to make these decisions without regard for their personal politics. But that does not mean the political fallout of a high stakes prosecution can be completely disregarded. When Justice Department officials at the highest levels must grapple with the question of whether to charge a Cabinet secretary, a senior FBI official, or other top ranking individual, they know full well their decision will be heavily scrutinized by the public for political bias. This likely means in close calls the decision leans in favor of not bringing a criminal case.

Thus, as it turns out, not every wrong committed or every instance of misconduct can or should become a criminal matter. Many were furious that Clinton never faced charges, convinced that the combination of President Obama, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and Comey managed to stack the deck in her favor. But the reality is that there were serious questions about whether prosecutors would have been able to prove that Clinton intentionally mishandled classified information. In the case of McCabe, there were legitimate factual issues around whether McCabe had authority to make certain contacts with the media and whether his statements to investigators were lies or instead legitimate efforts to correct the record. In a close call and with all these factors to consider, the system rightfully found in favor of not pursuing charges.

As for Comey, it is difficult to understate the damage his actions have had on public confidence in the FBI and the criminal justice system. If he had any legitimate concerns about the actions of Trump, there were multiple options for appropriately reporting those concerns either internally within the Justice Department or to Congress. He chose instead to improperly take memos he had prepared in detailing his conversations with Trump, which may or may not have contained classified information but were clearly government property, and leak them to The New York Times. His cynical goal of triggering a special counsel appointment succeeded in giving us the ordeal that was the Russia investigation by Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerTrump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony Kellyanne Conway: 'I'd like to know' if Mueller read his own report MORE.

Horowitz has impeccable credentials as a principled and nonpartisan public servant and, for full disclosure, he was my mentor and law partner before his return to government service. While his report has yet to be released, any findings he makes against Comey or others should be taken very seriously. However, that said, any findings of misconduct or even of potential legal violations may not necessarily translate into a criminal case based on the many factors and considerations that have to go into making charging decisions. Far from being a conspiracy or a defect within our criminal justice system, this is exactly the way the process should work.

Hundreds of USDA employees to be removed from their jobs in September,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.

The Agriculture Department is preparing to issue hundreds of termination letters to employees who have not agreed to move from the District of Columbia to Kansas City. The notices, arriving sooner than some workers and their supporters expected, will accelerate a controversial relocation process that has already stripped two USDA agencies of key research staff.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced he would relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio of scientific grants, and the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency. The agencies rent office space in Southwest Washington near the waterfront.

In June 2019, Perdue declared the Kansas City region as the site of the new offices. USDA’s cost-benefit analysis suggests the move will save taxpayers $300 million over 15 years. The department has not said whether the employees will work in Kansas or Missouri; instead, it has set aside temporary office space for staff in its Beacon Complex in Missouri.

On June 13, USDA sent reassignment letters giving workers until 11:59 p.m. on July 15 to respond. Those who declined or who did not respond would lose their jobs, the letter warned.

The American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403, the union that represents the agencies, requested an extension for the deadline. Given the 900-mile distance from Washington to Kansas City and the uncertainty around which state to move to, the union considered 30 days insufficient time for employees to make a commitment.

In a phone call with Sen. Christopher Van Hollen (D-Md.) on July 14, Perdue told the senator the deadline would be extended until Sept. 30, according to the senator’s description of the call.

Two days later, Van Hollen and 18 other Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to Perdue to confirm the Sept. 30 deadline. Also that day, USDA announced that 250 USDA employees, two-thirds of those reassigned, declined to relocate and would lose their jobs.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney recently praised the USDA attrition as a way to “drain the swamp.”

On July 17, Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) wrote a letter to Perdue asking why he had not yet responded to the extension request. “We have heard from numerous federal workers who have requested personal extensions to this July 15 deadline, yet none has been approved,” Wexton wrote. “One such extension request would allow a current employee undergoing chemotherapy to continue their treatment with their trusted team of physicians.”

In a letter to Van Hollen in late July, the secretary said the July 15 deadline was final but that the department would evaluate employee extensions on a case-by-case basis.

Perdue never replied to Wexton’s letter, the congresswoman said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday. The department also “failed to respond to the employees who made requests for extension — yet they are able to issue termination letters to hundreds of dedicated public servants,” she added. On Tuesday, USDA notified the union that employees would soon begin receiving the termination letters.

A draft termination letter obtained by The Washington Post, whose authenticity was confirmed by two USDA employees and Wexton’s office, states that employees will be fired Sept. 27.

USDA did not respond to questions from The Post. The department provided a statement: “While USDA did not extend the notification deadline of July 15, we have continuously maintained that employees have until the report date to amend their decision which may include changing from a no to a yes. We are actively working with employees so they can make the decision in a timely manner to ensure they are able to take advantage of all available resources. The mandatory report date for relocating employees in Kansas City is Sept. 30, 2019.”

An investigation by the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, published Monday, determined that money already spent on the relocation violated the 2018 spending bill, because USDA did not acquire congressional approval.

USDA’s general counsel argued that the requirement for congressional approval was unconstitutional. In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Scott Hutchins, the USDA deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, said the department attorney’s opinion is binding.

“No one should be concerned about being accused of, or punished, for violating the Antideficiency Act when they incur and submit requests for reimbursement for relocation costs,” Hutchins wrote. Some USDA employees, he said, have already arrived in Kansas City.

Wexton called for the relocation to be halted immediately. “Secretary Perdue is ignoring his own inspector general, he is ignoring Congress,” she said, “and he is ignoring many of the farmers he supposedly serves.”

Maryland REAL ID Requirements Approved By Homeland Security,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/08/08/maryland-real-id-requirements-approved-by-homeland-security/,"



The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has given MDOT MVA the green light on its REAL ID requirements.

The Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration officially has approval for its compliance with the federal REAL ID requirements, the agency recertified them on Wednesday- making Maryland the first state to achieve that designation.

The recertification affirms that Maryland has all documentation and security procedures in place that are required to make their REAL ID driver’s licenses and identification cards compliant with federal law.

Maryland became one of the first states in the nation to have it certified in 2011.

The REAL ID Act requires all states to recertify periodically. It was passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The law creates standards for secure driver’s licenses and identification cards nationwide.

RELATED COVERAGE:

By October 1, 2020, all Marylanders must have documents on file and be REAL ID-compliant to use a state-issued driver’s license or identification card to board an airplane or enter federal government facilities.

The documents required include a birth certificate or passport, proof of social security and two documents proving Maryland residence.

The EPA's inspector general evaluated how the agency responded to an executive order from President Donald Trump issued in January 2017 mandating federal agencies control costs by cutting regulations. The EO asked that for every one regulation an agency issued, two regulations be cut.

The EPA cut 26 regulations, saving the agency more than $96 million, and created four new regulations -- far more than the 2-to-1 ratio the White House had requested, according to the report. The agency saved roughly $6 million more than the Office of Management and budget requested.

In the administration's first year, ""the EPA had the highest number of deregulatory actions of any federal agency,"" according to the report.

These actions include rollbacks of environmental regulations that govern water, air and greenhouse gas emission levels.

Nikola receives $1.7M grant from US Department of Energy for fuel cell research,https://www.teslarati.com,['Simon Alvarez'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-rival-nikola-get-1-million-us-department-of-energy-fuel-cell-research/,"Nikola Motors was recently awarded by the US Department of Energy with a $1.7 million grant to help the startup advance its research into fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) technology. The grant comes amidst the potential Tesla Semi rival’s continued efforts to develop durable hydrogen technology for commercial trucking.

In a press release, Jesse Schneider, Nikola’s executive vice president of Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Technologies, stated that the Department of Energy’s grant would allow the aspiring truck accelerate the development of hydrogen technology for its vehicles, which the company believes could potentially disrupt the lucrative trucking market.

“This award provides an opportunity for the highly talented Nikola team to leverage expertise in academia and exceptional resources within the DOE Fuel Cell Consortium for Performance and Durability to accelerate a breakthrough that will benefit the entire hydrogen and fuel cell industry and community,” Schneider said.

Nikola’s grant was given by the US Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Transportation Office, as part of the recently announced FY19 Commercial Trucks and Off-Road Applications FOA. NEL Hydrogen of Oslo, Nikola’s hydrogen partner, was also awarded a $2 million grant by the DoE.

The trucking startup’s fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) research is aimed at developing an architecture that could satisfy the power output needs and durability requirements of heavy-duty applications, such as the operations of the company’s long-haul vehicles like the Nikola One. The truckmaker noted in its press release that its research is being conducted alongside academics from Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, and Georgia Institute of Technology.

Nikola claims that it currently has 14,000 orders for its Class 8 trucks. The vehicles are expected to be manufactured in a factory in Coolidge, AZ. Testing is expected to begin on Arizona roads this year, with full production to commence in late 2022. Nikola is yet to reveal if its initial production runs will involve the original Nikola One sleeper truck, or the smaller, newer Nikola Two daycab, which was formally unveiled last April.

This timeframe would likely result in Nikola’s electric trucks entering the market later than the Tesla Semi, which is already undergoing extensive testing on multiple states across the US. Production of the Tesla Semi is expected to begin sometime next year, as noted by the electric car maker’s executives in the company’s first-quarter earnings call."
"Ex-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe sues over firing, blames Trump",https://nypost.com,['August'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/08/ex-deputy-fbi-director-andrew-mccabe-sues-over-firing-blames-trump/,"WASHINGTON — Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe sued the Department of Justice and the FBI Thursday over his March 2018 firing, arguing that it was a political move at the hands of President Trump.

McCabe’s ouster came less than two days before his 50th birthday — when he was planning to retire and would have been eligible for full pension benefits.

McCabe was briefly head of the FBI in the days following the president’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, prompting then Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to tap Special Counsel Robert Mueller to take over the bureau’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and any contacts Russians may have had with the Trump campaign.

As part of his criticism of the Russia investigation, the president used McCabe as an example of political bias within the institution, noting how McCabe’s wife had run for elected office as a Democrat, and took donations from a political action committee associated with former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close political ally of Bill and Hillary Clinton.

“Why didn’t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but go big dollars ($700,000) for his wife’s political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!” Trump tweeted back in July 2017.

Trump continued the onslaught for almost a year and cheered McCabe’s firing. It had been justified by an internal review by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, alleging McCabe misled investigators about his role permitting FBI officials to speak to the press.

As defendants the lawsuit lists current Attorney General William Barr, the Department of Justice and FBI Director Christopher Wray, who took over after McCabe.

But it’s Trump who gets the blame in McCabe’s suit, filed in federal court in Washington, DC.

“Trump, acting in an official capacity of President of the United States, is responsible and accountable for Defendants’ actions,” the lawsuit said.

“Trump purposely and intentionally caused the unlawful actions of Defendants and other Executive Branch subordinates that led to Plaintiff’s demotion and purported termination.”"
"Withdrawal of US troops in Syria strengthened ISIS resurgence, DOD watchdog says",https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/08/withdrawal-of-us-troops-in-syria-strengthened-isis-dod-watchdog-says.html,"A convoy of US forces armoured vehicles drives near the village of Yalanli, on the western outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Manbij, on March 5, 2017.

Syrian forces backed by the United States are struggling to contain ISIS following President Donald Trump's partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country, a Defense Department watchdog warned in a report released this week.

The report, produced by the department's office of inspector general, found that between April and June the so-called Islamic State consolidated its power in Iraq and mounted a resurgence in Syria.

Trump announced in December that the U.S. would soon reduce its fighting force in Syria, surprising allies and prompting the departure of then-Defense Secretary James Mattis.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter announcing the decision.

""I defeated 100% [of the] caliphate,"" Trump said during an interview with C-SPAN last month. ""That doesn't mean ISIS doesn't go running around bombing a store and doing what they do, because they're stone cold crazy, but we've done a great job.""

But the report, which largely summarizes the views of the U.S.-led military task force overseeing operations against ISIS, says that the group remains a threat in Iraq and Syria despite the loss of its final stronghold in Syria earlier this year.

The report says that ISIS retains between 14,000 and 18,000 members in Iraq and Syria, including about 3,000 foreign fighters. It also retains an extensive, global social media operation to recruit fighters.

In both countries, ISIS fighters carried out targeted assassinations, ambushes, suicide bombings in public places, and set fire to fields of crops, the report said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The insurgency did not carry out conventional attacks or attempt to take back territory, the report said, instead it sought to wreak havoc and decrease support for government institutions.

In Syria, it also began to reestablish ""illicit fundraising capabilities"" which the report likened to ""taxes"" on residents and businesses where it operates, the inspector general found. In Iraq, it was able to establish logistics nodes for coordinating attacks, bolstered by fighters who arrived from Syria following their final territorial defeat in March.

The group is strongest in Syria in the Dayr az Zawr province, parts of Raqqah province, and Homs province near Palmyra, the report said.

The report says the U.S. drawdown, completed in the spring, left American-backed Syrian forces ill-prepared to develop trust with local communities and develop human-based intelligence ""necessary to confront ISIS resurgent cells and insurgent capabilities in Syria.""

""Despite losing its territorial 'caliphate,' the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) solidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria this quarter,"" the report says.

In one massive camp in Syria, Al Hol, the absence of U.S. troops has left Syrian partners without the ability to provide more than minimal security, leading to the ""uncontested conditions to spread of ISIS ideology.""

""ISIS is likely exploiting the lack of security to enlist new members and re-engage members who have left the battlefield,"" the report says.

The withdrawal also limited the U.S. capacity to track the humanitarian situation at the camp, which is home to 70,000 people, two-thirds of which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimates are children.

The United Nations estimates that 11,000 residents of the camp are relatives of ISIS fighters, and the U.S. military estimates that as many as 45,000 are ISIS supporters.

In the coming months, the U.N. estimates that upward of 30,000 Iraqi residents at al Hol, primarily women and children, will return to Iraq.

Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of State responded to a request for comment.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that he had not read the report, The Wall Street Journal reported, but noted that the administration ""is incredibly mindful of the success we've had versus ISIS, and the challenge that it continues to present to the world."""

STEAMBOAT SPRINGS — The Yampa Valley Housing Authority is working toward a new affordable housing project on Steamboat Springs’ west side with the developer Gorman and Co.

The development is planned for a corner lot at the northwest side of the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and the newly built Sunlight Drive on Steamboat’s West End.

While the specifics of how many units will serve what income level hasn’t been determined, current plans for the project call for 84 rental units deed-restricted to Routt County households earning 80% to 120% of area median income with an average income of tenants in the project earning 100% of area median income.

Routt County’s area median income is currently $60,300 for a single-person household and $86,100 for a four-person household.

These income limits would be enforced by a perpetual deed restriction which could not be lifted should the property be foreclosed on.

Kimball Crangle, Gorman’s Colorado market president, said her company had been “talking peripherally” with the Housing Authority for a couple of years. The company responded to a recent request for qualifications from the Housing Authority.

“We started digging into Steamboat to see what you all probably live daily, that there is a housing crisis up here and that affordability for the local workforce is quickly evaporating, if not completely evaporated already,” she said.

Gorman operates in multiple states. In Colorado, the company has developed workforce housing projects in Vail and is in the process of completing a project in Keystone, according to Crangle and the company’s website.

The Housing Authority and Gorman aim to begin construction by May 1, 2020, and to complete the project by 2021.

“We committed to the voters that we were going to build a new project every year, and this is keeping that momentum going and building units for our local workforce and really providing more options for our local workforce, which is really important,” Housing Authority Executive Director Jason Peasley said.

Unlike the Housing Authority’s recent projects, this project would not be financed using the sale of tax credits. This means the Housing Authority will be investing more of its own money, generated by a property tax approved by voters in 2017, to subsidize each unit to undercut market rental prices. The Housing Authority will contribute $1.4 million in capital to the project.

“From a cost standpoint, it’s really no different, but on the sources side, because there are no tax credits, it means we have to target a higher income level,” Peasley said. “With higher incomes, we have more revenue, and we can, therefore, borrow more to help pay for the cost of it. Also, we as the Housing Authority will invest more money per unit.”

Terms of the project will be hashed out under a draft letter of intent that was approved in essence by the Housing Authority board Thursday. With direction from the Housing Authority board, attorneys between the two parties will be hashing out some final sticking points before it is granted final approval by Peasley and the Housing Authority board’s development committee.

Board member Catherine Carson was the sole nay vote against the approval. While she “loved the concept,” she was not comfortable with the mechanism in which the price of rent would be determined within the project.

The Housing Authority is also making progress on its other developments.

Peasley said Alpenglow Village closed Aug. 2 on the sale of its tax credits with Wells Fargo. The complex, located on Pine Grove Road, kicked off vertical construction last month and is expected to begin leasing in spring 2020.

The Housing Authority is also pursuing state tax credits to finance another project that would break ground in 2021.

Peasley said there are currently no waitlists or leasing information available for any of these housing units. Those interested should watch for information about leasing Alpenglow Village in the spring by visiting yvha.org.

“There’s essentially no way to get on a waiting list for that project (Alpenglow Village), and really any of those units, even the project we just agreed to work on,” he said.

""She often didn't agree with the President's policies,"" one administration official told CNN.

Another official acknowledged to CNN Breier didn't get along with Miller but she often clashed with many White House staff members, and many White House officials are relieved to see her go.

Breier, whose office was in charge of the Trump administration's attempts to control immigration from Mexico, took issue with the power the White House exerted over immigration and trade issues, according to The Post.

EPA Won’t Approve Labels That Say Roundup Chemical Causes Cancer,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-08-08/epa-wont-approve-labels-that-say-roundup-weed-killer-chemical-glyphosate-causes-cancer,"Product labels that link glyphosate, the main active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup, to cancer will not be approved by the EPA, the agency announced Thursday. The Associated Press

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it will not approve labels on products containing glyphosate that link the chemical to cancer.

The move is directed at California. In 2017, the state declared the chemical, which is the main active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup, a carcinogen. Roundup producer Monsanto challenged the ruling in federal court, and a judge has temporarily blocked the state from requiring the labels as the lawsuit continues.

Dated Aug. 7, the new guidance from EPA to companies registered to sell the chemical says that California's labels would ""constitute a false and misleading statement"" and that the agency will no longer approve labels that contain the state's warning.

""We will not allow California's flawed program to dictate federal policy,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.

The agency said the move is based on its own findings that show that glyphosate does not pose a public risk when used as directed.

But the World Health Organization's cancer agency previously determined that glyphosate is likely to cause cancer, prompting California to list the chemical in Proposition 65 , its right-to-know law that provides residents with warnings about cancer-causing chemicals.

The EPA's announcement is a win for Monsanto and its parent company, Bayer AG, which have found a haven in the agency but not in the courts."
Verdeca Receives USDA Approval of HB4® Drought Tolerant Soybeans,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verdeca-receives-usda-approval-hb4-003000980.html,"-- Novel trait stack expected to help growers facing climate and production challenges --

DAVIS, Calif. and ROSARIO, Argentina, Aug. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Verdeca, a joint venture between Arcadia Biosciences, Inc. (RKDA) and Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NYSE American: BIOX), announced today it has successfully completed the regulatory review process and received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for its HB4® drought tolerant soybeans, which will allow for commercialization in the U.S. market. The approval comes two years after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) approval of Verdeca's HB4 trait in 2017.

The HB4 stack is Verdeca's newest product release from its pipeline of traits developed to benefit soybean producers through quality improvement, stress mitigation and management practices.

""HB4 is a novel soybean trait that enhances the traditional herbicide tolerance package to provide yield stability across diverse environments,"" said Martin Mariani Ventura, general manager of Verdeca. ""Approval of this technology in the United States is a significant step for the successful commercialization of HB4 technology in the global soybean market.""

With USDA approval, the HB4 trait now has regulatory approval in more than 80 percent of the global soybean market. The HB4 trait has already been approved in Argentina and Brazil, with regulatory submissions currently under consideration by China, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay. Import approval from China is needed for commercial launch in Argentina, and is now expected in 2020.

More than 30 million of the world's soybean hectares are grown in the United States. While the 2019 growing season has challenged many U.S. soybean growers with too much water, key soybean production areas – including some areas within the United States – just last year suffered reduced yields due to water and heat stress.

""Trials in Argentina have shown a positive impact of the HB4 trait stack on soybeans there,"" said Raj Ketkar, president and CEO of Arcadia Biosciences. ""The USDA and FDA approvals are important steps in our continued drive to commercialize this trait in key markets.""

""This approval in the U.S. is an important step for Verdeca. The HB4 trait was recently approved by Brazil as well, and we now expect approval in China in 2020 to launch our commercial efforts in Argentina,"" said Federico Trucco, CEO of Bioceres Crop Solutions.

Arcadia Biosciences and Bioceres Crop Solutions formed Verdeca in 2012 to deploy next-generation soybean traits in all key production regions, beginning in South America and North America, which together represent nearly 80 percent of the harvested soybean hectares globally.

Justice Department files amicus brief in Mazars case shielding Trump from House subpoena.,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/justice-department-mazars-subpoena-trump-barr.html,"Attorney General William Barr speaks at the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University School of Law on July 23 in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Images

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice filed a disgraceful amicus brief urging a federal appeals court to block the House of Representatives’ subpoena of the president’s financial records. There is no clear purpose for the brief other than a blatantly partisan effort to shield Trump from congressional oversight. It is a startling departure from the DOJ’s traditional independence and another sign that Attorney General William Barr views his job as running interference for the president.

Donald Trump’s lawyers—his personal attorneys, not the DOJ—have been fighting this subpoena since the House Oversight Committee issued it in April. The committee sought eight years of financial records from Mazars USA, which provided accounting services to Trump. Congress has broad constitutional authority to investigate the president, and the Supreme Court has held that the judiciary must honor any subpoena with a “legitimate legislative purpose.” Trump’s lawyers argue that the committee’s subpoena lacks such a purpose, and was merely intended to “harass” the president. In its amicus brief, the Justice Department parrots this argument, framing the House’s subpoena as an effort to torment Trump by inspecting his finances for political gain.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected that argument in May. Mehta noted that the committee chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, had provided a memorandum detailing a number of legitimate reasons for the subpoena. Cummings wrote that the committee sought to learn whether Trump “accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics” so it could determine “whether reforms are necessary to address deficiencies with current laws.” The committee also wished to discover whether Trump “has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions.”

The House has already passed an ethics bill, H.R. 1, this year with provisions aimed directly at the executive. Lawmakers plainly have a “legitimate legislative purpose,” Mehta wrote, in probing the president’s ethics to decide whether these reforms are necessary and sufficient. Moreover, the committee wished to know “whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office.” It “is simply not fathomable,” Mehta wrote, “that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct—past or present—even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.”

Finally, the committee sought to learn whether Trump had complied with the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars the president from accepting any gift from a foreign government without Congress’ consent. “Surely,” Mehta wrote, “incident to Congress’s authority to consent to the President’s receipt of Emoluments is the power to investigate the President’s compliance with the Clause.”

Trump’s lawyers promptly appealed Mehta’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of judges for the D.C. Circuit is currently mulling whether Mehta got it right.

The Justice Department had no reason to step in; Trump is amply represented by his own attorneys, and this matter does not require the defense of some federal law. To the contrary, the DOJ typically sits out such interbranch disputes, and it has no obvious interest in siding with the president against Congress here.

But the DOJ filed an amicus brief anyway—weeks after oral arguments at the D.C. Circuit—and it is flabbergasting. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that courts may not search for some covert illicit motive among committee members; if the committee states a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the judiciary must respect it. The DOJ ignores this rule. It argues that the House’s actions raise “the specter that members of the Legislative Branch are impermissibly attempting to interfere with or harass the Head of the Executive Branch.” And it calls for a “searching evaluation” of committee members’ motives.

The DOJ argues that Cummings’ memorandum justifying the subpoena is “insufficient” because it was “not ratified by the full House.” It cites no authority for this proposition because it is made-up; the Supreme Court has never held that a committee’s subpoena is invalid until ratified by the full chamber. But even if that were the law, the DOJ has a problem: The full House already ratified the Mazars subpoena. In response to this fact, the DOJ claims that the House’s vote doesn’t count because “it did so only as part of a general authorization for pending and future investigations.” There is no precedent to support the argument that the House must ratify a subpoena with some unknown level of specificity; it is a blatant exercise in moving the goalposts. The DOJ is attempting to throw new roadblocks in front of the committee on the basis of its own pseudo-constitutional beliefs.

But that’s not even the strangest part of the brief. The DOJ insists that the House cannot investigate Trump pursuant to its impeachment authority. Why? Because it hasn’t asserted “jurisdiction over” impeachment. In other words, the House’s constitutional power of impeachment lies dormant until someone declares an intent to impeach. Who, exactly, holds this mystical authority? A committee chair? The speaker? A majority of lawmakers, shouting in unison? Who knows? The DOJ does not say when the impeachment power officially kicks in, because it has concocted this rule out of thin air. Maybe Mehta was on to something when he wrote that it “is simply not fathomable” that the Constitution could (silently) limit the impeachment power so arbitrarily.

Ironically, the DOJ ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to.

The DOJ brief fares no better in its dismissal of Congress’ authority over emoluments. Again, the Constitution explicitly bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign states without Congress’ consent. But the DOJ argues that this power does not justify the subpoena because there’s no proof the House “is investigating the President with a view toward consenting to any undisclosed emoluments.”

That is a lie. Cummings’ memorandum expressly stated that the House sought “to assess whether [Trump] is complying with the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution.” If that weren’t enough—and it is—Cummings is also investigating Trump International Hotel to determine whether it grants Trump unconstitutional emoluments. Recognizing, perhaps, that the courts cannot rigorously scrutinize a committee’s stated intentions, the DOJ has chosen to pretend the committee never stated those intentions in the first place.

Most gallingly, the DOJ urges the court to reject the legitimacy of the House’s legislative purpose by preemptively declaring its legislation unconstitutional. The DOJ writes that H.R. 1 and similar proposals do not deserve any “presumption of legitimacy” because they are probably illegal. It claims that the Constitution bars Congress from forcing the president to divest from his conflicts of interest. Thus, the House cannot investigate Trump to help it craft ethics reforms, since those reforms are unconstitutional.

This argument is astonishing. Federal courts are forbidden from issuing advisory opinions on the constitutionality of pending legislation. A bill cannot be challenged in federal court if it is just a bill; this is Schoolhouse Rock stuff. Yet the DOJ is essentially asking the judiciary to declare a provision of H.R. 1 unconstitutional before it becomes law. This vast expansion of judicial power would constitute an advisory opinion on steroids. The courts would be obligated to gauge the legality of bills under consideration in Congress every time they are asked to quash a congressional subpoena. That is not and cannot be the law.

Ironically, the DOJ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to. The Supreme Court curtails the judiciary’s ability to quash congressional subpoenas for a reason. Once courts start inspecting lawmakers’ motives, they become entangled in the legislative process. It is not the job of judges to decide whether the House really needed to issue a subpoena; once a committee stated a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the courts must butt out. Otherwise, judges will wind up curbing Congress’ constitutional powers and effectively killing legislation before it passes. The judiciary is ill-equipped to determine just how much information lawmakers require to govern effectively.

Still, counterproductive as the DOJ’s brief may be, it reveals the full extent of the department’s distortion under Barr. The Justice Department represents the United States, not the president himself, and it has no business putting its thumb on the scale of Trump in his fight against Congress. Barr may see the office of the attorney general as an outpost of the White House. He may see himself as a loyal foot soldier for Trump in his squabble with Democrats. But the Justice Department was never intended to be a weapon for presidents to wield against their political opponents. Tuesday’s brief degrades the institution, eroding its legitimacy for purely partisan goals."
Senate Republican calls out Trump’s DOJ for not responding to his domestic terrorism questions,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/republican-senate-chairman-slams-trumps-doj-over-domestic-terrorism-non-response-b903f3de5f75/,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, is typically a loyal ally of President Donald Trump and his administration. But on Wednesday, he went on Fox News and scolded Trump’s Justice Department and FBI for failing to provide even basic information about a major domestic terrorism threat.

In early May, Johnson and the committee’s top Democrat — Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) — authored bipartisan letters that were sent to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney General William Barr, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. These letters asked for information about domestic terrorism and how each is addressing it. DHS responded, but four months later, the Justice Department and the FBI — which operates within the DOJ — have not.

In a new letter on Monday, Johnson and Peters noted that there have been several domestic terrorism attacks since their first letter. “Since the date of our request, there have been numerous mass attacks, including Virginia Beach, VA; Gilroy, CA; El, Paso, TX; and Dayton, OH… These continued mass attacks make it clear that the federal government has more work to do in preventing domestic terrorism.”

On Tuesday, Johnson took the issue directly to the Trump administration — by raising it on Fox News.

“On May 8th, ranking member Sen. Peters and I sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the FBI, asking them how do they keep track of these domestic terrorist attacks? What kind of resources do they have and what are they devoting to different aspects of this? We got a response from DHS. We haven’t got a response from the FBI or attorney general,” he complained.

“Monday, we asked them to respond. I’m not sure you’ll ever have enough resources in terms of what people will be requesting. This is a serious issue, though. We expect answers out of the FBI director and the attorney general.”

In 2009, the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security produced a lengthy report on the risk of right-wing domestic terrorism. Congressional Republicans accused then-Secretary Janet Napolitano of insulting “American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation” and got the report removed from the DHS website.

In May, Trump was asked whether he saw white nationalism as a rising global threat. “I don’t really, ” he replied."
Obama Still Sounds Like a President,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['David A. Graham', 'Staff Writer At']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/obama-is-still-acting-like-hes-the-president/595540/,"Read: Barack Obama breaks his silence.

Inevitably, Obama’s statement was greeted with wistfulness and relief by Democrats, and even by never-Trump conservatives like Bill Kristol, who spent eight years fighting the Obama administration tooth and nail. The common theme: This is what presidential looks like.

Indeed, Obama continues to act almost as though he is the president. This note reads like a statement released by the Obama White House. Past presidents have been known to put out statements at moments of national trauma; what’s unusual now is that, because Trump’s efforts at consoling and uniting are so intermittent and clumsy, it feels as though the role of president is vacant, and Obama is sliding right back into it by habit—his and the nation’s.

Like President Obama, former President Obama wants to remain above the political fray. It is clear to the Democrats running for the presidency (as well as to many others) that Trump has to answer for ginning up racial and ethnic hatred and violence. Obama’s statement walked up to the edge of condemning Trump, then stopped without naming him: “We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don’t look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people.” Nor does Obama make any policy suggestions.

In part, this is Obama’s attempt to maintain the old norm against former presidents criticizing the current officeholder. Obama has tiptoed up to this line before, notably a year ago in South Africa—though there, too, he avoided speaking Trump’s name.

But Obama has also never quite figured out how to respond to Trump. (He is not alone: The same can be said of the Democratic Party, the Republican old guard, the press, and perhaps much of the public.) Obama remains haunted by the specter of tribalism. He also knows that Trump’s election is, in large part, a product of the backlash to his own election as the first black president. If he attacks Trump with the intent to harm him politically, he threatens to reinforce that backlash, rather than weaken it.

He also knows that any attack would have to land squarely: While Trump has the privilege of nearly infinite mistakes, Obama does not, on this topic least of all. As Ta-Nehisi Coates argued in The Atlantic in 2012, Obama, largely because of his race, has never had much margin for error. “An equality that requires blacks to be twice as good is not equality—it’s a double standard,” Coates wrote. “That double standard haunts and constrains the Obama presidency, warning him away from candor about America’s sordid birthmark.”"
China responds to US after Treasury designates Beijing a 'currency manipulator',https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/trade-war-china-responds-to-us-after-claim-of-being-a-currency-manipulator.html,"China's central bank has firmly rejected the U.S. Treasury's designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator, saying the accusation has ""seriously"" undermined the international financial order and risked further market turmoil.

The response from the People's Bank of China comes at a time of rapidly intensifying trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

On Monday, the U.S. Treasury accused Beijing of deliberately influencing the exchange rate between the yuan and the U.S. dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade.""

The move fulfills President Donald Trump's promise to recognize China as a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.

The announcement followed a sharp drop in the yuan against the dollar, with the Chinese currency breaching the 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008. A drop in a currency's value makes that country's products cheaper on the international market.

""The United States disregards the facts and unreasonably affixes China with the label of 'currency manipulators,' which is a behavior that harms others and oneself,"" the PBOC said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Chinese side firmly opposes this.""

The PBOC said it would not only ""seriously undermine the international financial order, but also trigger financial market turmoil. It will also greatly hinder international trade and the global economic recovery, and ultimately will suffer from it.""

China's central bank set the yuan's official reference point at stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-the-dollar point on Tuesday.

The move appeared to calm financial markets, initially rocked by fears the U.S.-China trade war was devolving into a currency war.

Late last week, China promised to fight back after Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had not been hit with U.S. duties."
