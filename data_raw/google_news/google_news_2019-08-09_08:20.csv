Trump’s Opponents Want to Name His Big Donors. His Supporters Say It’s Harassment.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Katie Rogers', 'Annie Karni']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/us/politics/castro-trump-donors.html,"WASHINGTON — For many businesses, a sudden deluge of phone calls might signal an influx of new customers. But most of the 25 calls Justin Herricks received before noon on Thursday were from people who wanted to tell him he was a white supremacist for donating money to President Trump.

“I’ve had people say, ‘Hey, we were going to use you for business, but we found out you’re a racist,’” Mr. Herricks, the owner of Precision Pipe Rentals, an oil and gas services company in San Antonio, said in an interview. “‘We hope that you burn in hell and your business will go with you.’”

The reason for the calls was Mr. Herricks’s inclusion this week on a list of 44 San Antonio-area residents who have maxed out their donations to the president’s re-election campaign. That list was shared on Twitter by Representative Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat who serves as the chairman of the presidential campaign of his twin brother, Julián. Republicans have accused the congressman of “doxxing” private citizens and trying to incite harassment of the president’s supporters.

A similar uproar over Trump donors is playing out in the moneyed enclave of the Hamptons, where real estate developers are hosting two fund-raisers for Mr. Trump on Friday. Progressives looking for a way to express their anger at Mr. Trump — and the people who support him — have threatened to boycott SoulCycle, the popular spin studio chain, and Equinox, a high-end gym, both owned by the billionaire developer Stephen Ross, who is scheduled to host the president at his Southampton home."

Appearing on CNN, Nadler said people shouldn't be ""hung up on the semantics"" since his committee is ""investigating"" the facts and evidence.

He said that he ""wasn't waiting"" for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has been publicly reluctant to support impeachment, but added that she's been ""very cooperative"" with his investigation.

But after being pressed as to whether his investigation was considered ""formal impeachment proceedings,"" Nadler insisted that's what it is.

Updated at 9:48 p.m. ET

John Gore, the main Justice Department official behind the Trump administration's failed push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, is set to leave the department Friday.

A person familiar with the matter tells NPR Gore plans to spend time with his family while he is ""discerning next steps.""

Gore, who has been serving as the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, is among the administration officials currently facing allegations of providing false testimony and concealing evidence as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question. In a recent court filing, Gore denied the claims made by advocacy groups represented by the ACLU, New York Civil Liberties Union and the Arnold & Porter.

Gore did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call requesting comment.

A partner at the law firm Jones Day before he joined the administration in 2017, Gore previously led the Civil Rights Division as its acting head. He ghostwrote the Justice Department letter to the Census Bureau that formally requested a citizenship question, which three federal courts have permanently blocked from 2020 census forms.

That letter, which was sent to the bureau in December 2017, claimed the administration wanted to add the question to the census in order to better protect the voting rights of racial minorities — a justification that a majority of the Supreme Court found to appear ""contrived"" and three lower courts have dismissed as a sham.

Pressed by plaintiffs' attorney Dale Ho of the ACLU during a deposition this past October, Gore testified that including the question is ""not necessary"" for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.

Earlier last year, Gore was criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers for failing to appear at a House Oversight committee hearing after he was invited to testify about the DOJ's request for a citizenship question. When he finally showed up at a follow-up hearing, he refused to answer lawmakers' questions beyond information that was publicly available.

Gore did later provide a written response to a question from Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic committee member from California, about the confidentiality of census responses. Current federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from sharing information identifying individuals until 72 years after the information is collected, and the data cannot be used against individuals.

An internal email released as part of the citizenship question lawsuits later showed that Gore and his staff crafted an intentionally vague response after discussing that the sharing of individuals' census information with law enforcement and national security officers may ""come up later for renewed debate."""
Homeland Security power struggle: McAleenan fights for control against immigration hardliners,https://www.cnn.com,"['Geneva Sands', 'Priscilla Alvarez', 'Pamela Brown', 'Jeremy Diamond']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/mcaleenan-immigration-hardliners-white-house/index.html,"Washington (CNN) On Friday, June 21, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign.

Days earlier, President Donald Trump had issued a vague threat to deport ""millions"" of undocumented immigrants, providing few details of the effort and surprising officials within his own administration. McAleenan was concerned that the operation was half-baked and too far-reaching in scope. And he felt undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President over the issue that Trump cares most about, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Then-acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Mark Morgan had begun hyping an upcoming operation targeting undocumented migrant families for deportation and was speaking directly with the President about it, according to a source familiar with the situation.

Arriving at the White House, McAleenan met with the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and his deputy Emma Doyle, to make his case. The raids, he said, would anger Democrats and jeopardize the administration's request for emergency funding for the border; they should be conducted in phases rather than all at once; and he argued the department needed more time to build out the proper messaging, said a former senior administration official.

On June 22, Trump suspended the operation, citing objections from Democratic lawmakers. But it's not clear Democratic objections drove his decision and sources said Trump's decision to postpone the operation allayed McAleenan's concerns that his advice as the DHS chief was not being heeded. And, days later, Congress passed the $4.5 billion emergency border funding bill that McAleenan thought the ICE raids could undermine.

Immigration hardliners accused McAleenan, without direct evidence, of leaking details of the ICE operation, charges he has denied. The operation targeting 2,000 families ordered removed by an immigration judge eventually took place a month later, but fell short of its goal -- resulting in the arrest of 35 migrants

The episode put into view the tensions within the Department of Homeland Security and the rocky relationship between McAleenan and the White House. McAleenan, who has been increasingly surrounded by Trump loyalists and immigration hardliners, has at times been frustrated that some officials go around him, as he has grappled for control of the department, multiple administration officials tell CNN.

McAleenan took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was pushed out of her role at the urging of White House senior adviser and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. McAleenan, who was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, had the backing of the President's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.

But while Trump elevated McAleenan, he still sees the acting secretary -- a career official who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- as having an allegiance to the previous administration.

In a meeting with congressional Democrats about the government shutdown earlier this year, the President referred to McAleenan, then at CBP, as an ""Obama guy,"" Axios reported in April.

McAleenan served under the former president, eventually rising through the ranks to the highest-ranking career position at Customs and Border Protection.

The President often still makes comments that McAleenan should go talk to Democrats since he knows how to deal with them, according to a source.

The relationship, however, runs hot and cold based on the numbers of migrants crossing the border and headlines the President doesn't like, sources tell CNN.

Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley praised McAleenan in a statement after this story published.

""In just a short time at the helm of DHS, Acting Secretary McAleenan has already substantially reduced illegal border-crossings, greatly expanded regional burden sharing, advanced vitally-important regulations, and significantly boosted the rapid removal and return of illegal aliens -- despite relentless obstruction from activist far-left judges and belligerently open-borders Democrat Lawmakers,"" Gidley said in a statement.

Four months into the role, McAleenan has had to navigate a migration crisis at the southern border and a White House that has shunned the traditional policy processes, all while leading the third largest federal department in the wake of a purge that left DHS and many of its component agencies without permanent leadership.

""It's arguably the most politically-charged job in government right now,"" said a senior DHS official about the acting secretary role.

In recent months, the three main immigration components in DHS have had a change in leadership -- Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The President's decision to swap out leadership appeared to be motivated by his desire to go in a ""tougher direction,"" as he once said, amid a swell of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border.

Trump's personnel choices have, on occasion, have had ideological conflicts with McAleenan. In addition to Morgan, Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia state attorney general, took over as acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services in June.

The White House, led by Mulvaney, previously looked into replacing McAleenan with Cuccinelli, who's been a public face on television on the President's policies, as acting secretary. A senior administration official said that option is no longer being considered.

McAleenan isn't expected to be offered the permanent secretary position, according to sources.

""There's still some apprehension. Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" said a DHS official about concerns over more leadership changes to come.

Trump told Fox News in June that McAleenan was ""doing a nice job,"" when asked about whether he will nominate him for the permanent secretary role.

""McAleenan, he is doing a very nice job. We're going to see. I've got to get used to him because it's a very important thing to me, the border. We need strong people at the border. And if people aren't strong, they're not going to do a good job.""

Despite the uncertainty that an acting role brings, multiple current and former DHS officials have praised McAleenan's depth of knowledge, operational experience and leadership.

""I think it's really hard being acting,"" said a former official. ""He is taking, if you will, taking the bull by the horns and spent his time doing the job.""

Trump focuses on numbers

US-Mexico border apprehension numbers are particularly important to Trump, who reviews the numbers at the beginning of each month and views them as a barometer of the situation along the southern border, according to administration officials.

Under his tenure as acting secretary, border apprehensions continued to soar to their highest level in a decade -- more than 130,000 -- before falling 20% in June and 24% in July , a drop that McAleenan attributes in part to a recent agreement with Mexico on immigration enforcement.

The numbers continue to go down for now, according to a source familiar with the trajectory, though they still exceed levels a year ago.

The White House has taken a retaliatory approach to immigration, rolling out policies that seek to discourage those who journey to the US-Mexico border. In March, the US announced it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, which the President accused of having ""set up"" migrant caravans for entry into the US.

McAleenan, who has been a proponent of regional investment in Central America, was not supportive of the move to freeze aid to the Northern Triangle, according to a former administration official.

During a visit to Guatemala at the end of May, McAleenan told CNN Trump was looking for investments that have a return on US interests, including the ability to address the causes of migration. The ""key measure"" of success is whether aid leads to a halt of migration to the US, he said.

""I think there's some very valid aid efforts that are ongoing but we got to assess them all carefully and make sure we're making the right investments,"" he said.

The architect at the core of the administration's immigration policies is White House senior adviser Miller, who had a hand in the purge within DHS earlier this year.

""I don't think anybody that works in the [immigration enforcement] space is eager to participate with him,"" said a former administration official, referring to Miller.

But McAleenan ""understands what Stephen's role is,"" the official added. Still, the two have clashed over Miller's attempts to make personnel changes within DHS, like placing Morgan into the role of acting CBP chief, according to a source familiar with the disagreement.

But McAleenan has forged a relationship with Kushner, the President's son-in-law, according to current and former administration officials, who released a proposal to reform the country's immigration system earlier this year.

During White House meetings, ""you could tell"" they had a ""close working relationship,"" said a former official.

A department roiled by turnover

Since assuming the acting secretary role, McAleenan has focused almost all of his public attention on immigration issues, while running a department that is also responsible for terrorism prevention, election security and natural disaster response. The acting secretary recently canceled a trip to London to travel to Guatemala to work on a new asylum deal that would return most migrants to Guatemala if they did not try to seek asylum there before journeying to the US.

At the end of July, Trump, standing behind McAleenan announced the asylum deal in the Oval Office.

The tension within the department's leadership ranks has become evident over time amid conflicting immigration views.

""The clash of those two views has caused a dysfunctional relationship within the leadership"" at the department, said the source, referring to diverging views on immigration enforcement. ""How do you repair the working relationships between the White House, and the [DHS] components? That seems ambitious, 'they are pretty frayed.'""

Morgan, who clashed with McAleenan over the raids, has since moved to Customs and Border Protection as acting commissioner, replacing John Sanders.

Sanders left the administration in part over concerns about the administration's rhetoric on ICE deportations, after the White House chose Morgan to serve at the acting commissioner, according to a source familiar with the personnel change.

McAleenan fought to keep Sanders at CBP, according to the source. With his departure McAleenan lost an ally at DHS.

""We've been surprised by the twists and turns in personnel,"" said a senior DHS official, who added that leadership appears to be in a ""decent place now."""

Ex-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe Sues Over What He Calls Wrongful Firing,https://www.npr.org,['Carrie Johnson'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/693598382/ex-deputy-fbi-director-andrew-mccabe-sues-over-what-he-calls-wrongful-firing,"Ex-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe Sues Over What He Calls Wrongful Firing

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP

Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has sued the Trump administration for what he calls his ""unlawful"" termination, arguing that his firing last year was the result of improper political interference by the president.

""It was Trump's unconstitutional plan and scheme to discredit and remove DOJ and FBI employees who were deemed to be his partisan opponents because they were not politically loyal to him,"" the complaint alleges.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed McCabe in March 2018, only hours before his 50th birthday, when his full law enforcement pension would have vested. McCabe's filing argues that he is ""entitled to his full law enforcement pension and all other benefits, privileges, and rights currently being withheld.""

In explaining the firing in April 2018, the Justice Department cited a ""lack of candor"" in McCabe's interviews with investigators looking into a 2016 media leak in the waning weeks of the presidential campaign.

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said the leak about investigations into Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation advanced McCabe's ""personal interests"" at the expense of the department's leadership.

McCabe has said those allegations were a pretext to get rid of him after months of abuse from President Trump, who had singled him out as a political scapegoat in the 2016 campaign. After McCabe's dismissal, Trump wrote on Twitter that it was a ""great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.""

To McCabe, the termination 26 hours before his scheduled retirement had everything to do with his role in protecting the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016.

McCabe said he was ""singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,"" he said in a statement last year.

Comey said he supported McCabe after his firing. But in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, Comey also said his ouster seemed appropriate, given the circumstances.

""This is what accountability looks like,"" Comey said.

Comey also said that the process had been infected with ""corrosive doubt"" because of Trump's attacks on McCabe in the past. Trump targeted McCabe in part because his wife had unsuccessfully run for state office in Virginia with support from Democrats.

Trump and Republicans said that meant McCabe was a Democrat and accordingly biased against the president, which McCabe has all along denied.

The U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., and a grand jury there have been considering whether McCabe may have broken any laws. So far no charges have been filed."
Donald Trump says he's done more than other presidents to solve the gun problem. Has he?,https://www.politifact.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/aug/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hes-done-more-other-presidents-s/,"Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot.""

As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump accepted the endorsement of the National Rifle Association and released a Facebook video headlined by the remark, ""I won’t let them take away our guns!!""

Now, as president, he wants to be seen as a problem-solver on gun policy.

At a media availability on Aug. 4 following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, a reporter asked President Donald Trump, ""The gun problem – what are you going to do about it? How are you going to address it?""

Trump responded, ""We’re talking to a lot of people, and a lot of things are in the works, and a lot of good things. And we have done much more than most administrations. And it’s ... really not talked about very much, but we’ve done, actually, a lot. But perhaps more has to be done.""

We wondered whether it’s accurate that Trump and his administration have ""done much more than most administrations"" to curb gun violence.

We found that Trump has made two concrete moves that tightened gun policy and has taken additional actions on other aspects of curbing mass shootings. This is more than some of his predecessors have done. However, this tells only part of the story, because Trump and his administration have simultaneously advanced more policies that would expand gun rights or prevent efforts to limit gun rights.

Limits on gun rights

Trump has clearly acted to limit gun rights in two cases.

• Using regulatory powers to bypass Congress, Trump in 2018 acted to ban bump stocks, an accessory that uses recoil to effectively turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic one. This technique was used by the shooter who killed 58 people and injured almost 900 attending a music festival in Las Vegas in 2017.

• Trump signed a large federal spending bill that included language to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. The legislation had received bipartisan support in Congress.

In addition, under Trump, the federal government has increased prosecutions of firearms offenses. (See our fact-check.)

The Trump campaign said he deserves credit for actions beyond the scope of guns specifically. They cited his signing of the STOP School Violence Act, which authorizes more than $1 billion in grant funding through 2028 to support violence-prevention programs in schools. The campaign also pointed to Trump’s establishment of the Federal Commission on School Safety. (The commission released a final report in December 2018.)

Expansions of gun rights and opposition to tightening gun rules

Still, the Trump administration’s gun-specific efforts have tended to focus on expanding gun rights or opposing tighter limits on them. Some examples:

• He signed legislation to overturn a rule enacted under President Barack Obama that made it harder for some mentally ill people to obtain guns. (Advocates for disabled Americans and civil-liberties groups joined with gun advocates in supporting Trump’s action.)

• Trump in 2019 threatened to veto bills passed by the House to require federal background checks for all gun sales. (A veto has not been necessary since the measures remain stalled in the Senate.)

• Trump’s Interior Department reversed a ban on hunting with lead ammunition in national parks and other federal lands.

• Trump’s Interior Department formally proposed a rule to expand hunting on federal lands.

• Trump’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives delayed an Obama-era rule to make gun-safety devices more readily available where firearms are sold.

• Trump’s Justice Department formally sided with plaintiffs seeking to overturn New York City restrictions on transporting handguns at the Supreme Court.

So, for Trump to focus solely on his efforts to limit gun rights ignores the more numerous examples in which he has sought to expand gun rights or prevent restrictions of gun rights.

""The Trump administration has been mostly missing in action on enhanced gun control,"" said Harold (Jay) Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida.

How Trump’s efforts to restrict gun rights compare to previous presidents

The universe of comparable presidents is actually pretty small. In the past 50 years, only two presidents — Bill Clinton and Obama, both Democrats — made tightening gun policies a significant item on their policy agendas.

In 1993, Clinton signed the Brady Bill, which heightened requirements for background checks, and the following year, he signed the assault weapons ban, which sunsetted after 10 years in 2004.

Obama, for his part, pursued gun control policies, especially after the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. But facing a Republican-controlled Congress opposed to gun control, such efforts went nowhere.

Instead, between 2013 and 2016, Obama undertook executive actions on mental health treatment, strengthened background checks, restarting federal gun research that had been frozen for years, funding additional federal agents, tracing guns found during investigations to determine trafficking patterns, and guiding U.S. attorneys to go after felons looking to buy guns or people lying in order to pass background checks.

""Trump has not had a pro-control record, although most previous presidents have not done much more"" than he has, said Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck.

However, experts caution against a direct comparison between Obama’s record and Trump’s.

""During Obama's administration, there were at least four bills to close the ‘gun show loophole,’ two attempts to renew the assault weapons ban, two attempts to ban high-capacity magazines, two to ban ‘build them yourself’ assault rifle kits, and one to ban imported assault weapons,"" said Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. ""Every single one of these 11 bills died on the floor of either the House or Senate, so it was never an option for Obama to sign them into law.""

Given that Republicans — the more consistently pro-gun party — have controlled either the presidency or at least one chamber of Congress for most of the past quarter-century, ""it’s not really surprising that more restrictions have not been passed at the federal level,"" Schildkraut said.

Our ruling

Asked what his administration would be doing about ""the gun problem,"" Trump said, ""We have done much more than most administrations. … We’ve done, actually, a lot.""

Trump has banned bump stocks, supported a bipartisan effort to improve the background-check database, and prioritized gun-related prosecutions. This number does compare favorably to what some other recent presidents have accomplished.

At the same time, Trump’s comment ignores that his administration has pursued multiple efforts to expand gun laws and regulations or to block efforts to tighten them.

White House rebuffed attempts by DHS to make combating domestic terrorism a higher priority,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jake Tapper', 'Anchor', 'Chief Washington Correspondent']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/white-house-domestic-terrorism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House officials rebuffed efforts by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, current and former senior administration officials as well as other sources close to the Trump administration tell CNN.

""Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism,"" one senior source close to the Trump administration tells CNN. ""The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home. They had major ideological blinders on.""

The National Counterterrorism Strategy , issued last fall, states that ""Radical Islamist terrorists remain the primary transnational terrorist threat to the United States and its vital national interests,"" which few experts dispute. What seems glaring to these officials is the minimizing of the threat of domestic terrorism, which they say was on their radar as a growing problem.

""Ultimately the White House just added one paragraph about domestic terrorism as a throw-away line,"" a senior source involved in the discussion told CNN. That paragraph mentions ""other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism."" It made no mention of white supremacists. (A separate paragraph in the report mentions investigating domestic terrorists with connections to overseas terrorists, but that does not seem to be a reference to white supremacists.)

The document mentions that domestic terrorism is on the rise, but the subject is only briefly addressed, all the more stark given that FBI Director Christopher Wray's July testimony that there have been almost as many domestic terror arrests in the first three quarters of the fiscal year -- about 100 -- as there have been arrests connected to international terror. Wray noted that the majority of the domestic terrorism cases were motivated by some version of white supremacist violence, adding that the FBI takes the threat ""extremely seriously.""

The State Department has put on leave an employee of its energy bureau after reports that he has been an active member of a white supremacist group for more than five years, two sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.

Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer for the department’s Bureau of Energy Resources, was linked to the Washington D.C.-area chapter of a white supremacist organization and published racist propaganda online, according to a report published Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate speech.

Story Continued Below

In a May 2018 episode of a white nationalist podcast, Gebert, speaking under a pseudonym, called for white people to establish “a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,” according to the SPLC report.

“We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,” the report quoted him saying.

Attempts to contact Gebert were unsuccessful. Twitter accounts that SPLC described in its report as belonging to Gebert and that have posted anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi messages were deleted as of Wednesday afternoon.

A State Department spokesperson did not reply to questions about Gebert‘s employment status.

“The Department of State cannot comment on personnel issues but is committed to providing an inclusive workplace,” a department spokesperson said.

Gebert started working at the bureau as a career employee in 2013, according to a posting in the George Washington alumni magazine the SPLC cited. He worked on energy issues involving Pakistan and India during his time there, former co-workers told POLITICO.

Former State Department officials expressed surprise that security screenings had not flagged Gebert’s involvement with the hate groups. Gebert would have undergone a routine screening before starting his position and another at his five-year work anniversary, said Amos Hochstein, who served as special envoy and coordinator for the State Department’s international energy affairs from 2014 to 2017 and was Gebert’s boss.

“It is inconceivable he got security clearance twice,” Hochstein told POLITICO. “If Gebert was Muslim or a person of color, it would have been caught. Neo-Nazis are not all shaved heads and tattoos, they are hiding in plain sight. I'm horrified Gebert worked for me at the State Department.“

A State Department spokesman did not respond to questions about the department’s security clearance practices.

There are times when retired Staff Sgt. Matt Lammers doesn't look like he needs anyone's help — like when he was competing, and winning, races at the Department of Defense Warrior Games in Tampa, Fla., this summer.

""We don't like to say the word 'can't' in our family,"" says Matt, who lost both his legs above the knee and his left arm to an explosion during his second deployment to Iraq in 2007.

Then he goes on to list all the things he just can't do without help from his wife, Alicia.

""She helps me shower. ... She helps me transfer in my wheelchair, drives me to my appointments,"" says Matt, while on a break between events at the games. ""I'd honestly say, not to be smart, but the question is, What she doesn't do?""

Matt won medals at the games in Tampa for sitting volleyball, swimming and indoor rowing. At the end of the games, the U.S. Army gave him the ""heart of the team"" award. But he and his wife almost didn't attend, because they were short on cash to make the trip after Alicia was cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs' caregiver program last December because Matt had not ""consistently engaged in treatment,"" according to a letter from the VA. Alicia had been Matt's official caregiver for most of eight years.

""It felt like a stab in the back, like what I do is not worth it in their opinion, like I'm not part of their team like I thought I was,"" she says.

Uneven standards and implementation

The VA program provides support and a stipend to caregivers for post-Sept. 11 veterans, usually a wife or parent. It got going in 2011 and was instantly popular among vets as recognition of the billions of dollars worth of labor performed by family members for disabled veterans through the decades. The program was prepared for only a small number of applications and was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of veterans who applied.

Almost from the start, that meant problems with uneven standards and implementation around the United States. NPR has reported on hundreds of caregivers being arbitrarily cut from the program; so has the Government Accountability Office and the VA's inspector general. Twice in two years, the VA has frozen the process of discharging people from the caregiver program, most recently last Dec. 20.

""It is essential that we get this right,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said at the time. ""This affects one of our most vulnerable veteran populations, and we need to make sure we have consistency on how we process and evaluate benefit applications across VA.""

Unfortunately for Matt and Alicia, that freeze came six days after a letter from the VA in Fayetteville, N.C., on Dec. 14.

""I got a letter saying that I was out of the program because the veteran hasn't shown any progress since 2011,"" said Alicia. ""I asked them, 'What do you mean by progress?' ""

That question is at the heart of a fundamental problem with the way the VA caregiver program was created. Originally it was intended as a temporary intervention.

""Well, amputations and paralysis are permanent conditions,"" says Sherman Gillums, a former Marine who is paraplegic. ""It's not about recovery. It's about sustaining your life. Even if they're cut off from the program, they're still needing that care.""

Gillums is with the group AMVETS, but he's also on the VA's caregiver advisory committee. He's concerned that the VA needs to change the ""recovery based"" model now, before a planned expansion to older vets that could double or even triple the number of caregivers enrolled. And he says the program should be permanent for catastrophically injured vets such as Matt.

""No significant improvement""

Not that Matt's case is without its complications. Besides his missing limbs, Matt has PTSD and brain injuries.

""Not just the physical but the mental disabilities too — that is very challenging. It's every day. It's a constant change,"" says Alicia.

She says that's why the VA's assessment that Matt hasn't improved hurt. He's doing better now than he has in years. He has struggled in the past with drug abuse and even ended up homeless. He has been abusive to his wife and others, sometimes physically.

""He has progress daily,"" says Alicia. ""But sometimes he has bad days or weeks. ... Life is like that.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

The Fayetteville VA told the couple in the Dec. 14 letter that ""there has been no significant improvement"" since Matt entered the program in 2011 and that he ""has not consistently engaged in treatment.""

In response to a query from NPR, the Fayetteville VA said that for Matt, the program ""was no longer in his best interest. He refused to follow his care plan, seriously endangering his health and that of those around him.""

The VA was alluding to his abusive behavior in the past. But Alicia says she has stuck with him through that.

""I'm not leaving. I'm still with him, and I'm still gonna do what I do,"" she says. ""I still have to help him. I still have to drive him. I still have to take him to appointments. I'm still gonna do this if you pay me or not.""

The VA also reached out to the couple and encouraged them to follow the VA's care plan and then reapply for the caregiver program in six months. They say they will, but Matt says he's still stung by the assessment that he hasn't made progress since 2011.

""All three of my limbs are still amputated, as they were June, 10 June 2007. Those have not grown back,"" says Matt. ""I wouldn't change anything for the world. I'm not complaining. I don't get hung up on injuries, but what they exactly expect from us triple amputees, single amputees, paras ... I don't, I can't really comprehend that."""
Prosecutor who helped craft Jeffrey Epstein plea deal resigns from DOJ,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/08/prosecutor-who-helped-craft-jeffrey-epstein-plea-deal-resigns-from-doj/,"A prosecutor who is being probed for helping negotiate the secret plea deal that allowed pedophile Jeffrey Epstein to avoid federal charges in 2008 has resigned from the Justice Department, her lawyer said Thursday.

A. Marie Villafaña will leave her post to join the federal Department of Health and Human Services — a move she had long planned, her attorney, Jonathan Biran, said.

“She is grateful for her career in the Justice Department and excited for a new opportunity at Health and Human Services,” Biran said.

Villafaña worked with several other federal prosecutors and her former boss, Alexander Acosta, to ditch a federal indictment of Epstein in 2008 and to charge him at the state level with minor prostitution charges, the Miami Herald reported.

Epstein was arrested in New Jersey in July and hit with federal sex-trafficking charges.

The Justice Department is now probing whether Acosta — President Trump’s former labor secretary — and other federal prosecutors including Villafaña illegally negotiated the plea deal that allowed Epstein to escape federal prosecution in 2008."
Trump Criticized DOD’s Potential Cloud Deal With Amazon. Now The Program Is On Hold,https://dailycaller.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://dailycaller.com/2019/08/07/trump-amazon-dod/,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is under fire as lawmakers are questioning why Amazon’s cloud technology was unable to detect the Capital One hack.

The company is being scrutinized after President Donald Trump’s criticisms prompted the DOD to put a hold on a program giving Amazon the ability to build out the agency’s cloud technology.

DOD’s decision to place a hold on the $10 billion program also comes as critics of Amazon’s role in the project manage to impress upon Trump how deeply Bezos was involved.

President Donald Trump’s growing skepticism of a potential Department of Defense cloud computing program with Amazon comes as CEO Jeff Bezos fields questions about why his company’s technology was unable to prevent the Capital One hack.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper is now reviewing accusations of unfairness in the contract process for the program, known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), the Pentagon announced on Aug. 1. His decision came after Trump ratcheted up criticism of the project. Amazon and Microsoft are the only two finalists.

Amazon, which is expected to land the program, is now wrestling with questions from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, who wants to know why the company’s cloud computing technology was unable to prevent Capital One hack. The company stored the 106 million Capital One credit-card records an accused hacker allegedly stole.

Capital One blamed the incident on “a specific configuration vulnerability” in the way it uses Amazon’s cloud. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday how the accused hacker was allegedly able to exploit a weakness in some misconfigured networks that cloud security experts frequently warn about. Amazon has not replied to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Conservatives and other experts warn that relying on one cloud system creates severe security risks.

“The use of multiple cloud solutions follows industry-wide best practices utilized by most Fortune 500 companies. Mr. [Trey] Hodgkins [of IT Alliance for Public Sector] noted that by using multiple providers, the cybersecurity and functionality of the JEDI system would be improved, costs would decrease through increased competition,” conservative groups wrote in a May 16 letter to Russell Vought, the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget.

Esper’s review is expected to delay awarding the JEDI contract, which would give the Pentagon a single cloud computing system for data ranging from personnel statistics to intelligence information rather than the hundreds the military currently uses. (RELATED: Trump Says He’s Getting A Lot Of Complaints About DOD’s $10 Billion Cloud Project)

Controversy has plagued the cloud computing program. Computing giant Oracle, for instance, alleged in a May 31 complaint that former DOD official Deap Ubhi was offered shares in Amazon and a salary with the big tech giant while he was finding a company to help build out JEDI. Ubhi never recused himself, according to the document.

Instead, “he spent weeks as a DoD official, downloading the JEDI Google drive to his laptop, meeting with AWS competitors as a DoD official, requesting and participating cloud meetings … and obtaining submissions from JEDI competitors,” Oracle noted in its document, referring to Amazon Web Services, the arm responsible for implementing the system.

Other reports revealed similar problems. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis attended a 2017 event with Teresa Carlson, vice president of Amazon’s worldwide public sector services. The dinner ultimately helped forge another meeting in August 2017 between Mattis and Bezos, The Wall Street Journal reported in July, citing emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

White House officials recently showed Trump a document that connects Ubhi and others to a ploy awarding Amazon the 10-year contract, CNN reported in July, citing documents. The document is identical to one from Oracle lobbyist Kenneth Glueck, an executive vice president with the company. The DCNF has independently confirmed the existence of the flow charts.

Trump has gotten more public in his criticisms. “So I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid,” the president said during a July interview. He was referring to complaints conservative have made recently about a $10 billion winner-take-all cloud computing contract. The president also retweeted a Fox News segment on July 22 criticizing the JEDI contract as “The Bezos Bailout.”

Hundreds of USDA employees to be removed from their jobs in September,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/08/07/hundreds-usda-employees-be-removed-their-jobs-september/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue speaks during a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing in 2018. (Andrew Harnik/AP)

The Agriculture Department is preparing to issue hundreds of termination letters to employees who have not agreed to move from the District of Columbia to Kansas City. The notices, arriving sooner than some workers and their supporters expected, will accelerate a controversial relocation process that has already stripped two USDA agencies of key research staff.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced he would relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio of scientific grants, and the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency. The agencies rent office space in Southwest Washington near the waterfront.

In June 2019, Perdue declared the Kansas City region as the site of the new offices. USDA’s cost-benefit analysis suggests the move will save taxpayers $300 million over 15 years. The department has not said whether the employees will work in Kansas or Missouri; instead, it has set aside temporary office space for staff in its Beacon Complex in Missouri.

On June 13, USDA sent reassignment letters giving workers until 11:59 p.m. on July 15 to respond. Those who declined or who did not respond would lose their jobs, the letter warned.

The American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403, the union that represents the agencies, requested an extension for the deadline. Given the 900-mile distance from Washington to Kansas City and the uncertainty around which state to move to, the union considered 30 days insufficient time for employees to make a commitment.

In a phone call with Sen. Christopher Van Hollen (D-Md.) on July 14, Perdue told the senator the deadline would be extended until Sept. 30, according to the senator’s description of the call.

Two days later, Van Hollen and 18 other Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to Perdue to confirm the Sept. 30 deadline. Also that day, USDA announced that 250 USDA employees, two-thirds of those reassigned, declined to relocate and would lose their jobs.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney recently praised the USDA attrition as a way to “drain the swamp.”

On July 17, Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) wrote a letter to Perdue asking why he had not yet responded to the extension request. “We have heard from numerous federal workers who have requested personal extensions to this July 15 deadline, yet none has been approved,” Wexton wrote. “One such extension request would allow a current employee undergoing chemotherapy to continue their treatment with their trusted team of physicians.”

In a letter to Van Hollen in late July, the secretary said the July 15 deadline was final but that the department would evaluate employee extensions on a case-by-case basis.

Perdue never replied to Wexton’s letter, the congresswoman said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday. The department also “failed to respond to the employees who made requests for extension — yet they are able to issue termination letters to hundreds of dedicated public servants,” she added. On Tuesday, USDA notified the union that employees would soon begin receiving the termination letters.

A draft termination letter obtained by The Washington Post, whose authenticity was confirmed by two USDA employees and Wexton’s office, states that employees will be fired Sept. 27.

USDA did not respond to questions from The Post. The department provided a statement: “While USDA did not extend the notification deadline of July 15, we have continuously maintained that employees have until the report date to amend their decision which may include changing from a no to a yes. We are actively working with employees so they can make the decision in a timely manner to ensure they are able to take advantage of all available resources. The mandatory report date for relocating employees in Kansas City is Sept. 30, 2019.”

An investigation by the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, published Monday, determined that money already spent on the relocation violated the 2018 spending bill, because USDA did not acquire congressional approval.

USDA’s general counsel argued that the requirement for congressional approval was unconstitutional. In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Scott Hutchins, the USDA deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, said the department attorney’s opinion is binding.

“No one should be concerned about being accused of, or punished, for violating the Antideficiency Act when they incur and submit requests for reimbursement for relocation costs,” Hutchins wrote. Some USDA employees, he said, have already arrived in Kansas City.

Wexton called for the relocation to be halted immediately. “Secretary Perdue is ignoring his own inspector general, he is ignoring Congress,” she said, “and he is ignoring many of the farmers he supposedly serves.”

"EPA fines Kensington gold mine operator $535,000 for a string of violations",https://www.adn.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2019/08/09/epa-fines-kensington-gold-mine-operator-535000-for-a-string-of-violations/,"The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday it fined the operator of a Southeast Alaska gold mine $534,500 in a settlement agreement stemming from scores of wastewater discharge violations, the unauthorized release of acid-rock-drainage into a lake, and other missteps.

Ed Kowalski, director of EPA’s Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division in Seattle, said a 2015 inspection and a review of records helped provide a clear picture of daily operations at the mine 45 miles northwest of Juneau.

“Coeur Alaska can and must do better in order to comply with our fundamental laws that protect people and the environment,” Kowalski said in a statement.

Kensington generates and manages large volumes of wastewater and stormwater containing pollutants that can damage water quality and wildlife, he said. Kensington and other hard-rock mining operations can “dramatically” reduce their impact on waters if they follow permit requirements, the statement said.

Many alleged violations were documented in the inspection, which involved the EPA and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. They include:

• 200 wastewater discharge violations.

• Unauthorized discharge of acid rock drainage into Lower Slate Lake.

• Improper operation and maintenance of sampling equipment.

• Multiple effluent-sampling violations.

• Failure to develop a complete Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan.

• Failure to repair a secondary containment structure for over a year that holds a majority of the facility’s fuel.

• Failure to conduct required monitoring, assessments, inspections and trainings.

• Failure to use proper sample handling and analysis procedures.

• Failure to report releases of nitrate compounds annually from 2013 to 2017.

As part of the settlement, Coeur Alaska also signed an agreement to ensure that acid rock drainage would be collected and treated before it’s discharged into Lower Slate Lake. Starting Aug. 1, the state modified Kensington’s individual permit to allow the release of residual acid rock drainage into the lake.

The drainage must now be treated to meet discharge limits based on water-quality standards, said an email from Mark MacIntyre, an EPA spokesman."
Nikola receives $1.7M grant from US Department of Energy for fuel cell research,https://www.teslarati.com,['Simon Alvarez'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-rival-nikola-get-1-million-us-department-of-energy-fuel-cell-research/,"Nikola Motors was recently awarded by the US Department of Energy with a $1.7 million grant to help the startup advance its research into fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) technology. The grant comes amidst the potential Tesla Semi rival’s continued efforts to develop durable hydrogen technology for commercial trucking.

In a press release, Jesse Schneider, Nikola’s executive vice president of Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Technologies, stated that the Department of Energy’s grant would allow the aspiring truck accelerate the development of hydrogen technology for its vehicles, which the company believes could potentially disrupt the lucrative trucking market.

“This award provides an opportunity for the highly talented Nikola team to leverage expertise in academia and exceptional resources within the DOE Fuel Cell Consortium for Performance and Durability to accelerate a breakthrough that will benefit the entire hydrogen and fuel cell industry and community,” Schneider said.

Nikola’s grant was given by the US Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Transportation Office, as part of the recently announced FY19 Commercial Trucks and Off-Road Applications FOA. NEL Hydrogen of Oslo, Nikola’s hydrogen partner, was also awarded a $2 million grant by the DoE.

The trucking startup’s fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) research is aimed at developing an architecture that could satisfy the power output needs and durability requirements of heavy-duty applications, such as the operations of the company’s long-haul vehicles like the Nikola One. The truckmaker noted in its press release that its research is being conducted alongside academics from Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, and Georgia Institute of Technology.

Nikola claims that it currently has 14,000 orders for its Class 8 trucks. The vehicles are expected to be manufactured in a factory in Coolidge, AZ. Testing is expected to begin on Arizona roads this year, with full production to commence in late 2022. Nikola is yet to reveal if its initial production runs will involve the original Nikola One sleeper truck, or the smaller, newer Nikola Two daycab, which was formally unveiled last April.

This timeframe would likely result in Nikola’s electric trucks entering the market later than the Tesla Semi, which is already undergoing extensive testing on multiple states across the US. Production of the Tesla Semi is expected to begin sometime next year, as noted by the electric car maker’s executives in the company’s first-quarter earnings call."
Senate Republican calls out Trump’s DOJ for not responding to his domestic terrorism questions,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/republican-senate-chairman-slams-trumps-doj-over-domestic-terrorism-non-response-b903f3de5f75/,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, is typically a loyal ally of President Donald Trump and his administration. But on Wednesday, he went on Fox News and scolded Trump’s Justice Department and FBI for failing to provide even basic information about a major domestic terrorism threat.

In early May, Johnson and the committee’s top Democrat — Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) — authored bipartisan letters that were sent to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney General William Barr, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. These letters asked for information about domestic terrorism and how each is addressing it. DHS responded, but four months later, the Justice Department and the FBI — which operates within the DOJ — have not.

In a new letter on Monday, Johnson and Peters noted that there have been several domestic terrorism attacks since their first letter. “Since the date of our request, there have been numerous mass attacks, including Virginia Beach, VA; Gilroy, CA; El, Paso, TX; and Dayton, OH… These continued mass attacks make it clear that the federal government has more work to do in preventing domestic terrorism.”

On Tuesday, Johnson took the issue directly to the Trump administration — by raising it on Fox News.

“On May 8th, ranking member Sen. Peters and I sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the FBI, asking them how do they keep track of these domestic terrorist attacks? What kind of resources do they have and what are they devoting to different aspects of this? We got a response from DHS. We haven’t got a response from the FBI or attorney general,” he complained.

“Monday, we asked them to respond. I’m not sure you’ll ever have enough resources in terms of what people will be requesting. This is a serious issue, though. We expect answers out of the FBI director and the attorney general.”

In 2009, the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security produced a lengthy report on the risk of right-wing domestic terrorism. Congressional Republicans accused then-Secretary Janet Napolitano of insulting “American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation” and got the report removed from the DHS website.

In May, Trump was asked whether he saw white nationalism as a rising global threat. “I don’t really, ” he replied."
EPA proposes downgrading Denver and northern Front Range to “serious” violator of air quality standards,https://www.denverpost.com,"['Jessica Seaman', 'Jessica Seaman Covers Health For The Denver Post. A Native Of North Carolina', 'Jessica Joined The Post After Stints As A Reporter In Greensboro', 'North Carolina', 'Little Rock', 'Arkansas. She Is A Graduate Of Unc-Chapel Hill.']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/08/colorado-air-quality-violations-epa/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it wants to reclassify the region encompassing Denver and the northern Front Range as a “serious” violator of federal health standards after ozone levels failed to meet air quality standards.

The move, which will require public comment, was expected as Gov. Jared Polis earlier this year directed state air officials to not pursue an exemption that would have reduced Colorado’s responsibility under the federal Clean Air Act.

The Denver region has been classified as a “moderate” violator of ozone standards since 2016. That region, as classified by the EPA, includes Denver, Greeley, Fort Collins and Loveland.

“We recognize how vital it is for the department to act and assertively reduce ozone pollution in the Denver Metro/North Front Range area — as well as throughout Colorado,” said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of the state health department, in a statement.

“With the backing of the state legislature and governor, we are moving forward on developing strategies to reduce emissions from oil and gas facilities, electrify the vehicle fleet and look for other ways to reduce pollutants that cause ozone.”

The EPA is making its decision to reclassify the Denver area based on air quality data collected between 2015 and 2017. The new designation will require new measures to be implemented to reduce emissions, according to a news release.

When Polis opted to forgo an exemption, he ordered work to reduce pollution in the state through measures that include using electric vehicles, adopting renewable energy and reducing oil and gas emissions.

The move comes as air quality in the Front Range has worsened in recent years, including as oil and gas companies have expanded in Colorado, causing ozone readings to exceed the 2008 health standards.

Other sources of ozone air pollution include cars and pollution from other states and countries. In Colorado, some air pollution has come from China, possibly from coal-burning power plants.

Ozone affects lung tissue and can aggravate diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, and it can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the EPA.

“EPA is proposing this action as required by the Clean Air Act,” said Gregory Sopkin, EPA Regional Administrator, in a statement. “We will continue to support the state as they revise plans and implement new measures that will reduce ozone-forming emissions across the many sources contributing to air quality impairment along Colorado’s Front Range.”

The agency will be accepting public comments on the proposal for 30 days starting Aug. 15. It will also hold a public hearing at its office in Denver on Sept. 6, the news release said."

"Withdrawal of US troops in Syria strengthened ISIS resurgence, DOD watchdog says",https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/08/withdrawal-of-us-troops-in-syria-strengthened-isis-dod-watchdog-says.html,"A convoy of US forces armoured vehicles drives near the village of Yalanli, on the western outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Manbij, on March 5, 2017.

Syrian forces backed by the United States are struggling to contain ISIS following President Donald Trump's partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country, a Defense Department watchdog warned in a report released this week.

The report, produced by the department's office of inspector general, found that between April and June the so-called Islamic State consolidated its power in Iraq and mounted a resurgence in Syria.

Trump announced in December that the U.S. would soon reduce its fighting force in Syria, surprising allies and prompting the departure of then-Defense Secretary James Mattis.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter announcing the decision.

""I defeated 100% [of the] caliphate,"" Trump said during an interview with C-SPAN last month. ""That doesn't mean ISIS doesn't go running around bombing a store and doing what they do, because they're stone cold crazy, but we've done a great job.""

But the report, which largely summarizes the views of the U.S.-led military task force overseeing operations against ISIS, says that the group remains a threat in Iraq and Syria despite the loss of its final stronghold in Syria earlier this year.

The report says that ISIS retains between 14,000 and 18,000 members in Iraq and Syria, including about 3,000 foreign fighters. It also retains an extensive, global social media operation to recruit fighters.

In both countries, ISIS fighters carried out targeted assassinations, ambushes, suicide bombings in public places, and set fire to fields of crops, the report said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The insurgency did not carry out conventional attacks or attempt to take back territory, the report said, instead it sought to wreak havoc and decrease support for government institutions.

In Syria, it also began to reestablish ""illicit fundraising capabilities"" which the report likened to ""taxes"" on residents and businesses where it operates, the inspector general found. In Iraq, it was able to establish logistics nodes for coordinating attacks, bolstered by fighters who arrived from Syria following their final territorial defeat in March.

The group is strongest in Syria in the Dayr az Zawr province, parts of Raqqah province, and Homs province near Palmyra, the report said.

The report says the U.S. drawdown, completed in the spring, left American-backed Syrian forces ill-prepared to develop trust with local communities and develop human-based intelligence ""necessary to confront ISIS resurgent cells and insurgent capabilities in Syria.""

""Despite losing its territorial 'caliphate,' the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) solidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria this quarter,"" the report says.

In one massive camp in Syria, Al Hol, the absence of U.S. troops has left Syrian partners without the ability to provide more than minimal security, leading to the ""uncontested conditions to spread of ISIS ideology.""

""ISIS is likely exploiting the lack of security to enlist new members and re-engage members who have left the battlefield,"" the report says.

The withdrawal also limited the U.S. capacity to track the humanitarian situation at the camp, which is home to 70,000 people, two-thirds of which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimates are children.

The United Nations estimates that 11,000 residents of the camp are relatives of ISIS fighters, and the U.S. military estimates that as many as 45,000 are ISIS supporters.

Lawyer: Man thought he was following President's orders in anthem attack,https://www.wthr.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.wthr.com/article/lawyer-man-thought-he-was-following-presidents-orders-anthem-attack,"MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — An attorney says a Montana man charged with assaulting a 13-year-old boy who refused to remove his hat during the national anthem believed he was doing what President Donald Trump wanted him to do.

Attorney Lance Jasper tells the Missoulian he will seek a mental health evaluation for Curt Brockway, a U.S. Army veteran who suffered a traumatic brain injury and was convinced he was following his commander in chief’s orders.

Jasper’s comments Wednesday came as prosecutors formally charged Brockway with assault on a minor.

Prosecutors say Brockway asked the boy to remove his hat during the anthem ahead of a rodeo.

They say the boy cursed at Brockway, and the man grabbed him by the throat, “lifted him into the air and slammed the boy into the ground.”

"DOJ, ICE release 300 of nearly 700 workers detained in Mississippi raids",https://nypost.com,['August'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/08/doj-ice-release-300-of-nearly-700-workers-detained-in-mississippi-raids/,"Federal authorities have released 300 of the nearly 700 workers detained in the Mississippi immigration raids on Wednesday, according to officials.

“Approximately 30 detained aliens were released yesterday on humanitarian grounds at the individual sites,” said the US Attorney’s Office for the state’s Southern District in a press release Thursday.

“Another 270 detained aliens were released after being processed by HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] at the National Guard base in Pearl and returned to the place where they were originally encountered.”

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency conducted the raids on Wednesday at seven food processing plants throughout central Mississippi. About 680 people were said to have been detained.

ICE agents asked the workers when they arrived at the immigration processing center whether they had any children who were at school or child care and needed to be picked up, according to DOJ officials.

It is believed that “all children were with at least one of their parents as of last night,” they said.

“In order to make it possible for detained aliens to contact family members and address childcare issues, HSI made cell phones available for use by detained aliens to make arrangements for the care of their children or other dependents,” explained the US attorney’s office. “In addition, HSI had liaison officers working with the school districts to facilitate this process.

“As part of HSI procedures pursuant to this operation, if HSI encountered two alien parents with minor children at home, HSI released one of the parents on humanitarian grounds and returned that individual to the place from which they were arrested,” the DOJ release added. “HSI similarly released any single alien parent with minor children at home on humanitarian grounds and physically returned that person to the place where he or she was originally detained.”

Wednesday’s raids unfolded early in the morning in the cities and towns of Bay Springs, Carthage, Canton, Morton, Pelahatchie and Sebastapol.

Federal officials failed to notify the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services before detaining the workers with children, according to the Clarion-Ledger.

“We’ve been up all night trying to figure this out,” said MDCPS spokesperson Lea Anne Brandon on Thursday.

A rep for ICE confirmed the failed correspondence with the Clarion-Ledger.

“Law enforcement arrests people every day who may have children,” said agency spokesperson Bryan Cox. “Protocols and procedures [were] in place” and ICE coordinated with school officials to reunite the kids with their parents."
Obama Still Sounds Like a President,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['David A. Graham', 'Staff Writer At']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/obama-is-still-acting-like-hes-the-president/595540/,"Read: Barack Obama breaks his silence.

Inevitably, Obama’s statement was greeted with wistfulness and relief by Democrats, and even by never-Trump conservatives like Bill Kristol, who spent eight years fighting the Obama administration tooth and nail. The common theme: This is what presidential looks like.

Indeed, Obama continues to act almost as though he is the president. This note reads like a statement released by the Obama White House. Past presidents have been known to put out statements at moments of national trauma; what’s unusual now is that, because Trump’s efforts at consoling and uniting are so intermittent and clumsy, it feels as though the role of president is vacant, and Obama is sliding right back into it by habit—his and the nation’s.

Like President Obama, former President Obama wants to remain above the political fray. It is clear to the Democrats running for the presidency (as well as to many others) that Trump has to answer for ginning up racial and ethnic hatred and violence. Obama’s statement walked up to the edge of condemning Trump, then stopped without naming him: “We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments; leaders who demonize those who don’t look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people.” Nor does Obama make any policy suggestions.

In part, this is Obama’s attempt to maintain the old norm against former presidents criticizing the current officeholder. Obama has tiptoed up to this line before, notably a year ago in South Africa—though there, too, he avoided speaking Trump’s name.

But Obama has also never quite figured out how to respond to Trump. (He is not alone: The same can be said of the Democratic Party, the Republican old guard, the press, and perhaps much of the public.) Obama remains haunted by the specter of tribalism. He also knows that Trump’s election is, in large part, a product of the backlash to his own election as the first black president. If he attacks Trump with the intent to harm him politically, he threatens to reinforce that backlash, rather than weaken it.

He also knows that any attack would have to land squarely: While Trump has the privilege of nearly infinite mistakes, Obama does not, on this topic least of all. As Ta-Nehisi Coates argued in The Atlantic in 2012, Obama, largely because of his race, has never had much margin for error. “An equality that requires blacks to be twice as good is not equality—it’s a double standard,” Coates wrote. “That double standard haunts and constrains the Obama presidency, warning him away from candor about America’s sordid birthmark.”"
Six states sue EPA over pesticide tied to brain damage,https://thehill.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456560-epa-sued-over-decision-to-allow-use-of-pesticide-tied-to-brain,"Several states sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday over the agency's decision to allow further use of a pesticide linked to brain damage.

California, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Maryland and Vermont argued in court documents that chlorpyrifos, a common pesticide, should be banned due to the dangers associated with it.

Earthjustice filed a similar lawsuit in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of groups advocating for environmentalists, farmworkers and people with learning disabilities.

“A chlorpyrifos ban is long overdue given the overwhelming evidence that says this pesticide harms brain development in children,” Tracy Gregoire, a project coordinator at the Learning Disabilities Association of America, said in a statement. “We are hopeful the courts will side with children who are now being exposed to irreparable, yet preventable harm.”

Chlorpyrifos, known on the market as Lorsban, is used on a wide variety of crops, including corn and cranberries. Farmers have called it the last line of defense against certain insects.

But it has also been linked to learning and memory issues and prolonged nerve and muscle stimulation.

The EPA banned chlorpyrifos for household use in 2001 over concerns it would cause brain damage in children.

EPA’s decision to allow continued use of chlorpyrifos came last month, the result of a court-ordered deadline to regulate the pesticide prompted by a lawsuit previously filed by Earthjustice.

EPA would not comment on the lawsuit but said those challenging the use of chlorpyrifos did not have enough data to demonstrate the product is not safe. The EPA said it would continue to review the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022.

""Registration review is a comprehensive, scientific and transparent process that will further evaluate the potential effects of chlorpyrifos. EPA has also been engaged in discussions with the chlorpyrifos registrants that could result in further use limitations,"" the agency said in a statement to The Hill.

States argue that timeline is far too long.

“Parents shouldn’t have to question whether everyday fruits and vegetables will poison their children,” California Attorney General Becerra said in a statement. “The EPA is egregiously sacrificing our children’s health by refusing to make a determination on this dangerous pesticide.”

A month after former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittSix states sue EPA over pesticide tied to brain damage Overnight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process MORE began leading the department, the agency rejected an Obama-era recommendation from agency scientists to ban the pesticide.

In the absence of EPA action, some states have moved to regulate chlorpyrifos on their own. Hawaii last year banned its use, and California and New York are considering a similar move.

California, the nation’s top agricultural state, said it was obligated to take action due to research showing chlorpyrifos hinders brain development in children.

Farmers and other groups have urged the EPA to keep chlorpyrifos available.

“Without the ability to use chlorpyrifos, entire production fields could be lost,” the American Seed Trade Association wrote in a letter to the agency in 2017.

But many farmworkers say they have been injured by prolonged exposure to the pesticide.

“A nerve agent pesticide that poisons workers and damages children’s developing brain has no place near our fruits and vegetables,” Ramon Ramirez, president of Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, a Latino farmworker group based in Oregon, said in a statement Tuesday. “We look forward to seeing the courts do what EPA refuses to do, protect workers and children with a chlorpyrifos ban.”

The State Department puts China first on rare earth metals,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-state-department-puts-china-first-on-rare-earth-metals,"HARGEISA, Somaliland — To most Americans, anarchy, intervention, and the Black Hawk Down fiasco define Somalia. By any reasonable metric, the country has not improved much since. Somalia has had the dubious honor to be crowned the world’s most corrupt country by Transparency International for 14 years running. Terrorism is a weekly occurrence , and perhaps even a tool for some Somali politicians.

Somalia largely deserves its reputation. A generation of Somali politicians and clan leaders have siphoned off the billions of dollars which the U.S. government and other outside powers have invested in the country. The national Somali military, built to supplant the country’s patchwork of militias, exists largely on paper. In recent weeks, Somali elders, soldiers, and politicians have lined up to apologize to and swear allegiance to al Shabaab, an extremist group responsible for terrorism both inside and outside Somalia.

Somaliland, the northern third of the country and a former British protectorate, however, is a happy exception. It gained its independence (and U.S. recognition) in 1960, only to forfeit it days later when it entered into a union with the rest of Somalia. It was an unhappy marriage marked by dictatorship in Mogadishu and later genocide against the Somaliland population. Finally, in 1991, Somaliland left the union and reasserted its independence. Today, it is peaceful, stable, and even without international recognition, one of the most democratic countries in Africa. It is the first country in the world, for example, to use biometric iris scans for voter registration.

Alas, the State Department ignores Somaliland and instead operates under the fiction that Somalia works. Like a gambler who believes he can redeem his losses with just one more hand at the blackjack table, it continues to pour money into the country, never mind the historical reverse correlation in Somalia between aid and stability. This fiction and gambler’s addiction increasingly undermine vital U.S. national interests.

Historically, Somaliland’s greatest resource was livestock and, for better or worse, charcoal. Energy companies now explore for gas and oil both in Somaliland and Somalia.

The real strategic asset of Somaliland, however, might be rare earth metals.

Mining is a new industry, but already Somaliland is becoming a resource for the rare elements necessary for modern electronics and cutting-edge technology. China has tried to monopolize rare earth elements both to bolster its own economy and, for strategic reasons, to deny them to the United States.

Here is where the State Department strategy is so narrow minded. Somaliland officials say that Chinese companies are aggressive in seeking mining concessions in Somaliland. Somaliland, which has traditionally been both moderate in its outlook and pro-Western, prefers to work with the United States and Europe. But, in order to maintain the fiction that Mogadishu is a success (even though a half billion dollars each year buys the Somali government control over just a few square blocks in the center of Mogadishu) the U.S. government dissuades American companies from signing separate contracts with authorities in Hargeisa, the Somaliland seat of government.

After all, if the U.S. government does not recognize Somaliland’s legal right to issue contracts, then any American businesses operating in Somaliland are illegally infringing on Somali sovereignty. Any American support for Somaliland, the State Department also insists, would also undermine efforts to stabilize Somalia. Perhaps that makes sense in a sterile State Department boardroom or in the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu, but China has no such qualms, and may tighten its rare earth monopoly while American diplomats wring their hands. Adding insult to injury, of course, is that despite the billions of dollars it has received in American assistance over the last decade, the Somali government also awards contracts to the Chinese.

It’s one thing for U.S. diplomats to fight for principle, but to do so absent a sense of vital U.S. national interests or a sense of Horn of Africa realities is counterproductive. Despite all the Trump administration’s rhetoric of America first, both the U.S. embassy in Somalia and the broader U.S. State Department appear effectively to be putting China first.

What Will Be the USDA’s Corn Acreage Estimate Monday?,https://www.agriculture.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/what-will-usda-report-print-on-us-corn-acreage-monday,"Huge is the word being used to describe Monday’s USDA’s Crop Production/WASDE Reports.

Why is it any different than any other August Crop Production Report?

Here’s why.

Because of a wet spring, farmers filling out the USDA’s June survey for its Planting Intentions Report still did not have many acres planted. So, USDA resurveyed farmers, in 14 mainly Midwestern states that experienced planting delays this past spring. Those results will be released Monday.

Plus, in its July report, when the USDA pegged U.S. corn acres at 91.7 million, a lot of farmers and market participants had a very hard time swallowing that number.

USDA’s Corn Acres

Here’s what is expected this time (Monday).

U.S. corn acreage is estimated at 87.99 million, according to the average analyst polled by Reuters News. The lowest trade estimate was 83.4 million, with the highest being 89.8 million. So, there is a wide range of thoughts.

For soybeans, the average trade estimate is 81.0 million vs. the USDA’s July estimate of 80.0 million.

Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says he is looking for acreage adjustments but not really any yield adjustments.

“I think USDA made the economic yield changes in June and will probably stick to them until they get out into the fields for next month. Yields will be most likely less at the end, given the stressful weather right now. But I would think USDA would want to wait to see some real data before adjusting further. Corn area could drop about 3.5 million acres and bean area could go up maybe 1.5 million acres,” Scoville says.

U.S. corn production could total 13.350 billion and 3.195 billion for soybeans, Scoville says. Both of those estimates would be slightly lower than the government’s estimates in July.

Scoville makes reference to the fact that this year’s August report is the first one that the USDA won’t have objective yield information for (ear counts). It was announced a few months ago that USDA will begin objective yield work for the September report.

Louise Gartner, Spectrum Commodities, says that it is safe to say all eyes Monday will be on corn acres.

“I would look for USDA to lower corn acres by about 3 million from last month (pretty much in line with trade estimates). But that really won’t tell the whole story. So many of those acres were planted well beyond the prevent-plant date, and many acres were replanted. I know of farmers who planted corn in late June, hoping for a late fall/delayed frosts,” Gartner says.



Matt Tranel, risk management adviser of Commodity Risk Management Group, says that Monday’s report is one of the most anticipated reports seen in quite some time.

“There are many things to watch, but I’m watching acres, yield, and demand, in that order,” Tranel says. “Acreage is the largest component.”

Tranel added, “What will make the acreage number so interesting is that the focus for many will be on planted acreage. When conducting the analysis for the June Acreage report, farmers responding to the survey indicated that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the interview, significantly lower than the 10-year average. This comes directly from the report itself. Further, the harvested acres as reported in June were expected at 83.6 million, only 8.1 million less than the 91.7-million-acre estimate of plantings.”

USDA Is Prepared

Lance Honig, USDA chief of the USDA/NASS Crops Division, told the University of Illinois Extension Thursday that his staff, in July, went back to those fields that didn’t get planted to find out what happened to those fields.

“That’s some of the data that we are looking at right now to determine if we need to make any acreage adjustments that we published on June 28, 2019,” Honig said in the University of Illinois Extension interview.

Honig explained that although the magnitude of delayed planting acreage is much greater this year, USDA has procedures in place to handle this type of situation.

Furthermore, USDA staff will not just visit the fields affected but talk to the farmers of those fields to find out what is expected to be harvested for silage or other uses, Honig says.

“So, we do have a mechanism to use to find out what the expected outcome of those planted acres will be,” Honig said in the University interview.



Evaluating Yield

Honig says the USDA relies heavily on the farmer to estimate yield.

“So, they (the farmer) will going to give us their best estimate of what they expect that crop’s yield to be. At the same time, we pull satellite information, looking at the crop from that perspective. We weave all that together,” the USDA crop official stated to the University of Illinois Extension.

Honig pointed out that there are two things to remember about yield forecasting.

First, it’s based on what was going on the first of the month. In this case, the first of August.

Secondly, the USDA assumes normal weather for the remainder of the crop year.

“So, we’re not making any adjustments that might happen out of the ordinary,” Honig stated during the University of Illinois Extension interview.

Gartner sees the USDA dropping corn yields, as weather continues to stress in the eastern Midwest.

“If it (USDA) does lower corn yields, I would look for just 1 or 2 bushels per acre for now. Corn condition ratings are starting to slip and I think will continue to erode, but that will likely show up in a later crop report,” Gartner says.

Tramel disagrees, expecting the USDA to wait to trim yield estimates later.

“The crop is later than normal and thus estimating an accurate yield could be quite challenging. Don’t be surprised if that number is very close to 166 bushels per acre, as previously stated. USDA may elect to take a pass on it until the September or October reports, when more clarity has been given to the crop. We won't truly know the results of the crop until they show up on the yield monitors this fall,” Tramel says.

Report’s Long Tail?

Scoville says that the market will move on from Monday’s data.

“I am not sure the market will believe those kinds of numbers, given the current weather situation. So, I am not sure there will be much of a tail for the market. We are moving to a full-fledged weather market. Corn and bean demand should be cut, both domestic and export, but we already know a lot of that, and I think we have beat the market up a lot on demand concerns, anyway. So, I think that we could rally a bit after the reports even with bearish reports due to the weather,” Scoville says.

A Lot of Data

The Farm Service Agency’s Acreage Report, made up of the acreage recorded by farmers to be eligible for government payments, will also be released at 11:00 a.m. CT, the same time as the USDA Crop Production/WASDE Reports.



Normally, the FSA report is released ahead of the USDA/WASDE data."
DHS Official: Trump Can’t Admit ‘This Is Terrorism’,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-official-on-el-paso-and-dayton-trump-cant-admit-this-is-terrorism,"After a weekend of carnage, President Trump said some things that sounded heartening. But current and former law enforcement officials say the president’s words aren’t enough—and they fear it’s all he has to offer.

Thirty-one people were killed between attacks on public places in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in the span of 12 hours this past weekend. While authorities say they have no motive yet for the Dayton attack, officials said the accused El Paso attacker wrote a manifesto justifying the mass murder of Hispanic people to stop their “invasion” of the U.S. Federal prosecutors said they’re considering domestic terrorism charges for the attacker. (Days earlier, a gunman expressing similar racist views killed three people at a food festival in California.)

“This is a clear manifestation of the political discourse that has taken place in the country over the past two years or so,” one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told The Daily Beast. “It cannot be blamed on mental health. This is an ideology-driven hate crime. This is terrorism and the White House has trouble labeling it as such. It is very frustrating.”

In remarks Monday from the White House, the president blamed violent video games and mental health problems for the carnage. He called for the implementation of red flag laws, also known as risk protection orders, that let people petition a judge to have the guns of their friends and family taken away if they worry that person will harm others. He even went so far to say “ our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” —something he has shied away from in the past.

The DHS official called the remarks “demoralizing,” noting the president’s effort to spread the blame around.

Despite the president’s call for reforms, current and former law enforcement officials say they aren’t satisfied. Sources say white supremacy is a significant threat to U.S. national security, and one mention in a 10-minute presidential speech won’t cut it.

“It is a good step to recognize the threat of white supremacy, but words alone cannot solve the problem,” said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who specialized in counterterrorism cases. “Action speaks louder than words. What kind of policy, legislations, designation, and funding is the administration willing to propose, support, and authorize in order to counter this emerging threat? This is where the rubber meets the road.”

Some officials said they put little stock in Trump’s words, worrying that the president would, as in the past, backtrack on his statements on white supremacy.

Others said Trump’s brief condemnation of the ideology meant little following his statements earlier in the day that linked the weekend’s shootings to the need for new immigration legislation—the accused El Paso shooter said immigration was destroying the country.

“I am concerned that white supremacist thought leaders will view his tweet linking immigration reform with background checks as a tacit signal that he still supports their agenda,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “It is mind-boggling he would blend the two issues. I don’t think there is a thorough understanding of the issues at the White House.”

Despite the concern surrounding Trump’s rhetoric on white supremacy, the intelligence community appears to be taking a new, active step in addressing the threat. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is hosting a conference on domestic terrorism with the FBI and DHS next month, according to a person familiar with the plans. An invitation to the event said the conference will scrutinize the federal government’s response to the threat in light of the recent deadly attacks by white supremacists on synagogues in Pennsylvania and California and mosques in New Zealand.

If Trump’s speech was any indication of where the White House plans to focus its efforts following the fatal shootings over the weekend, it seems white supremacy is an afterthought.

The president focused his speech on tracking individuals with mental illnesses.

“Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,” Trump said. “We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement.”

Authorities have not offered evidence that the accused gunmen in El Paso and Dayton were mentally ill. The American Psychological Association said in response to Trump’s remarks: “Blaming mental illness for the gun violence in our country is simplistic and inaccurate and goes against the scientific evidence currently available.”

Trump went on to say that he directed the Department of Justice to work with other law enforcement agencies and social media companies to better detect people he said were mentally ill and liable to kill.

“We must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs,” Trump said.

Federal law enforcement agencies have in the past worked with DHS as well as state and local law enforcement to track people who may endanger others, including veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with criminal pasts. National Security Agency software company Beware at one point let local police departments calculate individuals’ threat levels by collecting things like arrest reports, property records, and social media postings. Meanwhile, the FBI tracks potential terrorist attacks by opening official investigations. Many of those probes have focused on Muslim terrorist suspects following 9/11 and the rise of ISIS.

The only question now, law enforcement officials say, is whether the president will order a crackdown on white supremacist violence.

“The president did what presidents should do, which is condemn bigotry and hatred,” said George Selim, a former DHS official who now works at the Anti-Defamation League. “But what’s needed is resources, strategy, and policy. And the real measure of these horrible atrocities is if the resources, strategy, and policy of the federal government matches the president’s comments today.

“How many lives need to be lost before action is accelerated and the administration works with Congress? The time is now.”"
Treasury designates China as a currency manipulator,https://www.politico.com,"['Doug Palmer', 'Ben White']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/05/trump-blasts-china-yuan-drop-as-currency-manipulation-1634502,"President Donald Trump recently announced he would be setting a 10 percent tariff on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods after earlier imposing a 25 percent tax on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images White House Treasury designates China as a currency manipulator

The United States took the rare step on Monday of formally labeling China a currency manipulator, as trade relations between the two countries continued to spiral downward after President Donald Trump's decision last week to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods.

""In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement that followed the People's Bank of China's decision to let its currency, the renminbi, fall to the lowest level in more than a decade.

Story Continued Below

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made the determination acting ""under the auspices of President Trump,"" the department said. Mnuchin will now ""engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions,"" it added.

Previous administrations have been loath to label China a currency manipulator, arguing it was better to work with other countries to put diplomatic pressure on Beijing. The last time Treasury designated any country as a currency manipulator was in the early 1990s, when China was named.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to formally label China as a currency manipulator on his first day in office. But he declined to do that, reflecting the prevailing view at the time that Beijing was not devaluing its currency for an unfair trade advantage.

Since then, the Treasury Department has kept China on a currency watch list in five semi-annual reports issued under the Trump administration, but had not formally labeled it a currency manipulator. The next report is due on Oct. 15, but Mnuchin acted ahead of schedule.

The trade tensions had already driven stocks lower Monday before the Treasury’s designation. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500 fell around 3 percent, extending losses from last week. Soybean prices were also under pressure at the Chicago Board of Trade.

The penalties associated with the U.S.’ move include asking the IMF to increase surveillance of China's currency practices. The United States could also deny Chinese companies access to financing from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and prohibit them from bidding on U.S. government procurement contracts. But those do not kick until after a year under the authorizing statute.

However, the Commerce Department has previously proposed treating undervalued currencies as an illegal trade subsidy. If that becomes final, Treasury's designation could help open the floodgates to a number of trade remedies cases seeking countervailing duties on Chinese goods.

Treasury's action ""is more symbolic than anything at this point and aimed at Trump's hard core political base that he will need to shore up now that the economy is broadly decelerating in part due to the trade conflict,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. ""Moreover, it marks the start of a process that may end in the Trump administration attempting to devalue the dollar.""

That possibility was also on the minds of other economists, given Trump's concern that the strength of the dollar hurts the United States in international trade by making its exports more expensive.

""China will view this as unjustified and, therefore, is likely to retaliate, thereby signaling further tension escalation,"" said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. ""It signals a new step in the weaponization of economic instruments, also raising the probability of both trade and currency wars.""

Some feared a replay of the disastrous replay of U.S. actions under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the 1930s and tit-for-tat responses by other countries that many blame for prolonging the Great Depression.

""No doubt about it: We witness the two largest economies in the world in full economic, trade, currency war and this gets worse before it stabilizes,"" David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, said in an email. ""Recession risk rising. Smoot-Hawley replay is now underway.""

The U.S. move came after Beijing fired back at Trump's decision to slap tariffs on more Chinese goods by halting purchases of U.S. farm products and letting its currency weaken to 7 yuan to the dollar.

The president's decision last week to impose a new 10 percent tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods was ""a serious violation"" of the agreement between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a meeting in Osaka, Japan, on June 29, China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.

China “will not rule out import tariffs on newly purchased US agricultural products after August 3, and Chinese related companies have suspended purchasing US agricultural products,"" the statement said. The stronger dollar relative to the Chinese currency will further hurt U.S. exports there.

Trump announced the latest round of tariffs after his trade negotiators returned from talks last week in Shanghai frustrated that China had not made any new proposals in negotiations aimed at resolving U.S. concerns over Beijing's trade practices and industrial policies.

The new duties are scheduled to take effect on Sept. 1 unless the two sides are able to patch things up before then. But on Monday, that possibility seemed increasingly remote.

Hours before the Chinese Commerce Ministry announcement, Trump was already upset with the decision by the People's Bank of China to allow the value of China's yuan, officially known as the renminbi, to fall.

U.S. officials had no immediate comment on the Chinese Commerce Ministry statement. However, U.S. farm sales to China are already down sharply this year a result of the trade war.

The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast American farm exports to China at just $6.5 billion in fiscal 2019, which ends Sept. 30. That‘s down from $16.3 billion last year and from more than $20 billion annually when Barack Obama was president.

With his early morning tweet, Trump lashed out at two of his favorite targets at the same time: China and the Federal Reserve.

He's also been heaping pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to boost the U.S. economy. Last week, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, citing the uncertainty caused by Trump's trade policies as one reason for the move. Lower interest tends to drive down the value of the dollar.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, in a ""Fox News Sunday"" interview, expressed frustration over a 10 percent decline in the value of the yuan since Trump started imposing tariffs on China over a year ago.

Economists disagree with the administration's view of the tariff impact. They note the duties are actually paid by U.S. importers, rather than the Chinese government.

A U.S. business and agricultural group coalition, under the name ""Tariffs Hurt the Heartland,"" called on the countries to return ""immediately"" to the negotiating table before more U.S. farmers, workers and small businesses are further hurt by the conflict.

“It’s never been more clear that tariffs are a failing strategy. Behind today’s market turmoil are real Americans who have been used as bargaining chips in this trade war,"" Jonathan Gold, a spokesperson for the group, said in a statement.

The Tax Foundation, an independent nonprofit group, estimates that Trump's threat to impose a new 10 percent tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods amounts to a tax increase of $30 billion, on top of a tax increase of more than $60 billion from his earlier tariffs on Chinese goods.

Despite Trump's decision to impose more duties, the administration still plans to host Chinese officials in Washington in early September for another round of trade talks.

For the two sides to reach a deal and for Trump to eliminate the tariffs he's already imposed, China must stop its ""seven deadly sins,"" including currency manipulation and other practices such as providing huge subsidies for its state-owned enterprises and forcing American companies to transfer their technology, Navarro said.

One of Congress' toughest China hawks said earlier on Monday it was past time for Trump to call Beijing out for currency manipulation.

""China has been manipulating their currency long-before and since President Trump took office,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. ""He should finally tell his Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator. That's all he needs to do to make it happen.”



CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report misstated a currency designation. The Chinese currency weakened to below 7 yuan to the dollar."
Early FBI interviews of DOJ contact with author of Trump dossier released,https://www.cnn.com,"['Katelyn Polantz', 'Jeremy Herb']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/doj-contact-trump-dossier-author/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department on Thursday night released 34 pages of memos from interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who was in contact with the author of the unsubstantiated 2016 dossier about Donald Trump and his presidential campaign.

Judicial Watch, a right-leaning group that advocates for government transparency, obtained the documents through a federal public records lawsuit. The memos are called 302s, an internal FBI moniker for its notes of interviews. In all, 12 FBI memos about Ohr were released, from interviews in late 2016 though spring 2017.

The release is among the few internal documents available -- besides FBI memos about an interview with former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the Mueller report itself -- that show investigators' early approaches to the Russia investigation.

The memos -- and Judicial Watch's interpretation of them -- highlight how Ohr wanted to share information with the FBI and how the FBI was gathering leads on Russians and the Trump campaign in late 2016 and early 2017. The disclosure of the memos on Thursday largely retreads and aligns with what Ohr and others have told House committees.

Judicial Watch and others have criticized Ohr, calling him a government official with a conflict of interest in 2016 who wanted to help federal agencies probe Trump's campaign by funneling them damaging and unfounded opposition research.

EPA Won’t Approve Labels That Say Roundup Chemical Causes Cancer,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-08-08/epa-wont-approve-labels-that-say-roundup-weed-killer-chemical-glyphosate-causes-cancer,"Product labels that link glyphosate, the main active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup, to cancer will not be approved by the EPA, the agency announced Thursday. The Associated Press

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it will not approve labels on products containing glyphosate that link the chemical to cancer.

The move is directed at California. In 2017, the state declared the chemical, which is the main active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup, a carcinogen. Roundup producer Monsanto challenged the ruling in federal court, and a judge has temporarily blocked the state from requiring the labels as the lawsuit continues.

Dated Aug. 7, the new guidance from EPA to companies registered to sell the chemical says that California's labels would ""constitute a false and misleading statement"" and that the agency will no longer approve labels that contain the state's warning.

""We will not allow California's flawed program to dictate federal policy,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.

The agency said the move is based on its own findings that show that glyphosate does not pose a public risk when used as directed.

But the World Health Organization's cancer agency previously determined that glyphosate is likely to cause cancer, prompting California to list the chemical in Proposition 65 , its right-to-know law that provides residents with warnings about cancer-causing chemicals.

The EPA's announcement is a win for Monsanto and its parent company, Bayer AG, which have found a haven in the agency but not in the courts."
VA Workers Rally in Aurora Against Trump’s Assault on Federal Labor Unions,https://www.westword.com,['Chase Woodruff'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.westword.com/news/va-workers-rally-in-aurora-against-trumps-assault-on-federal-labor-unions-11440659,"Workers from Denver-area Veterans Affairs facilities are speaking out against efforts by the Trump administration to weaken labor protections for federal employees.

Joined by local leaders and labor activists, members of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2241 rallied outside the headquarters of the VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System in Aurora today, August 7. As contract negotiations between the AFGE and the administration continue in Washington, local union representatives are sounding the alarm about the possible implications for other federal workers across the country.

“If the administration is successful in breaking us, there’s a pretty good chance that the other unions will follow,” says Bernard Humbles, president of Local 2241.

Negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement for VA workers began in May, when Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie announced the administration’s contract proposal — which union leaders panned. The proposal would remove 28 articles from the previous bargaining agreement, which was signed in 2011, and substantially change others, including provisions that allow for so-called official time, which allows employees to conduct union business during work hours. It also eliminates or amends sections of the agreement concerning employee training, workplace safety, whistleblower protections and more.

Local 2241 represents roughly 3,000 workers in the Denver metro area, Humbles said, and 260,000 VA employees nationwide. But union members fear those numbers could fall if the Trump administration gets its way, increasing turnover and reliance on contract workers and reducing the quality of care for veterans.

“We’re already understaffed,” says Humbles. “Right now we have about 50,000 vacancies across the VA. Those positions need to be filled, and the contracting isn’t working very well. When they contract out, we don’t really get the bang for our buck that we need to.”

Little progress has been made in talks between the Trump administration and the AFGE, and the union has accused VA management of stalling tactics. In a letter to Wilkie on July 31, a group of 33 Democratic senators accused the administration of taking a ""destructive approach"" to bargaining and urged officials to return to the table and ""negotiate in good faith.""

""Negotiations are ongoing,"" VA spokesman Curtis Cashour said in an email to Westword. ""AFGE has consistently fought for the status quo and opposed attempts to make VA work better for veterans and their families. Now AFGE is taking the same approach with its refusal to accept commonsense improvements to its collective bargaining agreement.""

Attendees at Wednesday's rally included Representative Jason Crow, a Democrat whose district includes Aurora and several VA facilities, along with Democratic senate candidates Alice Madden, Mike Johnston and John Walsh.

""This president campaigned on fighting for the middle class, but he has gotten into office and done the opposite,"" said Crow. ""We will not let it stand.""

The Trump administration has pushed to roll back labor protections for workers at multiple federal agencies, including the VA and the Environmental Protection Agency — and VA workers are worried that this could only be the beginning.

“If they do bust the union here, it’s going to be a ripple effect,” says Brian Utt, steward of Local 2241. “They’re going to go after other federal agencies, like the Post Office. If they get one, they’re going to try to get them all.”

In the case of the VA, workers say, the administration's assault on unions will also allow it to push for greater privatization of the department. Under Trump, the VA has sought to shift billions of dollars in funding for government-run hospitals to private providers.

“We need the community to support us and not privatize the VA,” says Humbles. “We’ve got to believe that’s the direction that they’re heading in. If they can break the unions, they can lay off employees, furlough employees and bring contractors in to do the work. There’s a lot of money to be made on the VA.”"
"USDA science agencies’ relocation may have violated law, inspector general report says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/08/05/usda-science-agencies-relocation-may-have-violated-law-inspector-general-report-says/,"

A federal watchdog challenged the Trump administration’s authority to move two USDA science agencies out of Washington, in a report issued a few days after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, praised the move for encouraging federal scientists to quit their jobs.

The plan to relocate the two agencies from the District to Kansas City may have run afoul of the 2018 appropriations act, according to a report released Monday from the USDA’s Office of Inspector General.

In August 2018, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a plan to relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees $1.7 billion in scientific grants and funding, and the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency that publishes influential reports on agricultural trade and rural America. Both agencies lease office space in the District.

USDA selected the Kansas City region as the new home for these agencies in June 2019, in what Perdue has billed as a cost-saving decision. About two-thirds of nearly 400 employees refused the reassignment and will lose their jobs.

“This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, told The Washington Post last month.

In his keynote speech at the Republican Party’s black-tie-optional Silver Elephant Gala in South Carolina on Friday, Mulvaney seemed to celebrate the attrition at the agencies. “You’ve heard about ‘drain the swamp.’ What you probably haven’t heard is what we are actually doing. I don’t know if you saw the news the other day, but the USDA just tried to move, or did move, two offices out of Washington, D.C.,"" he said.

As the crowd clapped, Mulvaney continued: “Yes, you can applaud that one. That’s what we’ve been talking about doing. Guess what happened? Guess what happened? More than half the people quit.

“It’s nearly impossible to fire a federal worker,” Mulvaney said. “I know that because a lot of them work for me, and I’ve tried . . . By simply saying to people, ‘You know what, we’re going to take you outside the bubble, outside the Beltway, outside this liberal haven of Washington, D.C., and move you out in the real part of the country,' and they quit — what a wonderful way to sort of streamline government, and do what we haven’t been able to do for a long time.”

Trump officials are planning additional shake-ups and exoduses from Washington. By 2020, more than 80 percent of the headquarters staff at the Bureau of Land Management will be moved west of the Rocky Mountains, the Interior Department told lawmakers in July. The Trump administration also wants to break up the Office of Personnel Management and split 5,500 workers among three other departments.

J. David Cox Sr., president of American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the two USDA agencies, said Mulvaney’s comments confirmed the union’s concerns. “The administration’s decision to transfer hundreds of USDA jobs from D.C. isn’t about helping federal employees do their jobs better or delivering better services to the American taxpayer,” Cox said in a statement. “Their goal is to drive out hard-working and dedicated civil servants and silence the parts of the agencies’ research that the administration views as inconvenient.” A study from ERS, for instance, one of the agencies targeted for the move, showed that a $1.5 trillion tax bill signed by Trump offered few, if any, benefits to low-income farmers.

Congress questioned whether USDA has the legal authority to move the agencies. The department has this power, according to the inspector general’s investigation. But USDA also needs budgetary approval from Congress to fund the moves, the watchdog group said, which the department did not obtain.

In the fall, USDA awarded a $340,000 contract to the accounting firm Ernst & Young to assist with the relocation. The 2018 omnibus spending bill required USDA to receive congressional approval before spending this money. “That prior approval did not appear to have been granted,” the inspector general report says.

This expense may have also violated the Antideficiency Act, the report said, which prevents federal employees from involving the government “in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made.”

Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.), who requested the inspector general’s investigation in September 2018, exhorted USDA to follow the law. “The Secretary must follow the will of Congress and refrain from moving forward with the relocation,” they said in a joint statement Monday, “until Congress approves the use of funds for those purposes as directed by the fiscal year 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) called the inspector general report “very troubling” said it confirms “suspicions that the secretary does not have the authority to proceed with this relocation.”

G. William Hoagland, a vice president at the D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, predicted that the failure to get congressional approval “will certainly set in motion legal challenges” from the union to halt the move “until either the courts or Congress act.”

In a list of recommendations in the report, the inspector general’s office advised USDA to seek approval from a congressional committee.

USDA management refused to do so. “To say the department was out of step with budgetary requirements disregards the authority given to the executive branch by the U.S. Constitution,” according to a statement provided by USDA. It continued: “Since the inspector general affirms the department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed.”

This report has been updated.

Assistant secretary of State resigns after immigration clash: report,https://thehill.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/456674-assistant-secretary-of-state-resigns-over-immigration-policy-report,"The State Department’s top diplomat for Latin American matters has resigned after a dispute with the White House over Guatemalan immigration policy, according to The Washington Post.

Miller told Breier that it was ""her job"" to defend the agreement, which requires Central American migrants to seek asylum in Guatemala before applying for asylum in the U.S., the official added. The Post notes that it is unclear whether this was a primary cause of her resignation.

A second senior official, however, told the newspaper no such email chain exists.

Activists Say DHS Agents Racially Profiled Drivers Outside Miramar ICE Office,https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Manuel Madrid'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/activists-say-dhs-agents-racially-profiled-drivers-outside-of-south-florida-ice-office-11237427,"Federal agents used limited parking outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in Miramar as a pretext to racially profile drivers earlier today.

That's according to activists who intervened after they saw officers with the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service (FPS) demand driver's licenses from people of color who had stopped or slowed in no-park zones, and simply waved on white drivers to move their vehicles.

""I was shocked to see them simply letting white people drive off while stopping people of color,"" Maria Bilbao, an organizer with the immigration advocacy group United We Dream, tells New Times. ""They said what they were doing was legal, but I've never seen this sort of thing happen before.""

FPS did not immediately respond to New Times' request for comment.

The Miramar facility is the primary point of access for South Florida immigrants looking to check in with ICE. Lines to enter the facility begin before dawn and sometimes include hundreds of people, yet there's vastly insufficient parking to accommodate such large crowds. The constant flow of cars and pedestrians can make finding a place to park or idle difficult. New Times previously reported that tow truck drivers in the past have circled the lot outside the facility to haul away illegally parked cars.

According to Bilbao, FPS agents were targeting drivers of color who had stopped or slowed in no-park zones. On Twitter, Bilbao posted a video of the incident, in which she can be seen speaking with an FPS agent beside a stopped car. Bilbao is ushered back to the sidewalk by the agents as she asks why they're checking driver's licenses. One agent tells her it's part of their job.

""That's not part of his job,"" replies Carlos Naranjo, a community organizer with New Florida Majority. ""That's never happened before.""

WATCH NOW:



Our organizers at the ICE facility in Miramar, Florida found out that DHS is now checking the driver's licenses of the people driving to drop off their family members at the location. They are mostly stopping people of color. #AbolishICE pic.twitter.com/03o7BRGbCM — United We Dream (@UNITEDWEDREAM) August 7, 2019

Bilbao, along with other immigrant-rights activists, visits the facility every week to provide water and other support to immigrants waiting in line for their appointments with ICE. She says she's been going there for more than two years but had never seen DHS officers target drivers. Naranjo took photos of at least two drivers of color stopped by FPS agents. Bilbao says other activists counted as many as five cars stopped. Once Naranjo began filming the incident, the officers apparently stopped pulling people over.

Mark Myers, a staffer from the office of Miramar Democratic Rep. Cindy Polo, says he drove by the ICE facility to drop off water and was asked by FPS officers to move when he slowed his vehicle.

""I can't say that I wasn't stopped because I was a white guy in a tie. I can't be sure what was on the mind of the officer,"" Myers says. ""But I certainly wasn't asked for any information or identification.""

Another activist, Glenn Rice, responded to one of Bilbao's Facebook posts about the profiling, echoing Myers' experience. ""When I stopped on the side of the road this morning to drop off water, this same 'guard/ICE agent' [sic] tried to be very nice & professional with ME — asked me to 'please pull my car into a parking lot, SIR, if you're going to stay.' He even said thank you to ME!""

Thirteen states offer driver's licenses to undocumented residents. Florida is not one of them. An undocumented person in the Sunshine State could easily end up in deportation proceedings as a result of a traffic stop.

""I was undocumented for 18 years and often had no choice but to drive without a license,"" Bilbao says. ""I know what can happen when you get pulled over while undocumented — it can ruin your life.""

Besides that, the alleged racial profiling occurred outside a place where immigrants show up for legal check-ins with ICE. In other words, immigrants at the Miramar facility are there to comply with the law. Activists claim that ICE agents have routinely used the check-ins as a way to apprehend immigrants without warning, but this is apparently the first time FPS officers have requested documentation from people outside the facility.

The ICE office, located just off Miramar Parkway by I-75, has long been plagued by accusations of poor conditions, including insufficient shade outside and only two functioning toilets to accommodate hundreds of immigrants waiting in line. Activists have compared barricades used to fence immigrants to those used to corral farm animals. Bilbao worries FPS officers might use profiling tactics again when there are no activists present."

Hirono (D-Hawaiʻi), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), and 13 of their U.S. Senate colleagues sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler urging him to reconsider the decision not to ban chlorpyrifos.

The group calls chlorpyrifos “a toxic pesticide” and says it is “linked to brain damage in children and known to cause serious harm to human health.”

In the letter, the Senators ask the EPA to reverse its decision and place a ban on chlorpyrifos “immediately in the interest of protecting public health.”

“The EPA has repeatedly found that chlorpyrifos harms children’s brains at exposures far lower than what the EPA allows. Nevertheless, it refuses to ban this pesticide supposedly because the agency is currently unable to pinpoint the precise exposures that cause this harm,” the Senators wrote. “Additionally, the EPA’s rejection of the petition to ban chlorpyrifos has been accompanied by a new argument in which the EPA contends that the prohibition on allowing a pesticide to be on our food in the absence of an affirmative EPA safety finding does not apply to its action on public petitions. The EPA apparently now seeks to cast aside public input from its work to protect public health.”

“Additionally, chlorpyrifos threatens agricultural workers who apply the pesticide. Farm workers are exposed to chlorpyrifos from mixing, handling, and applying the pesticide, as well as from entering fields where chlorpyrifos was recently sprayed. Chlorpyrifos is one of the pesticides most often linked to acute pesticide poisonings, and in many States that monitor pesticide poisonings, it is regularly identified among the five pesticides linked to the highest number of pesticide poisoning incidents. This is significant given widespread under-reporting of pesticide poisonings due to such factors as inadequate reporting systems, fear of retaliation from employers, and reluctance to seek medical treatment,” the Senators continued.

“The EPA’s decision to reject the petition to ban chlorpyrifos is deeply concerning. It simply makes no sense from a public health or legal perspective for EPA to continue to resist taking action that would protect children’s brains. If you fail to reverse this decision, more children, farmworkers and American families will be exposed to this pesticide and they will suffer as a result,” the Senators concluded.

The senators say that despite a petition in July to ban chlorpyrifos, the EPA announced it would not ban the chemical, but rather would monitor the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2020.

In addition to sending the letter, Senator Hirono is also a cosponsor of S. 921, the Protect Children, Farmers, and Farmworkers from Nerve Agent Pesticides Act of 2019, which would prohibit the use of chlorpyrifos on food. Also, last year Hawaiʻi became the first state to pass a law banning the use of chlorpyrifos.

Joining Senators Hirono and Udall on the letter are U.S. Senators Cory A. Booker (D-N.J.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Richard J.

Interior took notes from FBI while developing controversial FOIA policy,https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456377-interior-took-notes-from-fbi-while-developing-controversial-foia,"The Interior Department took notes from the FBI, which handles reams of classified material and is known as a slower responder to public records requests, while developing its controversial policy for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, according to emails reviewed by The Hill.

Internal emails obtained through a FOIA request by Earthjustice and shared with The Hill show that Interior employees were eager to talk to FBI staff who oversaw FOIA requests as it sought to deal with its own mounting public records requests.

“I understand from my discussions with the US Attorney’s Office in D.C. that the FBI’s FOIA program and strategy in FOIA litigation is pretty much the 'gold standard,’ ” Rachel Spector, an official with Interior’s Office of the Solicitor, wrote to an unnamed FBI official on April 14, 2018.

“Sorry to be so persistent, but we are scrambling to get our arms around a significant surge in FOIA requests and accompanying litigation,” she wrote to another FBI official seeking information on their procedures.

The emails show Interior was particularly interested in the FBI’s “500-page per month policy,” under which the FBI only releases 500 pages of requested material to each requester per month. That rule has routinely been challenged in courts with mixed success by advocacy groups who argue it skirts FOIA law.

The “500-page per month policy” did not become a part of Interior’s new FOIA process, but critics say the discussions show the lengths to which the department went to try to find ways to not have to respond quickly to requests.

“I can’t imagine any reason for adopting the FBI’s approach other than it seems like a slow enough rate for them to be happy with processing records,” said Jeffrey Light, a FOIA specialist attorney.

The emails also show Interior reached out to officials at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) while it was working on its policy.

Both the EPA and Interior in 2018 were actively working to draft new FOIA policies under President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump cites brother's struggles with alcohol as driving force behind fight against opioids Booker: 'Knowing the bloody, violent truth of our past empowers me' Analyst says Trump's Venezuela policy is driven by Florida politics MORE. Interior ultimately submitted its draft policy in December 2018. EPA submitted its finalized policy without a public comment period at the end of June.

An Interior Department official said the policies were drafted in a way to “increase the value of the services we provide to the American people.”

“As part of the Department’s efforts to improve its FOIA program, we consulted other federal agencies to better understand their practices including training, technology, and processing. We are committed to increasing transparency and improving our ability to meet our statutory obligations with an ever-increasing volume of FOIA requests,” Interior spokeswoman Molly Block told The Hill in a statement.

The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its interactions with the Interior Department.

Thomas Cmar, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said Interior’s use of the FBI as a potential model for handling FOIA requests was troubling because “the FBI has a long and storied history of lack of transparency.”

“I think it says a lot about Interior’s point of view on transparency that they are looking for examples on efforts trying to clamp down on transparency as models for how the agency should adopt its procedures,” he said.

The FBI provided Interior with full texts of one of the court cases connected to the 500-page rule’s proceedings, writing: “The Appeal Court concluded the FBI’s policy was not in violation of the FOIA; the policy is a non-obstructionist; the policy serves to promote efficient responses to a larger number of requesters.”

Light, who has represented clients challenging the FBI’s FOIA rule, said he understood Interior’s interest in the FBI policy even though it was a bit like comparing “apples and oranges” given the often classified nature of FBI information.

“I can certainly understand from an agency’s perspective why they would want to have a cap on how many pages they want to do,” he said. “Because then, if there is a request that is large, you can forward the requester to be in a position to give up documents they really want or having to wait an inordinate amount of time to get them. It gives them a lot of leverage.”

The emails show Interior officials were interested in learning more about the EPA’s recent reorganization of FOIA request handling to a central office in Washington, D.C.

EPA in April 2018 quietly moved its national FOIA office to its Office of General Counsel, a big change that meant requests went to a general office rather than specific EPA bureaus.

Critics say the shift made EPA political appointees — and not career officials — the first gatekeepers for FOIA requests.

The EPA’s new policy has been challenged in the courts by a number of environmental groups over its lack of transparency and also spurred a bipartisan group of senators at the end of July to introduce a FOIA reform bill.

Interior set up meetings with EPA officials to discuss the rules after they learned of them.

“FYI,” wrote Cindy Cafaro, an officer in Interior’s FOIA policy office, as she forwarded an internal EPA press release about the National Freedom of Information Act office. The April 25, 2018, email was sent to Juliette Lillie, director of Interior’s Office of the Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, and Robert Howarth, the director of congressional affairs.

Four months later, Interior’s acting solicitor Edward Keable and EPA's acting FOIA director Timothy Epp held a meeting.

“Thank you again for taking the time this afternoon to meet with us,” Keable wrote Epp on Aug. 24. In the email, Keable suggested further discussing topics at a second meeting, scheduled for Aug. 28.

“What is your experience with and how do you minimize false positives? How do you manage quality control?” Keable asked Epp in the Aug. 24 email, referring to ways the agency could minimize the chances of releasing incorrectly identified documents from FOIA request match search results.

Cmar said the interactions were troubling because “we’ve seen serious abuses of the process at both agencies under this administration.”

Another internal email suggested that Interior Secretary David Bernhardt personally requested learning more details about EPA’s FOIA process. Bernhardt was deputy secretary at the time.

In August, an email sent from Lillie to acting Interior Solicitor Daniel Jorjani and Hubbel Relat, a senior counselor at Interior, said a “David” had asked staff to reach out to EPA.

“This morning we met with David on FOIA. He asked us to reach out to EPA to learn about their management processes, including clearing out backlog, accountability, management, staffing, tools, etc. and how they made the changes. Would it be possible for you to reach out within the next week?” Lillie wrote. “We are on a tight time frame to provide some additional guidance back to David. I am happy to discuss further with you, when you are available.”

Interior did not respond to a specific question about Bernhardt’s involvement.

The EPA told The Hill that it will “continue to work with all federal partners to share best practices for FOIA responses.” The agency did not comment on its communications with the Interior Department regarding FOIA policies.

Interior’s final draft FOIA policy submitted in December did not include EPA’s centralization plan.

Interior did not respond to questions about why the two policies were not included and whether it is looking to incorporate them.

Interior's draft FOIA policy has been criticized for including what’s known as an “awareness review,” which allows senior political appointees to review public documents referencing them before release. Critics warn the practice can slow the dissemination of public information and gives officials undue authority to potentially influence the withholding of documents.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenSenate Dems urge Mnuchin not to cut capital gains taxes Conservatives buck Trump over worries of 'socialist' drug pricing Interior took notes from FBI while developing controversial FOIA policy MORE (D-Ore.) last week placed a hold on Jorjani’s nomination to be the official Interior solicitor, citing concerns over his work on Interior’s FOIA policy and a lack of candor about his involvement while testifying to Congress.

Interior’s Inspector General is separately investigating the merits of the Interior FOIA policy.

“I am writing to ask you that you include in the scope of your investigation the role Deputy Solicitor Daniel Jorjani played in establishing DOI’s ‘supplemental’ FOIA review policy or any awareness he may have had of the policy’s existence before his confirmation hearing,” Wyden last week wrote to the Inspector General's Office.

“I believe your investigation may be the best hope of uncovering information critical to a possible DOJ investigation before the Senate moves forward with his confirmation vote,” he wrote.

Justice Department files amicus brief in Mazars case shielding Trump from House subpoena.,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/justice-department-mazars-subpoena-trump-barr.html,"Attorney General William Barr speaks at the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University School of Law on July 23 in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Images

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice filed a disgraceful amicus brief urging a federal appeals court to block the House of Representatives’ subpoena of the president’s financial records. There is no clear purpose for the brief other than a blatantly partisan effort to shield Trump from congressional oversight. It is a startling departure from the DOJ’s traditional independence and another sign that Attorney General William Barr views his job as running interference for the president.

Donald Trump’s lawyers—his personal attorneys, not the DOJ—have been fighting this subpoena since the House Oversight Committee issued it in April. The committee sought eight years of financial records from Mazars USA, which provided accounting services to Trump. Congress has broad constitutional authority to investigate the president, and the Supreme Court has held that the judiciary must honor any subpoena with a “legitimate legislative purpose.” Trump’s lawyers argue that the committee’s subpoena lacks such a purpose, and was merely intended to “harass” the president. In its amicus brief, the Justice Department parrots this argument, framing the House’s subpoena as an effort to torment Trump by inspecting his finances for political gain.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected that argument in May. Mehta noted that the committee chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, had provided a memorandum detailing a number of legitimate reasons for the subpoena. Cummings wrote that the committee sought to learn whether Trump “accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics” so it could determine “whether reforms are necessary to address deficiencies with current laws.” The committee also wished to discover whether Trump “has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions.”

The House has already passed an ethics bill, H.R. 1, this year with provisions aimed directly at the executive. Lawmakers plainly have a “legitimate legislative purpose,” Mehta wrote, in probing the president’s ethics to decide whether these reforms are necessary and sufficient. Moreover, the committee wished to know “whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office.” It “is simply not fathomable,” Mehta wrote, “that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct—past or present—even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.”

Finally, the committee sought to learn whether Trump had complied with the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars the president from accepting any gift from a foreign government without Congress’ consent. “Surely,” Mehta wrote, “incident to Congress’s authority to consent to the President’s receipt of Emoluments is the power to investigate the President’s compliance with the Clause.”

Trump’s lawyers promptly appealed Mehta’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of judges for the D.C. Circuit is currently mulling whether Mehta got it right.

The Justice Department had no reason to step in; Trump is amply represented by his own attorneys, and this matter does not require the defense of some federal law. To the contrary, the DOJ typically sits out such interbranch disputes, and it has no obvious interest in siding with the president against Congress here.

But the DOJ filed an amicus brief anyway—weeks after oral arguments at the D.C. Circuit—and it is flabbergasting. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that courts may not search for some covert illicit motive among committee members; if the committee states a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the judiciary must respect it. The DOJ ignores this rule. It argues that the House’s actions raise “the specter that members of the Legislative Branch are impermissibly attempting to interfere with or harass the Head of the Executive Branch.” And it calls for a “searching evaluation” of committee members’ motives.

The DOJ argues that Cummings’ memorandum justifying the subpoena is “insufficient” because it was “not ratified by the full House.” It cites no authority for this proposition because it is made-up; the Supreme Court has never held that a committee’s subpoena is invalid until ratified by the full chamber. But even if that were the law, the DOJ has a problem: The full House already ratified the Mazars subpoena. In response to this fact, the DOJ claims that the House’s vote doesn’t count because “it did so only as part of a general authorization for pending and future investigations.” There is no precedent to support the argument that the House must ratify a subpoena with some unknown level of specificity; it is a blatant exercise in moving the goalposts. The DOJ is attempting to throw new roadblocks in front of the committee on the basis of its own pseudo-constitutional beliefs.

But that’s not even the strangest part of the brief. The DOJ insists that the House cannot investigate Trump pursuant to its impeachment authority. Why? Because it hasn’t asserted “jurisdiction over” impeachment. In other words, the House’s constitutional power of impeachment lies dormant until someone declares an intent to impeach. Who, exactly, holds this mystical authority? A committee chair? The speaker? A majority of lawmakers, shouting in unison? Who knows? The DOJ does not say when the impeachment power officially kicks in, because it has concocted this rule out of thin air. Maybe Mehta was on to something when he wrote that it “is simply not fathomable” that the Constitution could (silently) limit the impeachment power so arbitrarily.

Ironically, the DOJ ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to.

The DOJ brief fares no better in its dismissal of Congress’ authority over emoluments. Again, the Constitution explicitly bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign states without Congress’ consent. But the DOJ argues that this power does not justify the subpoena because there’s no proof the House “is investigating the President with a view toward consenting to any undisclosed emoluments.”

That is a lie. Cummings’ memorandum expressly stated that the House sought “to assess whether [Trump] is complying with the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution.” If that weren’t enough—and it is—Cummings is also investigating Trump International Hotel to determine whether it grants Trump unconstitutional emoluments. Recognizing, perhaps, that the courts cannot rigorously scrutinize a committee’s stated intentions, the DOJ has chosen to pretend the committee never stated those intentions in the first place.

Most gallingly, the DOJ urges the court to reject the legitimacy of the House’s legislative purpose by preemptively declaring its legislation unconstitutional. The DOJ writes that H.R. 1 and similar proposals do not deserve any “presumption of legitimacy” because they are probably illegal. It claims that the Constitution bars Congress from forcing the president to divest from his conflicts of interest. Thus, the House cannot investigate Trump to help it craft ethics reforms, since those reforms are unconstitutional.

This argument is astonishing. Federal courts are forbidden from issuing advisory opinions on the constitutionality of pending legislation. A bill cannot be challenged in federal court if it is just a bill; this is Schoolhouse Rock stuff. Yet the DOJ is essentially asking the judiciary to declare a provision of H.R. 1 unconstitutional before it becomes law. This vast expansion of judicial power would constitute an advisory opinion on steroids. The courts would be obligated to gauge the legality of bills under consideration in Congress every time they are asked to quash a congressional subpoena. That is not and cannot be the law.

Ironically, the DOJ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to. The Supreme Court curtails the judiciary’s ability to quash congressional subpoenas for a reason. Once courts start inspecting lawmakers’ motives, they become entangled in the legislative process. It is not the job of judges to decide whether the House really needed to issue a subpoena; once a committee stated a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the courts must butt out. Otherwise, judges will wind up curbing Congress’ constitutional powers and effectively killing legislation before it passes. The judiciary is ill-equipped to determine just how much information lawmakers require to govern effectively.

Still, counterproductive as the DOJ’s brief may be, it reveals the full extent of the department’s distortion under Barr. The Justice Department represents the United States, not the president himself, and it has no business putting its thumb on the scale of Trump in his fight against Congress. Barr may see the office of the attorney general as an outpost of the White House. He may see himself as a loyal foot soldier for Trump in his squabble with Democrats. But the Justice Department was never intended to be a weapon for presidents to wield against their political opponents. Tuesday’s brief degrades the institution, eroding its legitimacy for purely partisan goals."

Energy Department wants to build nuclear test reactor,https://www.latimes.com,"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-05/energy-department-wants-to-build-nuclear-test-reactor,"A new nuclear test reactor is needed as part of an effort to revamp the nation’s fading nuclear power industry by developing safer fuel and power plants, the U.S. Department of Energy said Monday.

The federal agency said it would prepare an environmental impact statement as part of the process to build the test reactor in Idaho or Tennessee by the end of 2025. Public comments on the environmental review are being taken through Sept. 4.

The Versatile Test Reactor would be the first new test reactor built in the United States in decades and give the nation a dedicated “fast-neutron-spectrum” testing capability. Such reactors are called fast reactors.

“This testing capability is essential for the United States to modernize its nuclear energy infrastructure and for developing transformational nuclear energy technologies that reduce waste generation and enhance nuclear security,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in a statement.

Americans have been wary of nuclear power since the core from Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island underwent a partial meltdown in 1979 — one of the nation’s worst nuclear accidents. That was followed by a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploding and burning in 1986. In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan where the cores of three reactors suffered meltdowns after cooling systems failed.

Federal officials say the proposed test reactor would help create new and safer fuels, materials and reactors being developed by civilian companies in the United States.

“If this capability is not available to U.S. innovators as soon as possible, the ongoing shift of nuclear technology dominance to other international states such as China and the Russian Federation will accelerate, to the detriment of the U.S. nuclear industrial sector,” said Rita Baranwal, the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for nuclear energy.

The Energy Department had a fast reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor II, operating in eastern Idaho until it was shut down in 1994 as the nation turned away from nuclear power.

Edwin Lyman, senior scientist and acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said fast reactors such as the proposed Versatile Test Reactor are less safe than current reactors.

Most nuclear reactors in use now are “light-water” reactors fueled by uranium and cooled with water. Lyman said the test reactor would be cooled with harder-to-control liquid sodium and likely fueled by plutonium, increasing potential nuclear terrorism risks because plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons.

“There is nothing good about these reactors,” he said. “I think there is a love of plutonium in the [Energy] Department that is irrational.”

Revamping the nation’s nuclear power is part of a strategy to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by generating carbon-free electricity with nuclear power. The strategy was initiated under the Obama administration and continuing under the Trump administration, despite Trump’s downplaying of global warming.

Reducing spent nuclear fuel, federal officials say, is also an objective of the new test reactor. The United States has no permanent repository for about 77,000 tons of radioactive spent fuel, stored mainly at the commercial nuclear power plants where they were used to produce electricity.

But Lyman said fast reactors would produce waste even more hazardous and difficult to dispose.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, at the end of December there were 98 nuclear reactors at 59 power plants producing about 20% of the nation’s energy. Most of the reactors are decades old, and many are having a tough time competing economically with other forms of energy production.

The Energy Department is considering building the test reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho or the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee.

On a related front, late last year the Energy Department restarted the Transient Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory to test new nuclear fuels. That facility had been on standby since 1994."
