Leading House Dem calls out Omar and Tlaib amid Trump attack for furthering anti-Semitism with 'vile' cartoon,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nadler-omar-tlaib-cartoon-anti-semitism,"House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., called out members of both parties on Thursday, claiming they helped further anti-Semitism in the nation's ""political dialogue.""

""The growing anti-Semitism in our political dialogue is repugnant,"" Nadler said. He pointed to Trump's comments about ""disloyalty"" in Jews who voted for Democrats, as well as a cartoon forwarded by two progressive congresswomen already in the news for a failed attempt to enter Israel.

""[T]he Carlos Latuff cartoon forwarded by @RepRashida and @Ilhan can surely be read for its vile underlying message,"" Nadler tweeted.

TLAIB, OMAR SHARE IMAGE BY ARTIST ONCE CELEBRATED IN IRAN'S HOLOCAUST CARTOON CONTEST

Both Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., shared a cartoon from an artist who came in second in Iran's International Holocaust Cartoon contest.

The cartoon displayed a Star of David in the center and appeared to show Trump trying to silence Omar. It also showed Tlaib with what appeared to be Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hand over her mouth.

Netanyahu's government had banned Omar and Tlaib from entering Israel, citing the congresswomen's itinerary as evidence they wanted to promote a boycott against the country. The itinerary named their destination ""Palestine"" rather than Israel — and the group that planned their trip has also expressed support for terrorism against the nation.

It's unclear how the two will respond to Nadler but, if history is any judge, they won't be afraid of taking on a leading Democrat.

BILL MAHER FIRES BACK AT TLAIB AFTER SHE SUGGESTS A BOYCOTT OF HIS SHOW

Tlaib, Omar and the rest of their ""squad"" – which includes fellow progressive Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. – refused to back down when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized their decision to vote against a border funding package she pushed in the chamber.

Both Tlaib and Omar have caught special attention for comments described as ""anti-Semitic.""

Omar has been criticized for tweeting in 2012 that ""Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."" As a member of Congress, Omar infamously suggested that pro-Israel members of Congress are simply motivated by funding from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).

Tlaib, for her part, was criticized by House Republicans earlier in 2019 after she described the ""calming feeling"" she experienced when thinking about the Holocaust in part because, as she put it, Palestinians helped create ""a safe haven for Jews"" in the aftermath of the genocide.

TRUMP SUGGESTS DEMS' JEWISH VOTERS LACK KNOWLEDGE OF SHOW 'GREAT DISLOYALTY,' AMID OMAR-TLAIB FEUD

Omar and Tlaib were also two of just a handful of Democrats who voted against an overwhelmingly approved measure opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. When Omar countered that measure with her own resolution, she likened boycotts to those against the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.

This appeared to prompt the State Department to update its definition of anti-Semitism to include “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.”"
MLB bans playing in Venezuela amid Trump order,https://www.espn.com,"['Jeff Passan', 'Eddie Matz', 'David Schoenfield']",,,,https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/27442220/mlb-bans-playing-venezuela-amid-trump-order,"Major League Baseball has banned all affiliated players from participating in the Venezuela winter league this season, a response intended to comply with President Donald Trump's embargo against the country's Nicolas Maduro-led government.

""MLB has been in contact with the relevant government agencies regarding the Executive Order issued by President Trump on Venezuela,"" the league said in a statement. ""MLB will fully adhere to the policies implemented by our government. With respect to the Venezuela Winter League, MLB will suspend its involvement in that league until it receives direction from the relevant agencies that participation by affiliated players is consistent with the Executive Order.""

The potential repercussions of the prohibition, which prevents major league and minor league players from joining the 75-year-old Liga Venezolana de Beísbol Profesional (LVBP), could be significant. Multiple sources told ESPN they feared the ban would warp the heretofore strong bond between MLB and Venezuela and spawn a situation similar to that of Cuba, another embargoed country whose complicated relationship with the league has festered for decades.

Dozens of affiliated players either return home to Venezuela or travel there annually to play winter ball, as many supplement paltry minor league incomes with low- to mid-five-figure sums to play in a 63-game season. The LVBP, whose champion participates with those from the Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican, Cuban and Panamanian leagues in the annual Caribbean Series, is sponsored by Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the country's state-run oil company, according to sources.

The murkiness of the LVBP's link to a government-run business spurred MLB to consider the ban and consult with the Major League Baseball Players Association, according to sources. The fear, sources said, is that players agreeing to deals with a government-affiliated entity -- or agents consummating the deals -- would run afoul of the Aug. 5 executive order, which banned any such transactions.

Venezuela, once a bustling economic power in Latin America, has plunged into crisis, with widespread food and medicine shortages, millions of refugees leaving the country and toxic political infighting. The U.S. recognizes Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition, as president instead of Maduro, who remains in power.

One consequence of MLB's plan, sources said, could be Maduro retaliating by banning the league from signing amateur players in Venezuela. The country has proved to be a hotbed of talent, with Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr., Houston Astros second baseman Jose Altuve, Chicago Cubs catcher Willson Contreras and New York Yankees second baseman Gleyber Torres among the 95 Venezuela-born players who have logged major league time this season.

In recent years, as the economic strife worsened, teams shut down academies in Venezuela and consolidated their Latin American operations in the Dominican Republic. Top Venezuelan prospects have begun following suit, according to sources. Some of the best 12- and 13-year-old players in the country have moved with their families to the Dominican Republic in anticipation of signing with major league teams at age 16, sources said.

While all of the concerns about the executive order could be mollified by an agreement between the United States and Venezuela -- both countries on Thursday acknowledged recent back channel discussions -- MLB's desire to abide by it comes at a moment when the league's international dealings have been under scrutiny.

The Trump administration in April scuttled a deal between MLB and the Cuban government that would have allowed Cuban players to sign directly with the league instead of taking the circuitous and dangerous paths offered by traffickers. The Department of Justice continues a wide-ranging investigation into baseball's Latin American business -- including deals for Cuban defectors -- that sources said have targeted a number of teams, including the Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres.

MLB this week contacted the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Treasury department that imposes economic sanctions, seeking clarity on the executive order, according to a source. Teams expect to continue to sign amateur players as long as Venezuela does not prohibit it, believing that doing so would not breach the executive order because individual teenage players are not under the Venezuelan government's purview.

Whether that legal argument holds up is unclear and part of the complications caused by the embargo. While a number of major league and minor league players planned to compete in the LVBP, contracts are not typically agreed upon until September and October. With no affiliated players allowed, Luis Amaro, the general manager for the Aguilas del Zulia, said he expected Venezuela natives playing in the Mexican and Italian leagues this summer to fill out the rosters.

Until then, MLB and the MLBPA can only wait to see the consequences of the potential action. The lockdown of the Venezuelan talent pool, while not crippling, would significantly hinder the talent base in the minor leagues, where hundreds of Venezuelans play. The lack of a winter option for young players in Venezuela concerned one agent, who said LVBP helps keep players out of trouble when they return home. Another agent, who expected multiple clients to make up for below-minimum-wage minor league salaries by playing in Venezuela, said he hopes clients still can get jobs in the Dominican, Mexican or Puerto Rican leagues."

The 38 most bizarre lines from Donald Trump's wild impromptu news conference,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/trump-press-conference-best-lines/index.html,"(CNN) There's nothing President Donald Trump likes more than bantering with the media.

Witness his nearly hour-long impromptu news conference Wednesday at the White House -- all while his aides stood waiting for him to board Marine One for a speech to a veterans group in Kentucky. Trump prowled up and down the line of reporters -- bullying some, cajoling others and taking question after question after question.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

I went through the entire transcript of Trump's press conference and picked out the ""best"" lines. They're below.

1. ""But our economy is the strongest in the world, by far. Nothing even close. And a lot of good things are happening.""

2. ""I was right, and just about everybody admits that. I was right.""

Trump is talking here about the Federal Reserve but, really, he could be talking about anything in the world and he would still believe it.

3. ""[Fed Chair Jerome Powell] raised interest rates too fast, too furious.""

""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time."" -- Dominic Toretto/Vin Diesel

4. ""Oh, I have an appetite for background checks. We're going to be doing background checks.""

""Trump cools on background check push in recent lawmaker conversations"" -- CNN, August 20

5. ""But there are certain weaknesses, and we want to fix the weaknesses. And I think that'll happen. Let's see what happens.""

Trump's answer on whether background checks will be expanded should be in the vague answers Hall of Fame.

6. ""Denmark, I looked forward to going, but I thought that the Prime Minister's statement -- that it was absurd; that it was an absurd idea -- it was nasty. I thought it was an inappropriate statement. All she had to do is say, 'No, we wouldn't be interested.'""

OK, so. Trump wanted to buy Greenland, which is owned by Denmark. The Danes said no. But it was the way they said ""no"" that pissed Trump off. Everyone knows ""absurd"" is fighting words, right? RIGHT?

7. ""But all they had to do is say, 'No, we'd rather not do that,' or 'We'd rather not talk about it.' Don't say, 'What an absurd idea that is.'""

Did someone just say ""absurd""?!?!?! [Looks around for someone to fight]

8. ""I want guns to be in the hands of people that are mentally stable. And those people, I want them to easily be able to get a gun. But people that are insane, people that are sick up here [points to head], I don't want them to be able to get a gun.""

The President of the United States on guns: Sane people = good. Insane people = bad? Trump's take on gun policy is, uh, pretty rudimentary.

9. ""We're working on background checks. There are things we can do. But we already have very serious background checks. We have strong background checks. We can close up the gaps. We can do things that are very good and things that, frankly, gun owners want to have done. But we also have to remember the gun doesn't pull the trigger, a person does. And we have great mental illness.""

I dare you to figure out what Trump actually wants to do on guns from this word salad. And I know what he meant, but ""we have great mental illness"" doesn't sound all that good.

10. ""We're looking at a lot of different things relative to Antifa. Antifa, in my opinion, is a terrorist organization. You see what they've been doing. We've had great support on that. We're looking at various different things.""

""Great support"" on what, exactly?

11. ""No President has ever done anywhere close to what I've done between Golan Heights, Jerusalem, Iran -- and other things.""

He is always the first. And the best. Especially on those all-important ""other things.""

12. ""No President has done what I've done.""

FACT CHECK: True!

13. ""[Rep. Rashida Tlaib] had a plan to greatly embarrass Israel by going there with the fact that she wanted to see her grandmother. I assume that's true. I hope that's true. But it was very bad.""

In which Trump, as he so often does, questions whether the Democratic Michigan congresswoman was actually going to Israel to visit her grandmother without actually asserting that she wasn't.

14. ""In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you're being very disloyal to Jewish people and you're being very disloyal to Israel. And only weak people would say anything other than that.""

Yes, Trump is doubling down on his very controversial ""dual loyalty"" claims here. But he's also revealing what he believes to be the worst trait in a person: Being ""weak.""

15. ""I think that if you vote for a Democrat, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.""

He never, ever backs down . No matter what. He believes it to be a sign of, wait for it, weakness.

16. ""That was outsmarting Obama. So, Russia outsmarted President Obama. They took over during his term, not during mine -- Crimea.""

OK, so Russia seized Crimea from the Ukraine by force. But that was really because President Barack Obama was ... not smart? Huh!

17. ""They were taken out because Putin outsmarted -- on Crimea, on the red line, on other things -- totally outsmarted Obama. Obama was upset; they took them out.""

This is a stunning rewrite of history. Russia was removed from the G8 because they annexed land controlled by another country. They were not removed from the G8 because Obama was mad that Russian President Vladimir Putin had somehow outsmarted him.

18. ""The fake news, of which many of you are members, is trying to convince the public to have a recession. 'Let's have a recession.'""

This is obviously just Trump saying stuff. BUT: The idea that reporters are rooting for a recession, which would undoubtedly cost people their jobs in our industry and practically every other one, is patently ridiculous.

19. ""This isn't my trade war. This is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other Presidents.""

20. ""Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it.""

21. ""I was put here by people -- I was put here by people to do a great job. And that's what I'm doing. And nobody has done a job like I've done.""

A totally normal statement from the President of the United States!

22. ""The Prime Minister used a terrible word when describing something that we've been talking about for years with our country.""

[narrator voice] The word was ""absurd.""

23. ""She shouldn't treat the United States that way by saying, 'What an abs-...' She said 'absurd.' That's not the right word to use: 'absurd.'""

Look, I warned you guys about using that word! So now it's on. [Jumps into crowd like Amir Garrett taking on the entire Pirates team

24. ""We're building tremendous numbers of miles of wall right now in different locations. It all comes together likes a beautiful puzzle.""

25. ""This guy is the most biased reporter. NBC. You know, I made a lot of money for NBC with 'The Apprentice' and I used to like them, but they are the most biased.""

The person in question is NBC's White House reporter Peter Alexander. What did he say that set Trump off? ""Joe Biden's gaffes."" Yes, that's it.

26. ""I am the least racist person ever to serve in office, OK? I am the least racist person.""

The least racist person doesn't spend a ton of time talking about how they are the least racist person.

27. ""In six years, when I'm not here, The New York Times goes out of business very quickly.""

Put a pin in this. I'll take any and all bets of people willing to gamble that in 2025 The New York Times is out of business. Literally, set the line at five years from 2020. I will take the over on every bet.

28. ""There are many, many things in play. People are talking about videos. People are talking about lots of different things. But we do have a way of bringing what we already have, because we have many, many -- as you know, we have many, many people that are unable to buy guns right now. Many people are unable to buy guns.""

Trump regularly talks in circles. But when he talks about guns and the way forward on gun control(or not) he takes it to a whole other level.

29. ""And you know, we can't let that slope go so easy that we're talking about background checks, then all of a sudden we're talking about, 'Let's take everybody's gun away.'""

This is a favorite argument of the NRA but bears very little connection to reality. Making sure everyone who buys a gun has to submit to a background check isn't even on the same planet as the government coming to peoples' houses and demanding they turn their guns over. Ridiculous.

30. ""You approve one thing, then another thing, then another thing, then all of a sudden you're on that slope, and all of a sudden nobody has any legal protection.""

Donald Trump on slippery slopes. Very detailed stuff here.

31. ""We wiped out the caliphate, 100%. I did in record time.""

Was there a previous record for wiping out ISIS that I am unaware of? Also, this

32. ""I went to the hospitals. It was totally falsely reported. There were beautiful, beautiful, very sad, you know, horrible moments. But there were beautiful moments, in the sense that these people -- the families and also the people that were so badly injured that I was with -- they love our country.""

This is Trump on his hospital visit to victims of mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas. Very beautiful. Also sad. And horrible. But also beautiful.

33. ""So when I went to Dayton, and when I went to El Paso, and I went into those hospitals, the love for me -- and me, maybe, as a representative of the country -- but for me -- and my love for them was unparalleled.""

So, the big takeaway from Trump's visits to mass shooting victims was that they really loved him. Like, a lot.

34. ""The doctors were coming out of the operating rooms. There were hundreds and hundreds of people all over the floor. You couldn't even walk on it.""

So, according to the President, doctors stopped operating on patients in order to come out and meet him? OK! Very legal and very cool!

35. ""I think the Fed has been very late and very early.""

36. ""Plus, we're building large sections of the wall.""

37. ""It's only in your head. It's only anti-Semitic in your head.""

Real quote from the President of the United States.

38. ""You'll find out. ...You're going to find out."""

The failure to look at the evidence back in 2016 occurred even though the agents believed access to the sensitive evidence was “necessary” to complete the investigation into Clinton’s improper transmission of classified emails — some top secret — on her unsecure private email server, the memos show.

To make matters worse, the Trump Department of Justice (DOJ) has known about that decision since at least 2018, thanks to the work of the DOJ’s internal watchdog, Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, who provided DOJ leaders and Congress with a classified appendix explaining what happened.

But Johnson and Grassley have been unable to get answers for a year, even from Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrBarr says he has seen 'nothing' to undercut Epstein autopsy findings Prosecutors are mainly to blame for the criminal justice crisis The Hill's Morning Report - Trump hews to NRA on guns and eyes lower taxes MORE, about whether the FBI intends to look at the critical evidence it skipped back in 2016.

The Senate staff memo succinctly lays out just how egregious the FBI’s decision was in 2016.

The inspector general’s “appendix raised a number of serious questions because, as explained on page 154 of the unclassified DOJ IG report, the FBI decided not to seek access to certain highly classified information potentially relevant to the investigation despite members of the FBI case team referring to the review as a ‘necessary’ part of the investigation,” the Senate staff wrote.

ADVERTISEMENT

“As a result of the findings in that appendix, Senator Grassley wrote a classified letter to DOJ on October 17, 2018, which remains unanswered. On January 15, 2019, at Mr. Barr’s nomination hearing, Senator Grassley asked Mr. Barr if he would answer the letter, if confirmed, to which he attested, ‘Yes, Senator.’ On April 16, 2019, Senators Grassley, Johnson, and Graham sent a letter to Attorney General Barr reiterating the need for a written response to that letter.""

The DOJ’s silence on the road that the FBI willfully chose not to take is all the more deafening given what we already know about the Clinton email case.

As I previously wrote, then-FBI Director Comey’s original draft findings in the Clinton case concluded her transmission of classified emails through an unsecure server was “grossly negligent,” the legal standard supporting a felony charge under the Espionage Act.

But the findings were edited and the term changed to “extremely careless,” and Comey chose on his own to announce on July 5, 2016, that he would not seek criminal charges, a decision that the DOJ's IG concluded had wrongly usurped prosecutors’ authority to make charging decisions.

In addition, as I have written, FBI general counsel James Baker believed — almost until the last minute before Comey’s announcement — that Clinton should, in fact, face criminal prosecution, but he was talked out of it.

ADVERTISEMENT

And in a passage that often gets overlooked by reporters and pundits alike, IG Horowitz concluded in his final report about the Clinton email caper that the anti-Trump biases that FBI agent Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page expressed in text messages may have affected their decision-making to focus more urgently on the now disproven Trump-Russia collusion allegations rather than to finish work on the former secretary of state’s email problems, an investigation code-named Midyear.

“In assessing the decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead … we were particularly concerned about text messages sent by Strzok and Page that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions they made were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” the Justice's watchdog wrote.

So the FBI’s chief lawyer originally thought Clinton should be indicted, and the bureau wrote a draft supporting the felony standard, but then walked back its decision. And agents focused more on unsubstantiated Trump collusion than Clinton emails in what the IG feared might be a sign of bias.

And now we learn the FBI willfully chose to ignore highly classified evidence in the Clinton email case and has stonewalled Congress for a year on whether it intends to reexamine that evidence.

It’s exactly that sort of behavior that leaves many Americans wondering whether there are two systems of justice inside the FBI — one for the Clintons, and one for the rest of the country."
Emails show Veterans Affairs officials' scorn for 'Mar-a-Lago 3',https://www.politico.com,['Arthur Allen'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/22/digital-health-platform-mar-a-lago-members-1676335,"President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is shown in Palm Beach, Florida. Emails released from Veterans Affairs senior staff show the outsized influence of three of the club's members in the agency's planning for veteran health care. | Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo Ehealth Emails show Veterans Affairs officials' scorn for 'Mar-a-Lago 3'

Emails from senior Veterans Affairs staff released Thursday reveal the frustration and scorn they felt at having to deal with the intrusion of three wealthy members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in the agency’s plans to create a new digital health platform.

The 2017 and 2018 emails, which Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, show the outsized influence of the Mar-a-Lago members, Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, attorney Marc Sherman and internist Bruce Moskowitz.

Story Continued Below

The emails reveal how senior staff responded to what they saw as unhelpful meddling in their work. Essentially, they humored the three Trump friends while ignoring their advice, which they considered misinformed and potentially disruptive to veteran health care.

In one email, project head John Windom describes a meeting with the three as a “grin and bear it session.” Another calls them ""clearly out of their depth"" in demanding changes in the department's 2018 EHR contract with Cerner that the officials felt were unreasonable.

“Mr. Sherman does not understand the culture of VA or the federal government,” Windom said in another email with a colleague. “He appears to be a ‘big bang’ theory guy. The problem is, we must continue to deliver uninterrupted and quality care to our Veterans during the transformation within the parameters of the law and other regulations/policies.”

But a senior VA official involved in the EHR project, former Trump campaign official Camilo Sandoval, kept a list of the requests made by the three Mar-a-Lago members on a posterboard that he checked off from time to time, according to an official who worked directly with him.

The influence of the three Mar-a-Lago members was revealed by POLITICO in 2018, with additional details surfacing in FOIA documents requested by ProPublica. Congress is still investigating the group's interactions with department.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said last year that he had not spoken with any of the three since taking office. The VA on Thursday did not respond to an email inquiring into whether they are still involved in agency policymaking.

Two legal advocacy groups on Wednesday sued Wilkie for allegedly failing to preserve emails that they allege his predecessor, David Shulkin, sent from a personal account to conduct business with the Mar-a-Lago figures — activity that the suit claims was illegal.

“Despite misgivings, career VA employees were obligated to waste taxpayer time and resources to respond to the trio of Mar-a-Lago members, purely because of their connections to Trump,” the ethics group CREW said in a news release with the documents.

In one email released by CREW, a top VA official forwarded questions to another staffer that he said came from ""a POTUS friend/doctor.""

""We need to handle sensitively and with facts,"" acting Chief Information Officer Scott Blackburn said in the email. Ashwini Zenooz, a senior medical staffer on the project, responded that the requests are “just ridiculous. They don’t make sense and there is a basic lack of understanding… I’m just baffled.”

In another email, a staffer refers to Moskowitz as “the Dr from W Palm that is connected to Trump. ... He is outdated in his understanding of system but we need to be responsive here.”"

"Justice: 64% of federal arrests are noncitizens, with a 200% increase",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/justice-64-of-federal-arrests-are-non-citizens-200-increase,"Federal arrests of noncitizens have jumped over 200% in the last 20 years and now account for 64% of those arrested, according to the Justice Department.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics said that federal arrests of non-Americans rose 234% from 1998-2018. For U.S. citizens, the percentage rose just 10% over those 20 years.

The newly released statistics feed the Trump administration’s narrative that an increase in immigration, especially illegal immigration, has fed a spike in crime.

Immigration expert Jessica M. Vaughan said the increase in arrests is due to increasing prosecution of illegal entry and re-entry by migrants. ""Experience has taught the immigration agencies and DOJ that this works to reduce recidivism – in other words, when illegal crossers face some more severe consequence than just being sent back home, they don’t keep doing it,"" she explained.

Over that 20-year period, groups such as MS-13 have surged, first in urban areas and recently into rural communities, and drug and human trafficking have also increased over the U.S.-Mexico border.

Justice was very pointed in comparing U.S. citizens arrested to noncitizens. For example, it noted that while they make up just 7% of the U.S. population, noncitizens account for 15% of the arrests by federal authorities, 24% of drug arrests, 25% of federal property arrests, including 28% of all federal fraud arrests.

Also over that period, illegal immigration has surged off and on and the bureau said that immigration crimes account for the bulk of arrests. In the past, Department of Homeland Security authorities have accounted for a majority of the arrests.

“20 years, 95% of the increase in federal arrests was due to immigration crimes. From 1998 to 2018, federal immigration arrests increased 5-fold (from 20,942 to 108,667), rising more than 50,000 in one year from 2017 to 2018,” said the Justice Department.

Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, said that the statistics and types of crimes disprove claims by pro-immigration advocates that illegal immigrants aren't involved in crimes.

""Opponents of immigration enforcement are obsessed with trying to establish that illegal aliens and legal immigrants commit fewer crimes than Americans, and so, as their narrative goes, local law enforcement agencies should not cooperate with ICE and should adopt sanctuary policies. This is first of all not true, but is off-point and a dangerous conclusion. What these numbers show is that there are certain types of crime that are disproportionately associated with illegal aliens: drug trafficking, certain gang crimes, and identity theft and document fraud,"" she told Secrets."

Trump cancels student loan debt held by disabled veterans,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-cancels-student-loan-debt-held-by-disabled-veterans,"President Trump is canceling federal student loan debt held by disabled U.S. veterans.

Trump announced the new executive memorandum at a speech in front of the American Veterans organization in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday.

""I am taking executive action to ensure that our wounded warriors are not saddled with mountains of student debt,"" Trump told an audience of veterans. He is ordering the Department of Education ""to eliminate every penny of federal student loan debt owed by American veterans who are completely and permanently disabled.""

The order will aid more than 25,000 eligible veterans holding roughly $30,000 worth of student loan debt, Trump said. No federal tax will be levied against the forgiven debts, and the president is pushing each state to waive state taxes on the benefit, as well.

Congress is considering legislation toward a similar end in the Federally Requiring Earned Education-Debt Discharges for Veterans Act, or FREED Vets Act. The legislation would shift the burden of student loan debt held by disabled veterans onto American taxpayers whether or not each veteran applies for the program."
Acting DHS chief's top aide resigns amid White House tensions: report,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/458441-acting-dhs-chiefs-top-aide-resigns-amid-white-house-tensions-report,"Andrew Meehan, a top aide and spokesman to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, will reportedly leave the department amid friction between it and the White House.

""Meehan, who was in Panama in advance of the secretary's visit during the Flores rollout, made the decision to leave government a couple of weeks ago,"" a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told Axios.

The White House has also been increasingly frustrated by what it views as the botched DHS rollout of a proposal to reverse the Flores Settlement Agreement, which limits how long the government may detain minors with their parents, according to Axios, citing sources with direct knowledge.

Administration officials reportedly feel McAleenan missed an opportunity by announcing the policy shift at the Reagan Center in Washington, D.C., rather than a location that would have drawn more media attention.

""[McAleenan] could have been on all the TVs if he wanted to. But not everybody's taking live coverage from the Reagan Center at the last minute. At some point something has got to go right at DHS with their messaging and rollouts,” a senior official told Axios.

Trump himself was also irritated with coverage of raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July, specifically Breitbart and New York Times stories reporting only 35 of the 2,000 migrants targeted had been detained.

The president reportedly has no intention of nominating McAleenan for permanent DHS head and has far more positive views of acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli and acting ICE Director Mark Morgan, both of whom frequently appear on television to defend his immigration policies.

The Hill has reached out to the White House and DHS for comment."

Officials said Wednesday the decision to cancel the contract for a new ""kill vehicle"" could signal a new direction for an important aspect of missile defense.

Mark Wright, a spokesman for the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, said the Boeing contract is terminated as of Thursday. He said the decision to cancel it was ""due to technical design problems.""

The device known as a ""redesigned kill vehicle"" was to replace the existing ""kill vehicle"" used on rockets that are based mainly in Alaska to intercept intercontinental-range missiles launched from North Korea.

In May, Boeing was ordered to stop work on the project, pending a new way forward.

Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan called the cancellation worrisome in light of geopolitical circumstances.

“ Given the continued evolution of advanced adversaries’ missile capabilities and still uncertain and unpredictable nature of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, we cannot afford to wait possibly a decade for a new and still conceptual kill vehicle,” said Senator Sullivan in a press release. “I plan to dig deep into the assumptions made and details of the decision-making undertaken that led to what I hope is not this short-sighted decision.”

Justice Dept. Sent Anti-Semitic Post to Immigration Judges,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/08/22/justice-dept-sent-anti-semitic-post-to-immigration-judges/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department’s immigration arm sent judges a morning news briefing that included a blog post from a virulently anti-immigration website that also publishes work by white nationalists.

The post by VDARE featured links that directly attacked immigration judges with racially tinged slurs and a specific anti-Semitic reference about Jews and power, according to a letter sent Thursday by judges’ union president Ashley Tabbador to James McHenry, the director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Justice Department.

It was distributed to all 440 immigration judges across the country earlier this week, along with other stories from The Washington Post and Connecticut Public Radio. The inclusion of the post was first reported by BuzzFeed.

Assistant Press Secretary Kathryn Mattingly said the daily morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included.

“The Department of Justice condemns Anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,” she said.

VDARE is an anti-immigration website founded and edited by Peter Brimelow. He also operates a Connecticut-based nonprofit, VDARE Foundation, that raised nearly $4.8 million between 2007 and 2015, according to IRS filings.

Brimelow has denied his website is white nationalist but has acknowledged it publishes works by writers who fit that description “in the sense that they aim to defend the interests of American whites.” Brimelow also has spoken at conferences hosted by white nationalist groups, including Richard Spencer’s National Policy Institute and Jared Taylor’s American Renaissance online magazine.

Tabbador wrote that the union fully supports the right to free speech. “However, the publication and dissemination of a white supremacist, Anti-Semitic website … is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice.”

She asked that the post be withdrawn and an apology issued.

The issue arose as the Justice Department, which is in charge of immigration judges, is challenging their right to be represented by a labor union. It is a move the judges said was aimed at silencing criticism.

A petition recently filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority contended the union shouldn’t be allowed because the judges are management officials who help decide or shape the agency’s policies, a Justice spokesman said.

In recent months, the immigration judges’ union has spoken out against new performance quotas and rules for managing court dockets. The National Association of Immigration Judges has also called for the immigration courts to become independent of the Justice Department, where the judges are currently employees.

The Justice Department held a summit last month focused on how to combat anti-Semitism. In his keynote remarks, Attorney General William Barr said combating anti-Semitism was “an important priority” for the Justice Department and condemned what he called an “intolerable” rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes."
Congress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458352-congress-pumps-brakes-on-interior-push-to-move-bureau-of-land,"The Interior Department says it is moving ahead with plans to relocate a Washington-based agency to Colorado after getting the green light from Congress, but lawmakers say no such approval has been granted.

The Department of the Interior is preparing to move 27 top officials at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., while scattering other D.C.-based employees to existing offices out West.

The House Appropriations Committee was given 30 days to submit questions to Interior about the move and the reallocation of $5 million to cover related costs.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lawmakers had a number of questions: What are the benefits to Interior and the American public? What problem will this solve? Why was BLM singled out for this move?

The 30-day period ended on Aug. 15, and Interior says it will now proceed with plans to move about 300 employees to Western states after answering all questions from lawmakers.

But some lawmakers beg to differ.

“The administration’s characterization of Congress having ‘blessed’ BLM’s relocation plan is false,” Amanda Yanchury, spokeswoman for Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumCongress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment Clean water or mining pollution for the nation's favorite wilderness? MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Interior Department, said in a statement to The Hill.

“Interior’s initial relocation plan was significantly lacking in the details necessary for the Committee to evaluate this proposal. That’s why Congress, in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, requested more information — to ensure the transparency and accountability of the administration’s actions,” she added.

BLM argues the move will position its staff closer to the lands the agency manages, but critics contend it will simply move high-level career staff out of D.C. and further away from the corridors of power, following a similar decision to relocate Department of Agriculture (USDA) research staff to a new outpost in the Kansas City area.

“The Trump administration continues to undermine the capacity of non-partisan agencies to conduct research, collect data, and make decisions based on science, rather than ideology,” Rep. Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeCongress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Overnight Energy: Changing climate boosts Maine lobster industry -- for now | 2020 Dems debate climate response at Detroit debate | Dem asks for perjury investigation into Interior nominee Changing climate boosts Maine lobster industry — for now MORE (D-Maine), who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement to The Hill.

“As we’ve seen with affected USDA researchers, uprooting employees is this administration’s strategy for eliminating branches of government since it creates hardship and people are forced to quit,” she added. “It’s outrageous that this administration has now targeted BLM employees because the Interior Secretary— a former coal and mining lobbyist—doesn’t believe in the agency’s mission of preserving public lands.”

BLM retirees penned a letter to lawmakers on Tuesday arguing the move would “functionally dismantle” the agency. They also asked the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a hearing on the move.

About 4 percent of BLM’s 10,000 employees are based in Washington. Nearly all of them would be transferred elsewhere under Interior’s plan, leaving just 61 workers in Washington, according to a memo to Congress from Interior.

""Now that the Department of the Interior has met its commitment to provide Congress with an opportunity to review its reorganization plan for the Bureau of Land Management, we look forward to moving ahead with a thoughtfully considered and carefully developed plan that will place the BLM's leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage,” an Interior spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

""We have answered every single question asked by the Committee. No additional follow up questions were received,"" the agency said.

But details beyond what is covered by Interior’s July 16 memo have been sparse.

Lawmakers say their questions range from basic logistics like finding office space and the overall timeline to bigger picture questions like whether it is even legal to move the agency’s headquarters without congressional approval.

Those concerns were expressed in a “four corners letter” signed by majority and minority appropriations leaders in both chambers.

“It’s absurd for the administration to assume Congressional approval when the Committee has not yet received sufficient answers to outstanding questions about the plan’s feasibility, costs, legality, and personnel issues. This is clearly an attempt by the Trump administration to steamroll ahead with this plan without regard to the concerns of a co-equal branch of government,” said Yanchury, McCollum's spokeswoman.

House Appropriations Committee staffers say talks with BLM about the request are ongoing and that the congressional panels were under no obligation to meet a 30-day timeline for approving BLM’s financial plans related to the relocation effort.

Interior has brushed aside legal concerns surrounding the move and has not answered several questions about when employees will have to decide whether they will accept the reassignment and when the new headquarters in Grand Junction will be open.

William Pendley, the top official at BLM, told staff in an email obtained by The Hill that they can expect more details soon.

“During the last 30 days, we have continued to develop an implementation plan for the move while ensuring the continuity of operations across the Bureau of Land Management. This email is to let you know that more information will be forthcoming shortly,” Pendley wrote on Aug. 16. “We look forward to working with you to make the process as smooth and transparent for everyone as possible.”

Democrats also have questions over whether the move is legal.

McCollum’s office pointed to a section of federal law that says “all offices attached to the seat of government shall be exercised in the District of Columbia, and not elsewhere, except as otherwise provided by law.”

In a response to McCollum shared with The Hill, Interior noted that agencies like the Food and Drug Administration are headquartered outside D.C., in the nearby suburbs.

Interior said an office attached to the seat of government should be interpreted as “an executive department, a term defined elsewhere in the U.S. Code to include the Department of the Interior, but not its component parts.”

“The provision referenced by your staff is not a bar to making this change, which will promote greater efficiency and use of taxpayer resources,” Cole Rojewski, director of Interior’s Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, wrote to McCollum, adding that having every federal government office located in D.C. would be “impractical and unreasonable.”

Disagreement over the move is expected to spill into September as lawmakers work on appropriations for fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct 1. The House Natural Resources Committee will also hold a hearing in September to discuss the planning process behind BLM’s move.

"Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who's in charge of U.S. nukes, falls for seven-year-old Instagram hoax",https://www.salon.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/22/energy-secretary-rick-perry-whos-in-charge-of-u-s-nukes-falls-for-seven-year-old-instagram-hoax/,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday became the latest victim of an Instagram hoax that dates back years.

Perry, who is tasked with overseeing the entire American nuclear arsenal, reposted a message that falsely claimed that a new Instagram privacy policy would make all user posts, including deleted posts, public and would allow the company to “use your photos.”

Advertisement:

The message, which previously targeted Facebook users as early as 2012 and has been debunked by Snopes, also falsely claimed that users could opt out of the new policy by reposting the message.

""With this statement, I give notice to Instagram it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents,"" the post said. ""Instagram DOES NOT HAVE MY PERMISSION TO SHARE PHOTOS OR MESSAGES.”

Perry, a former ""Dancing With the Stars"" contestant, posted the message to his personal Instagram account as well as on Twitter. Other celebrities, like actresses Julia Roberts, Julianne Moore and Debra Messing and the pop singer Usher, fell for the hoax as well. But Perry was roundly mocked on social media because of his position overseeing all of America’s nuclear power plants and weapons.

""How the hell are you in charge of the department of energy when you fall for the social media version of chain email,"" one commenter wrote.

Advertisement:

""I’d like to introduce you to a Nigerian prince,” offered another commenter.

Hours after the post, Perry commented, “OMG … seriously, you mean this is fake!!”

“I’ll be darned!!” he added. “First time I’ve seen anything fake on the internet!!”

Perry finally deleted the post nearly 12 hours later and replaced it with a satirical version allowing Instagram to use his photos of dachshunds and “backstage selfies with Vanilla Ice.”

“This post I made on my phone shall stand as a legally binding document, in perpetuity throughout the universe,” the post said.

Perry is one of the few Trump administration officials who has served since the beginning of Trump’s presidency. The New York Times reported in 2017 that Perry had no idea the Energy Department was charged with overseeing the country’s nuclear arsenal and did not learn that he would be in charge of it until days after accepting the job. Perry, who studied animal husbandry at Texas A&M University, replaced Ernest Moniz, the former chairman of the MIT physics department who directed the linear accelerator at MIT’s Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Moniz’s predecessor, Steven Chu, earned a Nobel Prize in Physics.

Perry actually ran for president in 2012 on a platform of eliminating the Energy Department, though he famously forgot its name while listing off all the departments he would cut.

""The third one, I can’t,"" Perry said during a Republican primary debate in 2011. ""Sorry. Oops.""

Perry had a change of heart after being tasked with leading the agency.

“My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking,"" he told the Senate in 2017. ""In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination.”"
Feds Pull Crop Tour Staff After Threat From Farmer,https://www.newser.com,['Rob Quinn'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.newser.com/story/279467/feds-pull-crop-tour-staff-after-threat-from-farmer.html,"(Newser) – Trouble in the heartland for the Trump administration? The Department of Agriculture says it pulled all of its staff from a tour of corn and soybean fields in the Midwest after a credible threat was made against an employee. Sources tell Reuters that the threat was made in a phone call from an angry farmer. The sources say Lance Honig, crops chief of the department's National Agricultural Statistics Service, was among the staffers who had to leave the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour. Honig was due to address the tour in Nebraska City, Nebraska, Tuesday but appeared in a video interview instead, reports Bloomberg. An employee received a threat ""from someone not involved with the tour,"" NASS administrator Hubert Hamer said in a statement. ""As a precaution, we immediately pulled all our staff out of the event.""

Farmers have been hit hard by the trade dispute with China—and by a drop in commodity prices caused by larger-than-expected federal crop estimates. Planting this year was delayed by flooding and farmers expected estimates to be significantly reduced. In the interview, Honig admitted that this season has been ""horrific"" for farmers, but defended the service's methodology and stressed that the Department of Agriculture has no political bias. Illinois farmer James McCune tells Reuters that he can understand why somebody was angry enough to make threats. ""Any farmer who talked to the USDA guy who made the crop report would probably say something derogatory to him,"" McCune says. ""I don’t know anybody that agreed with that stuff.""

Federal judge approves DHS request to force feed immigrant detainee on hunger strike,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/news/458493-federal-judge-approves-dhs-request-to-force-feed-immigrant-detainee-on-hunger,"A federal judge in San Diego approved Thursday a request from the Department of Homeland Security to force-feed and hydrate an immigrant detainee on hunger strike.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reported the 41-year-old man, a Russian citizen, has not eaten since Aug. 4 and has consumed only water, though he has refused to tell officials at the ICE facility how much.

The man is also refusing any medical examination, the clinical director at the Otay Mesa Detention Center said in a declaration.

The physician indicated in federal filings that they are concerned the detainee could suffer serious health problems due to the ongoing hunger strike.

U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw approved ICE’s request to restrain the man if necessary to perform a medical examination and forcefully feed and hydrate him.

“The Court finds that Plaintiff is likely to succeed in showing that its interests in preserving life and discharging its duties to care for those in its custody outweigh any interest Defendant might have in expressing himself through a hunger strike,” she wrote in the order.

The Hill has reached out to ICE for comment.

The Daily Beast identified the man as Evgenii Ivanov. He has reportedly lost 27 pounds and refused 51 meals since his stay began.

Ivanov has been in immigration proceedings since November. His next court appearance is scheduled for the end of next month."
Editorial: Hotel California will be nightmare for Ford,https://www.detroitnews.com,"['The Detroit News', 'Published P.M. Et Aug.']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2019/08/22/editorial-hotel-california-nightmare-ford/2083428001/,"Ford Motor Co. is leading more than half of the auto industry into bed with California, rather than snuggling up to President Donald Trump and the regulatory relief he is promising them. And while the choice may deliver the stability they crave for the short term, it is bound to bring sleepless nights down the road.

Ford panicked in agreeing to strike its own deal with California on fuel economy standards, a bargain since joined by three foreign-based automakers. Worried the deeper cuts offered by the Trump administration would lead to lengthy lawsuits and harassment by environmentalists, Ford abandoned the data-driven process for establishing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets, and instead will accept what assuredly will be more arbitrary numbers from California's detached-from-reality regulators.

The irony is that Trump is giving the automakers exactly what they asked for when they sat down with him at Willow Run Airport in the winter of 2017.

All of the major car companies, including Ford, signed a letter to the president asking him to restore the promised mid-term review of mileage standards they negotiated with President Barack Obama in 2012. Obama tore up that commitment on his way out the door and declared the original standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2024 set in stone.

President Donald Trump speaks with reporters on the South Lawn, Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2019, in Washington. A day after considering cutting taxes to promote economic growth, Trump changed course and said he would abandon the idea, “We don’t need it. We have a strong economy.” (Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP)

The mid-term review was supposed to examine such things as technology, market conditions, consumer attitudes, impact on employment and profits, safety and other factors to determine whether the CAFE demand was attainable. The number was pulled from thin air by Obama's regulators, without regard to whether it could be achieved.

Despite the spin from environmentalists and much of the media, the automakers never asked Trump to roll back the standard, but simply to give them what they were promised: a data-driven review.

The administration complied, and appears to be moving toward a sharply lower target of roughly 37 mpg. It's a standard automakers can meet without abandoning their highly profitable pickups and sport utility vehicles, and without trying to force an artificial market for the electric vehicles that California demands, but consumers don't want.

But Ford and the other automakers worried California would march into court the minute the new standards were issued and assert its right under a 2006 law to draft its own regulations, setting up a dual automotive market. They also worried environmentalists would declare war on them, which, by the way, will happen one way or the other.

So in the name of attaining regulatory certainty, they struck a deal with California.

In doing so, they are abandoning a regulatory regime based on technological and market data, and accepting California's arbitrary process designed to bolster the state's green agenda. It would seem Ford and the others have given themselves up to their worst nightmare of having California as their defacto regulator.

General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and the remaining automakers have yet to decide whether they'll join the California bargain.

They should stick with the federal rulemaking, and let the fight be about the data.

Trump was not far off when he warned, ""Car companies should know that when this administration's alternative is no longer available, California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin.""

Empowering California is dangerous and will lead to automotive products that have no connection to market demand, and thus slumping sales and job losses.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised Denmark as a cooperative ally following a phone call with his Danish counterpart.

Pompeo held the call with Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod Wednesday to discuss President Donald Trump's canceled state visit to the country, which had been scheduled to take place in early September.

""The Secretary expressed appreciation for Denmark's cooperation as one of the United States' allies and Denmark's contributions to address shared global security priorities,"" U.S. Department of State spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""The Secretary and Foreign Minister Kofod also discussed strengthening cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark — including Greenland — in the Arctic.""

Denmark's Kofod said Wednesday that the conversation had been ""frank, friendly and constructive"" and affirmed the two nations' strong bond.

""(The) U.S. and Denmark are close friends and allies with a long history of active engagement across (the) globe,"" he said on Twitter. ""(We) agreed to stay in touch on full range of issues of mutual interest.""

Trump surprised Danish officials on Tuesday when he took to Twitter to announce he would no longer go to Denmark next month, with the president later dubbing Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ""nasty"" for her response to his idea that the U.S. could purchase Greenland. On Sunday, Frederiksen said Trump's suggestion of purchasing the territory was ""absurd,"" telling Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper that ""Greenland is not for sale.""

Greenland is a massive island and autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The land mass is considered to be rich with coal, zinc, copper and iron ore.

Trump said Tuesday that he would reschedule his visit to Denmark ""for another time."""
Veteran's widow speaks out after former VA doctor charged in 3 deaths,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Omar Villafranca'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/veterans-affairs-pathologist-charged-robert-levy-involuntary-manslaughter-widow-speaks-out-today-2019-08-21/,"Fayetteville, Arkansas — The indictment of a former doctor at a VA hospital in Arkansas is sending shock waves through the nation's largest health care system. Dr. Robert Morris Levy, 53, is accused of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients — and he could be responsible for the deaths of at least a dozen others.

Kathy McCoy's husband, Michael, died late last year. He was a proud grandfather of 10 and a retired Army sergeant. In 2014, he went to an Arkansas VA complaining of pain in his leg.

""He was in constant pain. It got to where at the end he couldn't walk … he would crawl a lot,"" McCoy told CBS News. ""They kept saying it was arthritis.""

She said it ended up being a blood clot in the leg.

McCoy's case is one of thousands under review after VA pathologist Robert Levy was accused of manslaughter in the deaths of at least three veterans by misdiagnosis or falsifying their diagnoses.

Kathy McCoy CBS News

""We looked at the most serious cases and the cases that were the most prosecutable and those are the three cases that we feel confident that we can take into court and get a conviction,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said.

Levy was chief pathologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center of the Ozarks for more than a decade, but he was fired last year after he was accused of working while drunk.

The federal indictment accuses him of practicing while intoxicated by drinking a potent form of alcohol called 2-methyl-2-butanol — or 2M2B — a form of alcohol that can't be detected in a common drug and alcohol test.

Levy can be seen in police bodycam footage said to be from a 2018 DUI stop. It was released by a law firm representing some of his alleged victims.

Robert Levy Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

An 18-month VA investigation into more than 30,000 cases under Levy's supervision found 3,029 showed errors or misdiagnoses, and concluded they may have led to at least 15 deaths, some from cancer.

McCoy explained that her husband felt like he trusted a system that ultimately failed him.



""I think there, at the end, he knew they had failed him,"" she said.

McCoy is buried here at the Fort Smith National Cemetery. But his family wonders if a proper diagnosis could have saved his life. In a statement, Levy said he's innocent and will defend himself vigorously.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
"DHS moves to end limits on detention of migrant families, close 'loophole'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-detention-migrant-families,"The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would move to scrap a major court agreement in order to allow for migrant families to be detained longer as their cases are being considered, instead of having to release them after 20 days.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, in a press conference detailing the decision, claimed that the long-standing court order known as the Flores agreement has incentivized illegal immigration and represents a ""loophole"" in the immigration system.

That agreement prohibited children from being kept in detention for more than 20 days. As a result, officials were releasing entire families to keep them from being separated -- though last year, the administration did separate families as part of a ""zero tolerance"" program that eventually was stopped amid a bipartisan outcry.

BORDER PATROL NABS NEARLY 200 CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS NEAR NEW MEXICO PORT OF ENTRY

""Today, the government has issued a critical rule that will permit the Department of Homeland Security to appropriately hold families together and improve the integrity of the immigration system,” McAleenan said. “This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress and ensures that all children in U.S. government custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.”

The Flores ruling came about as a result of a 1980s case in which a girl named Jenny Flores, then 15, was detained with adults by U.S. authorities after she fled El Salvador. Beginning in 1997, the Flores settlement called for migrant children to be sent to care programs after 20 days, and be given access to medical treatment and visits with relatives. McAleenan said the new rule takes the place of Flores, while keeping many of its terms.

The new rule is slated to go into effect in 60 days, though the change is sure to face a new court challenge.

In July, at a House Oversight Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., accused McAleenan and other administration officials of seeking to scrap the Flores Settlement, with the alleged goal ""to keep kids longer"" in custody.

McAleenan pushed back against that characterization. He explained that he wanted to keep families together for the time necessary it takes for immigration proceedings to go through, and for the justice system to make a ruling on the case.

“We want to keep families together through an immigration proceeding that's fair and expeditious in an appropriate setting,” he said. “That can't be done in 20 days with due process.""

Democrats have slammed the detentions as “inhumane."" When the new rule was announced, the ACLU called it ""another cruel attack on children,"" by allowing them to be held for longer than previously allowed.

""The government should NOT be jailing kids, and certainly shouldn’t be seeking to put more kids in jail for longer,"" they said.

Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro vowed to end all detention if he wins the presidency.

""Separating migrant children from their parents is appalling—but indefinitely detaining families isn’t a better alternative,"" he tweeted after McAleenan's announcement.

Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have claimed that the current system has resulted in children being used, repeatedly, by adults posing as family members to get into the U.S.

“This is a sick system, it’s rotten to its core,” Graham told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo in July, stating that 30 percent of those who cross into the U.S. with children are “fake families,” and that loopholes are used to let the same children come back over and over, bringing different adults with them.

McAleenan said approximately 6,000 migrants fraudulently presented themselves as families in the past fiscal year.

""No child should be a pawn in a scheme to manipulate our immigration system,"" he said.

In addition to putting an end to the 20-day limit, the plans announced Wednesday also set standards for detention facilities, which have been criticized by members of both parties for not having sufficient resources to keep people in proper living conditions.

""The new rule establishes a high national standard for care of children and families in custody,"" McAleenan said, noting that maintaining proper standards of care is a ""core"" element of the new rule.

"Dozens of Nigerian scammers indicted in email, romance schemes targeting elderly people",https://www.kcrg.com,['Stefanie Dazio Associated Press'],,,,https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Dozens-of-Nigerian-scammers-arrested-in-email-romance-schemes-targeting-elderly-people-557891301.html,"The relationship between a Japanese woman and a U.S. Army captain stationed in Syria started online, through an international social network for digital pen pals. It grew into an internet romance over 10 months of daily emails.

It ended with the woman $200,000 poorer and on the verge of bankruptcy after borrowing money from her sister, ex-husband and friends to help Capt. Terry Garcia with his plan to smuggle diamonds out of Syria.

In reality, there were no diamonds and there was no Garcia — they were part of an elaborate scam hatched by an international ring of cyber thieves operating mainly out of Los Angeles and Nigeria.

Federal authorities cited the case of the Japanese woman, known only as ""F.K."" in court papers, on Thursday when they announced an indictment charging 80 people with stealing at least $46 million through various schemes that targeted businesses, the elderly and anyone susceptible to a romance scam. Most of the defendants are Nigerians.

""We believe this is one of the largest cases of its kind in U.S. history,"" U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna told a news conference. ""We are taking a major step to disrupt these criminal networks.""

The investigation began in 2016 with a single bank account and one victim, said Paul Delacourt, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles office. It grew to encompass victims who were targeted in the U.S. and around the world, some of whom like the Japanese woman lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.

""F.K. was and is extremely depressed and angry about these losses,"" the federal complaint states. ""She began crying when discussing the way that these losses have affected her.""

Her relationship began innocently in March 2016 with an email but soon ""Garcia"" made ""romantic overtures,"" according to federal authorities. He told her they couldn't talk by phone because he wasn't allowed to use one in Syria.

So a stream of emails went back and worth, with her using Google to translate his English into her Japanese. A month into the relationship, Garcia told her he'd found a bag of diamonds in Syria and he began introducing her to his associates, starting with a Red Cross representative who told her Garcia had been injured but had given him the box.

F.K. ultimately made 35 to 40 payments, receiving as many as 10 to 15 emails a day directing her to send money to accounts in the U.S., Turkey and the United Kingdom through the captain's many purported associates.

The fraudsters even threatened her with arrest if she did not continue to pay and at one point she traveled to Los Angeles because she was told a Russian bank manager had embezzled more than $33,000 of her funds.

Authorities arrested 14 defendants Thursday, mostly in the Los Angeles area. FBI agents could be seen processing suspects in a downtown Los Angeles parking lot before they were arraigned in federal court. It was not immediately known if they had attorneys who could speak on their behalf.

Two suspects were previously in custody and a few others were arrested earlier this week. Hanna said he hoped to be able to work with foreign governments to extradite the remaining defendants.

They all face charges of conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to launder money, and aggravated identity theft, and some are charged with additional offenses for alleged fraud and money laundering.

"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."
Defense Department Official Stresses CBD Ban For Military Members,https://www.marijuanamoment.net,['Kyle Jaeger'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/defense-department-official-stresses-cbd-ban-for-military-members/,"A Department of Defense (DOD) official is reiterating that military service members are barred from using CBD products despite the legalization of hemp and its derivatives under the 2018 Farm Bill.

Patricia Deuster, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at the federal government-run Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, said in a call with reporters this week that the non-intoxicating compound is “completely forbidden for use by any service member in any of the services at this point of time.”

While CBD products are widely available—in grocery stores, gas stations and online—the lack of regulations for these items from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) creates uncertainty about levels of THC in the preparations. And military members who test positive for THC can be punished with an other-than-honorable discharge and the potential loss of other benefits.

“It’s a real conundrum, and it’s going to be a major issue for the military because it is available [nearly everywhere],” Deuster said, according to Military.com, which first reported her remarks. “You go into any store, and you can find gummy bears with a supplement fact panel on it.”

Though the Tuesday press call simply provided clarity on existing military CBD policy, it represents the latest example of DOD interest in preventing the use of cannabis among service members.

The Navy released a notice earlier this month stipulating that “all hemp and CBD products are strictly prohibited for use by Sailors” no matter the legal status. And the Coast Guard said its members aren’t even allowed to visit marijuana shops or use online or delivery cannabis services, according to an order released last month.

That order didn’t specify policy around hemp-derived CBD, but a Coast Guard official told Mililtary.com that if members “have a desire to use a product that may or may not fall into the definition of what’s prohibited, they should seek guidance or use caution.”

Last year, the Air Force wrote in a post that “consumption [of marijuana] is not permitted in any fashion, period.” It emphasized the need to take caution as more states legalize, with one risk factor being your “friend’s grandma’s miracle sticky buns” that “might look mighty tasty and get rave reviews at the big shindig,” but could contain THC.

In a memo released in April, the Air Force said that “Airmen are advised against using CBD products” and could face disciplinary action if they use CBD that isn’t the FDA-approved drug Epidiolex.

The Army issued a similar notice in November 2016 that stated service members may not use marijuana, hemp or hemp oil.

Though not a military branch, NASA also sent a warning to its workforce this month that the unregulated nature of CBD products means employees could inadvertently consume THC that could get them fired.

“The problem is there is no regulatory framework to ensure that the CBD products being sold meet the Farm Act,” Deuster said on the call this week. “[CBD] is everywhere. We are waiting for the FDA to do something,”

She added that service members shouldn’t “believe what [the companies] are telling you” about the benefits of CBD.

Former VA pathologist charged in deaths of 3 veterans,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-robert-levy-former-va-pathologist-charged-in-deaths-of-3-veterans/,"Little Rock, Arkansas — A pathologist fired from an Arkansas veterans hospital after officials said he had been impaired while on duty was charged Tuesday with involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients. Authorities say he misdiagnosed them and altered their records to try to conceal his mistakes.

A grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday charged Dr. Robert Morris Levy in the patients' deaths and on multiple charges of fraud and making false statements for his alleged attempts to conceal his substance abuse and incorrect diagnoses.

""In doing so, he was allowed to stay employed with the Veterans Administration, thus earning a salary, benefits and possibly a bonus,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said at a news conference in Fayetteville, referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs by its former name.

Levy, 53, who worked at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville, was paid an annual salary of $225,000, according to the indictment. He was fired from the hospital in April 2018.

In this Aug. 17, 2019, file photo provided by the Washington County, Arkansas Sheriff's Department, Robert Levy is pictured in a booking photo. Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

VA officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005. Levy has acknowledged that he once showed up to work at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks drunk in 2016, but he denied that he had worked while impaired. He entered an in-patient treatment program following that incident and returned to work in October 2016 after agreeing to remain sober and submitting to random drug testing.

Levy, who was being held at the Washington County jail, pleaded not guilty at a hearing Tuesday. Kees said that as of Tuesday morning, Levy had not obtained counsel to represent him in the case.

In the deaths, Levy is accused of falsifying entries in his patients' records after making incorrect and misleading diagnoses. In one case, a patient died of prostate cancer after Levy determined that his biopsy showed he didn't have cancer, prosecutors allege.

Prosecutors say a second patient died of squamous cell carcinoma after Levy misdiagnosed the patient with another form of carcinoma. In a third case, the indictment says, a patient with small cell carcinoma was treated for a type of cancer he didn't have following an incorrect diagnosis by Levy, and died.

In two cases, he's accused of falsifying patients' medical records to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis.

Prosecutors say Levy received bonuses in 2016 and 2017 that were based in part on him reporting that his clinical errors were less than 5%. But, according the indictment, almost 10% of the diagnoses he made had clinical errors.

""These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,"" VA Inspector General Michael Missal said.

Levy ingested 2-methyl-2-butanol, a chemical that would intoxicate him but that standard drug and alcohol screenings don't test for, according to the indictment. Levy is accused of lying to hospital officials when he told them he wasn't under the influence of any intoxicants. Levy is charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud for his purchase of the chemical.

U.S. Attorney Kees said at a news conference Levy ""had the medical expertise, the knowledge, the skill set and the equipment to know exactly how much of this substance to take. He had the equipment to measure it out precisely, and he had the knowledge to know how to ingest it so it wouldn't be fatal.""

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) said that ingesting between 18 and 27 grams of the chemical can produce signs of intoxication and cause unconsciousness after only 30 minutes, according to CBS Fort Smith, Arkansas, affiliate KFSM-TV. The NCBI also reportedly said that the effects can persist until the next day, and can include daylong sleeping and weeks of recovery.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
Trump Finds Unlikely Ally in Greenland Aspirations: Iran,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-08-22/trump-finds-unlikely-ally-in-greenland-aspirations-iran,"President Donald Trump faced almost universal opposition this week to his idea of purchasing Greenland from Denmark, though an unlikely ally emerged Thursday acknowledging the move would align with the commander in chief's perceived doctrine.

Iranian state news service Fars published an analysis Thursday afternoon detailing news this week that the president wishes to purchase the island governed by Denmark that straddles the Arctic Circle and where the U.S. maintains a key military base. It described Trump as ""unconventional and seemingly obsessed with reasserting U.S. hegemony"" but acknowledged the Arctic as a geopolitically critical region, currently contested by other powers like Russia and China.

""This scenario makes the island of Greenland, freezing and home to only 50,000 inhabitants, an extremely strategic location,"" Fars noted. ""Thus the idea that Trump aspires to acquire the island for the United States and militarize it accordingly is by no means unreasonable in his strategic calculus, even if the idea is a non-starter.""

Trump announced by Twitter earlier this week he was canceling a planned trip to Denmark in early September, later explaining he took issue with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's dismissal of his apparent bid. Trump on Wednesday called Fredericksen "" nasty "" for her comments. He also lamented via Twitter that Denmark does not spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense – a goal NATO countries in 2014 agreed they would each achieve by 2024.

In its analysis, Fars noted of Greenland, ""Denmark on its own does not have the resources or capabilities to make it useful on behalf of NATO, which is why Trump likely hit out at them over military spending.""

Remaining on message with the regime's central talking points, it concluded that Iran should take seriously the White House's pursuit of Greenland as a part of what it considers U.S. efforts to ""to maintain worldwide military supremacy.""

""American history is defined almost solely by territorial expansion for strategic ends. It may have fallen dormant, but Trump has very much rekindled an old flame for strategic ends. This illustrates as a whole just how far this administration is willing to go to reassert unilateral hegemony over the world – even if that means disappointing old allies.""

Many have expressed grave concern in recent days about Trump's intentions regarding a potential sale. Reactions from senior officials and lawmakers in Copenhagen have varied from calling the situation a "" laughing stock "" to a "" diplomatic crisis ."" Multiple officials from the Obama administration have spoken out about the importance of U.S. relations with Denmark – a founding member of NATO – calling it one of America's most important allies ."
USDA Begs Americans to Finally Stop Washing Their Chicken,https://www.inverse.com,[],,,,https://www.inverse.com/article/58691-do-not-wash-chicken-poultry,"Raw chicken, with its slightly slimy sheen, doesn’t look clean enough to eat. That doesn’t mean that you should wash it with water, though. While it’s common practice for some — and even the legendary chef Julia Child washed her poultry — scientists consistently agree that rinsing chicken is dangerous.

A report from the US Department of Agriculture released on Tuesday is the latest in a long line of research to link poultry washing to an increased risk of becoming ill. That’s because raw chicken is often contaminated with Campylobacter bacteria, as well as Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens bacteria. Cooking chicken at 165 degrees Fahrenheit is all you need to destroy these bacteria and make the meal safe to consume.

Meanwhile, washing chicken easily spreads the bacteria to other surfaces and foods, increasing the likelihood of an unsuspecting encounter that causes people to become sick.

Want to know why you shouldn’t wash chicken? Watch where the germs go in this new CDC video. #FoodSafety https://t.co/TsOrI1FpGj pic.twitter.com/qkJOptArGT — CDC (@CDCgov) August 20, 2019

This investigation was a partnership between the USDA and North Carolina State University. Overall, 300 people were asked to prepare a chicken and a salad in a test kitchen located in either the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina or in Lillington, North Carolina. All participants self-reported that they had some experience washing or rinsing raw chicken at home. Their reasons for washing included the intention to “remove blood/slime” or “because that is how a family member does it.”

These participants were broken up into two groups — one that was told before the cooking experience that washing their poultry was dangerous, and one that was not. When they started cooking, 93 percent of the first group did not end up washing their chicken, while 61 percent of the second group did.

Overall, preparing raw chicken close to a salad created a potentially dangerous scenario. Twenty-six participants who washed their chicken accidentally transferred the chicken’s bacteria to their salad lettuce. But even when people didn’t wash their chicken, 31 percent still ended up with salad that was contaminated with chicken bacteria. This cross-contamination is chalked up to “a lack of effective handwashing and contamination of the sink utensils.”

“Please keep in mind that children, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk,” explains Administrator Carmen Rottenberg of USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. “Washing or rinsing raw meat and poultry can increase your risk as bacteria spreads around your kitchen, but not washing your hands for 20 seconds immediately after handling those raw foods is just as dangerous.”

The investigators also found that 60 percent of the sinks and counters in the test kitchens used by the chicken-washers were contaminated with bacteria as well. Furthermore, 14 percent of these surfaces remained contaminated even after they were cleaned.

Luckily, no one ate any of the food prepared in the test kitchen.

The report additionally notes that, while it’s popular to brine poultry in salt water, vinegar, or lemon juice, that practice only flavors the chicken. It does not destroy bacteria, and that bacteria, in turn, contributes to millions of cases of foodborne illnesses that strike Americans each year.

If you really want to get the slime off your chicken, the best thing to do is to pat the area down with a paper towel and wash your hands as soon as possible."
Justice Department inspector general reportedly completes FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-inspector-general-reportedly-completes-fisa-abuse-investigation,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has reportedly completed his investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses by the Justice Department and FBI.

The Hill's John Solomon made the announcement Thursday evening on Fox News.

""What I can report tonight, Sean, is that the IG has completed his work on the FISA abuse report. It's expected to be transmitted as early as next week to Attorney General William Barr and that will begin a process of declassification,"" the investigative reporter told host Sean Hannity.

""I think we are still on track for that timeline, I've been saying on your show: mid-September to early October seems the most likely release point,"" Solomon said. ""It's going to be a tough report,"" he added.

The timeline for Horowitz's investigation, which began in March 2018, has repeatedly shifted over the past few months because of various developments.

Horowitz's team is examining the FISA application and three renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by Democrats.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors, which included Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications, and they have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Meanwhile, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review of the origins of the Russia investigation, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work. Over the past few days, the South Carolina Republican has said he expects Horowitz's findings to be ""damning and ugly"" for the DOJ. Graham also said he plans to meet with Barr this week to ""talk to him about how best to tell the story"" and predicted that after his report is released Horowitz will deliver ""chilling testimony"" in front of his panel."
Why does Kevin Moley still have a job at the State Department?,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Daniel W. Drezner', 'Daniel W. Drezner Is A Professor Of International Politics At The Fletcher School Of Law', 'Diplomacy At Tufts University', 'A Regular Contributor To', 'August At Am']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/22/why-does-kevin-moley-still-have-job-state-department/,"Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything

The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has been highly critical of how the Trump administration has treated the State Department. Morale was awful under Rex Tillerson and has barely improved under successor Mike Pompeo. The situation was so bad in 2017 that even Trump appointees publicly acknowledged the morale problem. In 2019, Foreign Service officers keep leaving the administration, writing Washington Post op-eds to explain: “More and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home. … I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration.”

Still, perhaps Pompeo means what he says about returning the swagger to the State Department. Susan Glasser’s recent New Yorker profile of him was not terribly flattering but acknowledged that morale had improved somewhat. In a recent interview with the Washington Examiner, Pompeo pledged: “I want to make the State Department a place where people want to come serve. I always think when you’re responsible for a team that one of the things you can do that outlasts your time and service is that you can create a culture and an environment where the best and brightest from all across America want to come be [a] part of that team.”

Furthermore, Pompeo has taken action when his subordinates behave badly. Earlier this month, Pompeo fired policy planning director Kiron Skinner for her “abusive” management style. According to Politico’s Eliana Johnson and Nahal Toosi, “State Department officials said Skinner acted unprofessionally in multiple ways, including yelling in public spaces and using homophobic language.” This secretary of state is unafraid to take tough actions to eliminate bad eggs, even when such actions threaten his pet projects.

That leads me to the question animating today’s column and directed at Pompeo: Why does Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley still have a job?

Some background: Fourteen months ago, Foreign Policy’s Colum Lynch and Robbie Gramer broke a story alleging that Mari Stull, a political appointee in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs (IO), was vetting the political affiliation and views of career employees. This would violate the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, as well as the guidelines laid out in the Foreign Affairs Manual. Stull worked for and was appointed by Moley, the assistant secretary of state for IO. In response to the article, the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) opened an investigation into the matter.

OIG published its findings last week in a 30-page report that incriminates both Stull and Moley. Some of the highlights:

“Throughout its review of the IO Bureau, OIG found that the leadership of IO failed to meet the Department’s Leadership and Management Principles. Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff. Then-Under Secretary Shannon told OIG that IO employees had described to him a negative and ‘vindictive’ environment in IO cultivated by Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull.”

“Several current and former IO employees reported that Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff. Senior Department officials outside of IO were particularly concerned about such treatment directed at more junior employees.”

“Other employees reported that they were reprimanded by Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull for following established Department policies and procedures.”

“Assistant Secretary Moley criticized employees when they told him that official travel that he planned in May 2018 did not qualify for first class accommodations under the Department’s travel policies and accused them of ‘not fighting hard enough’ to meet his demands.”

There’s plenty more, but those excerpts provide the general idea.

There are two other points worth noting. The first is that the problems were severe enough for acting director general for the Foreign Service William Todd, undersecretary for political affairs Thomas Shannon, Shannon’s successor Stephen Mull and deputy secretary John Sullivan to meet with Moley at various points to discuss Stull’s bad behavior, as well as sagging morale at IO.

The second is that Moley’s mismanagement of the situation led to an exodus of IO staff. As the OIG report says, “Approximately 50 of 300 domestic IO employees have departed IO since Assistant Secretary Moley took over its leadership, and nearly all of the former employees who OIG interviewed stated that poor leadership of the bureau contributed to their decision to depart.”

OIG recommended disciplinary action for Moley. (Stull left the State Department in January.) The State Department responded by saying that Moley “has been counseled by Department leaders on appropriate leadership and management of the bureau. Further discipline will be considered following OIG’s assessment of [Moley’s] response to the draft OIG report.” Moley’s response is included in the final OIG report, and it’s pretty laughable. Moley tries to pin most of the blame on Stull. But his denials contradict what Sullivan and Shannon told OIG and other facts OIG discovered.

Given Moley’s fact-challenged response, those who care about U.S. diplomacy — which presumably includes Pompeo — should hope he is gone soon. The day after the OIG report was released, Politico’s Toosi reported widespread frustration that Moley still had a job, especially given that Pompeo fired Skinner for similar transgressions: “If Moley isn’t fired, it sets a bad precedent for holding anyone else accountable, current and former staffers argued. ‘It’s offensive that [Moley] is collecting a taxpayer-funded paycheck today,’ one staffer said.”

The Los Angeles Times’s Tracy Wilkinson reported that “morale is sinking” at the State Department and that further resignations from Foreign Service officers are pending. Keeping Moley around despite documented examples of horrible management seems like a surefire way for Pompeo to contradict his pledge to “make the State Department a place where people want to come serve.”

Pompeo’s principal calling card as secretary of state has been his willingness to make the Faustian bargain of staying in President Trump’s good graces. It would be nice if he showed that he cared as much about the workplace culture of his employees as he does about the whims of the president. What happens to Moley will be an interesting test of whether Pompeo means what he says."
GOP Oversight report says Interior head met with group tied to former clients,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458474-republican-oversight-report-shows-interior-head-met-with-groups,"Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee released a report Thursday examining Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s calendar and alleged conflicts of interest in an effort to counter an ongoing investigation by Democrats.

But the report appears to confirm Bernhardt met with a group he recused himself from dealing with as part of his ethics pledge.

Democrats on the Oversight Committee have yet to release a report, but Republicans launched their own probe after they said Democrats launched an investigation without consulting them and issued an “unprecedented and overbroad initial document request.”

Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for a number of oil and gas companies, has been under fire from Democrats and environmental groups since joining the Trump administration as deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior (DOI). Democrats argue his background leaves him with a wealth of conflicts of interest, and have accused him of violating public records laws with how he

manages his calendar

.

The GOP report lists a number of findings, the majority of which state that, “contrary to allegations,” Bernhardt is not mismanaging his calendar, obfuscating meetings or violating ethics laws. Republicans instead accused Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsNikki Haley voices 'complete support' for Pence House committee heads demand Coast Guard Academy explain handling of harassment allegations Can the Democrats unseat Trump? MORE (D-Md.) and House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) of using “cherry-picked information to create a false impression"" about transparency at Interior.

“This interim staff report sets the record straight about the allegations levied against Bernhardt and DOI. The record is clear that contrary to public allegations of wrongdoing, DOI and Bernhardt have acted appropriately and ethically in maintaining and preserving the Secretary’s calendar records, as well as making them publicly available,” the GOP report said.

But Bernhardt's critics say the report shows he took meetings with former clients.

One part of the report aims to dissect a meeting of interest to Democrats involving Bernhardt and nine oil and gas companies.

That included the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA), a division of the U.S. Oil and Gas Association (USOGA).

“LMOGA appears to have an association to an entity on Bernhardt’s recusal list, U.S. Oil and Gas Association, but it does not appear that this association would require a recusal in all circumstances,” the report said.

Aaron Weiss with the Center for Western Priorities, which has criticized Bernhardt’s ethics record, said the secretary should not meet with a division of a group on his recusal list.

“They don’t ‘appear to have an affiliation’ — they are part of USOGA,” Weiss said. “They are on Bernhardt's recusal list.”

A spokesperson for Interior said another oil company, Statoil, did not attend the meeting because of advice from Interior ethics officials.

""Secretary Bernhardt is and always has been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he takes his ethics pledge very seriously. He seeks advice from career ethics officials before taking any meeting involving external parties and strictly follows their advice and guidance,"" a spokesman for the agency told The Hill.

The Hill has reached out to Oversight Republicans for further comment on the LMOGA meeting.

Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee did not respond to request for comment, but Oversight Democrats say the report from their Republican colleagues left many questions unanswered.

“The Republican Staff Report provides cover for the Trump Administration’s secrecy. The Committee still has unanswered questions about who Secretary David Bernhardt met with, when, and why. The Committee is also concerned about how the Department maintains records of Secretary Bernhardt’s meetings, as well as its compliance with FOIA, which remains a serious problem,” Cummings said in a statement to The Hill.

Interior has been under fire for a number of actions critics say make the department less transparent, from a public records policy that would give political hires more influence over what documents are released to leaving controversial meetings off of Bernhardt’s public calendar.

Interior previously outlined how meeting requests would be vetted by ethics officials before being added to the schedule on a Google document. Some meetings were added to the public calendar, but others were placed on “daily cards” used to outline Bernhardt’s schedule.

“Bernhardt’s calendars are not created to be public documents, but instead used as an internal method of allocating his time,” the report said.

House Democrats have questioned whether the method violates public record-keeping laws, but Interior said an outside review found the process did not result is destruction of federal records.

""We are pleased the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) found the Department of the Interior to be in full compliance with records management laws. We appreciate their thorough and professional review in response to Congressional inquiries,” Interior told The Hill in July.

The GOP report includes high praise for Bernhardt, saying he “is improving the ‘anemic’ ethics environment of the Obama administration” and repeatedly lists witness testimony saying Bernhardt has not violated ethics or public record keeping laws.

Weiss said the report cherry-picks interviews and hopes that all of them will be released publicly.

“This is truly a ridiculous document that reads like it was written by Bernhardt himself,” he said.

(Photo by Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public Media)

Protesters stood outside the Dena’ina Center Tuesday. Inside, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency addressed a luncheon sponsored by the Resource Development Council. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler spoke of easing regulations on industry. He talked about hot-button issues, like narrowing the definition of wetlands and chemical pollutants in drinking water.

He didn’t say a word about the hottest Alaska conflict facing the EPA: the proposed Pebble Mine, the project that draws protesters to nearly every relevant forum.

For over a decade, Bristol Bay fishing communities have been campaigning against the proposed gold and copper mine, though some Alaskans, including villagers closer to site, say they’d welcome the jobs.

In the latest turn on Pebble, the publication E&E News reported last week that political staffers at EPA headquarters watered down the concerns raised by scientists in the regional EPA office about the adequacy of the environmental review of the proposal.

The EPA is in a powerful position. It has the right to veto Pebble’s application, even if the Corps of Engineers wants to greenlight the mine.

But the head of the EPA says the decision won’t be his. Wheeler used to work at a law firm hired by Pebble, so he needs to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

“So far, you all are the first people to have raised Pebble to me,” he told reporters at the Dena’ina Center. “But if people do raise it, I just explain that under my ethics recusal with the agency, which I abide by, I can’t discuss Pebble mine.”

How the EPA decides whether to exercise its veto power is something mine developers and opponents are watching closely.

Wheeler left the decision to the EPA’s top lawyer, who Wheeler says is working with the agency’s Region 10 administrator, Chris Hladick. Hladick is an Alaskan who has worked in commercial fishing towns. Mine opponents worry he, and the scientists at Region 10, will be steamrolled.

Hladick says a team of 40 staffers worked on the document reviewing the Pebble environmental impact statement, and he says nothing out of the ordinary occurred.

“Anything that you do at the EPA comes with consensus of headquarters,” he said.

Region 10 was still able to produce a long document finding fault with the environmental statement on the mine.

“Yeah, 170 pages of comments,” Hladick said. “They’re pretty substantial.”

EPA’s critique hit home with at least one key player: Sen. Lisa Murkowski says the document Region 10 issued has her doubting that the environmental review of Pebble’s plan has been sufficiently rigorous.

“This is substantive,” she said of the criticism. “This is considerable. And it needs to be addressed. And if it can’t be addressed, there shouldn’t be a permit that issues.”

Wheeler was supposed to speak Wednesday at the Kenai Classic Roundtable in Soldotna but a spokesman said he had to cancel due to fire-related transportation concerns."
"Former VA doctor, who reportedly was impaired on duty charged with involuntary manslaughter, prosecutors say",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Paulina Dedaj', 'Paulina Dedaj Is A Writer', 'Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-va-doctor-who-was-impaired-while-on-duty-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-prosecuters-say,"A former Veteran’s Affairs doctor in Arkansas, who was reportedly caught under the influence of an intoxicating substance, was charged Tuesday with three counts of involuntary manslaughter after prosecutors say he misdiagnosed three patients -- eventually leading to their deaths.

Robert Morris Levy was charged in the deaths of three patients after a year-long investigation found he played a pivotal role in the deaths by “entering incorrect and misleading diagnoses” and, in two of the deaths, faking medical records to cover his tracks, the Western District Attorney’s Office of Arkansas said in a press release.

VETERANS ADVOCATE SPEAKS OUT AFTER SOLDIERS WERE DENIED MORE THAN $50 MILLION IN MEDICAL CLAIMS

In one case, a patient died of prostate cancer after Levy determined his biopsy showed he didn't have cancer, prosecutors say.

Levy first received his medical license in 1997 and several years later, in 2005, he began work as the Chief of Pathology and Laboratory Medical Services at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks.

In 2015 he was placed under review after several reports surfaced he was “under the influence of alcohol while on duty,” prosecutors said. A year later, Levy was found “intoxicated” while working and a drug and alcohol test revealed a blood alcohol content of .396.

His privileges were revoked and he was voluntarily admitted to a three-month in-patient treatment program.

Levy was allowed to return to the VA after signing an agreement in which he vowed to “maintain sobriety to ensure his ability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety to patients.” He was subject to 12 random tests during the period from November 2016 to June 2018, which he passed.

It was only later discovered that Levy was actually taking a substance, 2-methyl-2-butanol, which officials said “enables a person to achieve a state of intoxication but is not detectable in routine drug and alcohol testing methodology.”

He was fired that same year.

VA officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005. Levy has acknowledged that he once showed up to work at the VA drunk in 2016, but he denied that he had worked while impaired

In addition to the involuntary manslaughter charges, Levy also faces 12 counts of wire fraud, 12 counts of mail fraud and four counts of making false statements.

“These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,” Michael Missal, Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said.

“Our thoughts are with the veterans and their families affected by Dr. Levy’s actions.”

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines.

USDA cuts buyout packages for employees who won't relocate,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/usda-buyouts-kansas-city/index.html,"(CNN) The US Department of Agriculture is shrinking payments offered to employees who applied for buyouts rather than relocate to the greater Kansas City area, according to a document obtained by CNN.

The one-time payouts are being reduced from $25,000 to $10,000 because so many workers applied, according to the document.

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the affected agencies, says employees of the two research-related agencies that are being moved out of the the Washington area are ""extremely upset.""

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that the department said the change was made in order to offer payments to all eligible employees, rather than offer only the higher amount on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers still have the option to refuse the reduced payment if they decide to relocate, the spokesperson added.

The change comes after a union-compiled survey released last month showed an overwhelming number of the reassigned employees will likely choose to leave rather than relocate -- losses that could drain institutional knowledge and talent at two units that fund agricultural research across the nation and produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.

"As big cuts in foreign aid loom, State Department again endures resignations, turmoil",https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'Tracy Wilkinson', 'Tracy Wilkinson Covers Foreign Affairs The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-08-21/state-department-resignations-cuts,"Saying he could no longer be “complicit” in the Trump administration, Chuck Park, an eight-year State Department veteran most recently posted to a U.S. consulate in Mexico, last week became the latest American diplomat to publicly and pointedly call it quits.

“Over three tours abroad, I worked to spread what I believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance,” Park wrote in an essay. “But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home.”

The ranks of the United States’ foreign policy establishment are being roiled once again by resignations, reports of partisan intimidation and looming massive cuts in foreign aid that critics in Congress and elsewhere contend weaken American diplomacy worldwide.

When Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo took over the State Department 16 months ago, there was a surge in optimism that a dispirited corps would be reinvigorated after a tumultuous year of budget cuts and bungled management under former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson.

But morale is sinking amid signs that American foreign policy is now being dictated unchecked by a shoot-from-the-hip president and executed by a secretary of State with the political savvy to actually implement those controversial policies.

That includes efforts to essentially revamp the United States’ asylum programs, proceed with arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite bipartisan congressional opposition following the gruesome murder of a U.S.-based journalist in a Saudi consulate, and overturning of decades of U.S. policy in the Middle East by moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to the disputed city of Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights.

In parts of the world and international venues where American influence was once king, the United States has lost influence or is not present, critics say. Pompeo has declined to get involved in a delicate dispute between Japan and South Korea, two key Asian allies whose cooperation is central to regional stability and negotiations with nuclear-armed North Korea.

Pompeo will not attend this week’s Group of 7 meeting of the world’s top advanced democracies, leaving it to Trump –- who last year stormed away from the summit and refused to sign a final document, the first time that has happened. A communique this week from Western democracies offering support to the Hong Kong protesters facing off with China was signed by major world powers, but not the United States.

And in the coming days, the White House is expected to maneuver around legal hurdles to attempt to slash as much as $4 billion in U.S. foreign aid that supports critical programs around the world, including peace-keeping missions, and development, educational and human rights projects.

“We are not in a good place for dealing with the next super-crisis overseas, nor ongoing great power competition,” said Barbara Leaf, a retired 34-year veteran of the foreign service whose last post was as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, on Twitter. In an interview, she added, “We have lost decades of expertise vital to our national interests ... and we are stepping back a degree from the international engagement of the last 75 years that shaped” the world order.

For many diplomats like Park, the unconventional Trump approach has triggered an intense debate about whether to stay and promote good diplomacy, or leave an administration that violates their values. In social chat rooms and private conversations, they discuss what one diplomat called the “morality” of their work.

One of State’s most senior officials, the assistant secretary in charge of the Western Hemisphere, Kimberly Breier, abruptly resigned this month after reportedly clashing with White House advisor Stephen Miller over his aggressive immigration policies. Several people said they expected additional departures in the coming weeks.

Another diplomat told The Times this week he was quitting in part because Pompeo’s State Department seemed to have little use for input from its experienced foreign service officers. “We are serving a secretary of State who largely agrees with the president” instead of offering alternative viewpoints, said the diplomat, who is based in Latin America and requested anonymity because his resignation is pending. State’s “is a largely empowering voice,” he added.

Trump and Pompeo defend their policies, arguing the United States can no longer be the world’s police force or its benefactor. They say they are promoting a doctrine of “America first” that puts top priority on the prosperity and security of U.S. citizens.

But critics warn that could lead to U.S. isolation. “What we’re seeing, I think, is the institutionalization of America alone,” said Heather Conley, who heads the Europe program at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Other countries are trying to figure out who takes up the new mantle and [whether] can they hold on … until the U.S. returns to that leadership role, if it will.”

Speaking this week to the United Nations Security Council in New York, Pompeo defended the administration’s conduct of foreign policy, saying it was “reviving” America’s leadership role by joining multilateral efforts that are “meaningful,” “effective” and “reflect the values of freedom-loving societies,” such as the battle against Islamic State terrorism.

But in State Department ranks, there are frustrations on other fronts as well. A new report by the Inspector General’s office documents cases of Trump loyalists appointed to senior positions inside the department who went on to demand fealty to the administration and often berated and abused those they believed fell short.

The report recounted cases of “harassment” of career employees “premised on claims that they were ‘disloyal’ based on their perceived political views.”

Focusing on the State Department’s internal divisions over the United Nations and other multilateral organizations, investigators described a “negative and vindictive” environment in which one political appointee, senior advisor Mari Stull, punished and dressed down those she believed undermined Trump. She removed one senior official from the office and drove away dozens more, according to the report. She reportedly scrubbed officers’ social media, blacklisted those she deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump and labeled them “traitors,” it concluded.

Stull, who left the administration earlier this year, was formerly a food-industry lobbyist who came to the State Department from a wine blog she produced under the name Vino Vixen. She told those who complained that their objections were “pointless,” the report said, because “the Trump administration ‘has my back.’”

The inspector’s report also cited her boss, assistant secretary Kevin Moley, for failing to respond to complaints and granting her an “unprecedented level of independence,” according to an internal memo. He denied to investigators “the behavior attributed to me,” and remains in office.

A second inspector general report is underway on other alleged abuses, including the firing of a diplomat of Iranian descent, according to people familiar with the probe.

In cutting foreign aid, it remains unclear which programs will be targeted and how much money will be lost. To slash the money, the White House is attempting a workaround by submitting the proposed cuts late in the fiscal year so that Congress will not have time to act. The “rescission” package, as it is known, freezes foreign-aid money that Congress already approved for a 45-day review period. The fiscal year ends in Sept. 30, meaning the money will almost certainly go unspent and be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

The administration argues the action will help reduce the budget deficit. Agencies likely to be affected denied this, noting the money is a tiny fraction of the overall government budget.

Gayle Smith, former administrator of U.S. AID and president of the One Campaign, a global group that fights poverty and preventable disease, said the rescission move was “as ineffective as it is shameful.” It will “undermine U.S. leadership around the world,” she said, “subvert Congress’ spending authority ... and chip away at really powerful relationships” with private sectors, universities, civil societies and other non-governmental entities in scores of countries.

Trump this week said he was willing to listen to members of Congress but that he planned to go ahead with cuts. He argued that taking money away from countries or groups, citing Pakistan and the Palestinians, makes them more pliable in negotiations, though history has showed otherwise.

Opposition in Congress has come from both sides of the aisle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said the maneuver is illegal. Even Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said taking money from critical State Department programs “only undermines our national security interests and emboldens our adversaries.”

Park Police chief MacLean promoted to top Interior Dept. law enforcement post,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally', 'August At Pm']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/08/22/park-police-chief-robert-maclean-promoted-top-interior-law-enforcement-post/,"

U.S. Park Police Chief Robert D. MacLean. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

U.S. Park Police Chief Robert D. MacLean, who has led the uniformed force since 2013, is being promoted to head the Interior Department’s Office of Law Enforcement and Security, overseeing law enforcement programs including the Park Police and officers in the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Interior Department said Thursday.

MacLean, 53, has been a Park Police officer for 28 years. He did not return a request for comment. The move was first reported by Paul Wagner of Fox 5 News.

During MacLean’s tenure, unarmed motorist Bijan Ghaisar was fatally shot by two Park Police officers on Nov. 17, 2017. After Ghaisar was shot in a residential neighborhood of Fairfax County, Va., MacLean had his detectives begin a homicide investigation and told Fairfax police they were not needed, exercising the federal jurisdiction of the Park Police. Three days later, MacLean handed the case over to the FBI, though the bureau had not responded to the scene the night of the slaying. Ghaisar’s parents said Park Police officers treated them insensitively while Ghaisar, 25, lay in a coma, refusing to allow them to see their son for more than 10 minutes each hour or to touch him.

[Video shows Park Police fired nine shots into Bijan Ghaisar's Jeep at close range, killing him]

No decision has been made about whether to charge the officers involved in the shooting, Lucas Vinyard and Alejandro Amaya. U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu and a spokeswoman for the Justice Department’s civil rights division declined to comment earlier this week on when a charging decision might be made. Twenty-two months have passed since Ghaisar was killed.

Ghaisar’s mother, Kelly Ghaisar, was outraged by MacLean’s promotion. “Every time I even start to allow myself to think there might be some hope for justice, I get hit with news like this,” she said Thursday. “Chief MacLean allowed, and possibly ordered, his officers to guard my son’s body and treat my family in the most racist way possible. The U.S. Park Police have sat on this case after killing our son. It is a disgrace that it has taken this long to investigate this murder. This is another example of a law enforcement supervisor getting promoted despite obvious evidence of conduct that would likely end any other career.”

MacLean has remained silent about the shooting, refusing to disclose the names of the officers involved or details about why they shot. After MacLean refused to release videos of the shooting recorded by two Fairfax County police officers, Fairfax Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler Jr. in January 2018 released one of the videos that appeared to document the entire episode. MacLean declined to comment on the video.

When The Washington Post obtained the names of Vinyard and Amaya in the summer of 2018, MacLean refused a Freedom of Information Act request seeking to confirm the two men were Park Police officers, saying it was “personal information” and “would not shed light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties.”

Vinyard and Amaya’s names were released to the Ghaisar family by Fairfax County police, who publicly disclosed them in a lawsuit against the officers and the Park Police in March. They remain on paid administrative duty. The lawsuit is pending.

The Park Police are not equipped with body cameras or in-car cameras. No federal agents wear cameras. In response to the Ghaisar shooting, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) introduced legislation requiring federal uniformed officers to use such cameras, and they said MacLean told them he supported the legislation. MacLean has not publicly commented on the idea, which has not had a hearing in Congress.

[D.C.-area lawmakers reintroduce bill requiring body-worn, in-car cameras for federal officers]

The Park Police have about 700 officers in Washington, New York and San Francisco. MacLean previously worked on the department’s SWAT team and in internal affairs, headed its homeland security division, was the department spokesman, and served on a crime and violence task force with D.C. police and other agencies. MacLean helped oversee security and planning for major events on the Mall such as inaugurations and Independence Day festivities.

His department was criticized in 2017 when Park Police officers twice handcuffed youths selling water on the Mall. “We have to come up with better alternatives to handcuffing or having juveniles handcuffed and exposed out in the public for that long,” MacLean said.

The Park Police were also criticized by an inspector general’s audit in 2014 for “dysfunction” in communication after not finding a traveler who wandered from Reagan National Airport and died.

MacLean’s new job with the Interior Department involves overseeing law enforcement, security and intelligence activities for seven agencies: the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service rangers, the Park Police, the Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement, Fish and Wildlife refuge law enforcement officers, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Reclamation. The law enforcement office is described as the Interior Department’s “focal point to provide program guidance and oversight of the Department’s law enforcement, security, intelligence, counterintelligence/insider threat, and information sharing programs,” according to the office website.

In announcing the job, Susan Combs, the assistant interior secretary for policy, management and budget, said, “Chief MacLean has a stellar record protecting visitors and resources and is proud of the partnerships he has forged that have focused on the mutual law enforcement mission that transcends organizational jurisdiction and structure.” He is expected to begin in his new post on Sept. 16, Combs said in an email to Interior Department employees.

"Democrats press FBI, DHS on response to white supremacist violence",https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/458477-democrats-press-fbi-dhs-on-response-to-white-supremacist-violence,"House Democrats on Thursday pressed the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to beef up their strategies to combat the threat of violence motivated by white supremacist extremism after the shooting in El Paso, Texas, this month.



In letters to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, 65 House Democrats accused the Trump administration of withholding information from Congress about domestic terrorism committed by alleged white supremacists in recent years and not giving the issue enough priority.

ADVERTISEMENT

""The deadly events in El Paso, TX, Pittsburgh, PA, Poway, CA, Jeffersontown, KY, Charlottesville, VA, Charleston, SC, and elsewhere make it clear that this white nationalist extremist violence is a growing threat to people in every part of the United States,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letters, which were spearheaded by Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.).

They cited a report from Yahoo News earlier this month finding that a government document that was distributed throughout federal agencies — but not to Congress, despite Democratic senators' requests — found that alleged white supremacists were behind all race-based domestic terrorism incidents in 2018.



CNN reported earlier this month that White House officials rebuffed efforts by DHS to make combating domestic terror threats, including from white supremacists, a higher priority.

""Taken together, these developments give the strong impression that the Trump Administration may be endangering American lives by politicizing law enforcement and interfering with the operation of the agencies you lead,"" the lawmakers wrote.

The El Paso shooter allegedly sought to target Mexicans at a Walmart near the U.S.-Mexico border and published an anti-immigrant manifesto decrying a ""Hispanic invasion of Texas."" A total of 22 people were killed in the shooting while dozens more were injured.

Wray said in testimony before Congress in July that the majority of the agency's terrorism-related arrests since last fall were tied to white supremacy. Lawmakers pointed to his remarks in the wake of the El Paso shooting, saying federal authorities should put a bigger emphasis on tackling white supremacist extremism.

Lawmakers on Thursday asked the FBI and DHS to respond by Sept. 21 as to whether requests for resources to fight domestic terrorism had been denied or delayed by the White House; whether the agencies intended to adjust budget and staffing to address white supremacist and domestic terror threats; and what other steps they planned to combat white supremacist threats.

"President Trump decision to end DACA was lawful, Justice Department says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful-justice-department-supreme-court,"The Justice Department submitted a legal brief to the Supreme Court Monday that stated President Trump acted lawfully when he decided to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA in September of 2017, according to a new report.

The Department of Homeland Security, “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court late Monday.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

The Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments in November. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues of debates. A decision in favor of Trump would allow for the president to deport more than one million young adults residing in the U.S. under DACA protection, the New York Times reported.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was created under an executive order in 2012. The program gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children-- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy. Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

A decision from the Supreme Court to end DACA could galvanize young Americans to ensure Trump does not see another four years in the White House, the Times report stated. On the other hand, if the Court chooses to continue the Obama-era program, conservatives could argue Trump needs another four years to fulfill his campaign promises on immigration.

New York sues EPA over GE's Hudson River PCB cleanup,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-epa/new-york-sues-epa-over-ges-hudson-river-pcb-cleanup-idUSKCN1VB1YM,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday, accusing the agency of prematurely allowing General Electric Co to stop clearing the Hudson River of PCB contamination before the cleanup was finished.

Citing the state’s compelling interest in protecting the public and the environment from contaminants, New York officials are seeking to void GE’s “certificate of completion” from the EPA on April 11, which excused the company from further dredging unless further studies showed more was needed.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of siding with “big polluters” by accepting PCB levels that constitute a known health risk and leave Hudson River fish “too toxic” to eat.

“Since the EPA has failed to hold GE accountable for restoring the river, New York is taking action to demand a full and complete remediation,” Cuomo said in a statement.

The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but has said its decisionmaking was not politically driven.

GE had spent an estimated $1.7 billion to clean up the river over eight years, including six years of dredging, under a 2006 consent decree.

Mark Behan, a GE spokesman, said the EPA found that the Boston-based company had met its cleanup obligations, and that New York’s own data showed that 99% of sampled locations in the upper Hudson met state cleanup standards.

“Environmental conditions in the Hudson will continue to improve and GE will continue to cooperate,” he added.

New York filed its lawsuit in the federal court in Albany, the state’s capital, seeking to void GE’s completion certificate and block its reissuance until the cleanup is done right.

PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used in electrical equipment, carbonless copy paper and other products before a 1979 U.S. manufacturing ban, and are considered possible human carcinogens.

Two since-closed GE capacitor manufacturing plants north of Albany dumped roughly 650 tons of PCBs into the river between 1947 and 1977.

About 200 miles of the river were polluted, stretching as far south as Battery Park in Manhattan, though most pollution occurred in a 40-mile (64-km) zone near the plants.

State officials said about 54 tons of PCBs remain in the upper Hudson, roughly 13 tons more than the EPA expected when it found dredging necessary, and that PCB levels in fish remain three times higher than the agency’s goal."

"Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of Trump",https://www.newyorker.com,"['Susan B. Glasser', 'Ian Frazier', 'Amy Davidson Sorkin', 'Adam Gopnik', 'Andrew Marantz', 'Andy Borowitz', 'Adam Entous', 'Dexter Filkins']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/08/26/mike-pompeo-the-secretary-of-trump,"In the winter of 2016, Donald Trump was roaring through the primaries, and Mike Pompeo was determined to stop him. Pompeo, a little-known congressman from Wichita, helped persuade Marco Rubio to make a late stand in Kansas. Like many Republicans in Congress, Pompeo believed that Rubio had the national-security knowledge and the judgment to be President, and Trump did not. Urged on by Pompeo, Rubio’s team pulled money out of other states to gamble on winning the Kansas caucus. It was one of the few remaining contests in which Rubio still hoped to beat Trump, who, he said, was a “con artist” about to “take over the Republican Party.” On March 5th, Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, arrived in Wichita for the caucus. Rubio left his closing argument to Pompeo, who told the crowd at the Century II arena, “I’m going to speak to you from the heart about what I believe is the best path forward for America.” An Army veteran who finished first in his class at West Point, Pompeo cited Trump’s boast that if he ordered a soldier to commit a war crime the soldier would “go do it.” As the audience booed, Pompeo warned that Trump—like Barack Obama—would be “an authoritarian President who ignored our Constitution.” American soldiers “don’t swear an allegiance to President Trump or any other President,” Pompeo declared. “They take an oath to defend our Constitution, as Kansans, as conservatives, as Republicans, as Americans. Marco Rubio will never demean our soldiers by saying that he will order them to do things that are inconsistent with our Constitution.” Listening backstage, Trump demanded to know the identity of the congressman trashing him. A few minutes later, Pompeo concluded, “It’s time to turn down the lights on the circus.” Pompeo’s stinging rebuke of Trump got barely a mention in the local press, and Rubio finished third in Kansas. “We got smoked,” a former top Rubio campaign aide told me. Days later, Rubio’s campaign was over. In May, Trump secured the delegates needed for the nomination, and Pompeo reluctantly joined the rest of Kansas’s congressional delegation in endorsing him. Still, Pompeo had told the Topeka Capital-Journal, in April, that Trump was “not a conservative believer,” and, a few weeks later, he said, on CNN, “A lot of his policies don’t comport with my vision for how I represent Kansas.” At that point, Pompeo had never met Trump. Like many Republicans who called Trump a “kook,” a “cancer,” and a threat to democracy before ultimately supporting him, Pompeo disagreed with much of Trump’s platform. He took issue in particular with Trump’s “America First” skepticism about the United States’ role in the world. Pompeo was a conservative internationalist who had been shaped by his Cold War-era military service, and he remained a believer in American power as the guarantor of global stability. Yet, after Trump won the Presidency, Pompeo sought a post in his Administration and did not hesitate to serve as his C.I.A. director. In 2018, after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, by tweet, Pompeo happily replaced him as America’s top diplomat. Pompeo, an evangelical Christian who keeps an open Bible on his desk, now says it’s possible that God raised up Trump as a modern Queen Esther, the Biblical figure who convinced the King of Persia to spare the Jewish people. He defines his own job as serving the President, whatever the President asks of him. “A Secretary of State has to know what the President wants,” he said, at a recent appearance in Washington. “To the extent you get out of synch with that leader, then you’re just out shooting the breeze.” No matter what Trump has said or done, Pompeo has stood by him. As a former senior White House official told me, “There will never be any daylight publicly between him and Trump.” The former official said that, in private, too, Pompeo is “among the most sycophantic and obsequious people around Trump.” Even more bluntly, a former American ambassador told me, “He’s like a heat-seeking missile for Trump’s ass.” Pompeo’s transformation reflects the larger story of how the Republican Party went from disdaining Trump to embracing him with barely a murmur of dissent. This account of how Pompeo became the last survivor of the President’s original national-security team and his most influential adviser on international affairs is based on dozens of interviews in recent months with current and former Administration officials, U.S. and foreign diplomats, and friends and colleagues of Pompeo’s; the Secretary did not answer repeated requests for comment. Thirty-one months into the Administration, the relationship between Trump and Pompeo, born in derision and remade in flattery, has proved to be surprisingly durable. Trump often gushes about Pompeo, even as he has berated his hawkish national-security adviser, John Bolton, for taking similar positions. “I argue with everyone,” Trump told a reporter. “Except Pompeo.”

Fifty-five, burly, and barrel-chested, Pompeo lives with his second wife, Susan, and their golden retriever, Sherman, in a rented house on the grounds of a military base across the street from the State Department. A film buff and an AC/DC fan, he seems modest and approachable in settings where he’s comfortable. When challenged, especially about the President, he gets testy and red in the face. He favors baggy gray suits and close-cropped gray hair. Trump, who often talks about whether someone “looks the part,” has made a point of calling out Pompeo’s unglamorous presence. At a recent appearance in South Korea, he summoned Pompeo to the stage with his daughter Ivanka, referring to them as “beauty and the beast.” Pompeo’s background bears little resemblance to that of recent Secretaries of State, all of whom came to the job after long careers in public life and with extensive international experience. Pompeo, in contrast, has had a “meteoric rise,” as his friend Steve Scalise, the House Republican Whip, told me. A little more than a decade ago, he was unknown not only in Washington but also in his adopted home state, where he had just lost his first campaign, placing third in a three-way race to become chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. Trump often touts Pompeo’s credentials as a top student at West Point and at Harvard Law School, but in six years as a member of Congress he never chaired a subcommittee or faced a genuinely competitive election, and he served just over a year at the C.I.A. He spent much of his career running a struggling Wichita aviation company. Pompeo’s disclosure forms reveal that he is the poorest member of Trump’s Cabinet, listing family assets worth roughly, in 2018, between two hundred thousand and seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Watch “The Backstory”: Susan B. Glasser reports on how Mike Pompeo reinvented himself and went from an obscure congressman to Trump's most influential adviser on international affairs. Born in 1963, Pompeo was one of three children in a working-class family in Southern California. His father, Wayne, was a Navy radioman in the Korean War. His mother, Dorothy Mercer, was one of ten children of small-town Kansas pool-hall owners. In conservative Orange County, Wayne was a passionate liberal, according to two sources who heard this from the future Secretary. Pompeo does not speak publicly about his political disagreements with his father, but they began early on: he has said that, as a teen-ager, he read Ayn Rand’s “The Fountainhead,” and became a staunch conservative. The valedictorian of his public high school, he was nominated for West Point by his congressman, Bob Dornan, a fiery hard-right favorite of the defense industry. “That should give you a good idea of where I am coming from politically if ‘B-1 Bob’ chose me for West Point,” Pompeo told the conservative magazine Human Events, in 2011. Pompeo thrived at West Point, where he majored in engineering management. “Man, it’s hard to be No. 1,” a classmate told me. “It’s not just being the smartest person. It’s being the person who shines your shoes the best and also has the most athletic skills.” After marrying his college sweetheart, Leslie Libert, the weekend he graduated, Pompeo took a prestigious posting as a tank commander in the U.S. Army’s 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which patrolled the border between East and West in Germany. Five years later, with the end of the Cold War, the border was gone and Pompeo left the military, having risen to the rank of captain. He went to Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Law Review, then moved to Washington, D.C., and joined the blue-chip firm Williams & Connolly. In the late nineties, however, Pompeo radically changed his life. He quit the law firm after two years and divorced his wife. (He kept the dog, Byron; she got the cat, Keats.) He moved to Kansas, his late mother’s home state, where, in early 1997, he and “three of my best friends in the whole world” from West Point, as he put it recently, started a company, Thayer Aerospace. Their aim was to acquire firms that manufactured specialized machinery for aviation companies clustered in Wichita, a city known as “the air capital of the world.” Pompeo became Thayer’s C.E.O. While buying one of the companies for the new firm, he met Susan Justice Mostrous, a former Wichita State University homecoming queen. As the vice-president of a local bank, she was sitting on the other side of the negotiating table. “It’s true,” Pompeo told an interviewer, jokingly. “She took my money twice.” In 2000, he and Susan married and he adopted her son from her second marriage. Pompeo became a deacon of Wichita’s Eastminster Church, an evangelical congregation that eventually quit the mainstream Presbyterian Church because of its support for gay clergy. Over time, Pompeo got to know some of the city’s wealthiest benefactors, including David Murfin, one of the largest independent oil producers in Kansas, and Charles and David Koch, the billionaire Republican donors and skeptics of environmental regulation, whose company is headquartered in Wichita. In 1998, the Kochs’ venture-capital fund made a key early investment in Thayer. Within a few years, Pompeo was a trustee of the Flint Hills Center for Public Policy, which also has ties to the Kochs, and he was an early recruit for the Kochs’ national political organization, Americans for Prosperity. In 2010, amid the Tea Party backlash to President Obama, Pompeo made another career switch, running for an open Congress seat in the state’s Fourth District. The establishment climber from California had become a heartland evangelical. Pompeo ran a nasty race against the Democrat, an Indian-American state legislator named Raj Goyle, who, unlike Pompeo, had grown up in Wichita. Pompeo’s campaign tweeted praise for an article calling Goyle a “turban topper,” and a supporter bought billboards urging residents to “Vote American—Vote Pompeo.” In the heavily Republican district in a heavily Republican year, he won easily. “Pompeo’s singular ability is in navigating power,” Goyle told me. “On that I give him massive respect, the way he mapped Wichita power, the way he mapped D.C. power, the way he mapped Trump.”

The narrative of Pompeo’s transformation has been rewritten over the years, or never told at all. Most notably, the Kochs were far more significant backers of his business than he has publicly acknowledged. In 2011, the Washington Post reported that, according to Pompeo and his aides, the investment by the Kochs’ venture-capital fund “amounted to less than 2 percent” of Thayer’s total. Their statement was highly misleading. Corporate documents for 2003 filed with the Kansas secretary of state but not previously reported show that the Kochs’ fund had a nearly twenty-per-cent interest in Thayer. The Kochs were also involved in the firm’s management. Both the president and the chief financial officer of the Kochs’ venture fund sat, at various times, on Thayer’s board of directors, and in 2000 the fund helped secure loans of up to four million dollars for the firm to buy property. The Kochs’ extensive involvement was not a secret: their fund announced on its Web site that it was part of Thayer’s “equity sponsor group,” adding that it had given Pompeo’s firm wide-ranging support, including “acquisition capital, strategic input at the board level, and guidance in environmental risk issues.” The environmental risk turned out to be significant. Air Capitol Plating, an aircraft-parts processing company that Thayer took over in 1999, had for years been the subject of environmental complaints because of its use of the toxic chemical trichloroethylene, or TCE, dangerous traces of which had leaked into the local groundwater. In 2000, Thayer entered into a legal consent order with Kansas authorities, in which it admitted to the pollution and agreed to clean it up. To address the problem, Thayer had brought in another Koch-backed firm, Cherokee, which specialized in “risk management services” for firms “that face environmental challenges.” A new entity, Cherokee Thayer, assumed liability for the cleanup, although it appears that little if any cleanup was carried out. Instead, the company and the authorities spent years arguing over the extent of the contamination and what to do about it. Meanwhile, the firm continued to pollute, failed to file required reports in 2003, 2004, and 2005, and was fined more than a hundred thousand dollars by the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2005, the state found high levels of TCE in nearby residential wells, resulting in a “threat to human health,” and the E.P.A. named it a High Priority Violator. According to the State of Kansas, this month, twenty years after Thayer purchased A.C.P., a permeable barrier will finally be installed to insure that no additional TCE flows from the site into the water supply. In speeches, Pompeo often describes Thayer as a “small” company and himself as a “small businessman.” He has reminisced about Thayer as “a small, dirty, smelly, beautiful machine shop.” In fact, by 2000, according to a press release that year, the Kochs and other wealthy backers had invested ninety million dollars in the firm. Despite that funding, Thayer struggled financially when Pompeo ran it—another aspect of his past that Pompeo has publicly sought to revise. During his first run for Congress, in 2010, one of his Republican-primary rivals, a local millionaire named Wink Hartman, claimed that Pompeo was “forced out” of Thayer after having mismanaged the company into financial trouble, the Wichita Eagle reported. Pompeo denied the accusation, saying that he left Thayer on “excellent terms,” while acknowledging some difficulties, which he blamed on a downturn in the aviation industry after the 9/11 attacks. But the company’s problems began before 9/11 and continued well beyond. In 1999, the Thayer subsidiary Air Capitol Plating started going downhill. According to testimony from Randy Birchfield, a West Point classmate whom Pompeo recruited to run A.C.P., business had slowed and there were layoffs, cutbacks in bonuses and health-care benefits, and rumors of imminent bankruptcy. “Clearly, the trend lines were moving in a direction that wasn’t comforting for anyone,” Birchfield said, in a deposition in a lawsuit between Thayer and A.C.P.’s former owners. The firm’s difficulties persisted. Thayer’s former human-resources manager, Kenneth Bollinger, said that he “directed the systematic layoff of nearly half the employees after 9/11.” A company balance sheet showed that, as of May, 2004, Thayer had just thirty-one thousand dollars in cash on hand and a negative “net worth” of almost thirty-three million dollars. In 2005 and 2006, venders sued Thayer for more than three hundred thousand dollars in unpaid bills. In both years, Thayer authorized new shares to be issued, which would raise needed capital but could also dilute the stakes of early shareholders such as the Kochs’ fund. By April of 2006, Pompeo was no longer leading the company. The firm’s post-Pompeo president lists on his résumé today the “successful turnaround” of Thayer, which was renamed Nex-Tech Aerospace and sold to the private-equity firm Highland Capital, in April, 2007, with the assistance of a company that advertised expertise in the “wind-down” of “overleveraged and underperforming companies.” The same month as the sale, the Wichita Business Journal reported that the new C.E.O. described his job as being to “rebuild a reputation damaged by an era of missed deliveries and slow supplier payments.” Pompeo personally held a ten-per-cent interest in the firm as of 2003, but his financial-disclosure forms and his modest net worth suggest that he did not make much money from selling it. Pompeo, however, soon landed with one of his Wichita contacts, David Murfin, the Kansas oil tycoon. Murfin named Pompeo president of Sentry International, an oil-services firm that manufactured parts in China and elsewhere and sold them in the U.S. One Sentry joint venture was with a subsidiary of the Chinese national oil firm Sinopec, although Pompeo later told the Senate that he had no business ties to foreign government-owned entities. Like the Kochs, Murfin was a major player in Kansas Republican politics. Kelly Arnold, at that time the Sedgwick County G.O.P. chairman, told me that Murfin was “a key person for anybody running for office.” In January, 2007, Pompeo ran for the chairmanship of the Kansas Republican Party, against Tim Huelskamp, a future congressman, and Kris Kobach, a firebrand who represented the Party’s anti-immigrant right wing. “Pompeo’s pitch to the Party was: I’m going to run this thing like a business,” Dan Rasure, who helped Pompeo in that race, told me. “To the rest of the world this may sound crazy, given how much Pompeo has catered to the ultra-conservatives once he became elected, but, in Kansas terms, Pompeo is just straight-up what would be considered a moderate.” Coming into the state G.O.P. convention, Pompeo believed that he “had the race sewn up,” Rasure said, but Kobach flipped a bloc of votes, and won. Rasure stayed in touch with Pompeo, and persuaded him to become the first investor in his new alternative-energy startup, Sunflower Wind, which planned to make wind turbines. Pompeo, who personally invested as much as a hundred thousand dollars, served on the board and was a key adviser to the young C.E.O., who considered his advice invaluable. “I would never bet against Pompeo,” Rasure told me. But the firm went bust after one of its turbine blades cracked, and everyone involved lost money. Pompeo had better luck in politics. By 2010, Wichita’s U.S. representative, Todd Tiahrt, had decided to run for the Senate. In the crowded Republican primary to succeed him, Pompeo was again backed by the city’s business élite. Murfin became his campaign co-chairman. Pompeo won the primary with thirty-nine per cent of the vote. “Let’s make a pact—if neither of us is married by thirty, we read an article about how many people are getting married later these days anyway.” Cartoon by Will McPhail Soon after arriving on Capitol Hill, in 2011, he was the subject of articles in both the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post, in which he was portrayed, as one Kansas professor told the Post, as the new “congressman from Koch.” That Post article is where Pompeo and his aides misrepresented the Kochs’ investment in Thayer as an almost negligible two per cent. Pompeo would never again be directly challenged about Thayer. When he ran for reëlection in 2014, he aired a campaign ad touting his “remarkable success” leading the company. His positions evolved along with the story of his past. When Pompeo got to Congress, he argued that wind power was an expensive boondoggle and campaigned to end a production tax credit for wind technology, even though, not long before, he had personally invested in Sunflower Wind. By the time Pompeo joined the Trump Administration, he had written Sunflower out of his history, omitting from his Senate confirmation questionnaire his position as a member of its board.

In Washington, Pompeo found a way onto the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the critical panel for the business interests of his Kansas patrons. He appointed a former Koch lawyer as his chief of staff and acquired a reputation as a fierce defender of the Kochs. “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers” was the title of an op-ed that he wrote in 2012, in which he dismissed attacks on them as “evidence of a truly Nixonian approach to politics.” Two years later, he called the Kochs “great men.” His loyalty was rewarded: according to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 he received more campaign funds from the Kochs’ network than any other candidate in the country. But Pompeo hoped to make his mark in Congress on national security, and the Intelligence Committee was the panel that he most wanted to serve on. He got there in part by aiding the committee’s chairman, Mike Rogers, who sought Pompeo’s help in quelling an incipient rebellion by his fellow Tea Party members over the renewal of the wide-ranging surveillance authorized in the U.S.A. Patriot Act after 9/11. On the committee, Pompeo was regarded by his colleagues as smart and hardworking, “very bright, very politically shrewd,” as Adam Schiff, a Democrat, put it, “with a certain pugnacious quality to his persona.” Pompeo gained attention as one of the most partisan promoters of conspiracy theories about the killing of the U.S. Ambassador and three other Americans at a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. For years, Pompeo criticized Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s handling of the incident, and, when the select committee that was created to investigate it issued a bipartisan report clearing her, Pompeo and Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, were the only dissenters, arguing that Clinton knew Benghazi was a “terrorist attack” but, with the 2012 Presidential election only two months away, she covered it up. Pompeo confronted Clinton when she testified before the panel on October 22, 2015. He badgered her about why she had given her private e-mail address to her outside political adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, but not to the Ambassador to Libya. Their encounter was widely seen as a disaster for Pompeo, and he later told a local Republican club in Kansas that even his wife, Susan, had given him an F for his performance. “He was a Benghazi crazy,” a former senior intelligence official who dealt with Pompeo told me. Although his allegations were discredited, the investigation revealed that Clinton had deleted thirty thousand e-mails from a private server that she used while she was Secretary of State. Given that a subsequent F.B.I. investigation into Clinton’s e-mails hung over her 2016 campaign, the former official said of Pompeo, “at the end of the day, he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.” Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran was another obsession. Pompeo befriended the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, a younger fellow Harvard graduate and Army veteran, and they argued that not only would the deal fail to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; it was also an appeasement of the world’s worst sponsor of terrorism. In 2015, they travelled together to Vienna and then revealed what they said were “secret side deals” that the Obama team had agreed to with the Iranians. Pompeo’s pronouncements on Benghazi and on the Iran deal led to new media prominence on Fox News and other right-wing outlets, where he became one of the fiercest critics of Obama’s foreign policy. He trafficked in outlandish theories and engaged in slashing personal attacks. On “Meet the Press,” Pompeo called Clinton’s role in Benghazi “worse, in some ways, than Watergate.” But Pompeo grew restless in the House. In 2014, according to a Kansas Republican he consulted, Pompeo briefly considered challenging Kansas’s senior senator, Pat Roberts, in that year’s primary. In the spring of 2016, he publicly flirted with a challenge to the state’s other Republican senator, before dropping that, too.

By the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pompeo had, at least in public, changed his mind about Trump. “I am excited for a commander in chief who fearlessly puts America out in front,” he told the Wichita Eagle while in Cleveland as Trump accepted the nomination. He expressed even more excitement about Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, whom Pompeo considered a “friend and mentor” from their time together in Congress. Pence, too, had strong ties to the Kochs, and Pompeo found a connection to Pence’s campaign in Marc Short, a veteran operative for the Kochs’ organization. Although the Kochs had opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, Short signed on as an adviser to Pence and is now his chief of staff. “Marc knows Mike well,” a Republican friend of Pompeo’s told me, and Short got Pompeo to help Pence with debate preparation that fall. When Trump won, Pence repaid the favor by recommending Pompeo. The weekend after the election, Pompeo called a Kansas Republican who had worked for Trump and told him that he hoped to become either C.I.A. director or Secretary of the Army. The two decided that he should work his ties to Pence and to a West Point classmate, David Urban, who had run Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania. Urban was also hearing from Steve Bannon, Trump’s ultranationalist chief strategist, who called Urban to suggest that he urge “the old man” to name Pompeo to the C.I.A. post. Urban did so. On Wednesday, November 16th, Pompeo was summoned to Trump Tower for an interview with the President-elect. The men had never met, and still disagreed about key issues, such as Russia. Trump wanted to lift sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s regime, and disdained the U.S. intelligence community’s finding that Russia had intervened on his behalf in the election. “You’re wrong about Putin,” Trump told Pompeo, according to an account that Pompeo later offered to Republican insiders. “No,” Pompeo said. “You’re wrong.” Two days later, Trump announced that Pompeo was his nominee for the C.I.A. job. Trump seemed to know little about him, and Representative Devin Nunes, a member of Trump’s transition team, later said that he didn’t think Pompeo had even filled out a vetting questionnaire. After the announcement, Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz’s former campaign manager, called Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and reminded him of Trump’s fury at Pompeo’s Kansas caucus speech. As Tim Alberta recounts in his book, “American Carnage,” Kushner put the call on speaker, so that Trump could hear. “No! That was him? We’ve got to take it back,” the President-elect roared. “This is what I get for letting Pence pick everyone.” But the appointment stood. Two weeks later, Pompeo was hanging out with Trump in Urban’s box at the Army-Navy football game. Pompeo reminded other Republicans that he and Trump had a common enemy: Barack Obama. “He just made his political peace with reality—this is our President,” a former official in the George W. Bush Administration told me. Just months earlier, Pompeo had compared the “authoritarian” Obama to Trump, but Pompeo now saw joining Trump’s Cabinet as “an opportunity to kind of right the wrongs,” the former Bush official said. On January 23rd, Pompeo was confirmed, in a 66–32 vote. By then, he had deleted his entire congressional Twitter account, including a plea to the President-elect, days before Trump named him C.I.A. director, to “make the undemocratic practice of executive orders a thing of the past.” Trump, of course, did no such thing.

When Pompeo arrived at the C.I.A., he faced a political furor generated by the new President. Days before his swearing-in, Trump had compared the U.S. intelligence community to Nazi Germany for its handling of a secret dossier on Trump’s Russia ties. Then, at a welcoming ceremony in the lobby of C.I.A. headquarters, the President had attacked the agency again and made false claims about the size of the crowd at his Inauguration. Still, Pompeo managed to soothe the C.I.A. bureaucracy. He promised members of the Directorate of Operations that they would no longer be micromanaged, as they were under Obama. He vowed “to serve as an important bridge, if not a heat shield, not just from the White House but from any sort of political attacks,” Juan Zarate, a former U.S. official whom Pompeo asked to lead his transition to the C.I.A., told me. Pompeo also personally delivered the President’s Daily Brief to Trump, giving the C.I.A. valuable access to a skeptical President. “Mike got them in the room every day, and that is the most important thing the agency expects to have with its director,” the former senior intelligence official said. Pompeo used the sessions to establish a friendly relationship with the President, a contrast to Trump’s friction-filled dealings with other top national-security advisers. “He clicked with Mike early on, and Mike has had the benefit of that. Mike gets the President,” Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Trump’s, told me. Steve Scalise said that he remembers White House meetings in which “the President would look to Mike Pompeo before he even looked to Tillerson to get his assessment on different hot spots. That told me the President had incredible trust for Mike’s judgment, and it’s well founded.” Pompeo and his wife, who played an active role both in his office on the Hill and at the C.I.A., cultivated relationships not only with Trump but inside Trumpworld. One of these was with the Cabinet’s glitziest couple, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton. They made a seemingly odd foursome—the poorest member of Trump’s inner circle and one of its richest, an evangelical Kansan and an actress who got in trouble for vamping in opera-length black leather gloves at the U.S. Mint. Yet Linton recently told Los Angeles magazine that her favorite thing in Washington was dinner with the Pompeos. When the interviewer seemed incredulous, she replied, “But Pompeo is fun! He’s warm; he’s gregarious; he’s a great storyteller. He’s a lovely man. I love his wife, Susan.” Pompeo seemed to relish the C.I.A. job. He told a friend that, while flying around the world to meetings on a U.S. government plane, he would read the agency’s secret histories of wars in places like Afghanistan and Central America. Still, the former senior intelligence official said, “he wasn’t satisfied with being C.I.A. director. He wanted to be national-security adviser or Secretary of State.” “We didn’t know what to get the man who has everything. So we burned down your house first.” Cartoon by Liana Finck By the fall of 2017, Rex Tillerson was in trouble with the President. That summer, he had called Trump a “fucking moron,” and he often disagreed with Trump on policy decisions, such as withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. When Trump demanded an immediate withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, Tillerson pushed for more time. Most other advisers agreed with Tillerson, but Pompeo, a former senior official told me, twice sat in the White House Situation Room and supported leaving the Iran deal, sidelining his agency’s concerns about doing so. The Iran deal was one subject on which Trump and Pompeo were closely aligned before 2016. Another former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo gave “strong brushback” to experts on the Iran desk at the C.I.A. after they concluded that Iran was complying with the terms of the deal—a sore point, since Trump was claiming that Iran was not doing so. The first former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo challenged the agency’s Iran analysts: “He would ask, ‘What evidence? Are the Iranians cheating?’ ” At the White House, Pompeo waged what the former senior official saw as a “concerted campaign” to replace Tillerson. The escalating internal fight over Iran played into it. “Pompeo was working it hard. He saw and heard from the President how much he was souring on Tillerson,” the former official told me. “He was making the case to Trump: You’ve got a whole lot of people around you who don’t agree with you. I’m your guy.” An important proponent of Pompeo was Jared Kushner, who repeatedly clashed with Tillerson after Trump assigned his son-in-law an expansive portfolio that included everything from China to Mexico to Mideast peace. At a Washington social event in late 2017, a guest commented to Kushner on Tillerson’s troubles with Trump. “The problem will be solved very quickly if I have my way,” Kushner responded. When another guest suggested that Pompeo, who was present, should get the job, Kushner replied, “Of course.” Several months later, in March, 2018, Tillerson was returning home from a trip to Africa when Trump fired him and announced Pompeo as his replacement. “We’re always on the same wavelength,” Trump said. “The relationship has been very good, and that’s what I need.”

In the spring of 2018, on his first day as Secretary of State, Pompeo invoked the bluster of the Second World War general George Patton, vowing that the U.S. would “get its swagger back.” The reference to such an undiplomatic figure was odd, unless you knew that Patton is Trump’s most admired general and that the hagiographic movie about Patton’s life is one of his favorites. Pompeo followed up with a social-media campaign that featured photos of himself and Patton, and a State Department logo with a new motto: the “Department of Swagger.” Diplomats quickly surmised, as a former senior department official put it, that Pompeo’s opening pitch was to a “constituency of one.” Managing Trump as Secretary of State, however, would prove harder for Pompeo than it had been. As C.I.A. director, Pompeo spent many hours with the President, and he could punt difficult questions by saying that it was not his role to offer policy advice. Now he would often be away travelling, while Bolton, the new national-security adviser and a veteran bureaucratic infighter, had daily Trump time. The State Department was also in disarray from Tillerson’s tenure. Waves of experienced Foreign Service officers quit or were forced out, as Tillerson insisted on an extensive reorganization plan, instituted a hiring freeze, and accepted crippling budget cuts. The White House also blocked State from hiring any of the hundred and forty-nine G.O.P. national-security officials who signed “Never Trump” letters during the campaign. With State in crisis, Pompeo reached out to some veteran diplomats who had quit or been pushed aside, promoted a career Foreign Service official to serve as the department’s No. 3, lifted Tillerson’s hiring freeze, and consulted all the living former Secretaries of State, including Hillary Clinton, who took his call even though he had savaged her over Benghazi. The gestures helped smooth his Senate confirmation. In the end, Pompeo received even more Democratic votes, seven, than Tillerson had. Pompeo used his standing with the President as a selling point for a department in need of White House clout and a semblance of stability. “The department appreciates the fact that they have a Secretary who the President trusts,” Fred Fleitz, who served as Bolton’s chief of staff at the National Security Council, told me. Democrats noticed, too. “Morale is better at the State Department. It’s still at a historic low watermark, but people feel better,” Chris Murphy, a Connecticut senator who has vehemently opposed Pompeo on issues such as U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, told me. “There are some silver linings to Pompeo’s time at State that even critics like me can’t ignore.” Yet Trump’s impulsive style created constant complications for Pompeo, as it did for other officials. Trump undercut Pompeo with his abrupt decision, last December, to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria (which led to the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis); his unilateral recognition of Israel’s post-1967 annexation of the Golan Heights (a day after Pompeo, who was in Israel at the time, publicly said that he knew of no such plans); and his spur-of-the-moment decision to cut U.S. foreign aid to Central America. On North Korea, Pompeo was “very skeptical,” according to a former senior U.S. official, that Trump’s talks with Kim Jong Un would produce a breakthrough on denuclearization—a problem, since Trump’s first assignment to Pompeo was to oversee those negotiations. Trump has made a practice of alarming longtime allies, musing aloud about cancelling the mutual-defense treaty with Japan, threatening to pull U.S. troops out of South Korea, deriding Europe’s largest powers as NATO deadbeats, and dismissing the European Union as a “foe.” All of this has made for tense Pompeo visits in normally friendly precincts. In Washington, though, Pompeo has managed to maintain Trump’s confidence while remaining on speaking terms with a foreign-policy establishment that is deeply unsettled by the President. “He’s in a sense become the real adult in the room,” Ian Bremmer, the founder of the geopolitical advisory firm the Eurasia Group, told me. “It is less the case than he would like, but vastly more the case than anyone else.” Pompeo’s Republican friend told me, “He’s not an enabler of Trump. He does a lot to try to manage him.” Others believe that Pompeo is merely posturing. He is a politician who knows his audience; he wants to give the impression that “he generally agrees but he’s working with this wild man,” another former senior State Department official, who has met with Pompeo privately, told me. “He always has this sheepish ‘I know,’ but won’t show his hand.” He suggests, without being specific, the former official added, that he’s got “his finger in the dike.” When it comes to personnel, Pompeo has sent the right signals to the G.O.P. establishment by hiring a few Republican opponents of the President. He tapped Elliott Abrams, who wrote an anti-Trump op-ed in 2016, to be his special envoy to Venezuela. (Trump blocked Tillerson’s attempt to hire Abrams.) He asked Jim Jeffrey, George W. Bush’s deputy national-security adviser, to serve as the special envoy for Syria, even though he signed a Never Trump letter. This spring, Pompeo appointed the Fox News contributor Morgan Ortagus to be his spokesperson, although she, like Pompeo, had publicly opposed Trump in 2016, prompting the conservative magazine The National Interest to observe that “Mike Pompeo’s house has become a hall of NeverTrump.” In each case, Pompeo carefully managed the President. “He’ll be meeting with Trump about something else and then, like, at the end of the meeting he’ll be, like, ‘Oh, by the way, I’m bringing on Jim Jeffrey,’ ‘Oh, by the way, I’m bringing on Elliott Abrams,’ ” the Republican close to Pompeo told me. Trump agreed to the moves, but only because the jobs did not require Senate confirmation. “It’s fairly clear he has a deal with the President where if there’s no confirmation hearing, where people can talk about the 2016 race, then he can hire whoever he wants,” a senior Administration official told me. Fifteen months after Pompeo took over the State Department, the question is not whether he has stayed in Trump’s good favor but to what ends Pompeo is using the relationship. He “agrees certain things the President has mandated don’t make any sense,” a third former senior department official told me. When Trump unilaterally cut two hundred and thirty million dollars that was meant to help stabilize parts of Syria where U.S. forces were present, Pompeo “went to the President several times to fix it. He just lost,” the former official said. He concluded that this typified Pompeo’s approach. “He will go at Trump to try to change his mind, but if he can’t he’ll go, ‘O.K., we’re doing what the President has said.’ ” Pompeo’s own ideological agenda is also becoming clearer, as indicated by recent controversies over orders to U.S. diplomatic missions not to fly the gay-pride flag; the creation of a new State Department commission stocked with conservatives to review human-rights policy based on “natural” rights; and comments by the Secretary that were skeptical of climate change at an international climate-change conference. In the end, Pompeo may be remembered as the most conservative, ideologically driven Secretary of State ever to serve. He is certainly no sentimentalist about the world, and, while he does not share Trump’s affinity for dictators like Putin and Kim Jong Un, he has remained notably silent on human-rights abuses in places such as North Korea. In Saudi Arabia, he smiled during a photo op with the Crown Prince soon after the gruesome killing of the dissident columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and angered many members of Congress, including some in his own Party, by appearing to dismiss concerns about it. Pompeo and his advisers had thought that the episode would be a repeat of China’s 1989 massacre of protesters in Tiananmen Square: a controversy that produced outrage in Congress but then passed. Instead, Pompeo was “struck and frustrated by how it hasn’t blown over,” the Republican friend told me. Pompeo is also more political than any other recent Secretary, with the exception, perhaps, of Hillary Clinton. In some ways, he’s approached the job like a future Presidential candidate, hosting Republican strategists such as Karl Rove and wealthy patrons such as the former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein at regular “Madison Dinners,” named for the fifth Secretary of State (and fourth President). The dinners are orchestrated by Pompeo’s wife, Susan, who travels frequently with him and whose unusual requests are now being investigated by congressional Democrats after a whistle-blower complained that the couple was inappropriately using government resources and treating Pompeo’s security detail as “UberEats with guns,” CNN reported. “Oh, yeah, Thrag spoiled the ending of this one at work today.” Cartoon by Pia Guerra and Ian Boothby At times, Pompeo’s concern for his political image can seem to shape policy decisions. Last September, he ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra, despite objections from some State Department officials. “He did not want Basra to be his Benghazi,” a former senior U.S. official who discussed the decision with Pompeo said. Another former senior U.S. official, with experience in Iraq, told me, “Absolutely, it was an overreaction. He wears Benghazi around his neck.”

In a recent speech at the Claremont Institute, in California, Pompeo outlined his version of the Trump doctrine, claiming that “realism” “restraint,” and “respect” guided the President’s approach to the world. It was his most ambitious explanation yet of the Administration’s foreign policy, asserting that renewed nationalism is necessary as the U.S. faces a new era of great-power competition with China and Russia. It sounded plausible, Republican, and entirely unlike the President. “The problem with the speech is that it doesn’t reflect Trump’s foreign policy,” said Brett McGurk, a former State Department official who oversaw the anti-Islamic State coalition, until he quit in protest over Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria. “It’s not based on realism. It’s not based on restraint. It’s based on declaring grand objectives, few of which the Administration is willing or able to meet.” This gets at a central challenge of Pompeo’s tenure: turning Trump’s tweets and “instincts” into a coherent foreign policy, as his policy-planning chief often put it. Pompeo insists on that goal, though doing so often involves essentially ignoring the President himself. On Syria, for example, Pompeo, Bolton, and other officials disagreed with Trump’s order to immediately withdraw U.S. forces, but they sought to manage him rather than confront him, as Mattis did, while enlisting other allies, such as the Israelis and members of Congress, to lobby Trump for a reversal. In public, Pompeo defended the decision, arguing, in defiance of the facts, that it constituted a continuation of Trump’s policy. Eventually, Trump agreed to keep some troops in Syria. The episode was one of many in which Pompeo has struggled to avoid coming into public conflict with the President. In recent months, Pompeo has repeatedly tangled with members of Congress and journalists who ask about the President’s policies and his inflammatory statements. Such questions, he has said, are “silly,” “bizarre,” “ticky-tack,” “insulting and ridiculous and frankly ludicrous.” Yet none of the people I spoke with thought Pompeo harbored any illusions about the President. In private, Pompeo’s gripes sometimes echo those expressed by fired predecessors, among them H. R. McMaster, Trump’s second national-security adviser. One of the former senior officials told me that he had heard identical complaints from Pompeo and McMaster: “ ‘We put together carefully crafted policies on things and the President blows it up with a tweet, and I have to go in and put Humpty Dumpty back together.’ ” Until now, Pompeo has derived his power by being better than anyone else at anticipating where Trump is going to end up and managing to get himself there. As Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, put it, Pompeo has cultivated a “special skill,” figuring out “how to get Trump moving in the direction he wants.” The risks of getting publicly out of synch with Trump, however, have gone up for Pompeo this summer, as tensions with Iran rise. The President, a self-styled grand global dealmaker, has said that his goal after withdrawing from the nuclear deal is to bring Iran back to the negotiating table for a better deal. Pompeo, an Iran hawk far longer than he has been a Trump supporter, has been driving the Administration’s hard-line “maximum pressure” strategy. The possibility of a real divide with Trump emerged in June, after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Pompeo and his internal rival Bolton, a longtime advocate of Iranian “regime change,” initially backed a retaliatory military strike, and Trump agreed, only to reverse himself when planes were already in the air. Even before that incident, Fred Fleitz, Bolton’s former chief of staff at the N.S.C., had told me that Bolton and Pompeo are closely aligned on Iran, at least. “He and John are on the same sheet of music,” Fleitz said. Whatever their ideological convergence on Iran, relations between the two seem to have worsened in recent months, to the extent that the former White House official was told recently that they are “not even on speaking terms” and communicate largely through intermediaries. Pompeo, asked last month about his relationship with Bolton, noted, “There’s always tension among leaders of different organizations.” But for now it’s Bolton, not Pompeo, who appears to be the odd man out. In a sign of Pompeo’s ability to remain in Trump’s good graces, the President publicly bristled at Bolton, not him, after the aborted Iran strike. Then, with Pompeo by his side, Trump made an unprecedented, hastily arranged visit with Kim Jong Un to the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone, while Bolton went off on a previously scheduled trip to Mongolia."
