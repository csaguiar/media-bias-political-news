Trump Tells Freshman Congresswomen to ‘Go Back’ to the Countries They Came From,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Katie Rogers', 'Nicholas Fandos']",07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-squad-congress.html,"Mr. Trump’s attack came after days of Fox News coverage that centered on Ms. Omar. During her tenure in Congress, Ms. Omar has rattled fellow Democrats and provided ammunition to Republicans for her repeated criticisms of Israel, including a comment that pro-Israel activists were pushing “for allegiance to a foreign country.”

And she has been vocal about her life as a refugee who fled her native country and eventually settled in America, only to be disappointed with the country she found. More than any of the others in her freshman group, Ms. Omar — one of the first two Muslim women in Congress along with Ms. Tlaib — has forcefully used her personal story to make the argument that loving America does not require an acceptance of its shortcomings.

“I grew up in an extremely unjust society, and the only thing that made my family excited about coming to the United States was that the United States was supposed to be the country that guaranteed justice to all,” Ms. Omar recently said. “So, I feel it necessary for me to speak about that promise that’s not kept.”

Comments like these have inflamed Fox News personalities like Tucker Carlson, who used his television program to lash out at Ms. Omar.

“Our country rescued Ilhan Omar,” Mr. Carlson said in a broadcast last week. “We didn’t do it to get rich; in fact it cost us money. We did it because we are kind people. How did Omar respond to the remarkable gift we gave her? She scolded us, and called us names, she showered us with contempt.”"

Rapinoe says Trump's message 'excludes people that look like me' and 'a lot of people in his base',https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rapinoe-says-trumps-message-excludes-people-that-look-like-me-and-a-lot-of-people-in-his-base,"Soccer star Megan Rapinoe continued her criticism of President Trump on Sunday, saying the president’s message is dividing Americans.

Fresh off the U.S. women’s national team’s victory in the World Cup last weekend, Rapinoe made an appearance on NBC’s “Meet The Press” where she said Trump’s message excluded people “that look like me and are me.”

""I think Trump's message excludes people that look like me and are me, of course, but it excludes a lot of people in his base, as well,"" Rapinoe said. ""And I think that he's trying to divide so he can conquer and not unite so we can all conquer.""

THESE WOMEN’S WORLD CUP CHAMPIONS GIVE 'GLORY TO GOD'

Rapinoe, who took heat from Trump for saying she would decline an invite to White House to celebrate the USWNT’s victory, expanded on her stance when questioned by NBC’s Chuck Todd about how she would explain her choice to a Trump supporter.

""I'd try to share our message,"" she said. ""Do you think all people are treated equal? Do you believe that equal pay should be mandated? Do you believe that everyone should have health care? Do you believe we should treat everyone with the respect? Those are the basics we are talking about.""

Rapinoe, who won the World Cup’s Golden Boot and led the U.S. to its victory over the Netherlands, has been an outspoken advocate for equal pay.

“There’s been so much contention in these last years. I’ve been a victim of that, I’ve been a perpetrator of that,” Rapinoe said during a parade last week in New York. “With our fight with the federation, sorry for some of the things I said – not all of the things. But it’s time to come together.""

She continued: “This conversation is at the next step. We have to collaborate. It takes everybody. This is my charge to everyone. Do what you can. Do what you have to do. Step outside yourself. Be more. Be better. Be bigger than you ever been before. If this team is any representation of what you can be when you do that, please take it as an example.”"
"UK ambassador vouched for 'legit' dossier author, said Trump killed Iran deal to spite Obama, leaks show",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/uk-ambassador-memos-trump-iran-obama,"President Trump abandoned the Iran nuclear deal last year in an act of ""diplomatic vandalism"" to spite Barack Obama, according to a new leaked diplomatic cable purportedly written by British ambassador Kim Darroch in 2018.

Darroch also reportedly told a U.S. official that Christopher Steele, the author of the discredited anti-Trump dossier that the FBI used to justify secretly monitoring members of the Trump team, was ""absolutely legit."" Steele, in producing the dossier and several of its false or unsubstantiated claims, was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.

The documents was published by the The Mail on Sunday, days after the paper published several anti-Trump messages Darroch sent to Downing Street from 2017 to present.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged. And there was no evidence of a compromising, lurid tape of Trump, nor evidence of Trump-loyal hackers ""in the US>""

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant. And Fox News has confirmed that Steele provided clearly false information to a State Department contact prior to the FISA warrant being issued -- including a claim that there was a Russian consulate in Miami that was running a foreign influence operation, when no such consulate exists.

Darroch resigned as Britain's ambassador to the U.S. on Wednesday, after Trump announced the U.S. would ""no longer deal"" with him. Trump branded the ambassador a ""pompous fool"" in a Twitter fusillade.

The Iran memo was written after then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson visited Washington in a failed attempt to persuade the U.S. not to abandon the Iran nuclear agreement.

HAPPIER TIMES: RECAPPING TRUMP'S VISIT WITH THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND IN JUNE

""The outcome illustrated the paradox of this White House: you got exceptional access, seeing everyone short of the president; but on the substance, the administration is set upon an act of diplomatic vandalism, seemingly for ideological and personality reasons - it was Obama's deal,"" Darroch wrote.

Trump has long lambasted the multilateral Iran nuclear deal, both as candidate and campaigner, saying it's enabled Iran to fund terrorism abroad and continue to progress towards nuclear weapons.

Faced with crushing sanctions reimposed by the Trump administration, Iran announced this month it was working rapidly to develop weapons-grade uranium and would not stop unless remaining signatories to the deal found a way to alleviate the economic pressure.

IRAN ANNOUNCES URANIUM ENRICHMENT NOW EXCEEDS LEVELS SET BY IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, BLAMES US FOR BREAKING AGREEMENT

In previously leaked documents, Darroch described the Trump administration as ""diplomatically clumsy and inept"" and said he doubted it would become ""substantially more normal.""

""I do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the U.S.,"" Trump wrote on Twitter, responding to those remarks. ""We will no longer deal with him.""

Separately, Trump told reporters: ""We’ve had our little ins and outs with a couple of countries, and I would say that the U.K. -- their ambassador has not served the U.K. well, I can tell you that. We are not big fans of that man, and he has not served the U.K. well. So, I can understand it and I can say things about him, but I won’t bother.""

British police are currently hunting the culprits behind the leak — and, contentiously, have warned journalists that publishing the documents ""could also constitute a criminal offense.""

Police are investigating the leak as a potential breach of the Official Secrets Act, which bars public servants from making ""damaging"" disclosures of classified material. Breaking the act carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison, though prosecutions are rare.

Yet both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two contenders to become Britain's next prime minister, have defended the media's right to publish.

""We have to make sure that we defend the right of journalists to publish leaks when they are in the national interest,"" Hunt said.

British officials have said they have no evidence that hacking was involved in the documents' release, and that the culprit is likely to be found among politicians or civil servants in London.

International incidents involving British diplomats in the U.S. are rare, but not unprecedented. British Ambassador Lionel Sackville-West was sacked in 1888 for writing the so-called Murchison letter, which touched off a firestorm by indicating that Britain preferred Grover Cleveland over Republican Benjamin Harrison. (Republicans publicized the letter, helping Harrison win the White House.)

And in May 1856, President Franklin Pierce expelled John F. Crampton, then the British ambassador to the U.S., and several other British diplomats, following a lengthy spat over British efforts to recruit North Americans to fight in Crimea.

""It's not entirely unprecedented,"" Dan Drezner, professor of International Politics at The Fletcher School of Tufts University, told Fox News. ""When WikiLeaks released a trove of diplomatic cables, the Bolivarian leader of Ecuador expelled the U.S. Ambassador. Even in that case, however, the Ecuadoran government went through the proper diplomatic channels. A PNG [persona non grata]-by-tweet for the leak of cables confirming mainstream media reporting of the Trump administration is definitely new.""

"Devin Nunes: Without jail time for Russia probe 'dirty cops', no Republican will trust DOJ for ‘generations'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-jail-dirty-cops-republicans-doj,"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said there will be massive political consequences if Justice Department officials don't face jail time for their conduct during the Russia investigation.

According to Nunes, the Russia investigation was an ""obstruction of justice trap,"" that started without evidence of collusion and ended in an ""awful situation"" that could only be fixed by jailing the people who ""perpetuated this hoax.""

""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" he told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on the latest ""Hemmer Time"" podcast. ""We're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

Nunes specifically mentioned Andrew Weissman, one of the Mueller team's top prosecutors who briefed AP reporters in 2017, before Mueller's team was assembled, on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation.""

Authorities, Nunes said, hid that fact from his committee -- something he said was inappropriate given that Weissman was briefed on the Steele dossier in the summer of 2016.

At Mueller's hearing, Nunes plans to ask him whether he knew that Weissmann had been briefed on the dossier. Weissmann's early involvement with the chain of custody, according to legal advice Nunes received, effectively disqualified him from serving on Mueller's team.

Nunes' comments came before former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was scheduled to testify on July 17 before the House Judiciary Committee -- a hearing Nunes suspected Democrats hoped would include ""nasty"" comments making President Trump ""look bad.""

That date, according to sources, could have been pushed back to July 24, although committee Democrats have maintained the hearing would take place on July 17.

While the committee's chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., joined other Democrats in continuing to pursue the Mueller report's findings, Republicans have attempted to refocus the debate on accountability for what Nunes described as ""dirty cops.""

REP. NUNES ON CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S GRILLING BY DOJ INVESTIGATORS: A LOT OF THE DOSSIER 'WAS JUST MADE UP'

Barr already started the investigation and Nunes, in April, sent a criminal referral notification telling the Justice Department in April that he had identified ""potential violations"" of the law. Those criminal referrals stemmed from the Intelligence Committee's investigation when Nunes was chair and Republicans held the House.

Nunes told Fox News host Bill Hemmer that he thought it was possible that the Russia investigation was a way for the House to develop an impeachment strategy. He accused DOJ officials of trying to drag out the investigation in order to find legal violations.

""They were trying to hold out this investigation as long as possible, bust people here and there for nickel and dime stuff -- like obstructing an investigation, lying to Congress -- and eventually they would get Trump,"" he said.

Opinion | All Presidents Are Deporters in Chief,https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/opinion/sunday/trump-deportations-immigration.html,"Here’s how a recent Times report described an immigrant detention facility in Clint, Tex. , that was built during the Obama administration but overfilled under Mr. Trump: “Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.”

This week , Mr. Trump announced a new series of raids by ICE in at least 10 cities, aiming to arrest thousands of people who have been issued deportation orders.

“We’re focused on criminals,” Mr. Trump sai d on Friday, dodging the truth that his administration’s hard-line policies make little to no distinction between people who pose a genuine risk and those who miss an immigration court date.

The administration, for instance, publicly warned of collateral arrests as part of the new raids, threatening to detain other unauthorized immigrants who happen to be on the scene (children or other relatives, perhaps), even if they are not the main targets of the raids.

Publicity over the raids has rattled immigrant communities, as the administration clearly intended. For Mr. Trump, deterrence of illegal immigration has been a guiding principle — if not by means of a wall, then by means of cruelty toward migrants, from the squalid conditions in detainee facilities to separating children from their parents.

“It’s the complete, 100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx, with a disregard for managing what’s happening,” a Department of Homeland Security official told The Times earlier this year. “We have a lot more families, a lot more unaccompanied children, and the focus has just been on how can we deter, rather than how can we handle.”

But deterrence alone can’t explain a slew of other moves — scaling back a program that protects the families of members of the military and veterans from being deported, for instance. It doesn’t explain the frantic — yet unsuccessful — effort to put a question about citizenship on the census, which experts agree would lead to an undercount of people in immigrant-heavy communities. Nor does deterrence explain removing deportation protections from nearly one million people who live in the country under the auspices of humanitarian programs or because they were brought to the country as children."
Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan under federal investigation for alleged leaks,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Pablo Martinez Monsivais'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-under-federal-investigation-for-alleged-leaks-officials,"Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan is at the center of a federal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to call off a nationwide operation, three senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

Following the publishing of sensitive leaked law enforcement information on June 21, then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team followed department protocol and reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate. JIC is an agency office that handles internal investigations of personnel misconduct, sexual abuse, staff neglect, or violations of responsibilities that may have contributed to such incidents.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's not clear if JIC has referred the matter to the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

“Any investigation into the malicious, unauthorized disclosure of the operations is completely justified. Any causal observer would logically deduce that McAleenan’s dodgy response and coy behavior warrant additional scrutiny,” a second senior official said late Thursday.

A third official said the department’s decision to pursue the investigation of the acting secretary in itself was “very troubling.”

“It’s worrisome that it took days for the acting secretary to acknowledge and then deny the allegations, and it’s telling that he didn’t call for the investigation in the first place. More than anything, it’s unfortunate that people are even having this discussion at all,” the official wrote in a text.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak, charging he wanted to sabotage ICE’s monthslong plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

“That’s our belief,” one official told the Washington Examiner in late June, when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”

The acting secretary, who was in El Paso Thursday to show mayors from southern border cities conditions of Border Patrol facilities, has not mentioned the investigation in the weeks since the leak.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week, but on Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which border patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE is now planning to carry out raids nationwide this weekend, though it is not clear if the same people targeted in the canceled ones from June will be the focus of these new ones. The raids were reported Friday as having started earlier than expected."
E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Judges Sandra Ikuta and Jay Bybee, who ruled in the DOJ's favor, were appointees of President George W. Bush.

Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/739860400/broken-promises-teachers-sue-u-s-over-student-loans-that-werent-forgiven,"Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven

Updated at 1:09 p.m. ET

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

• “Politico Misleads On Trump EPA’s Progress Cleaning Up Superfund Sites.”

• “The Hill [newspaper] Gets It Wrong On New EPA FOIA Regulation.”

• “National Correspondent Misleads on Wheeler’s Remarks.”

While the Trump administration is not known for velvety smooth relations with the news media, federal agencies are far more likely to ignore reporters than to officially scold them. Not the EPA. Reporters whom the agency deems to have misreported can expect to hear about it, and not just through a polite phone call or an email requesting a correction.

Instead, the EPA goes public.

“A reader of Politico would have been rightfully confused about the results” of an inspector general’s report about a Superfund task force, the EPA declared in a June 24 release. “It is only fair to ask why they chose to ignore the key findings of this report.”

A day later, the EPA’s communications wing weighed in on the Hill’s story about a new regulation. “The Hill used a false premise and ran a grossly inaccurate story,” it said. It went on to list “THE HILL’s FALSE QUOTES,” “MORE OF THE HILL’S FALSE QUOTES” and “MORE FALSE REPORTING FROM THE HILL.”

A spokeswoman for the Hill, Lisa Dallos, said the publication stands by its story. Politico’s spokesman, Brad Dayspring, characterized the Superfund story as “fair and fact based.”

The EPA’s unusual approach is in some ways a return to its recent past. Under former administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned a year ago amid various scandals, the agency attacked reporters on a semiregular basis. The pushback sometimes took on a nasty tone. Pruitt’s spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, who has also left the agency, once responded to a reporter who was seeking comment for a story by telling her, “You have a great day, you’re a piece of trash.”

Things simmered down with Pruitt’s departure, but have lately begun to grow toxic again.

The EPA’s top media manager says the approach nowadays is kinder and gentler but still firm. “I’m trying not to get into name calling or picking fights,” said Corry Schiermeyer, associate administrator for public affairs at the agency. “I honestly just want to ensure that when anyone reports about our policies and issues that the reporting is correct and accurate.”

The news releases, she said, are a way to establish an official record before a disputed story goes viral on social media: “If we sat back and didn’t do anything, it can spin out of control.”

Reporters on the beat, however, are somewhat baffled by the agency’s aggressiveness, especially because Pruitt’s replacement, former energy-industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, is more low-key than his predecessor.

Asked who decides when to publicly call out a news organization, Schiermeyer hedged. “That’s a good question,” she said after a pause. “I wouldn’t say it’s the policy of Corry Schiermeyer’s office. I would say it’s often done on a case-by-case basis, by my office or others within the agency who feel that something was an egregious mischaracterization.”

That includes Wheeler, who Schiermeyer said objected to a tweet by Yahoo News correspondent Alexander Nazaryan about a speech Wheeler gave in June. Wheeler’s apparent peeve led to a news release asserting that Nazaryan “deliberately spread false information on twitter by misreporting Administrator Wheeler’s comments.” In response, Nazaryan tweeted Yahoo News “stands by the accuracy of our reporting.” Nazaryan declined to comment for this story.

News sources typically seek redress through discussion and negotiation with reporters and their editors. But the EPA’s critiques of Nazaryan and Politico had one striking difference: The agency posted its news releases without seeking a corrections or retractions the organizations, effectively blindsiding both. Schiermeyer acknowledged officials failed to do so, but said neither Politico nor Yahoo contacted the agency before publication.

Most recently, the agency trained its fire on the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ), in effect challenging en masse reporters who cover the EPA. Agency officials objected to a letter written by the group to Wheeler about the agency’s new Freedom of Information Act regulations. In a news release, the agency criticized the letter, saying it included “numerous inaccuracies that were regurgitated from false articles.”

“They took it as an opportunity to discredit or suggest environmental journalists were misleading the public,” said Bobby Magill, SEJ’s president. “It’s part of a larger pattern of trying to smear the press.”

Magill, a reporter for Bloomberg Environment, said he objected to “the tone” of the EPA’s response. “It’s one thing to set the record straight,” he said. “It’s a whole other thing to suggest you’re intentionally misleading people.”

But by rebutting in such a public way, the EPA risks calling more attention to the stories it’s disputing, a potential example of the Streisand effect, in which an effort to rebut or suppress information has the unintended consequence of drawing more interest to it (the phenomenon was named for legendary singer and actor Barbra Streisand, whose attempts to keep an aerial photograph of her Malibu home out of public view led to a spike of interest in it). The disputed Politico story, for example, was available only through Politico’s subscription service, so few would have known about it before the EPA complained.

Schiermeyer, however, thinks the approach can prevent worse outcomes. The public naming and shaming “can slow things down and sometimes stop misinformation from continuing to be repurposed,” she said. “You might not be able to stop the first reporter, but at least the second and third and fourth reporter” will see information the agency considers accurate."
Trump officially issues executive order to tally citizens through the Commerce Department,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-officially-issues-executive-order-to-tally-citizens-through-the-commerce-department,"President Trump officially issued his executive order Thursday, which demands all other departments and agencies provide the Commerce Department with any information related to citizenship.

Trump issued the order after courts ruled against having the citizenship question on the 2020 census. The order was also issued to avoid delaying the census any longer.

""To achieve that goal, I have determined that it is imperative that all executive departments and agencies provide the Department the maximum assistance permissible, consistent with law, in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country, including by providing any access that the Department may request to administrative records that may be useful in accomplishing that objective,"" the executive order states.

All agencies are being ordered to provide the citizenship data to an interagency working group that will be created to process the information.

State information on citizens will also be sent to the Commerce Department.

In the order, Trump outlines which information will be sent by which federal agency:



Department of Homeland Security: National-level file of Lawful Permanent Residents, naturalizations, F1 and M1 nonimmigrant visas, national-level file of customs and border arrival/departure transaction data

Department of State: refugee and asylum visas, national-level passport application data

Social Security Administration: Master beneficiary records

Department of Health and Human Services: CMS Medicaid and CHIP Information System

Trump has instructed the Commerce Department begin planning the administrative processes necessary to add the citizenship question to the census in 2030."

The City of Los Angeles sued the Department of Justice because it did not receive any funding from the Community Oriented Policing Services grant program , which is aimed at initiatives to build trust between communities and law enforcement agencies. Los Angeles chose ""building trust and respect"" as its focus area and did not mention illegal immigration in its application because of its policy as a sanctuary city.

The panel of judges ruled that ""because DOJ's scoring factors encouraged, but did not coerce, an applicant to cooperate on immigration matters, the panel also rejected Los Angeles's claims that DOJ's use of the factors infringed on state autonomy in a manner that raised Tenth Amendment concerns.""

""DOJ did not exceed its statutory authority in awarding bonus points to applicants that selected the illegal immigration focus area,"" the judges wrote, arguing that ""DOJ's determination that the techniques of community policing may be used to address this public safety issue (illegal immigration) was entirely reasonable.""

Ocasio-Cortez wants to ax Homeland Security. Some conservatives didn’t want it to begin with.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Marisa Iati'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/07/11/ocasio-cortez-wants-axe-homeland-security-some-conservatives-didnt-want-it-begin-with/,"

Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security.

The department’s creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast “the New Yorker Radio Hour.” She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an “egregious mistake.”

“People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies,” she told the New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick.

Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman’s proposal.

“Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb,” former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.

""Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.

[‘Outright disrespectful’: Four House women struggle as Pelosi isolates them]

The usefulness of a Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn’t always taken for granted. President George W. Bush’s administration initially had “zero interest” in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Richard B. Cheney thought it would needlessly increase the size of government.

“Creating a Cabinet post doesn’t solve the problem,” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.

Some members of Congress worried the White House was concealing the department’s true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of government, USA Today reported in 2002. Certain conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said they would not oppose Bush’s proposal but wanted to move slowly, according to the Houston Chronicle.

When the House of Representatives initially voted on the department’s creation the following July, 132 members opposed the move, including 10 Republicans. Congress eventually passed the Homeland Security Act and Bush signed it into law that November, creating the Department of Homeland Security.

Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that her proposal was “not that radical,” citing the reluctance of some members of Congress to support the department’s creation less than two decades ago.

“When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned — incl GOP — that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

It’s really not that radical.

Like some members of Congress, non-politicians also criticized the new department, which merged 22 federal agencies tasked with securing the country’s borders, protecting its infrastructure and guarding against terrorism.

James Bamford, a journalist and filmmaker who covers intelligence agencies, told CBS News in 2002 that creating Homeland Security was a public relations move that could actually decrease efficiency.

“Instead of moving people together, you should be moving information together,” Bamford told CBS. “You should be taking information and finding better ways to distribute it; faster ways to distribute it among people.”

In a 2003 article in National Review, conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru criticized Bush’s record as president, noting that Bush had “raised defense spending, given new powers to law enforcement, federalized airport security and created a new cabinet department for homeland security. . . . More people are working for the federal government than at any point since the end of the Cold War.”

[‘I hate this mission,’ says operator of new emergency shelter for migrant children]

Homeland Security was originally staffed by 180,000 employees from the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal offices. It also encompasses the agencies that oversee immigration, including Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security now has a workforce of more than 240,000, making it the government’s third-biggest department, behind Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Transportation Security Administration, which screens passengers at airports, was absorbed into Homeland Security just a year after it was created in response to 9/11 in November 2001. Conservatives at the time expressed concern that the new agency was unnecessarily bureaucratic and gave too much power to the government.

“Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust,” Slate reported. “The second most common opinion was fear.”

Republicans’ ire for the TSA survived a decade after the agency’s creation. Then-Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) in 2011 said Americans were “no safer today than they were before 9/11,” according to Forbes. The GOP’s 2012 presidential platform called for the privatization of airport security.

Calls to abolish Homeland Security are now made year after year, in publications ranging from policy journals to mainstream news outlets. In a tweet from 2018 shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) recalled a time when conservatives viewed Homeland Security as overly bureaucratic.

“Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS — as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government,” wrote Amash, who announced on the Fourth of July that he was leaving the Republican Party. “If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.”

""Administrator Wheeler, I'd like to ask you to please support a fair contract for EPA workers,"" Loreen Targos, an EPA scientist in the Great Lakes area, is seen saying in a video provided by the union. ""Please reward my award-winning labor by negotiating a fair contract.""

Targos was receiving a Silver Medal award on stage at EPA headquarters when she unveiled a banner reading ""Care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health & climate change, Do you?"" She also criticized the agency's recent unilateral change to the master bargaining agreement with the American Federation of Government Employees, one of several unions representing EPA employees.

Targos said a fair contract is needed to continue research into ""fighting climate change.""

This comes on the back of several instances where government workers have spoken out against the administration's policies, including when employees of the Department of Agriculture turned their backs to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at a meeting last month in protest of the announced office relocation to Kansas City.

Level 1 - Exercise normal precautions

Level 2 - Exercise increased caution

Level 3 - Reconsider travel

Level 4 - Do not travel

About half of Asia is classed as low risk, but there are six countries, including Iran, Iraq, and Yemen that are designated Level 4, mostly due to military conflicts, crime, and terrorism threats.

Tracy Jerome Jester Jr. of Forsyth, Georgia, died on March 17 of ""respiratory illness,"" after a day of sightseeing while vacationing at a resort, his mother Melody Moore, told ABC News.

Jester, who was 31, was vacationing with his sister on the island, Moore said.

The name of the resort was not immediately available.

""We can confirm the death of a U.S. citizen in the Dominican Republic in March 2019,"" a state department spokesperson told ABC News in a statement. ""We offer our sincerest condolences to the family for their loss. Out of respect for the family during this difficult time, we do not have additional information to provide.""

There was no immediate evidence linking his death to any of the other tourists who have died. U.S. State Department officials say there has been no ""uptick"" in American deaths in the Caribbean country despite a sudden rise in media attention on the country.

In June, a couple from Maryland, Edward Nathaniel Holmes, 63, and Cynthia Ann Day, 49, were found dead in their hotel room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana Resort in San Pedro de Macoris. Autopsy results revealed the cause of death as respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, officials said.

Moore said she spoke to her son around 7:40 p.m. on the night before he died. Jeter had told her he'd been out sightseeing that day and planned to leave at 10 a.m. the next morning to fly home.

Shortly afterwards, her daughter called to say Jester was vomiting and complaining he couldn’t breathe, Moore said.

Moore said she instructed her daughter to call 911.

“I was panicking because I couldn’t get to my children,” Moore told ABC News.

Her daughter told her Jester ""just dropped to his knees and started throwing up blood, and was calling for Mama,” she said. By 4:40 a.m., she said, “he was gone.”

Although Jester's body was returned home on April 4, Moore said she knows nothing but what’s written on the death certificate: ""respiratory issues."" She confirmed that her son had lupus.

Moore said the family has not ordered a toxicology report because Jester died before the other reported deaths in the Dominican Republic.

DHS reopening Tornillo holding facility but will turn it into an ICE detention center: Officials,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Washington Examiner Anna Giaritelli'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-reopening-tornillo-holding-facility-but-will-turn-it-into-an-ice-detention-center-officials,"TORNILLO, Texas — The Homeland Security Department will open an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center for adults in the coming weeks in the space outside Customs and Border Protection's Tornillo port facility, which was the center of protests last summer as a holding site for unaccompanied children, according to two Border Patrol officials with knowledge of the operation.

Construction was underway Saturday afternoon when the Washington Examiner passed through the Customs and Border Protection port of entry, now known as the Marcelino Serna Port of Entry. The town of Tornillo sits 30 miles southeast of downtown El Paso, Texas.

A large metal frame, comparable to the ones used for the massive white tents in Rio Grande Valley and El Paso, Texas, began going up this week, though officials have not decided whether to use tents or modular homes, one source said.

The structure that will be used as the tent frame was being installed Saturday. (Washington Examiner/Anna Giaritelli)

""That place is only supposed to hold adults. No Border Patrol will be working there, but I guarantee it's going to be a disaster,"" the first official wrote in a text.

""Its going to open the end of this month into early next month,"" the second official said.

Last summer, CBP stood up a Border Patrol-operated outdoor detention center for unaccompanied children to be housed while they awaited transfer to Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement. The facility is not a Border Patrol station or forward-operating base, but sector officials opted to use the adjacent land to put up dozens of tents, which housed bunk beds for children.

The camp was set up during a wave of family separations late last spring and activists from around the country showed up outside the government property to protest for months children being held, including those who arrived on their own and those who were taken away from parents. It was closed down in January as apprehension numbers in El Paso began to spike.

""There were a lot of activists, a lot of protests. So they said, 'We don’t want this. We’re gonna shut this down,'"" the second official said.

The new temporary facility will house approximately 2,500 people, likely waiting to be deported or who have made asylum claims but were not released by Border Patrol.

A statement released by CBP spokesman Roger Maier to media outlets states it will serve as overflow for Border Patrol stations. However, CBP data shows the number of single adults taken into custody in the region dropped 30% from May to June, prompting questions for why the sector would move now to put up a supplemental tent facility for Border Patrol if the numbers are declining."

The bill, H.R. 299, enables homebuyers using a VA loan to borrow above the 2019 limit of $484,350 for most counties, without any down payment.

A VA spokesperson told HousingWire that the loan limit will be lifted for loans that are guaranteed or appraised on or after January 1, 2020, and that guidance for lenders would be coming ahead of this date, published on the VA home loan circular page of its website.

The VA also clarified other changes that will go into effect as a result of the bill.

In addition to alleviating limits for veterans looking to purchase a home, H.R. 299 temporarily increase rates for certain loans by 0.15-0.30%, the VA said.

The slight bump in loan fees is intended to help finance health care costs for veterans who are suffering the effects of Agent Orange exposure as a result of their service.

Additional changes to the VA’s loan guaranty program include the elimination of funding fee differences for borrowers who are veterans versus those who are members of the Reserve.

It also removes the loan limit for the Native American Direct Loan Program, exempts Purple Heart recipients from paying loan fees, and authorizes VA-designated appraisers to rely on third parties for appraisal-related information.

The bill’s passage comes after years of lobbying on behalf of numerous trade groups, including the National Association of Realtors, which teamed with other housing industry trade groups to ensure veterans’ health care benefits would be extended without a significant increase to VA loan fees.

Now that the bill has passed, it is expected to “fast-track” disability compensation for as many as 90,000 affected former service members, according to military.com.

"EPA restores broad use of pesticide opposed by beekeepers - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.10tv.com/article/epa-restores-broad-use-pesticide-opposed-beekeepers-2019-jul,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency will allow farmers to resume broad use of a pesticide over objections from beekeepers, citing private chemical industry studies that the agency says show the product does only lower-level harm to bees and wildlife.

Friday's EPA announcement — coming after the agriculture industry accused the agency of unduly favoring honeybees — makes sulfoxaflor the latest bug- and weed-killer allowed by the Trump administration despite lawsuits alleging environmental or human harm. The pesticide is made by Corteva Agriscience, a spinoff created last month out of the DowDuPont merger and restructuring.

Honeybees pollinate billions of dollars of food crops annually in the United States, but agriculture and other land uses that cut into their supply of pollen, as well as pesticides, parasites and other threats, have them on a sharp decline. The University of Maryland said U.S. beekeepers lost 38 percent of their bee colonies last winter alone, the highest one-winter loss in the 13-year history of their survey.

Advertisement - Story continues below

Emails and other records obtained from the EPA through Freedom of Information Act litigation by the Sierra Club, and provided to The Associated Press, show sorghum growers in particular had pressed senior officials at the agency for a return to broad use of sulfoxaflor.

Sorghum growers regard honeybees as just another ""non-native livestock"" in the United States, lobbyist Joe Bischoff said in one 2017 email to agency officials, and by cutting threats to the bees, ""EPA has chosen that form of agriculture over all others.""

A federal appeals court had ordered the EPA to withdraw approval for sulfoxaflor in 2015, ruling in a lawsuit brought by U.S. beekeeping groups that not enough was known about what it did to bees.

EPA Assistant Administrator Alexandra Dapolito Dunn said Friday that new industry studies that have not been made public show a low level of harm to bees and other creatures beyond the targeted crop pests.

Dunn said EPA's newly reset rules for use of sulfoxaflor, such as generally prohibiting spraying of fruit and nut-bearing plants in bloom, when pollinators would be attracted to the flowers, would limit harm to bees. She called it ""an important and highly effective tool for growers.""

Michele Colopy, program director of the Pollinator Stewardship Council, one of the beekeeping groups that had successfully sued to block sulfoxaflor, said the EPA limits weren't enough to protect bees and other beneficial bugs whose numbers are declining.

""We understand farmers want to have every tool in their toolbox,"" when it comes to curbing insects that damage crops. ""But the ... pesticides are just decimating beneficial insects,"" Colopy said.

An environmental group charged the EPA with sidestepping the usual public review in reapproving broader use of the pesticide.

""The Trump EPA's reckless approval... without any public process is a terrible blow to imperiled pollinators,"" said Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's environmental health program.

INVESTIGATION: Veterans owed millions in refunds on VA home loans,https://www.13newsnow.com,"['Author', 'Published', 'Pm Edt July', 'Updated']",07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/investigation-veterans-owed-millions-in-refunds-on-va-home-loans/291-e2434652-86a8-4d91-85df-071b86dbc7a5,"NORFOLK, Va. — A new report from the VA’s Inspector General accuses senior officials in the Department of Veterans Affairs of failing to protect the financial interests of disabled veterans who used the agency’s popular home loan guarantee program.

As a result, the Department of Veterans Affairs owes approximately 53,200 veterans an estimated $189 million in home loan refunds, according to the report.

The findings by the VA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) mirror the disclosures in TEGNA’s Funding Fee Fiasco investigation.

TEGNA’s investigation revealed that senior VA managers in Washington were warned about funding fee overcharges five years ago by officials in the St. Paul, Minnesota Regional Loan Center, but failed to take corrective action.

The OIG report called what took place “troubling.”

OIG’s report states, “Because inappropriate funding fee charges were not refunded, many exempt veterans may have suffered significant financial losses.”

What’s more, since officials didn’t act when they were alerted about the problem in 2014, the overcharges have continued.

The refund amounts veterans are owed are often substantial. The average funding fee charge was $4,483, with the largest topping out at $19,470.

Roger’s VA Home Loan

Roger Roath purchased his Lakeville, Minnesota home with the help of the VA’s widely praised Home Loan Guarantee Program. The history of why he is owed money is buried in his stack of home loan records.

The nation’s debt to Roger began in the 1960s when he enlisted in the Navy.

“I served in Vietnam off the Gulf of Tonkin from 1968 to 1969... aircraft carrier,” he said proudly.

Roger said he’s had ringing in his ears ever since. So in 2011, he applied for a disability rating with the VA. After an initial denial, he appealed. His claim was eventually approved, but it took time.

“Approximately three years later,” he recalled.

Roger Roath is one of tens of thousands of veterans nationwide a KARE 11 investigation has discovered are owed a home loan refund

KARE

While his disability case was still pending, Roger refinanced his loan as interest rates continued to go down.

“Twice: 2011 and 2013,” he said. He used the VA’s Home Loan Program both times.

Disability waivers

Veterans who use the VA program are generally required to pay what’s called a ""Funding Fee"" -- up to 3.3 percent of the loan amount. In Roger’s case, that added up to thousands of dollars.

For disabled veterans, however, that funding fee is waived.

Since Roger’s disability claim was still pending when he refinanced his VA loan, he had to pay the fee.

But the VA’s own rules say that if a disability claim is approved after a loan is finalized – and the disability rating is made retroactive like Roger’s was – the veteran is due a refund of the funding fees.

Unfortunately, Roger says he didn’t know about that until he saw an investigative report on KARE 11, TEGNA’s Minneapolis station, detailing a problem in the VA’s Home Loan program.

And he is not alone.

Whistleblowers: veterans weren’t informed

In May, a whistleblower provided internal VA records that revealed a bombshell. Disabled veterans across the county who were owed home loan refunds weren’t always getting them, according to an analysis of funding fees done back in 2014 by employees at the VA’s St. Paul Regional Loan Center.

Between 2006 and 2014, “VA inappropriately collected approximately $150,901,534 on 47,588 loans,” their report concluded at the time.

Multiple VA insiders, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs, said that high ranking officials at Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters in Washington, D.C., were informed of the issue five years ago.

Despite the warning, they said officials failed to ensure that veterans got the refunds they deserved.

Records show that Mike Frueh, then Director of the VA Loan Guaranty Program, and Deputy Director Jeffrey London were made aware in 2014 that veterans were being inappropriately charged and not given refunds.

Frueh was later promoted to Chief of Staff for Veterans Benefits and Jeffrey London took over from his old boss and is now Executive Director of the Loan Guaranty Service.

The newly released OIG investigation confirms the managers had been warned about the outstanding debts owed to veterans and did nothing to rectify the overcharges.

The OIG Investigation

“Disturbingly, as of January 2019, Loan Guaranty Service management had not taken action to issue refunds to these exempt veterans,” the OIG report states.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior VBA management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” VA Assistant Inspector General for Audits and Evaluations Larry Reinkeymer wrote in the report.

Read the OIG investigation:

Meanwhile, the number of veterans affected and the amount they are owed grew, from an estimated $150 million in 2014 to $189 million by the end of 2017, the OIG investigation found.

The OIG report warned the totals could soar even higher.

“The review team estimated that VA could owe an additional 34,400 exempt veterans funding fee refunds of $164 million over the next five years if adequate controls are not implemented to minimize or detect these inappropriate charges,” the report states.

On April 26, 2019, TEGNA’s investigative team began requesting interviews with VA officials about the delayed refunds. They declined.

But after failing for years to take action, the VA suddenly issued a press release on May 13, just days before TEGNA’s first report was released. The VA announced major reform efforts are underway. The release also said VA is conducting an ongoing internal review looking at millions of loans dating back to 1998 to determine if additional refunds are needed.

Watch the original investigation below:



The OIG investigation reviewed loans made in 2012 through 2017. It determined nearly 73,000 veterans had improper funding fees adding up to $286 million. Some of those veterans did receive the refunds they deserved. The study says approximately 19,000 veterans – roughly one in four – received refunds totaling $97 million. However, the review team estimated the VA still owed approximately 53,200 veterans refunds totaling $189 million.

The VA managers who sat on the problem blamed their failure to notify veterans on “competing priorities” including processing high volumes of applications.

To that point, the OIG investigative team wrote, “…their priorities should have included issuing funding fee refunds to exempt veterans and implementing controls to minimize or detect future inappropriate charges.”

The OIG report also states the Under Secretary for Benefits “indicated that the financial impact to veterans is minimal when amortized over the life of a loan.”

Getting refunds

Impacted veterans like Andrew Ganfield don’t agree with that sentiment.

“It’s 10-grand off the principal of my mortgage,” said Ganfield. ""That’s a big deal!""

Ganfield is one of the veterans who called the VA loan center and demand a refund after seeing TEGNA’s first report about the funding fee overcharges.

A VA employee called him back leaving a voicemail stating he appeared to be eligible to have that $10,197 refunded and applied to his loan balance.

Listen to the voicemail Andrew received from the VA below:

If you think you may be entitled to a refund of the funding fee, contact the VA Loan Center at 1-877-827-3702.

"Roofing, paving, artisanal bread: Feds look to kick-start law that will free hundreds of inmates",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kevin Johnson', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/11/first-step-act-doj-looks-prepare-inmates-early-release-prison-justice-reform/1691490001/,"ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Set in the foothills of the soaring Rocky Mountains, the mud-colored cluster of Depression-era structures has been a fixture in the federal penal system for decades.

Although just 10 miles south of Denver, notoriety has rarely found its way here except on the occasions when the Federal Correctional Institute Englewood’s worn cellblocks have housed the likes of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich

Now, the 320-acre compound – distinguished by coils of razor wire and guard tower – is poised to play a leading role in a major criminal justice experiment.

Justice Department officials, including newly-installed Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, have cut a path to this unlikely place in recent days to tout a series of rehabilitation programs that could be key to supporting the early release and re-entry of waves of federal inmates set to be released as part of a criminal justice overhaul approved by Congress last year.

Inside Englewood, a culinary arts program is training aspiring chefs to pump out artisanal breads, pastries and cakes. An architectural drafting operation, manned by inmates, has produced designs for hundreds of chain restaurants and is assisting with a flood prevention project for the Port Authority of New York.

The prison’s signature enterprise, however, may be its most promising. Thirteen inmates are part of a roofing and road paving crew that travels the country more than seven months of the year tending to repairs and new construction at federal government installations scattered from the Great Lakes to New England. The crew members, many of whom have acquired valuable commercial drivers’ licenses while in prison and the skills to operate heavy machinery, have saved the federal government nearly $30 million in labor costs during the past three years, federal authorities said.

""I never thought I would get a chance to do something like this in prison,"" said Littlelee Ragsdale, a 36-year-old Wyoming man who is in the midst of a nine-year term for methamphetamine and heroin distribution. ""This a great opportunity for a real career outside of here. It's not just one of those jobs to get by. Re-entry (to the free world) is now a realistic goal.""

Leaning on the promise of Englewood’s programs and others like them scattered across the Bureau of Prisons system, Attorney General William Barr later this month is expected to unveil a tool that could shave years from the sentences of non-violent offenders like Ragsdale as part of the First Step Act, a sweeping law designed to reduce the federal prison population while easing offenders' transition back to their communities. Congress approved the law last year with support from both parties.

Barr is set to lay out rules on July 19 for evaluating federal inmates that could speed their path toward release. On the same day, a separate provision of the law will prompt the release of an estimated 2,200 offenders based on a re-calculation of the credit they receive for good behavior while in custody.

The new law represents a sea change in criminal justice policy which once advocated for the harshest punishments possible for offenders, including non-violent drug addicts who were swept up in en mass during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s. The reversal, largely driven by spiraling prison costs and racial disparities in the enforcement of such punitive measures has garnered support of an unusual political alliance: At the vanguard is Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and the man he hopes to unseat, President Donald Trump.

""My visit here is an indicator of the fact that we are working very hard on the First Step Act to comply with both the law and what we think Congress and the people who sponsored the bill intended,"" Rosen said in an interview with USA TODAY following a two-hour walking tour of the Englewood campus. ""We're pushing it hard; I'm putting my personal attention on that. The attorney general is, too.""

More than 1,000 freed so far

The vast federal prison system has long been a drag on the government, soaking up more than a quarter of the Justice Department's $28 billion budget.

Even though its prison population has dropped since 2014, with 180,664 inmates, it is still the largest penal system in the United States. The system holds more than seven times as many inmates as it did in 1980, at the start of the nation's drug war and a ""tough-on-crime"" strategy that featured mandatory minimum prison sentences for repeat drug offenses that doomed some inmates to more than two decades behind bars. More than 45% of federal inmates are now serving terms for some type of drug offense, by far the largest offense grouping in the system.

The First Step Act, signed into law by Trump last year, is an attempt to both chip away at the spiraling incarceration costs and better prepare offenders for release by driving down rates of recidivism.

The law gave judges more discretion in sentencing non-violent drug offenders, and eases some of the long mandatory-minimum sentences for convicts with only minor criminal records. It allows the government to more easily release seriously ill inmates and seeks to reconcile extreme sentencing disparities between people who sell crack compared to powdered cocaine. That provision alone has already freed 1,093 inmates and led to shorter sentences for 1,540 others.

Longtime advocates for such criminal justice reforms, who also have often been the fiercest critics of the Justice Department, are encouraged by the recent action but are wary of the challenges confronting full implementation of the law.

""I think they are doing their best to get prepared,"" said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which has long highlighted the impact of harsh sentencing policy on families of the incarcerated. ""The real test will be in the implementation of all of the different pieces.""

Ring said more attention and money will be needed to support job training and drug treatment programs. He said his group remains disappointed that several classes of offenders will be excluded from qualifying for increased credits for good behavior that can be earned by participating in rehabilitation programs. Those groups include: inmates convicted of terrorism, human trafficking, sex crimes, weapons-related offenses, some fraud crimes and drug traffickers.

""There is going to be some frustration,"" Ring said, referring to the excluded classes of inmates.

Hugh Hurwtiz, acting director of the federal prison system, also acknowledged that the exclusions represent a looming inmate management test for prison staffers.

""How do you manage inmates who are getting the credits and those who are not? That will be a challenge as we roll this out,"" Hurwitz said.

The roll out also comes at a time when the prison system is grappling with persistent staffing shortages. To make up for a shortage of guards, officials have ordered teachers, nurses, kitchen workers and other staffers to serve as correctional officers.

The practice, known as augmentation, has drawn staff away from rehabilitation programs that officials are now touting. It also has prompted criticism from some members of Congress who regard the practice as potentially dangerous.

Rosen, the deputy attorney general, said provisions of the new law ""will put additional demands"" on prison staffers and he indicated that Justice was reviewing staffing across the BOP. But he believed that current personnel levels were not jeopardizing safety.

""Everyone who is trained to work at a federal prison learns to participate in the security role,"" he said. ""But we're looking at that and plan to do whatever makes sense.""

'I plan to start my own company'

Dressed in a neatly pressed prison uniform, Littlelee Ragsdale looked the part of an inmate eager to turn the page on a troubled life.

Ragsdale, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, did not hesitate last week when called on to address Englewood's special guest – the deputy attorney general of the United States – to describe how his experience on the prison's roofing and road paving crew could change his life when his sentence is complete in 2023.

""I have a wife and three girls,"" Ragsdale began, adding that his work as a heavy equipment operator had prepared him to assume a new role of responsibility for a waiting family. ""I plan to start my own company.""

Even with the help of Englewood's program, Ragsdale's path will not be easy.

Ragsdale's brush with law enforcement authorities in 2016 was not a one-time mistake.

The former oil field worker has a criminal record that dates to 2001, including burglary and car theft, according to a Wyoming prosecutor familiar with his current case. Past social media posts and photographs also appear to show a fascination with firearms, including an image in which he posed with array of hand guns and rifles.

""If you want re-integration to be successful, you need to think about re-integration at the point of intake in the prison system, not just at the end,"" said Jeff Mellow, a professor of criminal justice at New York's John Jay College.

""When they are ready to leave, you really want to make sure that the first 90 days go smoothly. If they keep hitting that wall in a search for housing or a job many will eventually give up. You only have to think about people who make New Year's resolutions. How long do they last? To be successful post-release, it's so important to have all the resources in place.""

EPA green-lights insecticide,https://www.thegardenisland.com,[],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.thegardenisland.com/2019/07/13/hawaii-news/epa-green-lights-insecticide/,"LIHUE — While pesticide manufacturers say green-lighting the insecticide sulfoxaflor for use in the U.S. will provide local farmers with better pest-management tools, beekeepers on Kauai say the action is a step in the wrong direction.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced the decision Friday to resume broad use of the pesticide used to control bugs like aphids and made by Corteva Agriscience, a company that has some operations on Kauai.

Sulfoxaflor is also marketed as the insecticide Isoclast, an insect neurotoxin.

“After conducting an extensive risk analysis, including the review of one of the agency’s largest datasets on the effects of pesticide on bees, EPA is approving the use of sulfoxaflor on alfalfa, corn, cacao, grains, pineapple, sorghum, teff, teosinte, tree plantations, citrus, cotton, cucurbits, soybeans and strawberries,” EPA said in a news release Friday.

Representatives from Corteva Agriscience, which does not produce any pesticides on Kauai, said Friday they’re pleased with the EPA decision.

“Growers should have access to tools that can be used safely according to the product label. Isoclast was developed to provide an alternative that helps reduce stress on the environment,” said Laurie Yoshida, communications specialist for Corteva.

Friday’s EPA announcement — coming after the agriculture industry accused the agency of unduly favoring honeybees — makes sulfoxaflor the latest bug and weed-killer allowed by the Trump administration, despite lawsuits alleging environmental or human harm.

Honeybees pollinate billions of dollars of food crops annually in the U.S., but agriculture and other land uses that cut into their supply of pollen, as well as pesticides, parasites and other threats, have them on a sharp decline. The University of Maryland said U.S. beekeepers lost 38 percent of their bee colonies last winter alone, the highest one-winter loss in the 13-year history of their survey.

EPA Assistant Administrator Alexandra Dapolito Dunn said Friday that new industry studies that have not been made public show a low level of harm to bees and other creatures beyond the targeted crop pests.

Dunn said EPA’s newly-reset rules for use of sulfoxaflor, such as generally prohibiting the spraying of fruit- and nut-bearing plants in bloom, when pollinators would be attracted to the flowers, would limit harm to bees. She called it “an important and highly effective tool for growers.”

However, beekeepers across the nation, including on Kauai, say the caveats on the sulfoxaflor approval aren’t enough to protect pollinators.

“For beekeepers, this is a step in the wrong direction,” said Kauai beekeeper James Trujillo. “The decision to restore this product for agricultural uses on honeybee-attracting crops can only put these important pollinators at greater risk.”

Trujillo points out the honeybee population is further threatened by the administration’s decision to suspend data-collection for the national Honey Bee Colonies Report, “the most important reporting program for honeybee health.”

Michele Colopy, program director of the Pollinator Stewardship Council, one of the beekeeping groups that had successfully sued to block sulfoxaflor, said the EPA limits weren’t enough to protect bees and other beneficial bugs whose numbers are declining.

“We understand farmers want to have every tool in their toolbox” when it comes to curbing insects that damage crops. “But the … pesticides are just decimating beneficial insects,” Colopy said.

Sulfoxaflor was first approved for use by the EPA in 2013 and restricted use to exclude crops that attract bees in 2016.

"Bill Clinton 'knows nothing' about financier Jeffrey Epstein's 'terrible crimes,' former president's spokesman says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-clinton-knows-nothing-about-financier-jeffrey-epsteins-terrible-crimes-former-presidents-spokesman-says,"Bill Clinton ""knows nothing"" about the ""terrible crimes"" linked to Jeffrey Epstein, the former president's spokesman said Monday, in Clinton's first statement after new sex-trafficking charges were lobbed against the wealthy financier.

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old wealthy hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said. ""Staff, supporters of the foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and he has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.”

Separately, claims in court showed that President Trump may have flown on the jet at least once, as well.

CUSHY PLEA BARGAIN WITH EPSTEIN WAS SO BAD IT BROKE THE LAW, JUDGE RULES

Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr said he has recused himself from the matter ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

On Saturday evening, Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned conspicuously that it is ""quite likely that some of our faves are implicated"" in the ""horrific"" sex-trafficking case.

""This Epstein case is horrific and the young women deserve justice,"" Pelosi tweeted. ""It is quite likely that some of our faves are implicated but we must follow the facts and let the chips fall where they may - whether on Republicans or Democrats.""

For his part, Trump previously called attention to Clinton's dealings with the financier.

""Nice guy -- uh, got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island, with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2015, referring to Clinton's connections with Epstein. ""A lot of problems.""

Meanwhile, Trump biographer Tim O'Brien this weekend reposted an excerpt fom a 2002 profile of Epstein in New York Magazine, in which Trump told a reporter, ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago estate “because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” according to court documents filed by Bradley Edwards, the lawyer who has represented several Epstein accusers. That claim has not been confirmed by Trump or Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein appeared Monday in a hearing that lasted about 30 minutes wearing a blue prison top with a brown T-shirt underneath, in addition to orange slip-on sneakers. Prosecutors said in the 36 hours since Epstein's arrest, multiple attorneys and several individuals have come forward and said they were victims, none of whom had previously been spoken to.

FORMER FBI OFFICIAL: INDICTMENT OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN IS 'PLACEHOLDER,' EXPECT DOZENS MORE CHARGES IN NEAR FUTURE

Epstein allegedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other underage girls.

""This allowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference.

Berman added that nude photographs ""of what appeared to be underage girls"" were discovered at Epstein's Manhattan mansion during a search following his arrest Saturday. The hundreds of photos were discovered in a locked safe, according to officials.

Prosecutors also allege Epstein ""worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates"" who helped facilitate his conduct by contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 66-year-old at his mansion in New York City and Palm, Beach, Fla.

At Epstein's multi-story mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform a massage on him.

""The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the 'massage,'"" prosecutors wrote. ""During the encounter, Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals.""

In Monday's court appearance, prosecutors said that the massage room in New York was set up exactly as how the alleged victims described it 15 years ago.

CHRISTINE PELOSI WARNS IT'S 'QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF OUR FAVES ARE IMPLICATED' IN 'HORRIFIC' EPSTEIN CASE

Victims would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash by either Epstein or one of his associates or employees, according to prosecutors. The 66-year-old also allegedly ""incentivized his victims"" to become recruiters by paying the victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl brought to him.

""In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit,"" federal prosecutors said.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said that Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 5 p.m. on Saturday ""without incident."" Epstein is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail near the Manhattan courthouse where he appeared Monday afternoon.

A former State Department employee was sentenced to 40 months in prison for concealing her interactions with two Chinese intelligence agents, along with the extravagant gifts they gave her in exchange for government information.

Candace Claiborne began to work as an office management specialist at the State Department in 1999, according to court documents. She had a top secret security clearance and served overseas in such cities as Baghdad, Beijing and Shanghai.

But she ignored her responsibility to report foreign contacts, prosecutors said as they announced her sentence on Tuesday.

""Claiborne was entrusted with privileged information as a U.S. government employee, and she abused that trust at the expense of our nation's security,"" Acting Assistant Director John Selleck of the FBI's Washington Field Office said in a statement. ""The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face,"" he added.

Over the course of five years, Chinese agents allegedly gave Claiborne and her family ""tens of thousands of dollars"" in gifts and perks – including wired cash, a monthly stipend, overseas trips, tuition at a Chinese fashion school and an apartment that was fully furnished. In exchange for the gifts, Claiborne gave them a window into the State Department's inner workings through copies of internal documents about dignitary visits and other topics.

Prosecutors said she told a co-conspirator that the agents were ""spies"" and wrote in her journal that she could ""Generate 20k in 1 year"" by working with one of the agents.

Federal public defender David Walker Bos, Claiborne's attorney, did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Her arrest came in March 2017 after a sting operation in January of that year. An FBI agent, posing as a Chinese agent, approached Claiborne on a street in Washington, D.C. She welcomed him to her home and their lengthy discussion ended with the undercover agent thanking her for helping the ""Ministry,"" NPR previously reported.

After the arrest, she pleaded not guilty to charges of obstruction and making false statements to the FBI. In April 2019, she pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. In the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to drop the other charges.

A judge ordered Claiborne detained pending sentencing, but she requested to self-surrender on June 5, the document stated.

In addition to a 40-month prison sentence, Claiborne received three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000.

Her sentence comes after former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee pleaded guilty this spring to spying for China – and as U.S. officials have warned that Chinese espionage is the country's most serious security threat."

Castro said that Johnson's suggestion that doing so would be tantamount to having open borders echoed a ""right-wing talking point.""

Asked during a presidential candidate town hall hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens what he thought of Johnson's so-called friendly fire, Castro said the criticism was ""obviously not friendly.""

""I would say that Secretary Johnson is wrong, Vice President Biden is wrong on this and Congressman O’Rourke is wrong on this,"" Castro said.

Castro noted that ""until about 2004, we treated crossing the border as a civil violation, not a criminal violation,"" and said by conflating that with the notion of open borders, Johnson was repeating a prominent political argument on the right.

""Secretary Johnson has suggested somehow that people will take that as open borders. Open borders are a right-wing talking point,"" he said, pointing to current enforcement mechanisms on the U.S. southern border, like existing fencing and the presence of Border Patrol agents.

He also argued that migrants crossing the border without permission often do so with the intention of presenting themselves to Border Patrol and law enforcement officials.

""They want to present themselves to our border officials,"" Castro said. ""It makes no sense to make policy based out of fear, political fear."""
"USDA Makes Few Changes In Corn, Soybean Production Thursday",https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-drops-us-corn-acreage-market-goes-up-thursday,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The USDA made little changes for U.S. corn and soybean production and ending stocks estimates in its July monthly report released Thursday.

As a result, the markets dropped initially. However, since the 11:00 a.m. release, the farm markets have recovered.

At the close, the Sep. corn futures finished 9 1/4¢ higher at $4.44 1/4. Dec. corn futures finished 8 1/2¢ higher at $4.48.



Aug. soybean futures are 4 1/2¢ higher at $8.99. November soybean futures finished 4 1/2¢ higher at $9.17 3/4.

Sep. wheat futures closed 16 3/4¢ higher at $5.21 1/2.

August soymeal futures settled $1.70 per short ton higher at $312.40. August soy oil futures closed $0.09 higher at 28.18¢ per pound.

In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.20 lower, the U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 150 points higher.

Corn

In its July Crop Production Report the USDA pegged the U.S. 2019 corn production at 13.875 billion bushels vs. the trade’s expectations of 13.3 billion bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 13.68 billion.

The U.S. 2019 corn yield is estimated at 166 bushels per acre vs. the trade’s estimate of 164 bu./acre and the USDA’s previous estimate of 166 bu./acre.

Soybeans

For soybeans, the U.S. 2019 production is pegged at 3.84 billion bushels vs. the trade’s estimate of 3.871 billion bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 4.15 billion.

The USDA sees the U.S. soybean yield averaging 48.5 bu./acre vs. the trade’s expectation of 48.4 bu./acre and the governmental agency’s previous estimate of 49.5.



U.S. 2018/19 Ending Stocks

In its report, the USDA pegged the U.S. 2018/19 corn ending stocks at 2.34 billion bushels vs. the trade’s estimate of 2.21 billion bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 2.19 billion.

For soybeans, the old-crop ending stocks were estimated at 1.05 billion bushels vs. the trade’s expectations of 1.05 billion and the USDA’s June estimate of 1.07 billion.

U.S. 2019/2020 Ending Stocks

For corn, the new-crop ending stocks are pegged at 2.01 billion bushels vs. the trade’s expectations of 1.589 billion bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 1.67 billion.

For soybeans, new-crop ending stocks are estimated at 795 million bushels vs. the trade’s expectation of 816 million bushels and the USDA’s June estimate of 1.045 billion bushels.

USDA pegged the U.S. new-crop wheat ending stocks at 1.00 billion bushels vs. the trade’s expectation of 1.031 billion and the USDA’s June estimate of 1.072 billion.

World 2018/19 Ending Stocks

In its report Thursday, the USDA pegged the world corn ending stocks at 328 million metric tons vs. the trade’s expectation of 327 million mt. and its June estimate of 325 mmt.

For soybeans, world ending stocks are estimated at 113 mmt. vs. the trade’s estimate of 113 mmt. and the USDA’s June estimate of 112 mmt.

The world wheat stocks are pegged at 275 mmt. vs. the trade’s expectation of 275 mmt. and the USDA’s June estimate of 276 mmt.

Trade Response

Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that on the surface, today’s USDA/WASDE report showed some tightening of wheat supplies versus last month, but overall global supplies of wheat are more than adequate.

""The underlying story in today’s report is definitely the global tightening of the soybean balance sheet, with global bean stocks down over 7% and global production down over 9%. Global usage of soybeans is projected higher, even in the face of the swine flu pandemic in Asia. All eyes will be on the August WASDE for more clarity around yields and acres, which are the big unknown variables right now,"" Gilbertie says.

Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that the WASDE report's world wheat production causing increased U.S. export demand potential was the bullish highlight.

""USDA used the June acres for corn and beans and that led to reduced beans and increased corn production estimates that no one thinks is accurate. The naysayers might be right. We pivoted to weather right away, as July is supposed to be hot and dry. These crops are so far behind that hot and dry in July could really hurt the corn and maybe the beans. Reversal day in the corn, so maybe we got some upside coming tomorrow and next week."""
Interior Dept. says it spent $2.45M in public funds on Trump’s ‘Salute to America’,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://wtop.com/dc/2019/07/interior-dept-says-it-spent-2-45m-in-public-funds-on-trumps-salute-to-america/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of department's share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July 4 ""Salute to America"" at $2.45 million.

In a letter to lawmakers on Capitol Hill made public Thursday, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of the department’s share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July Fourth “Salute to America” at the Lincoln Memorial at $2.45 million.

Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations’ spending for concerts, parades and other celebrations in and around the National Mall.

Interior’s costs included crowd accommodations, such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.

The disclosure confirms what The Washington Post had previously reported: that close to $2.5 million was diverted from the National Park Service, which normally uses the money from entrance and recreation fees to make improvements to U.S. parks.

Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the public funds were used to “celebrate President Trump.”

There are further concerns from local leaders as well.

In a Tuesday letter to Trump, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the president’s Fourth of July event on the National Mall, as well as protests by others, have left the city’s security fund bankrupt, and that it will be running at a deficit of more than $6 million by the end of September.

She attributed the Emergency Planning and Security Fund (EPSF) numbers to estimates by the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency and said the total cost for the District is estimated at $1.7 million.

The EPSF covers public safety at events, anti-terror efforts and support for the Secret Service.

Security for the annual “A Capitol Fourth” concert, which was held the same day on the National Mall, was provided by the federal Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, not D.C. police.

Bowser also said D.C. still hasn’t been reimbursed the $7.3 million extra it spent for Trump’s 2017 inauguration.

“These overages can be attributed to declining reserves, increased demand for heightened security, and a one-time draw down of $7.3 million to cover security costs associated with the 2017 presidential inauguration,” Bowser wrote.

The White House debates that figure.

Reached for comment about Bowser’s letter, the White House said: “We have received the letter and will respond in a timely manner.”

Senators are also seeking to probe the cost of the event, which included military flyovers and tanks on the National Mall.

WTOP has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Park Service, via the Interior Department, to see a cost breakdown for the event.

A Defense Department spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the Pentagon spent $1.2 million on the “Salute to America” celebration, which does not factor in the cost of flyovers, since the flyovers are being listed as training flights to “facilitate flying hours, which are imperative to military readiness.”

That puts known cost estimates for “Salute to America” at $5.35 million.

DOD wants to place virtual sensors in AWS’s commercial cloud for a secure connection,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/aws-dod-sensors-scca-cloud-security/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to clarify that the sensors in use are virtual.

Regardless of how the ongoing $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud procurement plays out in the next month or so, the Defense Information Systems Agency is prepping for more adoption of Amazon Web Services’ commercial cloud.

DISA issued a sources sought solicitation Tuesday saying that it plans to integrate its Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) into AWS’s Secret Region, which is approved to host Department of Defense data and services up to impact level 6 for Secret-level classified information.

To do so, DISA will place software-based, firewall-like virtual sensors in AWS’s cloud “to monitor DoD workloads hosted therein. These sensors inspect traffic to and from those DoD workloads and route inspected traffic to the [Defense Information System Network].”

The SCCA is essentially DISA’s model for securing the Department of Defense’s workloads hosted in the commercial cloud. The agency describes it as “a set of services that provides the same level of security the agency’s mission partners typically receive when hosted in one of the DISA’s physical data centers.”

To be clear, this solicitation doesn’t mean the Pentagon is buying more commercial cloud services from AWS — though it certainly could play out that way if JEDI is awarded to AWS. However, it signals that DOD is looking to secure its connection to AWS’s cloud because it’s possible, if not likely, the two will do more work together.

“DISA does not determine where DoD mission owners chose to host their cloud-based DoD workloads but is charged with protecting those workloads in the CSPs they select,” the solicitation says. AWS “currently hosts existing DoD workloads, and has strong demand for additional DoD workloads.”

It’s likely DISA will soon look to other cloud providers next to integrate with the CSSA, as each commercial cloud provider military services do business with will need its own sensors. In this case, AWS, because of its more advanced security authorization, appears to be one of the first. “Those CSPs with existing and forecast workloads are the first to be integrated with the SCCA and have boundary defense established for those DoD workloads,” the solicitation says.

DISA wants to hear from AWS resellers by July 23. The eventual contract will be for a year with two optional renewal years.

This comes as the Pentagon’s JEDI procurement looms. AWS and Microsoft are currently faced off as the only contenders for the landmark commercial cloud contract. DOD CIO Dana Deasy said recently the Pentagon plans to make an award in August.

Meanwhile, Oracle has filed a lawsuit against the single-award nature and technical requirements of the contract; it also alleged that conflicts of interest between DOD and AWS steered the contract toward Amazon as the frontrunner to win. The Court of Federal Claims is hearing oral arguments on that protest this week. If the court were to rule in Oracle’s favor, it would certainly throw a wrench into the JEDI award timeline."
Rep. Nunes on Christopher Steele's grilling by DOJ investigators: A lot of the dossier 'was just made up',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-christopher-steele-dossier-fbi-questioning,"Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday he believes the public will soon see that much of the Trump-Russia dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was ""made up.""

According to a New York Times report, FBI officials questioned one of Steele's sources and ""came to suspect that the man might have added his own interpretations to reports from his own sources that he passed on to Mr. Steele, calling into question the reliability of the information.""

Steele was interviewed as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's probe of how the FBI used the unverified dossier, including its role in obtaining a surveillance warrant against then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Reacting on ""Fox News @ Night,"" Nunes, R-Calif., said Steele refused to talk to the House Intelligence Committee while he served as chairman in 2017 and 2018.

""This is a man who made up this entire document. As you're starting to see it's unraveling, his sources are not real or if they are real they're second and third hand. So a lot of this is just made up out of whole cloth,"" said Nunes.

Shannon Bream then asked Nunes about a Politico report which suggested Steele's 16-hour grilling led to ""new and important information"" and could therefore ""dampen expectations among the president's allies who’ve claimed that Steele’s sensational dossier was used improperly by the bureau to 'spy' on the campaign.""

Nunes scoffed at that notion, saying either Steele had credible sources or he did not.

""The fact remains that they used that garbage that was paid for by a political campaign before a court,"" said Nunes, adding that there is information that is ""equally as bad or worse"" that has not been made public about Steele's work."
EPA employee protests union contract while receiving award from Admin.

Loreen Targos, an EPA employee in Chicago, unfurled a banner on stage next to Wheeler reading, “I care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health and climate change. Do you?”

Targos was on stage with the rest of a team being honored for cleaning up refinery waste near Muskegon Lake in Michigan.

In

a video

released by American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 704, based in the Great Lakes region, Targos can be heard asking Wheeler if he supports a fair contract for EPA workers.

EPA employees have been outraged by a recent contract that went into effect Tuesday that remains unsigned by union leaders and scales back union protections.

In an interview with The Hill, Targos said Wheeler did briefly respond to her.

“I did look at him and ask him and ask if he was going to support a fair contract and he said something along the lines of agency talking points of ‘We tried to come to the bargaining table but you guys refused.’”

The fight between the EPA and the union began over how much of the contract was even negotiable. The EPA wanted to renegotiate the entire contract, while the union wanted to renegotiate a narrower slice.

Under the latest contract, union employees would have to give up office space within the EPA offices and union leaders would not be able to use the intranet or agency billboards to communicate with members. It would also limit the amount of time union leaders could spend helping rank-and-file employees with labor disputes and other issues by 75 percent. It also changes how employees can arbitrate their grievances.

Targos said the new contract was “unilaterally imposed.” The AFGE has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against the EPA.

“There was all this pomp and circumstance to highlight the good work of EPA employees,” Targos said. “Why take away the conditions that supported such award-winning work?”

The EPA said it issued the new contract after years of fruitless negotiations.

“Administrator Wheeler was proud to host the National Honor Awards ceremony for the first time in 10 years and recognize the outstanding achievements of more than 700 EPA staff,” a spokesman told The Hill. “This collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired 12 years ago, the Trump EPA has worked with AFGE for the past two-and-half years to reach a new CBA and EPA is not the party refusing to come to the negotiating table.”

Targos said a security officer stopped her later and asked if she was actually an EPA employee.

“When I said yes he asked if I was really here to receive an award for that team and if I had just snuck on stage, so I said, ‘Yes I was in that group and supposed to get an award with that team,’” she said.

Targos said she was hoping to get more of a response from Wheeler.

“There’s always a part of you that hopes they will be better than what they say about them in the media, and it’s a sad thing to always be disappointed and realize, 'Oh you’re as bad as they say you are.'”"

But the talks have bogged down amid acrimony between Democrats and the White House, and now Washington’s leaders run the risk of a fiscal pileup that could also imperil President Trump’s effort to update the North American Free Trade Agreement.

White House officials have said the debt ceiling must be raised by early September to ensure the government can pay its bills. And spending on many federal programs expires at the end of September, requiring a separate deal to prevent a government shutdown.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin consulted with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) this week and met Wednesday with GOP leaders, alongside acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, trying to forge a solution. Pelosi has made clear that any increase in the federal debt limit should come as part of a broader, two-year budget deal — an approach also favored by leading Senate Republicans — but it’s far from clear whether lawmakers and the administration will be able to reach such an agreement before Congress leaves town for its annual summer recess in August.

The debt ceiling “is something we’re having discussions about, updating the numbers and potentially the need to do something before everybody leaves” for the August recess, Mnuchin told reporters after exiting a meeting in the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday evening.

“We just want it passed. We don’t care how it’s passed,” Mnuchin added when asked if the administration would prefer a stand-alone vote on the debt ceiling, as opposed to packaging it with a larger budget deal.

Mnuchin is serving as the White House’s emissary with Democrats because Pelosi has largely brushed aside most other senior White House officials.

She has dismissed Mulvaney, saying he has “no credibility” on spending issues because he pushed to shut down the government while serving in the House. She has also castigated Attorney General William P. Barr and accused him of lying to Congress, and made a cutting remark to the White House budget chief during a recent meeting .

The one bright spot had appeared to be her respect for U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, who had spent more than a year carefully cultivating ties with top Democrats in a push to revamp NAFTA. But even that effort is now under extreme strain, as labor unions and vocal Democrats are demanding major changes that might be politically infeasible.

All these dynamics will test the withering relationship between Pelosi and Trump. Pelosi has tried to hold back her caucus from launching a formal impeachment proceeding against Trump, but she faces mounting pressure as the 2020 presidential campaign picks up steam.

Trump’s attacks against her became quite personal last month, when he called her a “nasty, vindictive, horrible person” and a “disgrace” during a Fox News interview in France. That led Pelosi to effectively dismiss him, responding “I’m done with him” just a few days later.

Pelosi has also shown little regard for Trump’s top deputies. She has been unsparing in her public criticisms of Mulvaney. At one point during a budget negotiation in May, Pelosi snubbed acting budget director Russell Vought when he spoke up to reiterate a point. Turning to Vought, Pelosi asked, “What was your name again, dear?” according to an individual who witnessed the exchange and spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount it.

This unraveling could have real consequences for the country.

A think tank warned on Monday that the debt ceiling must be raised very soon or the government could risk missing payments on its bills by early September, but so far lawmakers and the White House have not been able to come up with a solution. Part of the problem, congressional aides and White House officials said, is a disconnect between senior administration officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill.

[GOP in disarray as budget impasse threatens shutdown, deep cuts — and default]

On Tuesday, before speaking on the phone with Mnuchin, Pelosi went so far as to dismiss the idea of meeting with administration officials at all while the budget impasse languishes, saying it would be pointless.

“I don’t see any reason to have a meeting. They know where we are. We’ve met, we’ve met, we’ve met,” Pelosi told reporters.

Pelosi’s comments left Republican lawmakers fuming and alarmed as they pointed to the series of approaching deadlines.

To cut a deal, White House officials have signaled an openness to increasing spending levels for next year, a position they did not hold a few months ago. But Democrats want to lock in more spending increases, and talks have broken down repeatedly. Congress is scheduled to be on recess in August and the first week of September, leaving scant time for action.

“We’re headed for a train wreck, so she’s either got to step up and start leading or just yield to the Senate, I suppose,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). “I’m one, having served in the House, that’s a little bit sympathetic to the management challenges she has, but that’s the price of leadership.”

At the same time, Republican leaders and Trump administration officials had long hoped to see action on Trump’s revamped North American trade deal, a top promise from his campaign, before the recess. But that now looks barely feasible as House Democrats and organized labor press to reopen the deal to make changes including strengthened enforcement of environmental and labor standards, and to address provisions on prescription drugs they see as overly generous to industry.

Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a longtime Pelosi ally who has been vocal in the trade debate, dismissed the chances of a vote on a new trade deal before fall.

“It’s not going to happen,” DeLauro said. “It’s got to be right in the content, which is what we’re striving for. That doesn’t mean it’s not going to be done. But I don’t believe it will be done before the August recess.”

DeLauro added that Pelosi will be the one to make the call on when — and if — to move on the trade deal. “That’s her prerogative.”

In an interview at a CNBC event this week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was waiting for a “green light” from Pelosi before moving forward. That ability of the speaker to single-handedly sink the North America trade deal by declining to put it on the floor has led to an increasingly desperate pressure campaign by Republican lawmakers and administration officials, including Vice President Pence, who has been traveling to Midwestern cities with manufacturing bases to make the case for the pact.

Trump had previously threatened Democrats that he would completely withdraw from the existing 1994 NAFTA deal if the updated version does not receive a vote, but he has not made that threat in a while as he tries to solicit more help from Pelosi.

“We need pressure on Speaker Pelosi to actually confirm that she will bring it up, and that she will be supporting this initiative,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) pleaded Tuesday.

But if Pelosi is feeling pressured to act swiftly on the trade deal, she has not shown it. At a recent news conference, she alluded to — and dismissed — the anxiety expressed by Republicans over allowing the pact to linger so long that it becomes fatally tied up in the 2020 presidential campaign and gets killed by campaign trail politics.

“The ambassador [Lighthizer] frequently will say, ‘We just don’t want to get this into the presidential,’ ” Pelosi said. “But that really doesn’t have anything to do with — it’s about the substance of the agreement, not the politics at all.”

For Pelosi, the mounting pressures over the budget, debt ceiling and trade arrive as she is coming off the most divisive episode of her speakership to date, last month’s vote on an emergency border spending bill that tore apart her caucus. After Pelosi caved to demands from moderates and put a Senate bill opposed by liberals on the floor for a vote, some liberals turned on the moderates in an ugly and very public display of disunity, unloading on them for supporting the legislation.

[House passes $4.6 billion border bill as leaders cave to moderate Democrats and GOP]

Although Pelosi has long commanded widespread bipartisan respect as a steely negotiator, the episode led some to question whether she will be able to steer a trade bill or a budget deal through her restive caucus. Some senior administration officials and Republicans have questioned whether Pelosi controls enough votes to deliver on a compromise.

“After watching how much difficulty she had passing the emergency supplemental, I don’t know where the votes are — and she knows that better than I would,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). “She’s a dealmaker but she’s also going to extract as much out of the deal as she can, so that’s why she’s not in a big hurry.”

Even as Pelosi has sought to keep the lid on liberal demands for impeachment proceedings against Trump, that task could get exponentially tougher next week, when former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will appear before Congress for the first time to testify.

Pelosi’s defenders, though, say that if deals on the budget or on trade prove elusive, the fault lies not with the House speaker but with a president who has proved to be an unreliable negotiator time and again. In past rounds of budget brinkmanship, Trump repeatedly shifted stances or undercut his own top lieutenants, leading Democrats to question whether they have a partner in the White House they can work with.

In private, Pelosi and Trump’s conversations on the border spending bill and other topics have been more cordial and productive than their public comments might suggest, aides say. But for the House speaker and the president, the coming battles over the budget and trade could prove the biggest test yet.

“If anybody can do it, it’ll be Nancy, and I think that over the years of her leadership she has proven that,” said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. But, Roybal-Allard said, “I think this time is more challenging than ever.”"

To fix this immigration problem requires immediate changes to our laws, not just funding: Opposing view

Since last fall, the Department of Homeland Security has consistently stated that Border Patrol’s temporary holding spaces were not designed nor ever intended to detain the record numbers of migrants illegally crossing the border, including tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and families every month.

During multiple border trips, our panel consistently observed alarming conditions at holding facilities despite Border Patrol’s valiant efforts to feed, clothe and improve medical care for migrants, many of whom arrived diseased or ill from the perilous journey.

With dangerous, illegal border crossings continuously rising, in April our bipartisan panel of the Homeland Security Advisory Council issued its public report urging emergency funding and legislative fixes to address this surge and the nation’s broken immigration system.

Our recommendations included establishing temporary regional centers near the southwest border and another in Guatemala with sufficient living space, judges, security and medical support to humanely care for families and children and timely process their claims. Today, our panel still awaits congressional action on our emergency recommendations from April 16.

The numbers are staggering. This fiscal year, more than 266,000 children illegally crossed our border primarily from Central America, exceeding the past two fiscal years combined.

OUR VIEW: Trump earns place in history with how America treats migrant children

Because of an outdated legal framework, there are few options for unaccompanied children from Central America. Under current law, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is prevented from keeping children together with close relatives who aren’t their parent or legal guardian. Only Congress can change that. Legally, these children cannot be repatriated back home nor can they simply be released into the interior of the USA. They must be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for placement with a sponsor.

This year’s backlogs in transferring children ages 12 and under from Border Patrol custody to HHS did not exist last year. But, as the numbers of families and children illegally crossing the border repeatedly spiked to historic levels, it exceeded the fixed space and beds of HHS. That’s why, in April, federal agencies that had exhausted their budgets for housing children requested emergency funding to avoid this very crisis of children held at inadequate Border Patrol facilities.

Unfortunately, Congress didn’t pass emergency funding until June 27, almost two months later.

Based on our review, Homeland Security has done all it reasonably could with limited resources to care for children who should have been transferred from Border Patrol to HHS custody within 72 hours, and ideally for tender aged children within 24 hours. The Border Patrol did not cause this crisis; our broken immigration system did.

To fix this problem requires immediate changes to our laws, not just funding. With passage of the supplemental funding, Congress has demonstrated that it has the capacity to change the law if members have the will.

UK’s Department Of Health Focuses On Sleep,https://z6mag.com,"['Lorey De Guzman', 'Sean Louis Salazar']",07-14-2019,2019,7,https://z6mag.com/2019/07/14/uks-department-of-health-focuses-on-sleep/,"Cabinet ministers are aiming to help the public with their insomnia problems.

The United Kingdom ministers plan to issue guidance on how much sleep each person needs. This plan is part of the government’s proposals that aims to improve the public’s health in the UK.

A leaked draft emphasizes that lack of sleep links to multiple physical and mental health problems. Illnesses tied to sleep deprivation is obesity, strokes, heart attacks, anxiety, and depression. Aside from being susceptible to diseases, lack of sleep also hinders the process of recovery from surgery or illness.

Patients, especially those who just finished having surgery, should have “protected sleep time” that will ensure the patient receives the rest it means. There’s no word if there will be guidelines on how to implement this in hospitals. Staying in a hospital sometimes leads to compromised rest due to the constant noise such as the beeps and clicks of machine monitors, the busyness of doctors and nurses attending to patients, and a steady stream of visitors walking around.

However, the government emphasizes that good sleeping habits are essential not just to post-operation patients. In the United Kingdom, three out of four adults sleep less than seven hours every night.

The government will be reviewing the evidence presented in the draft and then create concrete actions to promote better sleep. One of the ideas is to improve good “sleep hygiene.”

Sleep hygienes are practices and habits to achieve good sleep quality. A crucial part of sleep hygiene is the duration of sleep a person gets. An appropriate amount of time to sleep is needed to ensure enough rest and full rest alertness for the rest of the day. Sleeping too little or too much affects a person’s lifestyle and health.

Aside from sleeping guidelines, Health Secretary Matt Hancock will publish a full list of proposals in a public health green paper. The plans will tackle different health issues ranging from quitting smoking to lessening obesity. The aim is to prevent the public from getting minor illnesses, which will save the National Health Service (NHS) money in the long run.

Director of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute and Oxford University professor Russell Foster affirmed that there is overwhelming evidence that links sleep to conditions like diabetes, dementia, and depression. He further added that the minister should also consider individual preferences and variation when they come up with the final recommendations.

“What’s emerged over the last few years is that some really important things are going on within the brain. Our ability to consolidate memories, to process information, coming up with innovative solutions to complex problems are all really important functions within the brain at night. In essence, our ability to function during the day is defined by the quality of sleep we had at night,” Foster said in a report.

Sleep-related Products and Services

In recent years, business for sleep-related products and services have increased. Products have also improved from trivial items like pillows and mattresses.

Now, there are special treatment pillows and mattresses that address different sleeping issues for its users. Innovations on how to market it were also launched.

Business like Casper launched mattress-in-a-box in 2014, which allowed buyers to test their mattress for 100 days. If the customer was not satisfied, the bed could be returned and would be picked up by the company.

Aside from the essentials of sleep, understanding how to develop good sleeping is also important. Nowadays, wearable technology is helping to understand users’ sleeping patterns. Sleep trackers are now a default feature in most fitness trackers.

If the trackers and comfortable pillows and mattress still don’t do the trick, hire a sleep consultant. New parents, who are most affected by sleep deprivation, can hire sleep consultants to help improve their baby’s sleeping patterns. Sleep coaches will help train the baby sleep consistently in a regular pattern, allowing parents to enjoy night’s rest at the right time, too.

Adults can also find technology that will help them sleep immediately. For insomniacs, products ranging from wearable technology to meditation apps can help soothe one’s mind and lull them to sleep.

Companies have also learned that taking care of their employees meant providing facilities for them to rest. Offices are now equipped with sleeping facilities where employees can take a quick nap while on their break. Employers noted that their staff is more productive and alert after they’ve implemented these facilities."
Senators and State Department at Each Other’s Throats,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Political Reporter']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senators-and-state-department-at-each-others-throats,"On Friday, June 28, an email with an odd subject line hit the inboxes of the Senate’s top national security staffers.

“RE: Gabriel—does this look good to you?” it read.

Beneath the cryptic subject line was an invitation from the State Department asking Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) staff to join a question-and-answer conference call with a top official working on Iran policy.

The call, on the following Monday, did not go well. Staff had been eager—and impatient—to hear how the administration would handle Iran’s decision to amp up its uranium enrichment. But after reading a bland statement full of already public information, Matt McInnis, a political appointee who works on Iran policy, said a technical difficulty meant he couldn’t take questions. The whole call lasted less than 10 minutes, according to multiple people on it.

“It was insulting,” said one staffer on the call. “It was such a box-checking exercise for them.” Another staffer described feelings of amusement mixed with horror.

For participants, the blunders were a microcosm of the metastasizing tensions between SFRC and the State Department. The committee is supposed to oversee the department. But five Hill staffers familiar with its work told The Daily Beast it has struggled under the leadership of Chairman Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and Trump ally who wasn’t distinguished for broad foreign policy chops when he ascended to the post. Before Risch took the gavel, Sen. Bob Corker—who retired last year—ran the committee. While Corker was a traditional Republican who almost always voted with President Trump, he used the post to lambaste the administration’s frequently perplexing foreign policy choices. He even called the White House “an adult day care center.”

Under Risch, things are different. The conservative from Idaho has taken a much more deferential approach and is loath to publicly criticize the administration. He has yet to schedule open hearings on the war in Libya, the violent unrest in Sudan, and the free trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico.

Multiple staff blamed Risch’s non-combative approach for the committee’s struggles to get briefings and testimony from the department. And they point to debacles like the Iran conference call as evidence of the department’s disregard for the committee.

Risch’s defenders, meanwhile, say he engages in effective behind-the-scenes advocacy to the president and that until a few months ago, there were hardly any Senate-confirmed senior State Department officials who could testify. They also credit Risch with securing a long-awaited classified briefing from Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, though Democrats say they’re still frustrated Khalilzad hasn’t testified publicly.

The committee still has trouble getting answers. To this day, according to two staffers, the department has yet to provide the committee with a copy of the U.S./Mexico agreement on tariffs that Trump himself waved around in front of news cameras on June 11. Committee staff have sent weekly emails to the State Department—for months now—asking for details on the administration’s decision to cut aid to Central American countries and have yet to get substantive answers to their questions, per one aide.

“ It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration. ” — Senate aide

“It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration,” another aide said.

“We get very much a head-pat acknowledgement,” said a third staffer. “Kind of, ‘There, there, Congress, we’ll tell you the bare minimum and that’s that.”

Suzanne Wrasse, the communications director for Risch on the committee, said the chairman effectively advocates for SFRC.

“The chairman is a pragmatic lawmaker with a long history of working ‘behind the scenes’ to get results, not to make political points,” she said. “He is in regular contact with the president and his senior advisers, and has used his stature to deliver results for the committee on a bipartisan basis.”

Risch has also touted his warm relationship with Trump.

“He has treated me with nothing but respect and listened carefully to what I had to say, and sometimes I was able to move him,” the senator said in a February Roll Call interview. “Sometimes a little bit, sometimes more than a little bit. Sometimes not at all.”

One tense moment came when the administration decided to use an emergency declaration to green-light billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

Traditionally, the State Department consults with SFRC on arms sales—but not this time. And it wasn’t for lack of talking; in the days leading up to the declaration, there was communication on the Iran situation between senior Trump administration officials and the Senate. Sec. Mike Pompeo and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a members-only briefing for senators just two days before the arms announcement. But the topic of an emergency declaration didn’t come up in that briefing, according to people familiar with it. Instead, SFRC staff found out about the arms deals the day the administration announced them, on May 24.

That day, State set up another conference call for congressional staff to explain their move. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary for political-military affairs, was on the call. At one point, a staffer pushed Cooper on why the department hadn’t worked with Congress on the move, given its oversight responsibility.

“That’s a matter of semantics,” Cooper replied, according to a source who was on the call—which then exploded. To some listeners, Cooper’s comment sounded like a glib write-off of Congress’s constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable.

Reached for comment on this incident, a State Department spokesperson pointed to congressional testimony Cooper gave several weeks later, where he said the department “value[s] deeply this Committee’s and Congress’ role more broadly in the review of the arms transfer process.”

The frustrations are percolating as Trump faces some of his thorniest foreign policy dilemmas yet. Just weeks ago, the president said he nearly green-lit a strike on Iranian targets that could have killed scores of people. Instead, the president deferred to the non-interventionists in his orbit—including Fox News host Tucker Carlson. But as crises materialize like it’s Whack-A-Mole, staff working with the committee responsible for overseeing American diplomacy say it’s in the dark. And they have to wonder: How could this administration handle negotiations with the Iranians if they can barely run a conference call about them?"
