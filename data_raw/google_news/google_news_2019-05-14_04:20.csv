Barr assigns US attorney in Connecticut to look into government surveillance involving Trump campaign: source,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-us-attorney-connecticut-surveillance-trump-campaign,"Attorney General William Barr has appointed a U.S. attorney to examine the origins of the Russia investigation and determine if intelligence collection efforts targeting the Trump campaign were ""lawful and appropriate,"" a person familiar with the situation told Fox News on Monday evening.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, will conduct the inquiry, the source said. The move comes as the Trump administration has pushed for answers on why federal authorities conducted the surveillance -- as well as whether Democrats were the ones who improperly colluded with foreign actors.

Two sources told Fox News earlier today that Barr was “serious” and had assigned DOJ personnel to the probe. Durham is known as a ""hard-charging, bulldog"" prosecutor, Fox News is told.



Sources familiar with matter say the focus of the probe includes the pre-transition period -- prior to Nov. 7, 2016 -- including the use and initiation of informants, as well as potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses.

An informant working for U.S. intelligence posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 to try extracting any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia from George Papadopoulos, then a Trump foreign policy adviser, it emerged earlier this month. Papadopoulos told Fox News the informant tried to ""seduce"" him as part of the ""bizarre"" episode.

Durham previously has investigated law enforcement corruption, the destruction of CIA videotapes and the Boston FBI office's relationship with mobsters. He is set to continue to serve as the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut.

ROSENSTEIN BLASTS 'ANGRY' COMEY, SAYS HE'S BECOME A DISAPPOINTING PARTISAN HACK

In January, House Republican Reps. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows wrote to Durham seeking a briefing, saying they had ""discovered"" that Durham's office was ""investigating [former FBI General Counsel James Baker"" for unauthorized disclosures to the media.""

Durham's new review would exist alongside the ongoing probe by DOJ Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, who is continuing to review potential surveillance abuses by the FBI -- an investigation that began last March and that Fox News is told is nearing completion.

Republicans also have been looking for answers from U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber, who was appointed a year ago by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review not only surveillance abuses by the FBI and DOJ, but also authorities' handling of the probe into the Clinton Foundation.

Huber, Republicans have cautioned, apparently has made little progress and has spoken to few key witnesses and whistleblowers. But, in January, then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker reportedly indicated at a private meeting that Huber's work was continuing apace.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXTS SHOW DOJ PUSHED BACK ON 'BIAS' IN KEY FBI FISA SOURCE

Durham's appointment comes about a month after Barr told members of Congress he believed ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign in 2016. He later said he didn't mean anything pejorative and was gathering a team to look into the origins of the special counsel's investigation.

Democrats have pummeled Barr in frustration following revelations in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russian actors, despite numerous offers by Russians to assist the campaign. Mueller's final report has led to a bitter D.C. battle over the limited number of redactions in the report, which the DOJ says are legally necessary because they pertain to grand jury matters.

In obtaining a secret FISA warrant to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, the FBI copy-pasted directly from a disputed Washington Post opinion article to suggest the Trump campaign may have been compromised. The bureau also repeatedly assured the court that it ""did not believe"" British ex-spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion.

But, London court records showed that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS -- the opposition research firm behind the dossier. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), a piece of information not stated in the FISA application.

The FISA application cribbed word-for-word from the Washington Post article that claimed the Trump campaign had ""worked behind the scenes"" to ""gut"" the GOP platform on Russia and Ukraine. The FBI apparently did not conduct its own independent assessment of the piece, which was labeled an ""opinion"" column by the Post, and Mueller's probe ultimately found no wrongdoing by the Trump team.

Additionally, internal FBI text messages exclusively obtained by Fox News earlier this year showed that a senior DOJ official raised concerns about the bias in a key FISA warrant, but that FBI officials pressed on.

""There's a document that's classified that I'm gonna try to get unclassified that takes the dossier -- all the pages of it -- and it has verification to one side,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this weekend. ""There really is no verification, other than media reports that were generated by reporters that received the dossier.""

Graham specifically cited the report from The Hill's John Solomon that the FBI was expressly told that Steele, the bureau's confidenial informant, had admitted to a contact at the State Department that he was ""keen"" to leak his discredited dossier for purposes of influencing the 2016 election.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec’s written account of her Oct. 11, 2016, meeting with Steele was apparently sent to the FBI, according to records unearthed in a transparency lawsuit by Citizens United.

| Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Trade Republicans surrender to Trump’s China tariffs GOP senators have no plans to even try to stop a trade war they oppose.

The GOP is starting to give up on thwarting President Donald Trump’s trade agenda.

Senate Republicans acknowledge that the president’s latest tariff increase on Chinese imports are harming farm state economies, their own constituents and some of Trump’s most reliable voters. But there’s no plan to stop, or even threaten, the president’s tariff regime — just the latest example of Trump imposing his protectionist will on a party that once celebrated free trade.

Story Continued Below

As the stock market tanked on Monday following the escalating conflict with China, Republicans lamented the state of affairs. But after trying, unsuccessfully, to get the president to remove his year-old tariffs on U.S. allies, there’s little appetite for opening a new front with Trump when it comes to China.

So the GOP on Monday stuck to the same message: The tariffs are bad, but at least this time, Trump is taking on China — and not on Canada or Mexico.

“They can feel it. The farm community up ‘til now has really supported the president without flinching. But eventually you flinch,” said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the No. 4 GOP leader whose state is a major soybean producer. Yet he concluded: “If you’re going to have a trade fight, the trade fight to have would be the China fight.”

Farmers are “disappointed but, you know, recognizing that China is the one that is forcing this,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa).

Trump showed little regard for the GOP’s worries on Monday as he advised Americans to avoid buying products made in China to avoid the tariffs then later bragged that the tariffs are taking in billions of dollars — ignoring that consumers pay those fees, not China.

“I love the position we’re in,” he said. “It’s working out really well.”

Republicans would disagree but apparently have no will to challenge the president over the matter.

Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley has vowed to block the president’s new North American trade deal as long as steel and aluminum tariffs remain on Mexico and Canada, but Trump has ignored his ultimatum.

On Monday, Grassley admitted that Congress has ceded too much power to the White House on trade, but the Iowa Republican declined to say whether his committee would do anything about it. He offered the gentlest of guidance to Trump, urging him to work with allies on the China fight, and ordered China “to get real.”

It’s a widely held view among Republicans: Past Congresses granted the White House too much authority and now there’s nothing lawmakers can do about it.

""The retaliatory tariffs will have a significant consequence to Kansans,” said Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). He said the Senate can only do so much besides make their case to the White House: “Really this authority rests in the president.”

That’s a view that ignores Congress’ power to rein in the president or confront him through legislation. But the GOP is in no mood to get into it with Trump after blocs of Senate Republicans defied him on his national emergency declaration, criticized his foreign policy and tanked his two Federal Reserve picks. A number of Republicans are up for reelection and sweating potential primary challenges if they cross Trump.

Instead, Republicans seem to be relying on Trump’s conservative base in agricultural states to deliver the president a message. Asked who can determine when the economic pain from retaliatory tariffs is too much to stand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said, “It’s up to the producers.”

“They can’t produce soybeans and actually make a profit today. Five years in a row, farmers’ prices are down 50 percent since 2013. This is a very serious thing, and these are the president’s people. They want him to be successful. But there’s a limit to how long they can hang in there,” Rounds said.

The steel and aluminum tariffs on North American and European allies have drawn far more GOP opposition because they were imposed on the dubious basis of national security. Some Republicans have sought to restrict those “section 232” tariffs, but GOP leaders have declined to consider legislation that would tie Trump’s hands.

The GOP pushback has been far weaker on Trump’s China offensive, even though the results have been just as damaging. Beijing is imposing new 25 percent tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. imports in the face of Trump’s new levies on $200 billion in Chinese goods.

“The president's right to hold China's feet to the fire on this,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.). “They wouldn't be negotiating at all if it weren't for what the president has done. Of course, I'd like to see a deal done.”

Still, many Republicans are once again worried about economic headwinds, and the stock market is looking shaky. Rural America, where Trump is popular, could be headed for ruin.

But after complaining about Trump’s trade policies for more than two years, the only thing new in the GOP is a sense of resignation and a sense that confrontational stances toward Trump in the past have not paid off.

""It's a lot of uncertainty. Some anxiety. And obviously that's reflected in the stock market,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). Trump has “got a lot of power when it comes to those tariffs so we're just trying to work with him.”

Though they frequently complain, Republicans have been loath to cross Trump on trade, one of the most sensitive rifts with the party. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell squelched an effort last Congress to give lawmakers the power to block Trump’s national security-based tariffs, and two of the most fervent backers of that effort, Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, have retired.

There’s still plenty of unease about the tariffs on U.S. allies, but the moment for action seems to have passed. Now that Trump has turned to China, Republicans are even less inclined to confront Trump over a trade war with a country widely blamed for stealing intellectual property from the United States. Many senators are also still worried Trump could impose new tariffs on foreign autos, which would strike at factories in Southern states that are mostly represented by Republicans.

Perhaps most important, Republicans stopped being surprised when the president makes good on a protectionist trade policy he’s been touting for nearly four years now.

The new tariffs on China were “the worst kept secret in America,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). “If it was a secret.”

Trump Is Angry That the FBI Won’t Endorse His Theory of Victimhood,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['David Frum', 'Staff Writer At']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/trump-wants-chris-wray-buy-his-theory-victimhood/589333/,"But that is not the Trump way. The Trump way is to escalate, always.

Andrew G. McCabe: Every day is a new low in the Trump White House

Over the four weeks between the Barr letter and the release of the redacted Mueller report, Trump kept insisting that the Mueller report said more than it did. It said, in effect: We didn’t find sufficient evidence to charge your campaign with conspiracy, and our internal Department of Justice policies forbid us from charging you with obstruction. He wanted it to say: You did nothing wrong. He wanted it to say: Actually, Donald, you were the real victim here—and Hillary Clinton the true criminal conspirator.”

Trump has tried to close that gap by lying about it—and by demanding that other people lie, too. When they don’t and won’t, Trump gets angry. And when Trump gets angry, he takes to Twitter.

Trump got extra angry Sunday night. Uncheered by Mother’s Day, the president launched into a sequence of rage tweets that included the line: “The FBI has no leadership.” Trump has fired one FBI director, James Comey, for looking into the Russia matter. He fired an acting director, Andrew McCabe, for the same apparent reason. Apparently, he is now gunning for the present director, Chris Wray.

Why is Trump angry? Trump disjointedly tweeted over linked messages: “The Director is protecting the same gang…..that tried to……..overthrow the President through an illegal coup. (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch”

Trump wants the FBI to endorse his own theory of victimhood—and it won’t. Worse, the FBI was embedded in the Mueller investigation. The FBI received, and still holds, whatever information the investigation gathered about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, including potential answers to the all-important question: Why? Why was Vladimir Putin so eager to help Trump into the presidency? Why did Russia care so much, and run such risks for him?

Read: The chilling effects of Trump’s war on the FBI

The answer may be indicated in an underappreciated pair of sentences on page 76 of Volume II of the Mueller report: “As described in Volume I, the evidence uncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were involved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the President otherwise had any unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does indicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal or political concerns.”

So long as the FBI remains in independent hands, the president will remain gripped by those concerns.

What Trump means by leadership is compliance. He wants an FBI director who serves him personally the way Attorney General Barr has served him personally. So long as the FBI retains its integrity, Trump feels unsafe. He cannot close the case, because he keeps hearing scratching sounds from inside. He cannot move on, because he keeps looking back in fear. His next move? He’s already telegraphing it: another attack on the independence of law enforcement.

Trump today welcomed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to the White House. I keep thinking on this trip of the shrewd insight offered by a Budapest observer when I visited Hungary in 2016: “The benefit of controlling a modern state is less the power to persecute the innocent, more the power to protect the guilty.” Trump holds that power, and he is determined to wield it."

De Blasio mocked by protesters at raucous Green New Deal rally inside Trump Tower,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/de-blasio-mocked-by-protesters-at-green-new-deal-rally-inside-trump-tower,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio faced a crowd of angry protesters Monday at a raucous rally promoting the city’s Green New Deal inside the lobby of Trump Tower, where the Democrat threatened President Trump’s family company with millions of dollars in fines if his buildings don’t comply with new environmental standards.

Speaking in front of the same escalators where Trump launched his 2016 campaign, de Blasio blasted the president's rollback of Obama-era environmental policies, his move to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement and his appointment of climate change skeptics to the Cabinet.

“His buildings are one of the biggest polluters in New York City,” de Blasio said. “Cut your emissions or we’ll cut something you really care about.”

De Blasio, who is mulling a Democratic presidential run, added: “We’ll take your money.”

The mayor, though, was forced to shout for much of his speech amid jeers from a crowd of about a dozen protesters inside the lobby of Trump Tower, which also had music blasting over the speakers. A number of protesters rode up and down the escalator behind de Blasio carrying cardboard signs with slogans like “Worst Mayor Ever,” “Failed Mayor,” and “Trump 2020.”

De Blasio said he did not mind the protesters and added that it was “so nice for them to serenade us.”

“They’re scared of the truth,” he said. “Anyone that has a problem with saving the planet, I have a problem with them.”

The rally for the city’s Green New Deal was originally scheduled to be held in front of Trump Tower, but was moved into the lobby due to inclement weather.

New York City’s own Green New Deal plan – officially called The Climate Mobilization Act and modeled after the one proposed in Congress by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. – passed the City Council last month in a 45-2 vote. De Blasio has not yet signed the legislation but is expected to soon.

The deal is actually a package of 10 bills meant to curb carbon emissions in the country’s largest city by carrying out measures that will be “the equivalent of taking more than one million cars off the road by 2030,” according to New York City’s Committee for Environmental Protection Chair Costa Constantinides.

CALIFORNIA GOV. NEWSOM FACING NEW PRESSURE FROM ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TO BLOCK DRILLING, FRACKING

But the main facet of the deal is the plan clamp down on emissions from the city’s famed skyscrapers with a goal of reducing overall emissions by 40 percent by 2030. Buildings create almost 70 percent of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a recent survey.

“The first of any major city on the Earth to say to building owners, ‘you've got to clean up your act, you've got to retrofit, you've got to save energy,’” de Blasio said last month. “If you don’t do it by 2030 there will be serious fines, as high as $1 million or more for the biggest buildings.”

Upgrades to buildings in order to meet the new standards are expected to cost owners around $4 billion – a figure that has the city’s powerful real estate lobby up in arms.

“The bill that passed…will fall short of achieving the 40 x 30 reduction by only including half of the city’s building stock,” Real Estate Board of New York President John H. Banks said in a statement. “The approach taken today will have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain a broad range of industries, including technology, media, finance, and life sciences, that provide opportunity and continued economic growth that is so important for our city.”

New York is not the only major American city to push its own version of the Green New Deal.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released a plan last month to make the city carbon neutral by 2050.

“Politicians in Washington don’t have to look across the aisle in Congress to know what a Green New Deal is — they can look across the country, to Los Angeles,” Garcetti said. “With flames on our hillsides and floods in our streets, cities cannot wait another moment to confront the climate crisis with everything we’ve got. L.A. is leading the charge, with a clear vision for protecting the environment and making our economy work for everyone.”

Trump Jr. subpoena could force GOP loyalty test,https://www.politico.com,['Burgess Everett'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/13/donald-trump-jr-subpoena-1319430,"There's essentially nothing more politically toxic for congressional Republicans than voting on enforcing a subpoena issued to the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Congress Trump Jr. subpoena could force GOP loyalty test

If Donald Trump Jr. doesn't comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee's subpoena, the chamber is preparing for the possibility it could vote on enforcing the order on the Senate floor, according to sources in both parties.

Republicans said privately on Monday they were eager to avoid the clash and what would surely be an ugly floor vote if Trump Jr. ignores the Senate; some hope the committee and Trump Jr. can work out a deal to avoid a floor vote on complying with the subpoena or even holding the president's son in contempt. But the chamber has several options if it chooses to force the issue, and they could pass given that they would require only a simple majority and aren't subject to the chamber's supermajority requirement, according to aides in both parties.

Contempt is one way forward. But the Senate also has a special option ""as an alternative to both the inherent contempt power of each House and the criminal contempt statutes,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. The Intelligence Committee and then the full Senate can take civil action to enforce a subpoena in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or to simply ask for a declaration of the validity of the subpoena, according to CRS.

It's a tactic aimed more at forcing compliance than punishment and has been used sparingly by the Senate, though the chamber did use the power to compel the production of documents from Backpage.com in 2016, which was accused of facilitating human trafficking. Typically civil action has been used more often for seeking documents, though in 1989 the Senate did seek civil action to compel testimony during an impeachment trial of a federal judge.

The Intelligence Committee declined to comment. It is not clear what deadline the committee has set for Trump Jr., either.

Still, Republicans aren't eager to test the waters when it comes to Trump Jr.; a floor vote would probably be the worst case scenario for Republicans eager to avoid confrontation with the president during a tough election cycle. There's essentially nothing more toxic than voting on enforcing a subpoena issued to the president's son.

""Hopefully, the Senate doesn’t have to vote on a subpoena, because that would be a difficult vote for a lot of Republicans between letting a chairman run their committee the way they want to, and in this particular instance, it’s usually a bipartisan decision that a person makes,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Hugh Hewitt's radio show on Monday. ""I don’t want that to happen, but I don’t want to discuss why it might happen. And hopefully, it won’t happen.""

“Iran is an escalating threat and this seemed like a timely visit on his way to Sochi,” Brian Hook told reporters, referring to Pompeo’s planned visit to Russia on Tuesday for meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Pompeo canceled a visit to Moscow on Monday and stopped in Brussels instead, en route to Sochi.

“The secretary wanted to share some details behind what we have been saying publicly,” Hook said. “We believe that Iran should try talks instead of threats. They have chosen poorly by focusing on threats.”

Hook said Pompeo, while in Brussels, also discussed reported attacks on several oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

Asked if Pompeo was blaming Iran for the attacks, Hook said: “We discussed ... what seemed to be attacks on commercial vessels that were anchored off Fujairah ... we have been requested by the UAE to provide assistance in the investigation, which we are very glad to do.”

Asked if he himself believed there was the possibility of an Iranian role, Hook had no comment.

Related Coverage Trump says it would be big mistake for Iran to try anything against U.S.

The UAE said on Sunday that four commercial vessels were sabotaged near Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs lying just outside the Strait of Hormuz. It did not describe the nature of the attack or say who was behind it.

Saudi Arabia said Monday that two of its oil tankers were among those attacked and described it as an attempt to undermine the security of crude supplies amid tensions between the United States and Iran.

The UAE on Monday identified the vessels as very large crude carrier (VLCC) tanker Amjad and crude tanker Al Marzoqah, both owned by Saudi shipping firm Bahri. The other two were UAE-flagged fuel bunker barge A. Michel and Norwegian-registered oil products tanker MT Andrew Victory."
"Trump administration breaks campaign promise, purges 200,000 VA healthcare applications",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/trump-administration-breaks-campaign-promise-purges-200-000-va-healthcare-applications,"""The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,” presidential candidate Donald Trump said when speaking at a rally on Oct. 31, 2015, in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Va.

""Over 300,000 — and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now — over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care,"" said Trump.

Trump’s strong condemnation of the Obama administration’s handling of the backlog of hundreds of thousands of veteran benefits claims made him the overwhelming choice for many veteran voters in 2016.

But after two years in the White House, the Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.

In purging this massive backlog of applications, the VA is declaring the applications to be incomplete due to errors by the applicants, despite the OIG findings and in violation of the promise Trump made to fix the system. This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits.

Under the supervision of Dr. Richard Stone, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, VHA managers last November instructed the agency’s IT staff members to purge over 200,000 pending healthcare applications.

Such a profound decision to deny veterans benefits should have to come from someone higher up — the president or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs — not from a career bureaucrat who has not been elected or confirmed by the Senate.

This purge flies in the face of previous guidance provided by lawmakers. On March 3, 2017, Senate and House Veterans Affairs committee members sent a joint letter to the VA, instructing the agency to delay its plans to purge these records. The committees wanted the VA to send new letters to veterans, informing them of their application status and potential equitable relief or financial reimbursement for service-connected health expenses caused by enrollment system errors, as prescribed by law.

Currently, VA is skirting this provision of the law by blaming veteran applicants for the agency’s own mistakes processing health and disability claims. As a result, to win benefits wrongfully denied due to VA’s administrative errors, veterans are forced to go to court and pay legal fees out of whatever benefits they ultimately win.

The Trump administration’s decision opens the door to the agency purging any future backlog of veteran claims for benefits by falsely declaring the applications incomplete due to veteran error.

This is the second time the VA has been caught using its IT department to adjudicate benefits for veterans. In January 2017, the IT department auto-enrolled over 70,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans whose applications had erroneously been held up until they could meet a “means test” — that is, prove their income level. This mass-approval of applications was done in preparation for then-Under Secretary David Shulkin’s confirmation hearing.

They did this without bothering to fix the systemic error that required proof of income from combat veterans, who aren’t required to provide it. As a result, there are still more than 20,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans being denied healthcare benefits due to an erroneous means-test requirement.

Moreover, the means test error in the enrollment system not only affects veteran access to healthcare benefits, but it also causes billing errors for thousands of veterans each year.

The Veterans Health Administration’s Member Services office, which manages the enrollment system, had to reexamine over 6,000 veteran income verification cases, because veterans were overbilled for medical copays ranging from $200 to $3,000. About 1,000 veterans are believed to receive fraudulent bills from the VA every month due to this known system error.

Despite being aware of these systemic issues for years, VA has not initiated an outreach campaign to educate the veteran community about what to do if their application is in a pending status or if they get a fraudulent bill due to missing means-test information.

Instead, the agency has chosen a policy of sending a single notification letter for pending applications, despite knowing that 25% of the letters mailed to veterans are returned or placed on hold due to bad address information in the enrollment system.

Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans routinely have incorrect address information in the enrollment system because they do not have permanent non-military addresses at the time of enrollment during the demobilization process.

The VA could resolve this problem through its data-sharing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration, to get current addresses for veterans in the pending backlog. But unfortunately for veterans, it is the VA’s practice to use information from the IRS and SSA only for the purposes of billing and verifying veterans’ dates of death.

All of these issues could be easily fixed. This is why President Trump’s reversal on this issue is so disappointing to the veteran community. Many veterans are asking why the enrollment system was not included in the President’s VA information technology modernization plan.

As a result, 200,000 applications have been purged, violating Trump’s promise. Currently, over 300,000 additional veteran healthcare applications remain in a pending status and will most likely be purged in the near future.

A liberal watchdog group said Monday it plans to sue the Commerce Department to obtain records relating to Secretary Wilbur Ross’ “lies” about his decision to add a citizenship question to next year’s Census questionnaire.

Restore Public Trust said in a complaint filed Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it has filed several requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act that call into question Ross' justification for adding the citizenship question to the Census, and the group is demanding the release of those documents.

The question, which the Trump administration plans to include for the first time since 1950, is at the center of a legal battle that last month reached the Supreme Court. Civil rights groups and several local and state governments have sued the administration to have the question struck from next year’s survey, which is used to apportion congressional seats, Electoral College votes and billions in federal funding.

Restore Public Trust is suing for the release of a tranche of documents that the group says will show Ross was misleading in congressional testimony over how the question came to be added to the Census. Ross has said he added the question “solely” at the request of the Justice Department, which said in a memo that the question would help it better enforce parts of the Voting Rights Act.

But emails turned over as part of the lawsuits have showed that Ross was in contact with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach about the question, and he had asked the Justice Department to request the question. The Commerce Department has defended Ross' testimony, arguing that the new communications only supplement the record.

The Commerce Department declined to comment Monday, citing pending litigation.

Researchers at the Census Bureau have said adding the question could result in depressed response rates among the Hispanic residents, a demographic that already sees lower rates of response to the decennial survey. Critics of the question have argued that the question is aimed at diluting the political power of Democratic-leaning areas home to Hispanic communities. Separately, Commerce has been accused of violating administrative procedure and adding the question without proper vetting of its potential effect on Census responses.

The lawsuit filed Monday cites three FOIA requests submitted by the group last December and on April 12 seeking communications regarding the Census, including emails sent or received by Ross and some of his top current and former aides, as well as Kobach and Census Bureau and DOJ officials, relating to the Census.

According to the group, they have received no communication from the Commerce Department concerning their requests, even though FOIA requires agencies to respond within 20 days or provide notice that their response will be delayed. The document requests are likely to overlap with those the House Oversight Committee voted last month to subpoena from the Commerce Department.

“The American people have a right to know what Secretary Ross and the rest of Trump’s political appointees discussed behind closed doors as they devised a scheme to make the census less representative for all Americans,” said Kyle Herrig, senior adviser to Restore Public Trust. “Even more disturbing than Secretary Ross’s attempts to avoid public scrutiny is his apparent lies to Congress and evasion of Congressional oversight.”

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case last month and appears poised to side with Ross, overturning the ruling of lower courts and letting the citizenship question stand. DOJ has said in court filings that the Census Bureau must finalize printed questionnaires by the end of next month to meet production deadlines.

Amid the legal drama over the citizenship question last month, Ross also caught flak for rejecting two invitations from House and Senate appropriators to testify before their committees about his agency's budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, saying his appearance would be a distraction and offering to send other officials from the department.

Senator Marco Rubio sent a letter Monday to Attorney General William Barr asking him to investigate whether former secretary of state John Kerry violated federal law by continuing to meet with Iranian officials after leaving office.

“The Department of Justice should therefore make a determination on whether or not former Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s recent actions related to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran potentially violate the Logan Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” Rubio wrote.

The letter, Rubio’s second urging an investigation into Kerry’s conduct, comes after President Trump suggested that Kerry should be prosecuted under the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without the permission of U.S. officials.

“What I’d like to see with Iran, I’d like to see them call me,” Trump told reporters last week. “John Kerry speaks to them a lot, and John Kerry tells them not to call. That’s a violation of the Logan Act, and frankly he should be prosecuted on that.”

Kerry’s camp pushed back on Trump’s assertion in a statement provided to CNN.

“Everything President Trump said today is simply wrong, end of story,” a spokesperson for Kerry told CNN. “He’s wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he’s been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe.”

Rubio sent his first letter on the subject to then-attorney general Jeff Sessions in September 2018, after the Boston Globe reported that Kerry was “quietly seeking to salvage the Iran deal he helped craft” by engaging “in some unusual shadow diplomacy” with Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. Though he would not comment on what was discussed, Kerry did admit to meeting with Zarif “three or four” times since Trump took office. The Globe further reported that Kerry formed a team “of officials who were his top advisers at the State Department” to shape media coverage of Trump’s departure from the Iran deal."
VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.

"Inslee, Ferguson denounce EPA move to ease water standards for Washington state",https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/inslee-ferguson-denounce-epa-move-to-ease-water-standards-for-washington-state/,"The Environmental Protection Agency proposes to ease Washington water-quality standards for chemicals discharged into state waterways, a move embraced by industry groups that sought the change and denounced as “illegal” by Gov. Jay Inslee and state Attorney General Bob Ferguson.

The action, disclosed Friday, reverses a 2016 decision by the EPA under the Obama administration that required the state to toughen the water-quality standard.

Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, said his agency had “inherent authority” to reconsider the 2016 decision, according to a letter Hladick sent Friday to Maia Bellon, the director of the state Ecology Department.

Ferguson and Inslee, in a joint statement, said “by taking this unilateral action, the EPA will risk almost certain litigation and cause uncertainty for Washington businesses.”

A major point of contention is the water-quality standard for PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), a group of chemicals considered to be probable carcinogens. PCBs can be found in dyes, paint, building materials, coolants and other products. In trace amounts, they often are present in industry wastewater discharges as well as municipal utility plants that treat stormwater runoff. Once in Puget Sound and freshwater drainage, they accumulate in fish and shellfish, so ingesting this food in large volumes can increase cancer risks.

In Washington, the PCBs water standard has been subject of years of intense scrutiny.

Tribal leaders pressed for tighter pollution limits to protect their members, who may eat far more fish and shellfish than other Washington residents. And, they were dismayed by the Trump administration’s EPA decision, which they said was done without the consultation required by the federal government’s treaties and trust responsibilities to tribes.

“This action is outrageous,” said Lorraine Loomis, chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. “Like all federal agencies, the EPA has a legally binding trust responsibility to the tribes that requires government-to-government consultation and the protection of tribal treaty rights and resources. They are not living up to this responsibility that is rooted in the U.S. Constitution.”

Paper and pulp manufacturers and other industry groups applauded the Trump administration decision.

They had opposed the Obama administration standard, saying that there was no technology available to bring wastewater discharges levels of PCBs to the low levels that were required. In a written statement, Donna Harmon, president of the American Forest & Paper Association, said, “The earlier EPA rule represented costly and ineffective regulatory overreach — plain and simple.”

The clash over PCB standards has unfolded under the umbrella of the federal Clean Water Act, which creates a partnership between the state and federal government to protect and when necessary restore the nation’s waterways.

Under the act, states have authority to develop water-quality standards, and the EPA the power of review.

During the Obama administration, the EPA partially disapproved of a state standard — developed by the Washington Department of Ecology while Inslee was governor. The EPA ruled the state standard for PCBs — 170 parts per quadrillion in wastewater discharges — did not go far enough in protecting the health of heavy consumers of Washington fish. Instead, the EPA sent a standard of 7 parts per quadrillion.

In February 2017, after the Trump administration took office, industry and water utility groups filed a petition to the EPA arguing that the action under the Obama administration unjustly overturned the state standard and that it should be pulled back.

Meanwhile, state officials accepted the EPA decision and went to work with stakeholders, including tribes and industry representatives, to find ways to implement new standards.

Colleen Keltz, an Ecology Department spokeswoman, acknowledged that the 7 parts per quadrillion standard may not be obtainable with current technology. But she said that the state is working under a new system that allows permitted discharges to have a variance that allows higher levels of discharges until technology is available to meet the standard.

But the EPA, under the Trump administration, rejected the need to try to reach the lower standard. In a 32-page document released Friday, the EPA said the earlier state PCBs standard of 170 parts per quadrillion should be restored, rejecting the Obama administration’s objection as “based on sound science.”

Hladick’s criticisms of the 2016 EPA PCBs decision were rejected by Dennis McLerran, who served as regional administrator for the EPA under President Barack Obama. McLerran acknowledged that some standards are “aspirational” but said the earlier EPA action was based on the best science available and that the rule allowed for flexibility when dischargers could not meet the standard.

McLerran said it was “very unusual and inappropriate” to pull it back without first consulting with tribes and state officials.

“I think it is a very unfortunate thing. The state had made it clear that it was implementing the standards, and found them to be correct,” McLerran said."
"Trump welcomes Viktor Orban, Hungary's far-right nationalist prime minister, after past presidents shunned him",https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Liptak'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/13/politics/trump-hungary-viktor-orban/index.html,"Washington (CNN) He's rolled back democratic checks on his power, mused about creating a European ethnostate and erected a razor-wire fence to keep migrants out , angering the rest of the European Union.

So why was Hungary's far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Monday?

""I know he's a tough man but he's a respected man,"" Trump said during a friendly photo-op at the start of the talks on Monday. ""Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that's OK. That's OK.""

Administration officials say the invitation to the White House for talks — the first for a Hungarian prime minister in years — is part of a concerted strategy to re-engage Central European nations as Russia and China seek to exert influence in the region.

But the visit is raising questions about which leaders Trump is looking to cultivate — including a long list of global strongmen — at the expense of more traditional US allies.

Orbán was largely iced out during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both concerned about the steps he took to consolidate power and block independent media. He last visited the White House for one-on-one meetings in 2001, during his first stint as prime minister, but was refused an Oval Office meeting with Bush.

Since then, he's adopted a more stridently nationalist tone — including calls to create in Hungary a homogenous society that blocks asylum seekers or other refugees.

""We must state that we do not want to be diverse,"" he said in a 2018 speech. ""We do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others.""

Trump has closely monitored Orbán during his time in office — and particularly his anti-migration stance, which mirrors Trump's own. Other European leaders shunned Orbán's decision to block migrants from entering his country with a fence, but Trump has advocated his own border wall. Steve Bannon, once Trump's senior adviser, once deemed Orbán ""Trump before Trump.""

""We are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal immigration, on terrorism and to protect and help the Christian communities around the world,"" Orban said in short remarks from the Oval Office.

Orbán isn't exactly being welcomed back to Washington with open arms. He was the first foreign leader to endorse Trump in his presidential bid, and has lobbied intensely for a meeting, but it took more than two years to secure a White House invite — the last of the major Central European nations to come for talks.

The delay reflected American officials' desire to discourage Hungary from further eroding democratic values. It's an issue they've raised at lower-level meetings, including when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Budapest in February.

A bipartisan group of senators wrote Trump on Friday to ""express concern about Hungary's downward democratic trajectory and the implications for US interests in Central Europe,"" imploring him to raise the issues during his meeting.

Yet when they sit for talks in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon, officials said the President was expected to focus on arms sales and energy independence — and not the concerning practices that have earned Orbán his strongman reputation.

""I can assure you that all of these issues have been well covered with all of our Hungarian counterparts,"" said one senior administration official. ""The point of this meeting is simply to reinforce the strategic relationship between NATO allies, the US and Hungary, not necessarily to thrash out every issue on the bilateral agenda, which we have been doing constantly for the last two years.""

Several advisers have cautioned Trump about appearing overly chummy with his counterpart, believing a warm embrace could hamper the administration's efforts to keep Orbán at arms-length.

Already, however, Trump's ambassador to Hungary has created waves by suggesting the limits Orbán has placed on challenges to his power are something Trump himself would embrace.

""I can tell you, knowing the President for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orbán has, but he doesn't,"" David Cornstein told The Atlantic last week

The comment caught the attention of officials at the White House, who later claimed it was taken out of context. But it nevertheless illustrated the potential pitfalls of inviting a problematic pro-Trump leader the US is wary of elevating.

Trump announced during his meeting with Orbán that he would use next month's Group of 20 summit in Japan for meetings with both Putin and Xi.

The migration issue, along with Orbán's moves to consolidate control of the country's judiciary and threaten the independence of the media, has caused deep rifts with the European Union. Orbán's party was suspended in March from the EU's largest political coalition.

Trump has generated his own tiffs with the EU, namely over trade. He faces a mid-May deadline on imposing new tariffs on European autos.

This story has been updated with additional developments on Monday.

"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."

MINDEN, W.Va. — More than three decades after widespread environmental contamination was discovered in the small town of Minden in Fayette County, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday the area has been added to its Superfund National Priorities List.

In addition to mandated on-site environmental testing and removal of contamination, the designation will provide local residents with access to the Superfund, including possible eligibility for specialized medical care and other federal aid.

The EPA proposed adding the site to the National Priorities List in Sept. 2018. The designation was finalized following a review of comments received during the required 60-day public comment period.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler made the announcement at New Apostolic Church in Minden, joined by Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, R-W.Va., U.S. Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., and EPA Region 3 Administrator Cosmo Servidio.

EPA Andrew Wheeler

According to Wheeler, the decision to add Minden to the National Priorities List was based on several existing factors and on a number of documented events, beginning in 1970, when Shaffer Equipment Company began building electrical substations in Minden for the regional coal mining industry, eventually leading to soil and water contamination from oil containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) within materials stored at the company’s work site.

“I would say what really weighed on my mind in making the final call and listing today was the history of the site, and the fits and starts that this site has had since the early 80s, and the fact that we thought this was cleaned up three different times,” he said. “The community here had a lot of, I would say, a distrust on what’s happened in the past, and I felt the community needed this and needed the certainty of it being addressed — finally addressed — by both the state and the federal government.”

Gov. Justice said he shares the frustration of area residents who have lived through decades of what he characterized as unmitigated failure by government to respond appropriately.

“Maybe we can, now, straighten up what others just let go,” said Justice. “Why it took so long, none of us can explain, none of us can explain. That’s all there is to it. All I can do is apologize for it taking so long. It’s ridiculous, it’s absolutely terrible.”

Sen. Capito said she was pleased her office was able to help the agency clear the necessary hurdles to bring Minden under federal protection.

“It’s taken some work to get us here. We’ve worked closely with Administrator Wheeler and many others at EPA to make this happen for a while now, and this is an important designation. It’s not only an acknowledgement of the work that needs to be done, but it’s also a commitment from the federal government, a commitment of attention and resources and a commitment to provide more financial and technical assistance to clean up this site,” she said. “That also means delivering a new sense of safety and certainty to all those who call Minden home, and it means providing for the health and well-being of West Virginians.”

Region 3 Administrator Servidio told MetroNews the National Priorities List designation will generate the beginning of an intricate process of gathering information from scientists, investigators, and those impacted, directly and indirectly, as a result of PCB contamination.

“We are now in the midst of a remedial investigation, a thorough remedial investigation. All the information and data that we extrapolate we’ll share with the community, as we continue to do, and take input from them as well. They are a part of the process,” he said. “We take into (consideration) the whole history of the site, all the actions that we’ve done in coordination with the state, as we move forward.”

According to Servidio, the area that will undergo remedial testing for contamination includes the Shaffer Equipment Company property and sediment from the adjoining Arbuckle Creek, though the specific boundaries of the site chosen for scientific analysis will be defined further during the investigation, which is expected to begin by early summer.

In 2017, the EPA tested soil and sediment from the site and declined to take further action, concluding the site no longer posed an immediate threat to human health.

In April, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., sent a letter to Wheeler, reiterating his support for the proposed addition of Minden to the National Priorities List, noting the significantly higher rate of cancer among local residents, compared to other residents of Fayette County."
DHS asks military for more help dealing with influx of migrants,https://www.cnn.com,"['Barbara Starr', 'Ryan Browne']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/12/politics/homeland-security-military-immigration/index.html,"(CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has asked the military for more help as it deals with the influx of migrants coming into the US, including tents for large numbers of them, two US administration officials told CNN.

One official said the DHS request was for single occupancy units.

The request, which was delivered to the Pentagon Friday night, came as Customs and Border Protection predicted it would surpass half a million migrants crossing the border so far this fiscal year. The number of apprehensions on the US-Mexico border is the highest since 2009

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is considering the request.

""Secretary Shanahan is committed to increasing support to DHS where appropriate to do so,"" his spokesman, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, said in a statement.

DOJ tries to disqualify ex-Obama official from defending China’s Huawei,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Bebeto Matthews'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-tries-to-disqualify-ex-obama-official-from-defending-chinas-huawei,"The Justice Department is working to disqualify top Obama department official James Cole from defending the Chinese technology firm Huawei in a high-profile criminal case, according to a new heavily redacted federal court filing on Friday.

The Justice Department unsealed an indictment against Huawei in January 2019 which charged the company with bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to commit money laundering, obstruction of justice, illegal actions related to dodging Iran sanctions, and more. Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2011 to 2015, has been representing Huawei in this matter since 2017, but the Justice Department’s motion is an attempt to convince the court that Cole’s previous experiences investigating Huawei-related matters while at the department should disqualify him.

Cole held the second-highest position in the Obama Justice Department for five years, where he worked with Attorney General Eric Holder, oversaw the day-to-day operations of the department, and represented the department on the National Security Council. He brought those experiences to Sidley, one of the largest law firms in the country, where he is the global co-lead of their White Collar: Government Litigation and Investigations practice and where he has defended Huawei for the past couple years.

Justice Department attorneys told the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York that “Cole should be disqualified from representing Huawei Tech and Huawei USA in this case because of two different conflicts.” The details the department provided on the first conflict were heavily redacted. The agency said that “having represented the government in his role as DAG in the DOJ's [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED], Cole should not now be allowed to represent the defendants in a [REDACTED] matter brought by the DOJ that is substantially related in multiple respects to that [REDACTED] investigation.” Therefore, the department said that “Cole should be disqualified because he was personally and substantially involved in a [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED] that exposed him to relevant, privileged factual information [REDACTED] and strategic information about that investigation.”

The Justice Department did not specify those prior investigations.

The agency said the second conflict is that “Cole's representation of the defendants jeopardizes the government's interest in having a fair trial and obtaining a conviction that can sustain appeal and collateral attack.” Their claim was that, due to Cole’s past involvement in Justice Department investigations related to the Huawei case, he would not be able to provide Huawei with a proper defense and that “any representation by Cole would taint the trial process and any ultimate conviction.”

The Justice Department met with Cole related to his alleged conflict of interest multiple times in January and February 2019. Cole declined to recuse himself in March 2019, stating, “We have carefully considered the material you showed us and were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified based on that information.”

For its part, Huawei released a statement saying the Justice Department “has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter” and that its motion “makes a mockery of the adversarial process.” Huawei says that this is an attempt by the department “to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice … while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The Justice Department has been increasing its scrutiny of China’s activities in recent years, launching a ""China Initiative"" in 2018 and charging an increased number of people in China-related espionage cases, cracking down on China-based hacking schemes, prosecuting Chinese efforts to steal trade secrets, and more. The department has turned its sights on Huawei’s alleged criminality: Aside from charging the company and its connected entities, the U.S. government is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer Wanzhou Meng, who the U.S. believes was involved in the criminal conspiracy.

The U.S. government widely suspects that the Chinese-based Huawei, a technology firm that is a global leader in telecommunications and in 5G, is working hand in hand with the Chinese government, giving China's surveillance state access to hardware and networks around the world. Discussing the U.S.’s intelligence-sharing relationships with the United Kingdom and other European allies who are considering the use of Huawei’s 5G technology, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently warned, “We don’t believe you can have those technologies in your systems and still have a trusted network. We’re happy to continue to look at technology and see ways we might achieve that, but the United States for its part will only participate in trusted networks. We will only share America’s information with those networks that we are confident aren’t under the control of China or China’s government.”

The Department of Defense’s annual report to Congress on China, released in May, stressed that China is a growing threat not just in terms of hard power military capabilities but also in terms of cyberattacks, espionage, and infiltration. The Defense Department pointed out that China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law “requires Chinese companies, such as Huawei and ZTE, to support, provide assistance, and cooperate in China’s national intelligence work, wherever they operate.”

Cole is not the only former high-ranking Obama official representing China-based Huawei’s interests. Samir Jain, who was the senior director for cybersecurity policy for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, registered as a lobbyist for Huawei earlier this year.

"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve",https://www.npr.org,['Tim Mak'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721763041/exclusive-documents-detail-meetings-of-russians-with-treasury-federal-reserve,"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pavel Ptitsin/AP Pavel Ptitsin/AP

Newly obtained documents describe what happened when two now-infamous Russians took their outreach campaign into the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2015.

Alexander Torshin, then a Russian central banker, brought his protégée, Maria Butina, for meetings with senior officials and even sought another with the then-chair of the Fed, the documents confirm.

Agency officials described what happened before and since in internal materials obtained by NPR under the Freedom of Information Act. The fact of the meetings has previously been reported, but their contents have not been fully described until now.

Torshin has since been sanctioned by the Treasury Department and cannot return to the United States.

Butina, meanwhile, has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to serve as a Russian agent and has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.

In an interview with NPR on Thursday, Butina called her meetings with government officials, politicians and the National Rifle Association ""civil diplomacy, this unofficial channel of diplomacy"" and said it was meant to build relationships between the U.S. and Russian governments — and ultimately to promote peace.

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department declined to comment for this story.

The 'gun fanatic'

Torshin and Butina sought to build bridges between the Russian government and influential Americans via their enthusiasm for gun rights. Both had life memberships in the National Rifle Association.

At the same time, Russia was stepping up its broader campaign of influence against the United States.

So in 2015, after the chill in relations between Washington and Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Torshin sought to take advantage of his connection to Russia's central bank.

Paul Saunders, who was then the executive director of a D.C.-based think tank called the Center for the National Interest, reached out to officials with the Treasury and the Fed to help organize meetings.

""Because we were about a year into U.S. sanctions on Russia following their annexation of Crimea, we thought it would be interesting for Americans to hear from a Russian central bank official about the status of the Russian financial system,"" Saunders told NPR. ""We were certainly not at that time aware of any derogatory information about Torshin.""

Saunders helped broker a meeting for Torshin and Butina with Nathan Sheets, then the undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs.

Treasury aide Erik Woodhouse consulted with a number of officials inside its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the White House's National Security Council, but no red flags were raised about the meeting, which ultimately took place on April 7, 2015.

A few years later, after Butina was arrested, a Treasury Department staffer wrote about what took place.

According to that newly revealed account, the discussion wasn't so much about banking as about denying Russia's involvement in the shoot-down of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner and amplifying Torshin's support for guns.

""The meeting was supposed to be about economics, but the guy just went on and on about how the Russians didn't shoot down MH17 for an hour or so,"" the Treasury Department official wrote, referring to the Malaysia Airlines flight.

""The guy was also a gun fanatic and said he was a 'life member of the NRA.' In fact I think he was even in town for personal business tied to the NRA.""

Saunders also reached out to request a meeting between then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Torshin in March 2015.

Yellen's office passed on the meeting and suggested that Torshin instead meet with Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer. Following the approval of an adviser, Fischer took the meeting on April 8, 2015, without further investigation into Torshin's background.

""They are in the United States to attend the NRA's annual meeting,"" the meeting's official notes read. Both Russians pointed out, as part of their introduction, that they were ""life members"" of the NRA.

This meeting did turn to economic issues, including discussions about Russian credit and inflation.

Butina, now in custody at a detention center in Alexandria, Va., said the meetings were unremarkable.

Of her meeting with Fischer, she said: ""Torshin put it straight: that he is here as an NRA member and he's just interested in meeting similar-minded people. ... I don't remember, even, the details of this conversation, because it wasn't significant at all.""

The sanctions

After months of investigations and headlines about Russia's influence campaign against the United States, Torshin was placed under sanction by the U.S. government in 2018.

In the evidentiary package that designated Torshin as a target for U.S. sanctions — also obtained by NPR — the Treasury Department established that Torshin was a Russian government official who could be targeted under existing sanctions authorities.

But the package also highlighted Torshin's alleged links with Russian organized crime.

Citing public sources such as Crime Russia, a news website focusing on Russian corruption, and El País, a Spanish newspaper, the document noted that Torshin was in ""frequent contact"" with Alexander Romanov, who heads the Taganskaya organized crime group, between August 2012 to May 2013.

""Torshin may have personally given instructions to members of the Taganskaya on money laundering methods using Spanish bank accounts and real estate,"" the evidentiary package reads.

The package cites no classified or governmental sources, but experts say the inclusion of references to Torshin's alleged organized crime links suggests the U.S. government had reason to believe the allegation was truthful.

""There's a whole process that is used for determining what is included in an evidentiary package. By including it, they view it as credible and relevant to designating him with sanctions,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, who formerly served as a senior adviser to the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

""This information is strictly ancillary to the legal authorities needed to sanction Torshin, but they want to put it out there for government officials to be aware of.""

Butina told NPR that she once asked Torshin about these alleged links, but she said she didn't believe they were true.

""I have no knowledge about this, absolutely none. ... One time I asked him about it, and he denied it ... a couple of years ago,"" she said. ""I don't believe he has this type of personality."""
President Trump’s penchant for secrecy is about to be tested in court,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'May At Pm']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-penchant-for-secrecy-is-about-to-be-tested-in-court/2019/05/12/bf604b4e-71c6-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html,"AMONG THE mysteries surrounding President Trump’s conduct, one of the strangest is his penchant for meeting President Vladimir Putin of Russia without aides or interpreters, contrary to the practice of past presidents. The Post’s Greg Miller has quoted U.S. officials as saying there is no detailed record, even in classified files, of Mr. Trump’s face-to-face interactions with the Russian leader at five locations over the past two years, and in one case, Mr. Trump seized the notes made by an interpreter who was present.

This peculiar behavior is about to be tested in court. Three groups have brought a lawsuit seeking to force Mr. Trump and his advisers to follow the laws that govern presidential and federal agency records. So far, they allege, the president has failed to do so.

At issue are the Presidential Records Act, which covers Mr. Trump’s activities, and the Federal Records Act, which covers agencies such as the State Department. In normal procedure, State provides interpreters for such meetings. The presidential records law was passed by Congress in 1978, after Richard M. Nixon’s resignation, to prevent Nixon from destroying or otherwise disposing of his records and secretly recorded White House conversations. The law established that records of the presidency relating to duties of the office are the property of the American people, and it ended the previous tradition of presidential records belonging to former presidents. Importantly, the law also demands that the president take care to ensure his activities are documented and preserved for eventual access by the public — a vital form of accountability. Likewise, the Federal Records Act requires government officials to document their activities and preserve their history.

The three organizations questioning Mr. Trump’s adherence to the law are Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit government accountability group; the National Security Archive, a leading nonprofit research group at George Washington University that uses the Freedom of Information Act extensively; and the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, which represents scholars seeking to document U.S. diplomacy. In addition to Mr. Trump’s meetings with Mr. Putin, the groups question in their lawsuit whether an adequate record exists of the president’s conversations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, or of senior White House aide Jared Kushner’s meetings with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The failure to document these meetings is not only about compliance with the law. Mr. Trump’s secrecy deprives his own advisers of knowledge about what is going on and thus harms their ability to give him good advice. It will blast a huge crater in the work of historians who attempt to piece together what transpired in Mr. Trump’s presidency. It also deprives the American people of a basic method of holding Mr. Trump accountable for his performance. No doubt he likes it that way. But the courts must insist that no president is above the law, including the law for keeping honest and full records of the presidency."
EPA demolishes ‘dangerous’ building containing asbestos in Otsego,https://www.mlive.com,"['Brad Devereaux', 'Bdevereaux Mlive.Com', 'Bdeverea Mlive.Com']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2019/05/epa-demolishes-dangerous-building-containing-asbestos-in-otsego.html,"OTSEGO, MI — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s demolition of a building containing asbestos in Otsego is under way.

The EPA is on site this week, executing a plan to spend an estimated nearly $1 million to demolish Rock Tenn Paper Mill, 431 Helen Avenue, which is contaminated with asbestos, Paul Ruesch of the EPA said.

“That building was trashed. It was really dangerous,” Ruesch said on Friday, May 10, as demolition was progressing and much of the building had come down.

“I’m happy the EPA is able to take away the environmental hazard and the safety hazard,"" he said.

EPA to spend nearly $1M to demolish building containing asbestos in Otsego The building will be demolished in 2019.

Workers used heavy machinery equipped with shears, grapples and other tools to begin ripping down parts of the building this week, and a process is in place to control the dust during the project, Ruesch said. Contractors licensed to work with asbestos materials will remove the debris from the site and it will be disposed of in a special way, he said.

Beginning in the next week, residents will see an increase of slow-moving traffic on West River Street (also known as 106th Avenue) as trucks haul materials off the site, Ruesch said. People will be there using flags to alert motorists.

Some metal pieces will remain on the site once crews leave the area, Ruesch said on Friday.

The work began in April and is expected to be complete by the end of May, he said, and the project is expected to come in significantly under budget.

A previous environmental assessment identified asbestos contamination at the building that was part of the former RockTenn paper mill at 431 Helen Avenue in Otsego, Allegan County Executive Director of Services Dan Wedge has said. Allegan County took ownership of the 48-acre property that includes the building where asbestos was found through a tax foreclosure, Wedge said.

The project announcement comes after a joint request from the Allegan County Treasurer’s Office and the City of Otsego submitted June 28. The funds have been made available under the EPA Time-Critical Removal Action, Allegan County said.

The funding allows for the entire power house building to be demolished and removed by EPA contractors, the county said.

The money comes from U.S. EPA funds for Superfund sites, and the EPA will attempt to recover the cost from responsible parties, Ruesch said.

The paper mill closed in 2004. Anthony M. Davis of Canton bought the former Rock-Tenn site in 2006 and the property entered foreclosure in April 2011 after Davis’ company, Cogswell Property LLF, failed to pay overdue property taxes.

Davis was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013 after he pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Clean Air Act by failing to obtain a thorough asbestos inspection for the mill’s powerhouse building before stripping out pipes that he knew were wrapped in insulation containing asbestos. He was sentenced to pay $168,029.59 in restitution to the the EPA.

In 2012, the EPA arranged to remove about 200 drums and bins of toxic waste from the former RockTenn site.

The land is for sale now and will be available for purchase for a minimal investment, Wedge said previously. The demolition is meant to help bring more redevelopment opportunities, he said."

Updated at 7:56 p.m. ET

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the — 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""
DOJ celebrates judge ruling radio station must register under FARA as Russian agent,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-celebrates-judge-ruling-radio-station-must-register-under-fara-as-russian-agent,"The Justice Department celebrated on Monday a federal judge’s decision which found that a Washington, D.C., radio station, operated by RM Broadcasting, had been acting as an agent of a foreign power, Russia, and must therefore register as such under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Assistant Attorney General John Demers touted the decision, saying that “the American people have a right to know if a foreign flag waves behind speech broadcast in the United States.”

Since 2017, RM Broadcasting had been using AM radio channel 1390 WZHF to rebroadcast Russia’s Sputnik radio programs in D.C., and so the Justice Department was able to convince a district judge in southern Florida, where RM Broadcasting is based, that the company was acting as a foreign agent on Russia’s behalf. Last week, Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that RM Broadcasting was working on behalf of the federal state unitary enterprise Rossiya Segodnya, an international information agency, which the Justice Department contends is “a Russian state-owned media enterprise created by Vladimir Putin to advance Russian interests abroad.”

The Justice Department highlighted the decision as an example of its commitment to stepping up Foreign Agents Registration Act enforcement. “Our concern is not the content of the speech but providing transparency about the true identity of the speaker,” Demers said. “This case shows that the Department can and will utilize all of its tools to bring transparency to efforts by foreign entities to influence the American public and our government, and demonstrates our renewed effort to enforce FARA rigorously.”

The Justice Department said its court win over RM Broadcasting “marked the first FARA civil enforcement action since 1991.”

The foreign agents registration law requires anyone who is working on behalf of a foreign government — lobbyists, businesses, newspapers, think tanks, media outlets, and radio stations — to disclose their foreign relationship by registering with the Justice Department.

The Justice Department contended that Russia’s “control” over RM Broadcasting’s activity “was absolute with respect to broadcast content.” The department said that RM Broadcasting was being used by Russia as a U.S.-based middle man to attempt an end run around the law and told the court that “allowing foreign principals to circumvent FARA simply by operating in the U.S. through contractual intermediaries would render FARA ineffectual with respect to its purpose of informing the public of the foreign source of information.” The judge agreed, saying that RM Broadcasting “is an agent of a foreign principal and is required to register pursuant to FARA.”

Originally passed during the World War II era to combat Nazi propaganda efforts, the rarely prosecuted FARA law gained new attention after special counsel Robert Mueller secured convictions under the statute against Trump associates, including Paul Manafort and Rick Gates during his investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 campaign. Brandon Van Grack, who spent a year and a half working for Mueller, was put in charge of the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act unit earlier this year as the department promised to step up enforcement.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Adam Hickey told the Washington Examiner that the department now believes that the foreign agents law “is a sufficiently high priority and there are enough cases to warrant having a deputy chief responsible for the malign influence work generally, just like we have a deputy chief for export control and sanctions, cyber, and economic espionage.”

RM Broadcasting joins better-known Russia-backed outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik in being forced to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act in recent years. The U.S. has also stepped up the pressure on Chinese state media operating in the U.S. The China Global Television Network registered in 2019, but Xinhua News Agency has thus far declined to do so."
"After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has dropped a requirement that peer-reviewed studies by staff scientists include a disclaimer that findings are “preliminary.” (Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as “preliminary,” after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat — these findings and conclusions are “preliminary” and have “not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.”

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: “The findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.”

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a “welcome” change.

“The previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‘preliminary’ would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,” Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. “It is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.”

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: “Many journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.”

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that “removing ‘preliminary’ from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.”

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have “agency-specific policies” that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department’s internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several “flags” that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of “prominent issues,” include “significant” scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request “corrections” and “changes,” if the scientific publication falls under the category of “prominent issues” or policy implications.

“It is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,” Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal “stakeholders” request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return “the REVISED PUBLICATION” for “ACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,” the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA’s scientific integrity rules and “helps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.”

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review “into a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.” Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, “just about any output” from that agency could be flagged, she said.

"After reports of record falsification, Department of Justice investigating Connections prison services",https://www.delawareonline.com,"['Christina Jedra', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2019/05/13/doj-investigating-connections-prison-services/1187333001/,"CLOSE A former employee at Connections CSP says she was told to falsify dozens of female patient records at Crest South. 5/10/19 Jerry Habraken and Damian Giletto, Delaware News Journal

The Delaware Department of Justice said on Monday it is investigating Connections Community Support Programs, the private contractor that provides physical and mental health services to all inmates in state correctional facilities.

News of the probe comes after The News Journal published an investigation into reports that the contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment at Crest South, a taxpayer-funded substance abuse program for drug offenders in Georgetown.

Over a dozen inmates at Crest South said they received little or no individual counseling during their stay. Four former Crest counselors said the program supervisor instructed subordinates to falsify and backdate records to indicate clients had received counseling and treatment plans when in fact they did not. The supervisor denies this.

One former counselor, Shannon Lasek, admitted to falsifying at least 30 records.

""DOJ’s Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust is aware of issues regarding Connections’ contract and work with the Department of Correction, and is conducting an investigation,"" said DOJ Communications Director Mat Marshall.

Marshall would not comment further on the substance of the investigation but said that people with information about ""Connections' record-keeping practices"" should contact publictrust@delaware.gov.

Connections CEO Cathy McKay did not make herself available to The News Journal for interviews but issued a statement on Monday.

""We welcome any objective investigation into our programs and are confident any investigation will work to restore a level of trust in the community,"" she said.

The organization investigated its own records after Lasek said in her December resignation letter that she was forced to falsify documents. McKay said officials ""were satisfied that this did not occur.""

The Department of Correction, which paid Connections $15 million for its mental health and substance abuse services last year, said it did ""a quick search"" of electronic records in December that showed no evidence of falsification but it is conducting a deeper investigation now.

According to McKay, Connections' electronic record-keeping system cannot be backdated and ""clearly shows that individuals did receive services they claimed in print did not happen.""

Lasek said it's true that the electronic system automatically timestamps new inputs. She said when she falsified records, she published notes in the computer system that referred to paper charts. The electronic marker would show the current date, according to Lasek, but the paper file would have the older date the treatment plan was due.

Connections Board Chairman Bob Byrd said he had nothing to add to McKay's statement.

A spokesman for Gov. John Carney called the allegations of record falsification a ""clearly troubling"" situation that deserves the attention of prosecutors.

""We will not solve our addiction crisis without addressing addiction in our prisons, where 46 percent of inmates on any given day are facing challenges with substance use,"" said Jonathan Starkey, the governor's communications director.

""We need to make sure that inmates have real access to treatment so they have a chance of success when they leave prison and re-enter their communities. Addiction affects every corner of our state, and this is too important an issue to not get right.""

The DOC said in a statement that it appreciates The News Journal bringing ""more detailed information and in-person accounts"" to its attention.

""Should the allegations be substantiated, the Department of Correction will take appropriate corrective action,"" the agency said. ""The DOC remains committed to providing quality care to the individuals entrusted into its custody.""

MaryBeth Cichocki, a Delaware addiction treatment advocate, has heard complaints about the quality of Connections services for years. In response to reports of falsification, she said she was ""not surprised.""

""Connections needs to be kicked out of Delaware, and we need to start a new program with people who really care about the outcomes of the people they’re treating,"" said Cichocki, who lost her son to an overdose in 2015. ""From what I’ve seen of Connections, all they care about is making money.""

The state, which paid Connections more than $72 million in state contracts last year, needs to reconsider its service delivery, Cichocki said.



""Connections has taken over the state and there is no competition anymore,"" she said. ""I really think the state is at a loss for what to do so they keep funding Connections.""

The Department of Correction recently extended Connections' mental health contract through mid-2020 and said the allegations of fraud will ""absolutely not"" get in the way of that agreement.

""That’s pretty sad if Connections is all we have and these things are happening and they’re continuing to ignore it,"" Cichocki said.

Lasek hopes the Department of Justice investigation is more thorough than the probes done by Connections and the DOC, neither of which interviewed her.

""They need to listen to the counselors and past clients,"" she said. ""We know there is a big problem. Let's all care enough to do something about it. Let's care more about the harm being done to people than their need to look good.""

This isn't the first time a Delaware health care contractor has been accused of falsifying records.

In 1994, St. Louis-based Correctional Medical Services lost its license for faulty record-keeping at a Gander Hill substance abuse program. Documents showed months of treatment plans, program notes and clinical supervision records were missing from client files, the News Journal reported at the time.

One inmate said he was instructed to sign a blank form or be expelled from the program. Another prisoner filed a complaint after he was directed to sign eight months' worth of progress reports in one session, the Journal reported.

In 2005, a former Correctional Medical Services drug and alcohol counselor said she was ordered to falsify documents from 1999 to 2002 so state inspectors wouldn't pull the program's license, the News Journal reported.

""I received a chart that wasn't touched for four months,"" said former counselor Denise Rodriguez. ""I was told to 'catch the chart up' using previous statements from the client.""

About 20 years later, Lasek reported a very similar experience with Connections.

Also in 2005, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice opened a ""formal inquiry"" into medical care and other systemic issues inside Delaware prisons.

The inquiry followed a six-month investigation by The News Journal highlighting AIDS-related inmate deaths and suicides over four years; allegations by inmates of poor medical treatment for cancer, meningitis and hepatitis; and a no-bid $25.9 million contract awarded to Correctional Medical Services to manage health care in the state's prisons.

The U.S. Department of Justice found ""substantial civil rights violations"" inside Delaware's prisons. Federal officials reached a settlement with the DOC despite protests from state officials and even a letter from then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner to then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales attempting to derail the nine-month federal investigation.

Federal regulators identified a host of problems inside the prisons, including inadequate screening and health assessments, inadequate treatment of inmates with infectious diseases, inadequate treatment of inmates with serious mental illness and deficiencies in the state's suicide-prevention measures.

The state signed an 87-point agreement promising to correct the deficiencies and ""meet generally accepted professional standards.""

After six years of working to improve inmate health, the DOC was released from the imposed agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice on the final day of 2012.

Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves,https://www.politico.com,['Zack Colman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/10/epa-air-chief-3238271,"The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues. ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves

A secretive utility industry coalition formerly represented by a top official at the Environmental Protection Agency is dissolving amid investigations into whether its members received special treatment from the Trump administration.

The Utility Air Regulatory Group has been under scrutiny from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was seeking information on the relationship between power companies, EPA air chief Bill Wehrum and the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, which represented the group.

Story Continued Below

UARG has frequently argued against tighter air pollution and climate regulations; Wehrum is undoing many of the policies at EPA that the group targeted when he represented it at Hunton.

The group released a statement Friday saying its ""membership has decided to disband the organization following a wind down period."" The statement said a committee would be formed to handle ""the completion/fulfillment of UARG's existing obligations and support of members as they continue to cooperate with the Congressional inquiry.""

In a separate statement, Hunton said it was ""proud to have been part of"" UARG's efforts to shape federal air pollution rules through public comments and other participation in the regulatory process.

Wehrum represented UARG until 2017, when he was nominated by President Donald Trump to be EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, a position that has allowed him to oversee many of his former clients' top regulatory priorities.

Membership in UARG was first reported by POLITICO, which obtained internal organization documents showing Hunton billed power companies $8.2 million in dues for 2017. Several utilities had already fled the organization before it was terminated Friday.

The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues.

Wehrum he has stayed in frequent contact with former colleagues at Hunton and other companies affiliated with the group. But he said he did not violate his ethics agreement, as he recused himself for dealing with “particular matters” related to UARG.

The House committee is investigating how power companies paid for UARG dues and whether the group's members had undue influence over EPA policy. Consumer advocates allege utility customers often foot the bill, which some power companies have confirmed; American Electric Power told Inside EPA that ratepayers financed membership.

Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), as well as Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), welcomed the group's dissolution, but said it wouldn't affect their investigation.

""Important questions remain about whether EPA officials William Wehrum and David Harlow continue to advance their former coal industry clients’ agenda at EPA, and we intend to see those questions through,” the three lawmakers said in a statement Friday evening.

UARG had existed since the 1970s but became aggressively litigious during the Obama administration.

One of its major achievements was a 2014 Supreme Court ruling, UARG v. EPA, in which Justice Antonin Scalia scolded EPA for seeking an “enormous and transformative expansion” of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

UARG challenged many other major EPA regulations from the Obama era, including carbon rules for existing and future coal plants, a mercury rule for coal plants, the updated ozone standard, haze cleanup plans and safety rules for industrial chemical facilities. Most of those lawsuits hadn't been settled before the Trump administration took power. EPA is now revising or repealing most of those rules.

And UARG is helping defend EPA in at least six ongoing lawsuits, including over several changes to air permitting policies and the agency's rejection of pollution complaints from downwind states.

It is unclear how UARG’s dissolution will affect those cases.

U.S. says Huawei lawyer's prior work at Justice Department poses conflicts,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-huawei-tech/u-s-says-huawei-lawyers-prior-work-at-justice-department-poses-conflicts-idUSKCN1SG2GU,"(Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd lawyer James Cole’s prior work at the U.S. Department of Justice created conflicts of interest that should disqualify him from defending the Chinese company in a case of alleged bank fraud and sanctions violations, U.S. prosecutors said in a filing on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign board of Huawei at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) Asia 2018 in Shanghai, China June 14, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo

Last week, the prosecutors filed a motion to disqualify Cole, who served as deputy attorney general, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, between 2011 and 2015. But the motion was sealed and classified, and prosecutors did not make public the reasons behind the move.

“There is a ‘substantial risk’ that Cole could use ‘confidential factual information’ obtained while serving as DAG to ‘materially advance’ Huawei’s current defense strategy,” the prosecutors said, according to a redacted copy of the U.S. motion filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.

Cole was not immediately available for comment. But in a statement Huawei said the U.S. wants to strip the company of counsel of its choice while concealing the facts on why.

“The Justice Department’s motion to disqualify Jim Cole makes a mockery of the adversarial process,” the statement said.

“The government has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter. Now, two years later, not only does the Justice Department seek to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice, but it does so while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The case against Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has ratcheted up tensions between Beijing and Washington as the world’s top two economic powers try to negotiate a trade deal.

The company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in December at the behest of U.S. authorities for her role in the alleged fraud. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.

In Friday’s filing, U.S. prosecutors said Cole’s representation of Huawei poses “irresolvable conflicts of interest.”

As deputy attorney general, Cole “personally supervised and participated in aspects of” an investigation that caused the conflicts, the prosecutors said in the filing.

Details of that probe were redacted, but the filing said the Huawei prosecution is “substantially related” to the matter.

The prosecutors said Cole possessed information from his government work related to his Huawei representation that he could not reveal, and this created the risk he would rely on the information in breach his duties to the Justice Department.

Secondly, because the nature of the conflict is classified, the prosecutors said, Huawei cannot obtain enough information for them to waive any conflict.

The case against Huawei and Meng accuses them of conspiring to defraud HSBC Holdings Plc and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a company that operated in Iran, putting the banks at risk of penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions laws.

Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner. The United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei’s Iran business.

U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system.

Last month, prosecutors said they planned to use information about Huawei in the case that was obtained through secret surveillance.

Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in Brooklyn on March 14."
Trump: It would be 'appropriate' for me to talk to DOJ about investigating Biden,https://thehill.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/443234-trump-it-would-be-appropriate-for-me-to-talk-to-doj-about-investigating,"President Trump Donald John TrumpStates fight Trump rollback of Obama lightbulb rules Authorities investigating shooting near Trump resort in Florida Trump: 'China is dreaming' Biden, other Dems get elected MORE said Friday it would be ""appropriate"" for him to discuss opening an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joseph (Joe) Robinette BidenTrump: 'China is dreaming' Biden, other Dems get elected A more disciplined Biden learns not to take the bait Kamala Harris says she wouldn't have voted for NAFTA MORE and his family with Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrTrump lashes out at Dem talk of 'constitutional crisis' Dems warn of 'constitutional crisis' but wary of impeachment Schiff dismisses Trump's threat to investigate Biden MORE.

Trump told Politico in an interview Friday that he hasn’t talked with Barr about investigating Biden and his family's business dealings but said ""certainly it would be an appropriate thing"" to bring up with the attorney general.

""Certainly it is a very big issue and we’ll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven’t thought of that. I mean, you’re asking me a question I just haven’t thought of,"" he told the outlet.

The president noted that it could be ""a very big situation"" for Biden, who has led the Democratic presidential primary field in polling since he launched his campaign last month.

""Because he’s a Democrat it’s about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican, it would be a lot bigger,"" Trump alleged.

Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last week called for an investigation into Biden for his previous ties to Ukraine after The New York Times reported that while Biden was vice president in 2016, he allegedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor. The prosecutor, who had been accused of ignoring corruption in his own office, was later voted out.

Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of an energy company that the prosecutor had been looking into, according to the newspaper.

Giuliani initially planned to travel to Ukraine to encourage Ukraine's president-elect to launch investigations into Biden and the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE's Russia investigation.

However, Giuliani changed course late Friday, announcing that he had canceled his trip. The reversal came after Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of seeking aid from a foreign government.

Biden, the front-runner among a crowded field of Democrats vying for the White House in 2020, had a 32-point lead over his competitors in a Hill-HarrisX poll released earlier this week.

Biden also surpassed Trump by six points in the first poll published after the former vice president officially announced his candidacy in April."
US DoJ Charges Group of Individuals Who Stole $2.5 Mln in Crypto Via SIM Swapping,https://cointelegraph.com,['Ana Berman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-charges-group-of-individuals-who-stole-25-mln-in-crypto-via-sim-swapping,"The United States Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment on May 9 that charges a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider and his colleague from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Angie Salazar announced the charges in the Eastern District of Michigan. Per Salazar, the investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations on two continents.

According to the indictment, five Americans and an Irishman are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Another three, who reportedly are the former employees of mobile phone providers, are charged in a criminal complaint with the wire fraud related to “The Community.”

As described in the document, the hacking group used SIM swapping — a type of identity theft attack that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication. The perpetrator usually gains control of a target's mobile phone by convincing or bribing the employee of the mobile provider to swap the phone number to a SIM card controlled by the hackers.

After successfully swapping the numbers of their victims, “The Community” managed to gain access to their various online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets. As a result of fraud, approximately $2.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to wallets controlled by the hacking group. Attorney Schneider clarified that in this case, three mobile phone service provider employees purportedly helped swappers to steal money.

The charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison each. Meanwhile, a conviction of aggravated identity theft could add up to two years in prison for the defendants .

According to Irish news website The Journal, a 20-year-old man from Dublin was arrested in Ireland upon the request of the U.S. authorities and is currently awaiting extradition.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in November 2018, a law enforcement group dedicated to fighting cybercrime released a report on SIM swapping, stating that it had become increasingly popular in California.

Meanwhile, in January, a 21-year old American was accused of stealing almost $24 million in crypto via SIM swapping. And in February, a New York resident was indicted in what constituted the jurisdiction’s first SIM-swapping prosecution."
Gates: Trump should have confronted Putin about election meddling,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/gates-trump-should-have-confronted-putin-about-election-meddling,"Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said President Trump hasn't been tough enough on Russia in the wake of the Mueller report.

""I think he should have said, we've had this discussion. The evidence is in. And don't ever do this again, or there will be consequences for Russia. I think he very much should have raised it with him,"" Gates said in a CBS interview.

Gates, who was appointed by President George W. Bush and continued to serve under President Barack Obama, said that while the administration has been tough in the sanctions it has imposed on Russia, the United States hasn't reacted strongly enough to its interference in the 2016 presidential election.

[Related: Trump: Obama did 'nothing' about Russian interference]

""I think there are ways we can do that, not military, but it's perhaps a certain set of sanctions. It's also using some of our own capabilities to go back into Russia and let's say inform the Russian people at the magnitude of corruption of Putin,"" he said. ""And I think we can make a case about that. I think we can create more problems for him. We have the capabilities to do that.""

Special counsel Robert Mueller's report revealed the Kremlin was involved in efforts to disseminate disinformation and sow division among voters ahead of the 2016 effort, but did not conclude the president or his campaign participated.

Gates, who also served as director of central intelligence under George H.W. Bush, said lawmakers should take action on the report's findings.

""The piece of the Mueller report about Russian interference is not case closed. And frankly, I think elected officials who depend on honest elections to get elected ought to place as a very high priority measures to protect the American electoral system against interference by foreigners,"" Gates said."
Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A decision on where in the West — possibly Utah — to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it’s moving. I can’t tell you where it’s going, but it’s moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they’ll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That’s an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that’s consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you’re only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don’t know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That’s why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain’t there in the first place,"" he said. ""There’s coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn’t exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We’re going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don’t have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don’t have? You don’t have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We’re trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."
Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker admits he is 'nervous' about DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-admits-he-is-nervous-about-doj-inspector-general,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker admitted on Friday that he is “nervous” about DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into the conduct of the DOJ and the FBI during the Trump-Russia probe.

Sitting down with with Lawfare’s Benjamin Wittes in a crowded room at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Baker said he is “assuming that they will dig and find stuff” and that “we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.” But Baker defended the FBI's actions, including its use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Horowitz’s investigation is particularly focused on alleged FISA abuse and the reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele in FISA applications targeting Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and the opposition research group Fusion GPS. The investigation is expected to finish in May or June.

Wittes said that Baker “had expressed great confidence in the way you guys conducted yourselves, in the integrity of these fundamental judgments, in the opening with respect to two separate investigations and with the respect to the handling of this FISA application.” Wittes then asked Baker: “So, how nervous are you about the IG?”

Baker said he is “always nervous about the IG,"" adding that “they’re coming in after the fact to look at what we did."" At the time, he said, the FBI was “trying to do it in real time and having the pressure to deal with these threats as they were coming.”

Baker contended that he was “confident in the judgments that I made at the time based on the information that I had available to me.” But he left open the possibility that others may have engaged in wrongdoing, saying, “I’m sure they will find things that I didn’t know at the time and maybe that others didn’t know at the time.”

“There were facts that existed in the Bureau that were known by certain people that weren’t known by others including me, that’s certainly possible and that happens frequently,” Baker said. “And so, I’m assuming that they will dig and find stuff like that. So, we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.”

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

During the event Friday, Baker defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier and stressed that he examined the FISA warrant applications on Page before they got signed and sent to the court. He said he was “comfortable” with their contents and was confident that the process remained “lawful.” Regarding the FISA court, Baker said: “These are federal judges for goodness' sake. They know how to evaluate wiretap applications. ... These are serious, serious judges.”

On the bureau’s handling of Steele, Baker said, “We’re not stupid. The FBI. We’re not stupid.”

And Baker said the FBI was careful in the way it used Steele’s reporting. “We have an obligation to take that information seriously and to be highly skeptical … You go to work … You try to validate it … We don’t just swallow it hook, line, and sinker. ... We spent a lot of time trying to vet that information line by line,"" he said.

“We are the Federal Bureau of Investigations, not the Federal Bureau of Conclusions,” Baker said defensively.

Steele has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele. And the New York Times reported that the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

Baker mentioned that he’s faced investigations before. “I’ve been investigated — or matters that I’ve worked on have been investigated — many times by the Inspector General. It’s not a pleasant process. It’s just not. The people are pleasant but the process is not the most enjoyable,"" he said.

Baker may have been referring to an alleged criminal leaks investigation that had been opened on him, which had been reported on as early as December 2017. He confirmed the existence of an investigation but declined to provide many specifics, saying, “Yes there is an investigation with respect to matters in which I was involved that is still open that I have cooperated fully with. I met with the investigative team for many hours over many days. That took place about a year and a half ago.”

“I haven’t heard anything since then … other than to hear from the Department that the matter is still open.” Baker said. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal.”

Baker was appointed as the FBI general counsel in January 2014 and was later reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, Baker resigned from the FBI and has since written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

As the event ended, Baker summed up his thoughts on all of these investigations. “Hindsight is 20/20,” he remarked."
US Treasury Ironically Accusing Vietnam of Currency Manipulation,https://beincrypto.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-ironically-accusing-vietnam-currency-manipulation/,"Recent months have seen increasing tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) via increases in interest rates. These have come in response to a robust US economy, a high-flying stock market, and a strong US dollar.

The current economic miracle is closely related to the massive rate decreases that the Fed used to pull up from the crisis of 2008. When the threat of a currency decline became apparent, the Fed rushed to prop up the dollar and with it, the US economy.

Pot and Kettle

In an ironic turn, however, the US Treasury has now threatened to turn up the heat on foreign governments for manipulating currencies. The scrutiny includes the twelve largest trading partners with the US, plus a host of other nations with trading surpluses.

While the vast majority of these nations have passed the so-called test, Vietnam stands to be the first nation accused. The country is apparently using external means to hold down the dong — the national currency of Vietnam. Obviously, the name has led to a host of snide comments regarding the country’s actions.

Passive Aggressive

The twist comes with a perusal of other US trading partners. Nearly every country on the list is using some means of currency manipulation.

For example, the Japanese government has been buying up massive amounts of ETFs in the country in order to keep the yen down, and Switzerland has been hoarding Apple stock to devalue the franc. China, too, recently buoyed its stock market by pumping money into oil and finance companies to stabilize values.

The difference, according to the Treasury, is the passive nature of these manipulations compared to Vietnam’s active suppression. Apparently, the active vs. passive nature creates a distinction that the Treasury is unwilling to countenance.

Decentralized Answer

Though the news of US scrutiny is not surprising, the relative hypocrisy could be. With nearly every national bank in the world manipulating its currency through some means, Vietnam’s tiny economy is an odd choice to single out.

The entire issue draws attention to the need for greater levels of economic decentralization. While such market manipulations can, and have, produced some level of stability in various places, they also produce economies that are wholly political.

On the contrary, Bitcoin (BTC) and other decentralized cryptocurrencies provide payment methodologies that free the consumer from the constraints of centralized government. By connecting peer-to-peer in a ‘trustless’ environment, Bitcoin allows markets to move independently, without such manipulations.

Do you think Bitcoin is the currency of the future because it promotes financial independence, or is currency manipulation part and parcel with a stable economy? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)

The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Trump’s plans to expand fossil-

fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior’s Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking in as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico’s Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

“So, that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,” he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. “What I hope is, as an organization, we learn from any error we make.”

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee this week, to factor climate change into the department’s decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation’s carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

“The law requires us to analyze those things,” he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. “It doesn’t say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.”

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president’s order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said that the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said he expected to get a briefing on last week’s U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world’s plants and animals are at risk of extinction but added that the Interior and Commerce departments still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

“We didn’t start doing them to not do them,” he said.

As he pursues the administration’s agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on the Interior Department.

“We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,” McCollum said. “Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what’s the bare minimum.”

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

“You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,” he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary’s office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska’s Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

“I’m not somebody who would put somebody else’s stuff up,” Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose’s entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. “His neck meat alone was 135 pounds.”"

Josh Kaul defeated Attorney General Brad Schimel in November as part of a Democratic sweep of all statewide offices.

In his first four months in office, Kaul has fulfilled his campaign promise to withdraw Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act.

He has also switched sides in lawsuits over whether the state Department of Natural Resources can legally impose tighter regulations on factory farms and high-capacity wells, re-aligning with environmental advocacy group Clean Wisconsin.

Republicans say Kaul can't be trusted to defend GOP-passed laws. But Kaul says he's not being ideological, he just views the law differently.

"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

Trump will nominate Patrick Shanahan as secretary of defense,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/9/18517095/patrick-shanahan-defense-secretary-nomination-pentagon-mattis-trump,"The White House says President Donald Trump will nominate Patrick Shanahan, who has spent more than four months as the acting secretary of defense, for the permanent job. It’s likely his reward for being so amenable to President Donald Trump’s policies — from China to Venezuela to the southern border — since taking over the Pentagon’s top position.

“Based upon his outstanding service to the Country and his demonstrated ability to lead, President Trump intends to nominate Patrick M. Shanahan to be the Secretary of Defense,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a Thursday statement. “Acting Secretary Shanahan has proven over the last several months that he is beyond qualified to lead the Department of Defense, and he will continue to do an excellent job.”

Shortly afterward, Shanahan, a former top Boeing executive who spent 30 years at the company, said in a statement that he looks forward to becoming the defense chief, if confirmed by the Senate. “I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe,” he said.

Shanahan has been in the acting role since January 1, when he stepped in to replace outgoing Defense Secretary James Mattis after Mattis dramatically resigned, mainly in response to Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria.

But though he’s been serving as the acting secretary for months, it was never guaranteed that he would get the position full-time. In March, the Pentagon’s inspector general looked into allegations that Shanahan boosted Boeing while acting in his official capacity. However, in late April, the watchdog cleared Shanahan of the potential ethics violation.

There were also concerns among Trump officials that Shanahan couldn’t do the job after a series of lackluster performances during congressional testimonies in which he flubbed important questions about America’s defense policy and wars abroad.

He’s overcome those obstacles, though. And assuming the Senate confirms him, he’ll be set to lead America’s armed forces — as long as he stays in Trump’s good graces.

Shanahan has to stay on Trump’s good side

Sources told me that Shanahan and Trump have a very strong relationship. They have spoken at length in the Oval Office about Pentagon issues, and about their shared view that weapons programs are unnecessarily expensive and cumbersome. It also helps that National Security Adviser John Bolton seems to like Shanahan too, sources note.

By most accounts, Shanahan did a good job as Mattis’s deputy. His main role was to run day-to-day Pentagon operations and try to reform the bureaucracy as much as possible. He also gained Mattis’s trust over time, even though he wasn’t originally the former Marine general’s first choice.

However, Shanahan didn’t spend much time on foreign policy in the Defense Department or in his three-decade career at Boeing, so taking on the top role permanently will be a big change for him.

The reason Trump likes Shanahan, though, may come down to one very simple thing: He’s deferential. During a Cabinet meeting on January 2, for example, Shanahan sat stoically next to Trump as the president slammed Mattis for keeping America’s military involved in conflicts overseas, particularly in Afghanistan.

Shanahan has also reportedly told Pentagon leaders to focus on “China, China, China” — a country the president cares about challenging — which may also keep him in Trump’s good graces.

Mattis, on the other hand, was known to challenge Trump on occasion, and their relationship eventually broke down over Trump’s desire to withdraw troops from Syria.

It’s unclear at this point if Shanahan will push back on anything Trump wants to do."
"Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: 'Rumors' Trump is quashing DOJ, FBI investigations",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-rumors-trump-is-quashing-doj-fbi-investigations,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Friday there are ""rumors"" that President Trump is quashing investigations run by the Justice Department and the FBI.

During an interview on MSNBC, Baker told host Rachel Maddow he decided to speak out because of Trump's bullying tactics.

He said ""it could have a significant negative impact in the long run"" because people are worried about their careers and reputations.

""When the president of the United States starts to go at you on Twitter it's ... unnerving,"" he said. ""If you're concerned about your reputation and your long-term career, you're more likely to be hesitant to do things that will attract that type of ire.""

Maddow asked if he is aware of any investigations that have been impeded because of Trump's behavior, and Baker said he has ""heard rumors to that effect"" but none that he could confirm. He did acknowledge that this dynamic was ""currently"" at work.

""Whether it's true or not, it's something to worry about,"" he said. He noted that ""certain types of investigations, especially as they start to touch the political system or political leaders"" are the ones to worry about.

Baker's interview comes after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report, which details 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice. He declined to say either way whether Trump committed a crime, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

The FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. Baker, who is under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media, has been subject to criticism by Trump for his role in allowing the use of an unverified dossier to obtain the authority to spy on a member of his 2016 campaign, Carter Page.

“Former FBI top lawyer James Baker just admitted involvement in FISA Warrant and further admitted there were IRREGULARITIES in the way the Russia probe was handled,” Trump tweeted in January. “They relied heavily on the unverified Trump ‘Dossier’ paid for by the DNC & Clinton Campaign, & funded through a big Crooked Hillary law firm, represented by her lawyer Michael Sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked Baker hard & gave him Oppo Research for ‘a Russia probe.’ This meeting, now exposed, is the subject of Senate inquiries and much more. An Unconstitutional Hoax.”

Baker said Trump's intimidation tactics against the FBI are ""very dangerous,"" but believes that the career officials at the bureau are highly resilient and are going to ""resist"" Trump as much as they can."

Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff issued a subpoena to the Justice Department on Wednesday for the unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, in addition to all of the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information collected during the 22-month investigation.

The subpoena comes after Schiff (D-Calif.) and his Republican counterpart, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, made a rare joint request for the documents. Schiff said the Justice Department had yet to respond to the committee’s request, prompting him to issue a subpoena.

“The department has repeatedly failed to respond, refused to schedule any testimony, and provided no documents responsive to our legitimate and duly authorized oversight activities,” Schiff said in a statement.

“The department repeatedly pays lip service to the importance of a meaningful accommodation process, but it has only responded to our efforts with silence or outright defiance,” Schiff added. “Today, we have no choice but to issue a subpoena to compel their compliance.”

The committee’s subpoena requires the Justice Department to turn over the documents by May 15.

Schiff and Nunes penned joint letters to Barr — one on March 27 and another on April 25 — demanding the full Mueller report and its supporting materials. In the second letter, the lawmakers threatened a subpoena “absent meaningful compliance” by the end of last week.

In his letter to Barr informing the attorney general of the subpoena, Schiff said the Intelligence Committee required the information in order to “discharge its unique constitutional and statutory responsibilities,” including conducting oversight, examining potential national security issues and drawing up legislation to address vulnerabilities.

Schiff said the Justice Department claimed that it was accommodating his and Nunes’ request by allowing the lawmakers — in addition to 10 other senior members of Congress — to view a less-redacted version of the report.

“Neither of these responses amounted to a good faith effort to negotiate an accommodation of the committee’s request,” Schiff wrote, adding that his staff reminded the Justice Department of its “expansive and voluminous” production of documents related to the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s email server.

“These materials were of the precise type the department now claims it is prohibited from giving to the full committee, including classified and law enforcement sensitive information, documents related to third parties, and those pertaining to ongoing investigations,” Schiff wrote.

The committee’s announcement comes the same day the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for defying that panel’s subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report and all of its underlying evidence.

Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over the full report and its underlying materials — at Barr’s urging — in order to prevent the Justice Department from complying with the committee’s subpoena.

Schiff’s and Nunes’ numerous requests for the full Mueller report come despite efforts by Republicans on the Judiciary panel to back the Justice Department’s position that Congress does not have a right to the materials — in particular, the grand-jury information.

"London’s mayor says Trump ‘not in same class’ as Obama and Bush, not worthy of state visit to Britain",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Adam Taylor', 'Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/10/londons-mayor-says-trump-not-same-class-obama-bush-not-worthy-uk-state-visit/,"

London Mayor Sadiq Khan. (Jack Taylor/Getty Images)

Ahead of President Trump’s state visit to Britain on June 3, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says he believes the U.S. leader is not “in the same class” as his predecessors and is not worthy of the honor.

“Of course we should have a close relationship with the president of the United States, but we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet; we shouldn’t have a state banquet,” Khan said Friday, during an interview with LBC, a British talk-radio station.

“History tells us only two presidents have had a state visit,” Khan said. “President Trump is not in the same class as those two.”

Trump visited Britain last July, but that trip was not considered a state visit, even though he did visit the queen at Windsor Castle.

[Trump finally gets his British state visit — but tensions that led to delay remain]

Khan’s comments reflected widespread skepticism about the Trump administration in the British capital ahead of a long-delayed state trip next month. They also raised the possibility that Trump, who has criticized and insulted the mayor of London before, may retaliate, reigniting a war of words that would likely make his visit to the city more contentious.

British Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invite for a state visit to Trump during a visit to Washington in January 2017, just days after the president had taken office. “I am delighted that the president has accepted that invitation,” she told a White House news conference.

The only two state visits to Britain by U.S. presidents in the past were in 2011, when President Barack Obama visited, and in 2003, when President George W. Bush visited. State visits are formal trips to Britain by heads of state from countries overseas, with considerable pomp and circumstance that is not afforded to less formal visits by world leaders.

However, as relations between Trump and May grew difficult, Trump’s state visit to Britain was repeatedly delayed. When Trump finally made a brief visit to London in July 2018 — a working visit, rather than a state visit — he was greeted by protests and a giant blimp that depicted Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper.

Though a state visit was finally announced last month, most indications suggest that Trump remains unpopular in Britain. Polling data from the firm YouGov suggested only 1 in 5 people had a positive view of the U.S. president, while 67 percent had a negative opinion.

A spat between Trump and Khan, London’s mayor since May 2016, may not have helped the U.S. leader’s reputation in the British capital. Even before Trump was elected, Khan, a Labour Party member, had criticized him, telling Time magazine that because he is a Muslim, he would be stopped from going to the United States under Trump’s proposed Muslim travel ban.

Trump later responded by calling Khan “rude” and “ignorant” on “Good Morning Britain.”

After Trump’s inauguration, the president criticized the London mayor’s response to a number of terrorist attacks in the British capital. In November 2017, Trump shared anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist, prompting a rare rebuke from May.

Khan has called for Trump’s state visit invitation to be rescinded. In his interview with LBC this week, he stated that the visit was not necessary. “It’s possible to have a working relationship without the need to have a state banquet and roll out the red carpet,” Khan said.

Though Khan is not invited to the state banquet, he said he agrees with the sentiment of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has said he will refuse to attend the dinner. In a statement released in April, Labour’s Corbyn said that Trump “rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric.”

Khan also told LBC that one issue he had with Trump was the coarse language he used about women, which he felt emboldened others to target women and particularly female politicians.

“The impression is being given that you can get away from it — that you get a get-out-of-jail card. But it’s worse than that,” Khan said, referring to Trump’s comments about women who had accused him of sexual assault. “There’s a boasting and bragging, it’s almost like a green light for others to behave badly.”

Khan said that he hoped that May would raise some of these issues when Trump visits, though not necessarily in “Hugh Grant-type, public scene,” referencing a fictional faceoff between a U.S. president and prime minister during a news conference in the movie “Love Actually.”

“We’re their closest mates, we have a special relationship. That gives us a responsibility to call people out who we otherwise wouldn’t do so,” Khan said. “Your relationship with your best mate is different with your relationship with a mate or an acquaintance. Your standards that you expect from them are higher.”"
