Trump mocks CNN’s Chris Cuomo over viral video: ‘I thought Chris was Fredo also’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brian Flood', 'President Trump', 'Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-cnn-chris-cuomo-fredo,"President Trump ripped CNN’s Chris Cuomo as an ""out-of-control animal"" on Tuesday in response to a viral video in which the “Cuomo Prime Time” host threatened a man who apparently had called him ""Fredo.""

A video of the confrontation, which originally surfaced on the YouTube channel ""That's The Point with Brandon” and was circulated by Daily Wire reporter Ryan Saavedra, begins with the man telling Cuomo, ""I thought that was who you were."" The CNN host clearly didn’t appreciate the comment and the clip quickly became a trending topic on social media.

CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO SEEN IN UNVERIFIED VIDEO CURSING AT MAN WHO APPARENTLY CALLED HIM 'FREDO'

Fredo is a reference to Fredo Corleone, the weak and facile brother in the movie “The Godfather,” who was played by John Cazale.

The CNN host is the younger brother of Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York. The confrontation took place Sunday at a bar on New York's Shelter Island.

“I thought Chris was Fredo also. The truth hurts,” Trump tweeted. “Totally lost it! Low ratings @CNN.”

WARNING: THIS VIDEO CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

""No, punk-ass b----es from the right call me 'Fredo.' My name is Chris Cuomo. I'm an anchor on CNN,"" Cuomo responded. ""'Fredo' was from 'The Godfather.' He was a weak brother and they use that as an Italian slur -- are any of you Italian?... It's a f---ing insult to your people. It's an insult to your f--kin' people. It's like the N-word for us. Is that a cool f---ing thing?""

After the man sarcastically told him, ""You’re a much more reasonable guy in person than you seem to be on television,"" Cuomo reacted, ""If you want to play, we'll f---ing play.""

""If you've got something to say about what I do on television, then say it, but you don't have to call me a f---in' insult,"" Cuomo continued.

""Hey man, listen, I don't want any problems,"" the man, who appears to be holding the camera from below, told Cuomo.

""Well, you're gonna have a big f---in' problem,"" Cuomo shot back.

While the president mocked Cuomo over the confrontation, others have defended him. Fox News’ Sean Hannity tweeted that Cuomo has “zero to apologize for.”

“I say good for @ChrisCuomo,” Hannity wrote. “He’s out with his 9-year-old daughter, and his wife, and this guy is being a jack-ss in front of his family.”

In a statement to Fox News, CNN said it fully supported its primetime anchor.

“Chris Cuomo defended himself when he was verbally attacked with the use of an ethnic slur in an orchestrated setup. We completely support him,” a CNN spokesperson told Fox News.

The president later sent another tweet directed at Cuomo, who recently hosted a CNN town hall on gun control.

“Would Chris Cuomo be given a Red Flag for his recent rant? Filthy language and a total loss of control,” Trump tweeted. “He shouldn’t be allowed to have any weapon. He’s nuts!”

Trump reiterated his thoughts when speaking to reporters later in the day outside Marine One.

“I think what Chris Cuomo did was horrible. His language was horrible, he looked like a total out-of-control animal."" — President Trump

“I think what Chris Cuomo did was horrible. His language was horrible, he looked like a total out-of-control animal. He lost it, and frankly, I don’t think anybody should defend him because he spews lies every night. I don’t know why anybody would defend him,” Trump said. “Chris Cuomo is out of control. I watched it, I thought it was terrible… you’ve never seen me do that.”

Trump then said that the CNN host was “so out of control” that it’s a good thing he wasn’t holding a weapon.

Cuomo acknowledged that he received some support but said he shouldn’t “add to the ugliness” that he opposes.

“Appreciate all the support but - truth is I should be better than the guys baiting me. This happens all the time these days. Often in front of my family. But there is a lesson: no need to add to the ugliness; I should be better than what I oppose,” Cuomo tweeted on Tuesday morning.

Over the years, many people – including CNN personalities – have used the term “Fredo” to mock the president’s sons. Donald Trump Jr. took notice of the viral video and offered his thoughts on the situation.

“Hey @ChrisCuomo, take it from me, “Fredo” isn’t the N word for Italians, it just means you’re the dumb brother,” he wrote.

As of Tuesday morning, the viral video had over 3.4 million views – more than three times the audience that Cuomo typically draws. During the month of July, “Cuomo Prime Time” averaged 954,000 nightly viewers.

Cuomo announced Monday afternoon, hours before the video went viral, that ""Cuomo Prime Time"" was on hiatus this week and would be back on-air Aug. 19.

Ironically, the New York Post unearthed an old video in which Cuomo playfully referred to himself as “Fredo” during a 2010 radio interview.

"Trump just blinked, giving China a possible edge in trade war, Jim Chanos and others say",https://www.cnbc.com,['Kate Rooney'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/13/trump-just-blinked-giving-china-a-possible-edge-in-trade-war-jim-chanos-others-say.html,"In backing off on China tariffs Tuesday, President Donald Trump showed just how much pain the U.S. could tolerate — and China may use that to its advantage, key voices on Wall Street say.

Markets rallied on the announcement by the U.S. Trade Representative office that certain items were being removed from the new tariff list, while duties on others would be delayed until mid-December.

The short-seller Jim Chanos, who tweets under the alter ego ""Diogenes,"" hinted that Chinese President Xi Jinping may take this as a sign that the U.S. may cave with enough pressure.

""So then tell me why Xi should not continue to wait out The World's Greatest Negotiator, who keeps 'dealing' with himself?"" tweeted Chanos, founder and managing Partner of Kynikos Associates.

Some investors took Tuesday's announcement as a sign that despite the White House's claim that China would bear the brunt of tariff impacts, the trade war was indeed hurting consumers. The products in the group exempt from tariffs include cellphones, some apparel, and video games — all of which are crucial to the U.S. consumer market, especially during the holiday shopping season. Trump announced on Aug. 1 that 10% tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had not been slapped with U.S. duties.

Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon that he postponed tariffs for the Christmas season ""in case it had an impact on shopping"" and the delay would ""help a lot of people.""

Hedge fund manager and Hayman Capital Management founder Kyle Bass said based on the tariff de-escalation, ""it does look like President Trump has blinked."" While Trump has been vocal in the tariff fight, Bass said ""every time it makes the stock market go down a few hundred points"" the president ""backs away.""

""It looks like he doesn't want the price of iPhones going up into Christmas,"" Bass said on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley "" Tuesday. ""The Chinese are going to read this as a key weakness.""

China meanwhile, has not publicly backed off. It announced last week that it would not resume buying U.S. agricultural products, despite assurances otherwise by Xi to Trump at the June G-20 summit. It also has retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. goods and set off more worries about the trade war on Friday by letting its currency weaken.

John Rutledge, chief investment officer of global principal investment house Safanad, said the trade war is causing pain on both sides. In China, Rutledge said Xi is feeling pressure to show strength in the trade war, while Washington is grappling with mounting political pressure and costs to consumers.

But that can change quickly, Rutledge said, depending on which of Trump's trade advisors have his ear at the moment.

""There's a battle of the bands among advisors — this may be just a tick up as the rational group prevailed,"" Rutledge said, referring to White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whom he calls ""market thinkers"" in opposition to trade hawk and advisor Peter Navarro.

Still, Rutledge said its nearly impossible to predict the White House's next move and investors should take this as ""one day and one data point.""

""We shouldn't extrapolate or draw a trend, since it might get revered,"" Rutledge said.

The president's top priorities — a strong stock market and a tough China trade deal — have been at odds. Uncertainty around the trade war has weighed on financial markets. Stocks saw their worst day of the year on Aug. 5 after China let its currency weaken below 7 yuan to the dollar and made its announcement about U.S. farm products.

""The White House is now delaying the tariffs and removing some items. Did some acronym called the SPX cause someone to blink?,"" David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates, said in a tweet.

China's Commerce Ministry said Vice Premier Liu He had a phone call with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer and Mnuchin. Trade talks are set to continue in two weeks. According to Chinese news outlet CGTN, the call for the world's two largest economies to meet again on trade came from Lighthizer, not China.

So far, the pain felt by the stock market has not been that exaggerated. At its low point for this sell-off, the S&P 500 was down only a little more than 6% from its high.

""These developments are modestly positive, especially compared to the recent torrent of negative news, but we caution against viewing the tariff delay as anything more than an attempt to partially shield the American consumer heading into the holiday season,"" Isaac Boltansky of Compass Point Research wrote in a note to clients. ""We continue to believe that a broad deal will not emerge prior to the 2020 election.""

Trump, himself, accused China last week of trying to wait out the 2020 election for a trade deal."
"Trump campaign's small-dollar donations surge, marking major shift for GOP",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Maxim Lott', 'Alex Baumgart', 'Center For Responsive Politics']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/small-dollar-donations-trump-gop,"The Republican Party has long been panned by its detractors as the party of big money and big donors -- but donation patterns have changed measurably under President Trump, a Fox News analysis of campaign finance data shows.

Sixty-one percent of money raised directly by the Trump campaign this election cycle came from small donors (donations under $200), according to Federal Election Commission figures.

2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TRACKER

That is similar to the proportion Trump raised during the 2016 election cycle, when 65 percent of donations were under $200. And this is dramatically higher than previous Republican nominees. Mitt Romney raised 26 percent of his direct contributions from small donations in 2012, and John McCain raised 25 percent from small donations in 2008.

Campaign finance analysts say the data indicates grassroots enthusiasm for Trump's populist message.

""Democrats have traditionally been the party that has benefited the most from cultivating a small donor base,"" Alex Baumgart, individual contributions researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, which runs the donation database OpenSecrets.com, told Fox News.

""It's pretty clear from the numbers that Trump has done a lot to change that dynamic -- the populist edge he's brought to campaigning is clearly something that is resonating with small donors on the right.""

Conservative activists say Trump has changed the party.

""The Republican Party today is a vastly different party than it was five years ago,"" said Michael Johns, a co-founder of the national Tea Party movement and a former White House speechwriter to President George H.W. Bush.

Johns said Trump's focus on trade and other policies reflects that shift.

'The populist edge he's brought to campaigning is clearly something that is resonating with small donors on the right.' — Alex Baumgart, Center for Responsive Politics

""The American people are demanding a secure border, demanding an end to the exploitative and unfair trade policies... and demanding an end to an unresponsive swamp culture,"" Johns said, asserting that first the Tea Party, and then Trump, expanded the base to ""today's blue-collar and working Americans.""

NEW YORKERS MOCK DE BLASIO IN IOWA

Political scientists say that income data indicates a shift toward middle-income supporters, as well.

""Historically, there has been a very strong, positive correlation with income and Republican voting over the past several decades, but that went away in 2016,"" Anthony Fowler, a professor of public policy at the University of Chicago who studies campaign finance, told Fox News.

Democratic presidential candidates also improved their grassroots fundraising compared with previous cycles. Among the 20 Democrats who made the debate stage this year, 51 percent of individual contributions were from small donors. That's up from 26 percent for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and 43 percent for then-President Barack Obama in 2012.

Those figures vary significantly from candidate to candidate, however, with Sen. Cory Booker getting just 21 percent from small donors, former Vice President Joe Biden getting 38 percent and Sen. Kamala Harris getting 41 percent. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has 49 percent from small donors, with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 61 percent, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 67 percent, and Sen. Bernie Sanders at 77 percent (the most).

In last place is New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who got 9 percent of his individual contributions from small donors.

Fowler said studies show getting money from big donors is not necessarily bad.

""If there are any concerns that politicians behave differently because they're getting donations from rich people, corporate interests, etc., we haven't found much evidence in support of those concerns,"" he said.

The above numbers tell the story of donations made directly to the campaigns, but some contributions are more complicated -- like money raised through ""political action committees,"" or PACs. President Trump, for instance, works with two PACs -- the ""Trump Make America Great Again Committee"" and ""Trump Victory."" Money raised through those groups is then split between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, which promotes Trump independently.

The Trump PACs get 47 percent of their contributions from small donations.

With Trump PACs included, small donations given for Trump total $115,697,683 for the 2020 election cycle, and large donations total $117,457,166.

""While Trump has collected lots of small checks, he's also still pulling in the major checks and big contributions,"" Baumgart said.

""What really sets Trump apart from other Republicans in the past is the fundraising machine that he has created,"" he added. ""He's a natural campaigner who has been actively running for reelection since his inauguration. Consequently, the campaign has been able to capitalize on this by fundraising off the back of the numerous political battles that have taken place since then.""

Trump's unprecedented decision to fundraise ever since the last election makes it less likely he'll be outspent as the election goes forward; in 2016, Trump was outspent nearly 2-to-1.

Since the time that Democratic candidates started fundraising in 2019, all Democrats combined have pulled in more donations than Trump ($209 million compared with $106 million that Trump secured in 2019).

But because of his early start, $233 million has gone to Trump and his PACs for 2020, more than all Democratic rivals combined.

Michael Johns says he hopes the shift in where donations are coming from signals the Republican Party is becoming ""the party of working people.""

""We need to call greater attention to how liberal Democrats have mismanaged our largest cities and let down urban voters. ... We do this well and we can start to see a complete revolutionary shift, including solidifying the Republican Party as the party of working people.""

Bernie Sanders should know better than this ridiculous attack on The Washington Post,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/bernie-sanders-washington-post-amazon-jeff-bezos/index.html,"(CNN) Bernie Sanders is running a presidential campaign rooted in the belief that the country can be better than President Donald Trump -- and that he is the person who can bring about that change for the better.

Which makes what Sanders did on Monday in New Hampshire all the more disappointing.

Sanders, speaking at a town hall, started in on his now-familiar riff on how Amazon pays no taxes. And then he said this

""See, I talk about that all of the time. And then I wonder why The Washington Post — which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon — doesn't write particularly good articles about me. I don't know why. But I guess maybe there's a connection.""

Well, no, there isn't. And what Sanders is doing there is absolutely no different than what Trump does -- both in his attacks on the media generally and his specific hits on The Washington Post.

Don't believe me? Tell me what's different between what Sanders said, and this 2017 tweet from Trump : ""It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion, even if should be positive, is bad!""

The sentiments expressed in both those comments are the same: Because Bezos, a billionaire and founder of Amazon, also owns the Post, the newspaper is hopelessly biased against anyone who has negative things to say about Amazon. What Sanders said and what Trump has long maintained is that there is a corporate cabal out to get them because they had the temerity to speak out.

""Sen. Sanders is a member of a large club of politicians -- of every ideology -- who complain about their coverage,"" the Post's executive editor, Marty Baron, said in a statement following Sanders' unfounded allegation. ""Contrary to the conspiracy theory the senator seems to favor, Jeff Bezos allows our newsroom to operate with full independence, as our reporters and editors can attest.""

I am one of those reporters Marty mentions. I worked at The Washington Post for a decade prior to coming to CNN in early 2017. For the last three of my years at the Post, Bezos owned the company. Not once in all of that time -- and I wrote multiple pieces a day about politics and politicians (including Sanders and Trump) over that time -- was there ever even a whiff of Bezos' influence in the newsroom.

None. Zero.

What's truly appalling about Sanders' statement Monday is that he knows all of that. He's been in politics for a very long time. He knows that the job of the Post -- and CNN and every other major media organization -- is not to just provide him (or any other candidate running for president) with ""good articles"" about his candidacy. The job of the media is to hold politicians accountable, to fact check the claims they make and to educate the public. Not to make politicians happy.

Sanders even admitted that Tuesday when asked to explain his comments.

""Do I think Jeff Bezos is on the phone, telling the editor of The Washington Post what to do? Absolutely not. It doesn't work that way,"" he said. Then he continued his attack: ""But what I think is in media, in general, there is a framework, New York Times operates under, The Washington Post operates under, CNN operates under, for example, I've been in politics for a few years. You know what? Not one reporter has ever asked me, 'Bernie? What are you going to do about the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality?' ""

Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, added, ""The critique has been building. Senator Sanders has always been frustrated with the role of corporate media and its role in politics. That is not a specific criticism of any one journalist or newsroom but of the culture that can be dismissive of the things the senator believes are important.""

Now. It's important to note that as ridiculous as what Sanders said about the Post on Monday is, it pales in comparison to the damage done by Trump's dishonest and extended attacks against the media over the past four years . One comment by Sanders does not equal the mountain of falsehoods and innuendo pushed by Trump.

But the standard for Democrats shouldn't be some version of ""well, Trump did the same stuff -- and worse!"" There's no debate that Trump's had eroded, if not entirely destroyed, the notion of the presidency as a beacon of moral leadership. But traveling the low road, even occasionally, with Trump isn't a recipe to show the country the necessary change that Democrats believe they represent.

And again: Sanders knows better. (As does Trump, of course.) He said what he said to get a cheap applause line at a town hall packed with supporters. The problem for Sanders, Trump and politics more generally is that many of the people who hear things like this from them don't know better. They actually believe there is some sort of conspiracy between corporate America and the news media. And when politicians -- whether they are Sanders, Trump or anyone else in either party -- stoke that sentiment, that's dangerous. And bad for democracy. Full stop."
DOJ reassigns warden after Epstein's apparent suicide,https://thehill.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457281-doj-reassigns-warden-after-epstein-apparent-suicide,"Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrFrench officials call for investigation of Epstein 'links with France' House Judiciary leaders demand answers from Bureau of Prisons on Epstein death FBI searches Jeffrey Epstein's home in Virgin Islands MORE has ordered the Bureau of Prisons to temporarily reassign the warden at the New York federal prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was found dead over the weekend pending federal investigations into his apparent suicide.

Two staff members assigned to Epstein’s unit at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MMC) in lower Manhattan have also been placed on administrative leave, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Tuesday, noting additional actions may be taken if warranted.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) disclosed the developments Tuesday afternoon, one day after Barr expressed outrage that Epstein was left unsecured and spoke of “serious irregularities"" at the federal prison in New York.

“I was appalled — indeed, the entire department was — and, frankly, angry to learn of the MCC’s failure to adequately secure this prisoner. We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and that demand a thorough investigation,” Barr said during remarks at a law enforcement conference in New Orleans on Monday morning.

“We will get to the bottom of what happened at the MCC and we will hold people accountable for this failure,” Barr said.

Kupec said Tuesday that the MCC warden, whose name is Shirley Skipper-Scott, would be reassigned to the bureau’s Northeast Regional Office while the FBI and Justice Department inspector general investigate the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death.

James Petrucci has been named acting warden of the MCC, the Justice Department added.

“The Bureau of Prisons also placed on administrative leave two MCC staff assigned to Mr. Epstein’s unit pending the outcome of the investigations. Additional actions may be taken as the circumstances warrant,"" Kupec said.

Epstein, a registered sex offender following an earlier conviction in 2008, was found dead of apparent suicide in his cell early Saturday morning. He had been placed on suicide watch back in late July after reportedly being found with marks on his neck.

The developments over the weekend have triggered questions about the circumstances of his death and massive scrutiny of the conditions at the detention facility.

Various reports have described the federal jail as being short-staffed and some have suggested that corrections officers did not follow protocol by regularly checking on Epstein during his detention.

Epstein, a wealthy financier with ties to multiple powerful people, had been held at the detention facility since July 6 when he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges. His death cuts short a high-profile criminal prosecution, though Barr insisted Monday that prosecutors would continue their investigation into the sex trafficking allegations.

“Let me assure you this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,” Barr said. “Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice and they will get it.”

DHS in a ‘Mad Scramble’ to Catch Up With Domestic Terror,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-is-in-a-mad-scramble-to-catch-up-with-domestic-terror,"It wasn’t that long ago that senior Department of Homeland Security officials shied away from focusing on domestic terrorism, often fearing political backlash.

The White House pushed the sprawling department to focus overwhelmingly on immigration enforcement, at the expense of just about everything else. DHS veterans told reporters that white supremacist terror was the FBI’s issue, not theirs. When a DHS analyst warned of far-right violence in 2009, congressional Republicans bellowed in protest, with a lasting chilling effect. Under the Trump administration, the department disbanded a group of intelligence analysts focused on domestic terrorism. Cybersecurity staffers got shipped to the border. In the days after the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, leading DHS minds focused on the migrant caravan. And, as NBC reported, the administration cut funding for DHS grants designed to prevent radicalization.

But as white supremacists have terrorized communities around the country, senior officials at DHS have tried to step up their work against the threat. They fought to get that counter-radicalization money back, for instance. A consensus within the department slowly began to form: DHS exists to fight terrorism—even when those terrorists are American.

Then came the El Paso shooting, which left 22 people dead in the Texas border city. That’s when, in the words of one senior DHS official, “ the dam broke.”

“There were robust conversations before El Paso,” added that official, who spoke anonymously to discuss internal talks. “Acting DHS Sec. Kevin McAleenan has been very clear that this is a top priority for the Department, as Nielsen had also previously stressed. But the conditions are different now. We will ensure the Department is doing everything possible with existing capabilities and resources, and seek more capabilities and resources as needed. And more will be needed.”

Since the shootings in El Paso and Dayton that left 31 people dead, DHS officials are working overtime to find ways to ramp up domestic terrorism prevention efforts, according to four DHS officials familiar with the situation. But it’s not easy, sources said; over the last two years, the department has maximized resources focused on border security, and it’s already strained.

“These two shootings have caused a mad scramble where they are pulling every publication and book off the shelf in an attempt to figure out what they can do to address this problem,” said one former DHS official.

Senior DHS leadership had a call on Saturday night after the El Paso shooting and then again on Sunday afternoon, after a second shooter killed 10 people in Dayton. The violence was spiraling. So McAleenan directed senior officials to start a working group to assess what DHS was doing about domestic terrorism and what more it could do immediately, according two sources familiar with the situation. The department’s advisory council is supposed to speak with McAleenan about domestic terrorism prevention this week, one of those sources said.

It’s too soon to tell if El Paso will be a turning point for DHS. But just taking a serious look at what the department is doing to fight domestic terrorism and what more it can do—that marks a significant moment, especially when many in the White House remained laser-focused on stopping the flow of immigrants.

“People are scrambling,” said a current DHS official.

And they aren’t alone. The Daily Beast reported last week that the National Counterterrorism Center, another 9/11-era counterterror institution, has also quietly amped up its work fighting domestic terror.

DHS, meanwhile, heightened its efforts last week after President Trump condemned white supremacy and domestic terrorism. For more than two years, according to current and former DHS officials, the White House has directed the department to rev up its efforts to deal with the mass flow of migrants into the country.

Now, department officials are looking to elevate the mission to prevent domestic terrorism by leveraging existing resources and surging capabilities from throughout the department, according to another senior DHS official. It’s not dissimilar to the concept the department uses in responding to a natural disaster, the official added. The number of people involved is smaller, but it draws from people all across the department. They’re also putting together an action plan looking at the growing threat from domestic terrorism, according to multiple DHS sources.

“To ensure our communities are safe, we are focusing efforts on enhancing our prevention and preparedness, and creating response assets in communities so they will be better able to mitigate risk and respond to these kinds of events when they do occur,” McAleenan said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “So far we’ve reached thousands of people in communities around the country, educating them about indicators of radicalization or mobilization to violence. Community awareness can play a major role in preventing an attack.”

But significant turnover among senior DHS leadership has complicated its efforts to help state and local law enforcement partners.

“Trying to find someone in charge at DHS overall—it’s been hard lately!” said one senior state law enforcement official who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “Since DHS has been in existence, it’s always been fairly chaotic. But this is probably the longest it’s been with so many people in acting positions.”

The department’s effort to increase its focus on domestic terrorism has left officials in DHS playing catch up. One official said some of the individuals working overtime do not have domestic terrorism experience, as most have spent their careers on international terrorism.

“That’s a bit of a challenge,” said the official.

The challenge hasn’t gone unnoticed.

“This scramble is a direct result of the fact that notwithstanding concerns raised by some in DHS over the past several years, there have been no serious planning efforts by the department to focus on [domestic terrorism],” said John Cohen, former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “That’s due in large part because of the insistence by the White House that the department first and foremost focus on immigration and border security.”

The Daily Beast reported on DHS’ decision to disband a group of domestic terror analysts just days before McAleenan took office. Soon after, the secretary directed a review of all DHS efforts to combat targeted violence and domestic terrorism, including programs funded by federal grants doled out to the department in 2017, a department spokesperson said.

“Given the proof-of-concept nature of these programs, DHS was not prepared until earlier this year to make an assessment of their efficacy,” a spokesperson for the department said, adding that McAleenan directed the department to request more funds for domestic terrorism prevention for fiscal year 2020."
States sue to block EPA's coal power plant emissions rule,https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/lawsuit-coal-rule-epa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A coalition of states and cities will ask a federal court to block the Trump administration's overhaul of emission regulations for coal-fired power plants.

The administration rolled out its Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule earlier this summer, shifting regulatory authority to states while also promoting energy independence and offering hope to the struggling US coal industry.

It replaced one of the Obama administration's hallmark plans to address climate change, the Clean Power Plan. A divided Supreme Court had blocked that rule from taking effect while challenges to its legality played out.

The Trump-led Environmental Protection Agency said the rule would not overstep the legal bounds that Republicans believe Obama's plan crossed. But the EPA itself says the rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than the Obama-era plan it will replace.

Several states pledged to sue over the Trump administration plan. In the lawsuit , 22 states and seven cities will claim the rule ""disregards requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.""

The Justice Department on Tuesday accused House Democrats of shopping for a friendly federal judge in its effort to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify about potential obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.

In a new court filing, the Justice Department dinged the House Judiciary Committee for “attempting to game the system” by seeking to formally link its McGahn suit to a separate effort to access former special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury evidence.

Democrats say the cases are related because they are both connected to an ongoing “impeachment investigation” that could result in an effort to recommend Trump’s ouster. And tying the cases together could help expedite them, they argued.

But the Justice Department said House Democrats undercut their own argument for haste by waiting three months to file a lawsuit against McGahn, who refused to testify after the White House claimed he was “absolutely immune” and directed him to refuse to cooperate with Congress.

“For one thing, the committee’s desire for rapid adjudication rings hollow given that the committee waited until August to file suit over former counsel McGahn’s testimony despite being formally advised of the former counsel’s absolute immunity from compelled congressional testimony on May 20, 2019,” the filing states.

“Thus, any delay is the committee’s doing at this point.”

The Justice Department said the House’s true aim was to put both cases in front of D.C.’s chief federal judge Beryl Howell, who already was considering the grand jury matter, because of the perception that the appointee of former President Barack Obama might rule favorably in their case. It’s an attempt, the department argues, to manipulate longstanding requirements that cases be randomly assigned to judges to prevent judge-shopping.

Underscoring their point, Justice Department lawyers — arguing on McGahn’s behalf — said the demand for McGahn to testify and the request for Mueller’s grand jury evidence are based on “completely different factual and legal issues” and have no basis for being linked.

“[T]he two cases could not be more different,” the attorneys argued.

The Justice Department’s filing came a day after House lawyers argued in a separate filing that two of their court cases should be linked because both “seek key evidence for the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether to recommend articles of impeachment … based on the same underlying obstructive acts by President Trump.”

The Justice Department did not directly address the House’s assertions that it is conducting an impeachment investigation, but the filing referred to the effort as a so-called probe.

Last week, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said his panel was engaged in “formal impeachment proceedings,” a rhetorical escalation that matched what House lawyers had told federal judges in recent court filings. Nadler has also said that if the courts move quickly to address the House’s litigation, his committee could recommend articles of impeachment by the end of the year.

Democrats appear to lack the votes to open an impeachment inquiry in the traditional fashion, driven in part by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s resistance to taking that step. Pelosi is mindful of forcing her most vulnerable caucus members to take a politically difficult vote when impeachment efforts are all but certainly doomed in the Republican-controlled Senate. She has repeatedly argued for continued litigation against and investigation of the president.

Republicans have pointed to her ambivalence as evidence that no formal inquiry has begun.

“Democrats seem to believe, when it comes to holding this president accountable, that the ends justify the means and that they shouldn’t be constrained by House procedure when our democracy is under siege,” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, wrote in a recent op-ed. “In reality, they may do more to harm our democracy than any president ever could.”

In their own filing, Democrats argued that their authority for claiming to be in the midst of an impeachment probe stems from Jefferson’s Manual — a guide to parliamentary procedure employed by the House and Senate. The manual indicates that impeachment proceedings are launched in a variety of ways, not just through a formal vote of the House. One method is via the referral of articles of impeachment to the Judiciary Committee.

As Nadler and other Democrats note, the House referred articles of impeachment to the committee in January, and they say those articles are now officially under consideration for approval or amendment.

Democrats in recent weeks have pointed to a series of House actions they say bolster their position. In early June, the House voted to allow all committee chairs to enforce subpoenas in court — with the approval of House leaders acting on behalf of the entire chamber.

And last month, the House adopted a resolution declaring all Trump-related subpoenas and demands for information — retroactively and into the future — to have the support of the full House. Impeachment inquiry supporters say this is evidence that the House intended, however indirectly, to back impeachment proceedings without a formal vote.

Similarly, Judiciary Committee officials have noted that previous votes to authorize impeachment proceedings have been intended to empower the committee to issue subpoenas and convene depositions in an era when committees had far less authority than they do in the modern era. Now, the committee already has subpoena and deposition authority, they note.

"Colorado, 21 other states sue to stop EPA’s repeal of clean energy effort",https://kdvr.com,['Chuck Hickey'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://kdvr.com/2019/08/13/colorado-21-other-states-sue-to-stop-epas-repeal-of-clean-energy-effort/,"DENVER — Colorado joined 21 other states and local governments, including Boulder, in suing the Trump administration’s attempt to roll back clean air standards and climate rules, the Colorado Attorney General’s Office said Tuesday.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to dismantle the 2015 Clean Power Plan reduces efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and allows the agency to abandon its legal responsibility to regulate air pollutants.

The rule would also stop the progress that Colorado and other states are making toward clean, renewable and affordable electricity generation, Attorney General Phil Weiser said.

“Because Colorado’s economy relies on our natural resources, we are among the first to witness the effects of climate change,” Weiser said in a statement.

“The EPA’s rollback of clean air standards and climate rules and their proposed replacement undermine the rule of law and the work Colorado has already done to advance clean energy solutions and curb harmful emissions.”

“Protecting our land, air, and water is a top priority for the Attorney General’s Office. We owe it to future generations to ensure that climate change is treated as a serious threat and that the rule of law is fairly applied.”

The federal lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington by the 22-state coalition , as well as major cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago."

Centralize and simplify the impeachment narrative. Show how Trump's abuses relate to each other and how they started on the day he took his oath.

A majority of House Democrats now favor an impeachment inquiry. They are responding to the unavoidable evidence of significant wrongdoing by President Donald Trump and his resistance to any oversight or accountability, and they are right. The House has taken important new steps in this direction and should continue with a full impeachment inquiry.

In court filings over the last two weeks, the House Judiciary Committee has acknowledged that it is considering articles of impeachment and needs access to the evidence collected by the special counsel and testimony by former White House counsel Don McGahn to determine “whether to recommend articles of impeachment.”

In a CNN interview Thursday, Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler characterized these filings as ""formal impeachment proceedings."" And they are important steps in the impeachment process. How do we get from here to a full inquiry?

Consolidate and speed impeachment

At a minimum, a single committee should assume responsibility for considering potential grounds for impeachment, consolidating the relevant evidence in a committee report, and — if that committee believes there is evidence that the president has committed high crimes and misdemeanors — reporting an impeachment resolution to the House for an up-or-down vote.

Other committees have been pursuing lines of inquiry that are relevant to potential articles of impeachment against Trump. The House Oversight Committee has held hearings investigating the president’s potential complicity in a multifaceted scheme to evade enforcement of campaign finance law and cover up those offenses. The House Ways and Means Committee invoked a rarely-used but unambiguous statute in its attempt to obtain copies of the president's taxes, which could yield evidence of the president’s violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clauses, and the committee has now been forced into court to compel the Treasury Department to comply with the law.

It's finally time:We are on the path to Trump impeachment and saving what our Founders gave us

Other House committees have begun investigating President Trump’s other potentially impeachable abuses by issuing subpoenas for evidence and testimony regarding his personal financial interests and the extent to which he has used his office to enrich himself and his family. All of these efforts have built a strong foundation for an impeachment inquiry, and all of these committees should continue robust oversight, but it is time for a single body to take charge of the impeachment case.

Americans need simplicity and clarity

There is no procedural requirement that the House explicitly delegate impeachment jurisdiction to a committee, but there are significant advantages to it doing so. The American people deserve an organized process in which it is clear what abuses of power are being investigated and what rationale is being advanced for potentially removing the president from office. The easiest way to get there is for a single committee to assume those responsibilities, either through referrals from other committees or through an explicit grant of jurisdiction from the House or the relevant committee if the inquiry is consolidated within a single subcommittee.

Stop dithering, Democrats:Impeach Donald Trump now or change the channel for good.

Starting a full impeachment inquiry will also allow the House to proceed as expeditiously as possible, and time is of the essence. Although the 17 months that are left in the 116th Congress may seem like a lot of time, President Trump has already delayed congressional efforts to hold him accountable by forcing committees to file legal actions to enforce subpoenas that are facially valid. Committing to an impeachment inquiry requires that there be time for the House to consider an impeachment resolution if a committee approves one. If that resolution were to pass the House, the Senate would then need time to try the case.

A full impeachment inquiry would also allow Congress to explain to the American people how the president’s potentially impeachable courses of conduct relate to each other. By centralizing the discussion, Congress could show that the president’s obstruction of justice, as outlined in former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony and report, ties in with his potentially criminal scheme to defraud campaign finance law and then cover it up while in office; and his receipt of unconstitutional profits, gains or advantages from foreign and domestic governments with direct interests in U.S. policymaking.

It is time for the House to consolidate and explicitly define the impeachment inquiry that is already under way. All of these seemingly disparate threads should be woven together to show the American people the unprecedented and potentially constitutionally repugnant abuses of power and position that this president has engaged in since he first set foot in the Oval Office.

Gutfeld: Trump's feud with Scaramucci shows he's the 'Al Davis of presidents',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-scaramucci-feud-gutfeld-al-davis,"President Trump's feud with Anthony Scaramucci is the latest example of the commander-in-chief's commitment to winning at all costs, according to Greg Gutfeld.

""Donald Trump is like the Al Davis of presidents,"" Gutfeld said Monday on ""The Five,"" referring to the iconic longtime principal owner of the Oakland Raiders. ""He had a singular motto, which was 'Just win, baby' -- he didn't care how. He attracted rough, scary and weird people -- that was the entire Oakland Raiders.""

SCARAMUCCI BREAKS WITH TRUMP, SAYS GOP MAY NEED 'CHANGE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET'

Davis served as head coach-general manager of the Raiders in the 1960s and later was GM and principal owner until his death in 2011.

Of the comparison between Davis and Trump, the ""Greg Gutfeld Show"" host said he saw a similarity between the Raiders' choice of players and the individuals hired by the White House.

""You also get these weird third-stringers,"" he added, naming Scaramucci and former White House aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman -- who, post-termination, attacked Trump in a ""tell-all"" book.

""They get in under the guise of loyalty and then when it doesn't work out, they turn on you... He's like Omarosa.""

Earlier Monday, Scaramucci told CNN the president has a ""nihilistic way to his personality.""

""I think you have to consider a change at the top of the ticket when someone is acting like this,"" he told anchor John Berman.

After the televised remarks, Trump fired back on Twitter, claiming Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House director of communications in 2017, was upset at not being rehired.

""Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn’t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be),"" Trump wrote.

""Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!"""
State Department's overly broad travel warnings undermine US mission,https://thehill.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/457170-state-departments-overly-broad-travel-warnings-undermine-us-mission,"BERBERA, SOMALILAND — To depart Mogadishu’s heavily-armed international airport — Somalia’s “green zone” — is an expensive prospect. Decades of lawlessness and instability in Mogadishu make insurance almost impossible. Few foreigners will pass outside the airport’s heavily fortified walls without armored cars and multiple personal security contractors. Most diplomats in Somalia (including America’s and Europe’s) are either sequestered inside the airport or remain in Kenya.

But Berbera is a different story. The main port in the northern region of Somaliland is thriving. New hotels are opening. Locals and foreigners intermingle on the beach, and both men and women gather on doorsteps and in tea houses in the evening to watch football, gossip, or shop. In Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa, money changers leave bundles of cash unattended as crime is so low. While al-Shabaab repeatedly strikes deep into Mogadishu and Kismayo, there has not been a terrorist attack in Hargeisa in more than a decade. While President Bihi’s government in Somaliland controls approximately 50,000 square miles of territory, President Farmajo in Mogadishu has secured only around 50,000 square feet, equivalent to the grounds of Villa Somalia, Somalia’s heavily-fortified White House.

According to the State Department’s travel warning, there is no difference between the two regions. “Do not travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, kidnapping and piracy,” it warns. It declares violent crime pernicious across regions, and continues to warn about piracy, even though Puntland’s pirates have not captured a single ship in more than two years, and Somaliland’s coast guard has never permitted piracy off its 450-mile coast.

ADVERTISEMENT

Inaccurate and imprecise State Department warnings are not limited to Somalia. The State Department’s Iraq warning neither acknowledges Iraqi Kurdistan’s decades-long security nor the dramatic drop in Baghdad violence. The United States recently got a taste of its own medicine when Uruguay issued a travel warning citing “growing indiscriminate violence, mostly for hate crimes, including racism and discrimination” as a reason to avoid travel to the United States, even as most towns and cities — let alone rural America — remain safer than ever.

Overly broad travel warnings matter. They undercut diplomacy and diminish soft power when America needs it most. They inflate insurance costs and dissuade investment. In effect, the State Department’s embrace of travel warning inaccuracy risks ceding entire countries to Russian, Chinese, Turkish, or Iranian influence as their businessmen sink roots while their American counterparts are absent.

There are other second order effects. Many universities now forbid students to study or research in areas subject to travel warnings. The irony here is that the countries where there are warnings are arguably the areas in which the United States most needs specialists.

They also breed corruption. I watched food shipments arrive in Berbera supervised by the World Food Programme. Because the UN, like the United States, does not differentiate between Somalia and Somaliland, the UN employees receive thousands of dollars of bonuses monthly due to supposed hazardous conditions which, in reality, do not exist. In short, it’s an expensive scam which costs American taxpayers. U.S. diplomats likewise receive similar danger pay and hardship bonuses, undermining the State Department’s already limited budget.

The reasons for such inaccurate warnings are complicated. Part of the problem is no security officer wants to loosen restrictions fearing that they could become a scapegoat in case of any future terrorism. This is why, more than a quarter century after the end of the Lebanese civil war, U.S. diplomatic security parameters remain largely unchanged. The Benghazi tragedy has also led the State Department to double down. Regional Security Officers feel the best way to protect staff is to hold them in gilded prisons, never mind undercutting any effectiveness.

ADVERTISEMENT

Sometimes policy interferes. Since 2015, the State Department has refused to treat Somaliland differently than Somalia so as not to reinforce its separatism. That fiction not only undermines the veracity of all State Department warnings, but also cedes Somaliland to Russia or China.

Indeed, it can be a vicious circle as overly broad warnings become reason to dissuade diplomatic visits necessary to reassess the real situation, and they can even stand in the way of Congressional delegations and oversight.

Make no mistake: It’s essential to keep America’s diplomats and Americans safe, but inaccuracy and the State Department’s penchant for playing games with warnings risks undermining the reception of legitimate warnings and undermines the broader U.S. mission.

Newark hands out bottled water amid growing lead crisis following EPA rebuke,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/newark-bottled-water-epa-crisis-lead-flint-vulnerable-communities-1cdc6e5f8436/,"One of New Jersey’s major cities is offering bottled water to its residents after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) raised glaring concerns over dangerous lead content in the area’s drinking supply.

The growing crisis in Newark comes after years of resident concerns over lead in drinking water, leading many people last fall to start using water filters on their taps. That change hasn’t gone far enough, the federal government says, and now the city is facing water issues reminiscent of other areas, like Flint, Michigan.

Both cities are majority black with many residents living below the poverty line — groups that tend to suffer environmental crises disproportionately.

New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy (D) and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) said Sunday that beginning Monday, bottled water would be available to city residents concerned about water quality.

“Access to safe drinking water is critically important to our administrations and we take health risks associated with lead in drinking water very seriously,” the officials said in a joint statement.

The move comes amid growing controversy over lead in Newark’s drinking water, a problem that stretches back several years. Some of the city’s lead service pipes are around a century old, sparking concern among public health experts. And since at least 2018, inadequate corrosion treatment at the Pequannock water plant has led to high lead levels in some residents’ tap water, breaching 15 parts per billion, the standard set by the EPA.

After downplaying the city’s water issues for over a year, Newark in October 2018 gave away 38,000 water filters to address the problem. But residents say they still have lead in their drinking water. On Friday, the EPA sent a letter to the city and state advising bottled water usage for residents in homes with lead pipes.

“[W]e are unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their heath is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices,” the EPA wrote, after testing water at two residences in Newark.

Under President Donald Trump, the EPA has repeatedly said that water issues are the country’s top environmental problem, above climate change. But Newark’s crisis reflects ongoing contamination trends across the country. And it’s not just lead that’s leaching into the water.

Toxic “forever chemicals” found in non-stick pans and many other everyday items have appeared in water around the country, including in Michigan. And in states like Iowa, agricultural runoff is polluting well water. In both instances, health and environmental advocates have argued the EPA is not doing enough to address the problem.

But the agency indicated it might assert its authority if Newark’s situation does not improve. The EPA said it “is prepared to take appropriate action” to protect public health in the city.

Contact with lead can result in growth development problems, neurological issues, and occasionally fatalities. Lead in public drinking water can be especially problematic given the universal nature of water consumption.

In Flint, a drinking water crisis that began in 2014 affected around 100,000 people after the city switched its water source. Multiple deaths are associated with lead pollution there and residents have repeatedly accused public officials of lying to them about the extent of the issue. Litigation over responsibility for Flint’s tragedy remains ongoing.

EPA data has repeatedly shown that communities of color and low-income areas disproportionately suffer from environmental problems, like air and water issues. And while Newark, like Flint, is heavily black with a high poverty rate, the city has so far worked to avoid comparing the two situations, even as Newark’s public health crisis grows.

Mayor Baraka has previously called on Trump to help Newark address its water issues. In January, Baraka told the White House the cost would likely be around $70 million. Prior to that, the city had historically argued that its water was safe to drink, despite concerns.

Now, the city is advising residents to run their taps for five minutes before using the water. Bottled water is only being distributed to certain residents who had previously received filters, although pregnant people and young children are advised to drink bottled water. Baraka has insisted that the bottled water is only a “preliminary precaution.”

But advocates argue the city still isn’t doing enough. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Newark Education Workers Caucus (NEW Caucus) sued city and state officials in 2018, arguing that systemic failures had allowed the lead contamination to occur. Both groups greeted the city’s move towards bottled water for impacted residents but expressed continued concern.

“We are deeply troubled by the City’s announcement [confirming the lead issues],” NRDC’s Senior Director of Health and Food Erik Olson said in a statement, going on to express hope that both NRDC and NEW Caucus “can work cooperatively with the City to address this serious public health crisis.”"
Watchdog report says Trump's State Department hiring freeze impacted safety,https://thehill.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457178-inspector-general-report-says-trumps-state-dept-hiring-freeze,"A 16-month hiring freeze at the State Department hurt both safety and morale within the department, according to a report released Friday by the State Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).

The watchdog found 96 percent of embassies and consulates and 95 percent of domestic offices and bureaus said the hiring freeze ""had a somewhat negative or very negative effect on overall operations.""

A full 100 percent of bureaus and offices responding to a survey told the OIG the freeze, imposed by President Trump Donald John TrumpSecurity analyst calls Trump's language on Hong Kong protests 'inappropriate' Americans' opinions about China hit record low: survey Pentagon watchdog says it is officially reviewing billion 'war cloud' contract MORE in January 2017 and ended in May 2018, hurt employee welfare and morale. Only slightly fewer embassy and consulate respondents — 97 percent — said the same thing.

""Several bureaus charged with protecting security, health, and life safety reported to OIG that the hiring freeze had significant detrimental effects on their operations,” the report said.

For example, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security said it was unable to fully staff its command center, which is responsible for monitoring potential threats against U.S. diplomats and American citizens abroad, during the freeze, according to the report.

""DS said that even staffing the center with the minimum staff needed to operate contributed to employee burnout and fatigue and led to coverage gaps that could have significantly affected its ability to respond to overseas security crises,"" the report states.

The survey results found the hiring freeze also hurt State Department operations domestically, with the Bureau of Medical Services telling the OIG that due to staffing shortages it was less prepared to provide services for children of overseas employees with special needs or process medical clearances for staffs, and was also hindered in mental health operations such as determining suitability for law enforcement officers authorized to carry weapons."
"Four men sentenced for child pornography, DOJ says they used bitcoin and Tor to cover their tracks",https://www.cnbc.com,['Kate Fazzini'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/doj-sentences-four-for-child-porn-used-bitcoin-tor-to-cover-tracks.html,"Four men from across the U.S. and Canada were sentenced to decades in prison for running what the Justice Department called a ""highly sophisticated"" encrypted underground network for trading child pornography.

The Justice Department said the four convicted men ran a ""global child exploitation enterprise"" called ""The Giftbox Exchange"" on the open-source Tor Network, which uses an overlay network for directing internet traffic, obfuscating the details, locations and identities of those using it.

The website was paid for through bitcoin transactions, and the men ""used other advanced technological means to thwart law enforcement efforts, including file encryption and cryptography.""

Patrick D. Falte, 29, of Franklin, Tennessee, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, three counts of advertising child pornography, and three counts of distributing child pornography. Benjamin A. Faulkner, 28, of Ontario, Canada, was sentenced to 35 years in prison; Andrew R. Leslie, 24, of Middleburg, Florida, was sentenced to 30 years in prison; and Brett A. Bedusek, 35, of Cudahy, Wisconsin, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, for their roles in the scheme.

Three of the men had already been sentenced for child sex crimes, according to the DOJ.

The case was aided by the Justice Department's Project Safe Childhood, and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation and High Technology Investigative Unit, which have been tasked with investigating crimes against children that involve the use of encrypted communications, anonymizers and other sophisticated technologies.

The FBI has increasingly called on technology companies to help break various encryption methods to help find online criminals, including sex offenders. Christopher Wray highlighted several cases at an FBI cybersecurity conference in July in which he said companies helped the bureau find and rescue abused children through their cooperation.

USDA Data Drops U.S. Corn Market 25¢ Monday,https://www.agriculture.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-drops-us-corn-acreage-to-million,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The U.S. corn market dropped its daily limit low, 25¢, as USDA keeps corn production numbers high vs. previous estimates.

In its August Crop Production/WASDE Reports, the USDA raised the average corn yield and lowered production only slightly.

As a result, the CME Group corn market dropped its daily limit low of 25¢, while soybeans dropped only slightly.

At the close, the Sep. corn futures finished 25¢ lower (the daily limit low) at $3.85 1/4. Dec. corn futures ended 25¢ lower at $3.92 3/4. As a result, Tuesday's daily limit will move from 25¢ to 45¢.



Sep. soybean futures settled 12 1/4¢ lower at $8.66 3/4. November soybean futures finished 12 1/2¢ lower at $8.79 1/4.

Sep. wheat futures ended 27 3/4¢ lower at $4.71 3/4.

December soymeal futures settled $5.10 per short ton lower at $293.40. December soy oil futures closed $0.10 higher at 30.05¢ per pound.

In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.29 higher, the U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 370 points lower.

U.S. 2019/20 Corn Production

On Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn acreage at 90.0 million vs. the average trade estimate of 87.7 million and the USDA’s previous estimate of 91.7 million.

On Monday, corn production totaled 13.9 billion bushels vs. the avg. trade estimate of 13.1 billion bushels and the July estimate of 13.8 billion.

On yield, the USDA pegged this year’s corn yield at 169.5 bushels per acre vs. the avg. trade estimate of 164.7 bushels per acre and the USDA’s July estimate of 166 bushels per acre.

U.S. 2019/20 Soybean Production

In its Monday report, the USDA pegged this year’s U.S. soybean acreage at 76.0 million. That compares to the avg. trade estimate of 80.8 million and the July estimate of 80.0 million.

Also, the USDA pegged soybean production at 3.68 billion bushels vs. the avg. trade estimate of 3.79 billion bushels and the July estimate of 3.84 billion.

Regarding yield, the USDA estimates the U.S. soybean crop averaging 48.5 bushels per acre vs. the avg. trade estimate of 47.5 bushels per acre and the USDA’s July estimate of 48.5.

U.S. 2018/19 Corn, Soybean Ending Stocks

For corn, the USDA pegged U.S. ending stocks at 2.36 billion bushels vs. the avg. trade estimate of 2.38 billion bushels and the July estimate of 2.34 billion.

Farm Service Agency Acreage

In a separate report, the Farm Service Agency released acreage numbers that appear to be market-friendly for corn and soybeans.

For corn, U.S. farmers recorded planted acreage at 85.8 million and soybean acreage at 74.0 million.

Also Monday, the FSA released its prevent planted acreage, as of August 1, 2019.

Corn=11.2 million, as of August 1.

Soybeans= 4.35 million, as of Aug. 1

Wheat = 2.209 million, as of Aug. 1

Trade Response

Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that the USDA report is negative for corn, for sure.

“USDA increased corn yields and threw the market limit down. USDA also cut corn demand for a significant increase in ending stocks. That made for bearish world data as well. The crop is so late that yields will be subject to much further revision and should be taken with a big grain of salt.

Scoville added, “During a visit to Bloomington, IL, on Saturday, I witnessed a crop that had just silked and was in blister stage. If it makes it home, there is a good crop there. But, a disaster is possible too and USDA and everyone else has no clue. Today, the USDA left the soybean yield alone, with a big crop in bean acreage area. I think the bean area might be bigger, there were plenty of beans seen over the weekend but the area data should be good I think not the yield,” Scoville says.

Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that this was a surprisingly bearish report on the surface.

""But, the fact that the official numbers deviate so much from expectations, weekly crop progress reports, and the prevent plant acreage indications leaves traders confused and doubting the long-term validity of today’s numbers. Clearly prices will be volatile for the remainder of the harvest season as future WASDE reports begin to more accurately reflect the reality of the coming harvest,"" Gilbertie says.

Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says the USDA data has been received as disappointing.

“The much anticipated USDA August WASDE crop report turned into disappointment very quickly. All corn numbers were increased from the July report from yields to the world ending stocks. The 3.5 yield increase and sharp increase in 2019-2020 ending stocks sent corn sharply lower to daily trading limit levels lower,” Roose says.

Matt Tranel, Cash Advisor for Commodity Risk Management Group, says that the USDA numbers on corn, in particular, were the ones that have many scratching their heads.

“The average trade estimate for harvested acres was 80.05 million with the bottom end estimate near 76 million and top end at 81.9 million. The USDA had harvested acres printed at 82 million. Quite bearish right there in it's own right. The zinger on top of acres came in the form of the yield number released. Many had thought yield may be close to unchanged today and revised later on in the year. But, yield ended up being released at 169.5, up 3.5 bushels/acre from the July report. Coupled together and accounting for other supply and demand factors, ending stocks stand at 2.181 billion,” Tranel says.

Tranel added, “This report likely places a wet blanket over the market for quite a while and limits top end opportunities. We'll have to see how this crop finishes and the next couple months of reports but harvest just might be the next opportunity for a rally, that's if the acres and yield isn't as high as what the USDA is currently forecasting.”

Cray lands $600 million contract from DOE to build El Capitan exascale supercomputer,https://www.zdnet.com,['Natalie Gagliordi'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/cray-lands-600-million-contract-from-doe-to-build-el-capitan-exascale-supercomputer/,"Supercomputer maker Cray has landed a $600 million contract to build the El Capitan exascale system in partnership with the US Department of Energy (DOE), the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This is the third US exascale win for Cray, which is in the process of being acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $1.3 billion.

Cray is one of the leading players in supercomputing, with its systems powering three of the world's top 10 supercomputers. The company recently announced another Exascale supercomputer contract for more than $600 million for the DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Cray's architecture and interconnect technology are also part of a $500 million, 1 exaFlop supercomputer called Aurora set to arrive in 2021 at Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago.

El Capitan will be the first exascale supercomputer for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and will exclusively serve its efforts to ensure the safety, reliability and security of the nation's nuclear stockpile. The system will include Cray's new Shasta architecture, ClusterStor storage and Slingshot interconnect technology.

Cray said its updated Shasta architecture, which was also unveiled on Tuesday, fuses high performance computing with the modularity and ease-of-use of cloud computing. That so-called fusion is at the core of why HPE has sought to acquire Cray. In a nutshell, HPE wants to offer a future HPC-as-a-Service platform and ramp up its ability to sell supercomputing products to enterprise customers.

""As we enter the exascale era, modern applications are creating the need for applying supercomputing capability to a new class of digital transformation problems. What is the domain of a few national laboratories today is fast becoming a necessity for every enterprise,"" said Cray CEO Peter Ungaro. ""With our new software platform, Cray is delivering a fully featured, extensible software and tools environment that performs like a supercomputer and runs like a cloud. The same Cray technology that powers exascale systems can be delivered in a single, low-cost rack and ready to integrate into any data center environment.""

The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says people in Western Pennsylvania should not worry about air pollution from Shell's cracker plant in Beaver County.See the EPA administrator's comments and the report by Action News Investigates in the video player above.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will visit the cracker plant in Monaca. Aides said he would tout the 5,000 construction jobs and 600 permanent jobs being created at the site.Earlier this year, Action News Investigates found the cracker plant will bring thousands of tons of air pollutants to a region that already has some of the nation's dirtiest air.The plant's permit calls for far higher levels of volatile organic compounds than the Clairton Coke Works, one of the biggest polluters in the region.The cracker will emit more ammonia -- another toxic chemical -- than the coke works and the Edgar Thomson Works steel plant combined.Also, the cracker plant will produce 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 488,000 cars.All that has environmental advocates worried about the health of people living near the plant, as well as downwind as far away as Pittsburgh.But EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said there is no cause for concern.""We are closely monitoring both the permit and the emissions and we're looking at the overall emissions environment of Western Pennsylvania. We want to make sure the air quality overall is positive for everyone who lives in Western Pennsylvania,"" Wheeler said.Wheeler also addressed concerns that the plastic produced at the cracker plant would worsen the growing issue of plastic pollution.""These products are being made here instead of China, India or other countries so you save on the carbon footprint of transporting the finished products from halfway around the world. So this is actually a win for the American public and it's producing the products that we use here in our own backyard,"" Wheeler said."

""Here’s the thing. There are people who voted for him for a variety of reasons,"" she said earlier in the interview. ""And a lot of it had to do with the promises he made, which he has not delivered on because they were false promises.

""And he betrayed a lot of people. He came in saying he was going to help working families. Everyone from farmers to auto workers.""

Trump defended the DHS raids to reporters outside the White House on Friday and called them a ""very good deterrent"" to illegal immigration.

""I want people to know that if they come into the United States illegally, they're getting out. They're going to be brought out. And this serves as a very good deterrent,"" he said.

The operation was carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Wednesday and resulted in the detention of 680 illegal immigrants. Agents targeted a food processing plant in Mississippi and swarmed the facility with federal search warrants in hand.

""The execution of federal search warrants today was simply about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout our great country,"" U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said in a statement.

No injuries were reported and a man believed to be the lone suspect was taken into custody. The shooting was reported around 2:18 p.m. at the Taylor Street entrance to the hospital at 820 S. Damen Ave., authorities said.

Witnesses evacuated from the building said the shooting began outside before the man entered the hospital. He was arrested inside by Veterans Affairs police. Police were seen placing evidence markers along Taylor Street near the entrance to the hospital. The suspected gunman was taken to Chicago Police Department's Area Central headquarters.

Jeff Sallet, special agent in charge of the FBI's Chicago field office, said the man was ""carrying an assault rifle and began firing."" VA police inside took him into custody without firing a shot within 30 seconds, he said.

""We avoided tragedy here in the city of Chicago today,"" Sallet said, thanking officers with VA hospital police. ""As those shots and the call came, they ran to the shots, resulting in a quick mitigation of the threat.""

Lori Lohar, acting director of the VA medical center, said the gunman was not believed to be a veteran.



""The heroic efforts of law enforcement resulted in the individual being taken into custody with no reported injuries or loss of life,"" she said.

Because the hospital is a federal facility, any criminal charges connected to the incident will be filed in federal court by the U.S. Attorney's Office, according to the FBI. The shooters motive was not immediately known.

""We have, obviously, mass acts of violence happening in this country on a regular basis,"" Sallet said. ""Here in the partnership with the Chicago Police Department — state, local and federal — we are working together on a regular basis to negate these threats.""

Deputy Chief Christopher Kennedy of Chicago police said VA officers ""averted what could have been something very tragic.""

Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at the Road to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) Heartland in Overland Park Monday, Mar. 18, 2019. Pompeo answered questions about entrepreneurship, Trump, and Kansas.

It was a half hour before noon Monday when a federal agent showed up at IHOP and showed Rachel Yoakum his badge.

“I honestly thought it was the health department or something,” said Yoakum, the general manager of the newly opened IHOP on 151st Street in Overland Park.

But it turned out the International House of Pancakes would be getting a visit from the nation’s top diplomat and the agent was there for a security sweep.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo soon arrived at the restaurant with his family and a team of agents from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

“You don’t normally see stuff like that in IHOP, so it was like what the heck?” said Yoakum, who recalled six SUV’s pulling up to her store at noon exactly. “Everybody in the whole store, even customers, were like is that who I think it is?” Yoakum said that some customers thought that Pompeo was going to deliver a speech. Instead, he ordered two scrambled eggs, two pancakes, two strips of turkey bacon and a Pepsi.

Pompeo had been spotted getting BBQ at Q39’s Overland Park location the day before.

It’s the former Kansas congressman’s second visit to the state this year. He’ll be there again next month to deliver a speech at Kansas State University as part of the prestigious Landon Lecture Series.

Pompeo’s August visit and upcoming speech have helped reignite speculation about Pompeo’s political future in the wake of Sen. Pat Roberts’ retirement announcement.

Pompeo has repeatedly downplayed his interest in the open Senate seat, but he remains the top choice of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Sources close to Pompeo have stressed that this month’s visit was purely personal.

The reason for the visit to Kansas — and to IHOP — was to celebrate his mother-in-law’s birthday. Yoakum said Pompeo’s mother-in-law was treated to a birthday sundae and song.

The secretary of state posed for photographs with employees, shook the hands of customers and even signed books before departing from the restaurant.

“I just shook his hand and said thank you for your service,” said Zach Fischer, one of the waiters who met Pompeo."
10-year Treasury yield dips back below 1.7% amid global growth worries,https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-lower-amid-trade-war-concerns.html,"U.S. government debt yields were sharply lower on Monday, amid trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and concerns of slowing global economic growth.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 1.63%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at around 2.127%.

The spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields narrowed to about only 5 basis points on Monday, near its lowest level since 2007.

""Persistently low inflation in developed economies should constrain nominal yields, and tariffs are more likely to weigh on prices via demand destruction,"" Michael Reynolds, investment strategy officer at Glenmede Trust Company. ""Overall, these factors are holding back aggregate demand for both consumer spending and business investment, culminating in lower bond yields that reflect diminished growth expectations.""

Market focus is largely attuned to simmering trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

On Friday, President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and called into question the next round of trade talks. It comes after the U.S. president said he would impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 1. China responded by halting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

Last week, the U.S. accused China of being a currency manipulator after Beijing allowed the yuan to dip below the 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade.

On Monday, the People's Bank of China set its daily midpoint for yuan trading — which determines the limits for its onshore movement — at 7.0211 per dollar. That was weaker than Friday's session, but stronger than market expectations.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury is set to auction $42 billion in 13-week bills and $42 billion in 26-week bills."
EPA Won't Approve Warning Labels for Glyphosate,https://www.webmd.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/news/20190812/epa-wont-approve-warning-labels-for-glyphosate,"Aug. 12, 2019 -- Warning labels for the suspected cancer-causing weed killer glyphosate (Roundup) won't be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer says glyphosate is ""probably carcinogenic,"" which has led California to require warning labels on glyphosate products, the Associated Press reported.

However, California hasn't enforced the warning label rule because Roundup maker Monsanto last year obtained a court order blocking the warning labels until the lawsuit is resolved.

The EPA says its research shows the chemical poses no risks to public health and won't approve warning labels for glyphosate products, the AP reported.

The EPA considers labels warning glyphosate to cause cancer to ""constitute a false and misleading statement,"" which is prohibited by federal law, Michael Goodis, director of the agency's registration division in its Office of Pesticide Programs, said in letters to companies explaining the EPA's stance.

Chandra Lord, a representative for Monsanto’s parent company Bayer AG, said the EPA’s announcement “is fully consistent with the science-based conclusions reached by the agency and leading health regulators worldwide for more than four decades.”

“Glyphosate is not carcinogenic,” Lord said.

It's unusual for the EPA to tell a state it can't go beyond the federal requirements, according to Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity.

""It's a little bit sad the EPA is the biggest cheerleader and defender of glyphosate,"" Hartl told the AP. ""It's the Environmental Protection Agency, not the pesticide protection agency.""

Glyphosate-related lawsuits involving about 13,000 plaintiffs are pending against Monsanto. Juries have awarded damages in each of three cases that went to trial in California."
DHS chief regrets 'unfortunate' timing of ICE raid of food processing plants in Mississippi,https://www.usatoday.com,"['David Jackson', 'Published P.M. Et Aug.']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/11/trump-aide-kevin-mcaleenan-unfortunate-timing-ice-raids-mississippi/1981130001/,"CLOSE

CLOSE Dozens of immigrant workers have been released a day after being detained in the largest immigration raid in a decade in the United States. AP

BEDMINSTER, N.J. – President Donald Trump's acting secretary of Homeland Security expressed regret Sunday for the timing of immigration raids that netted 680 workers at food processing plants in Mississippi, an operation that took place after a mass shooting that targeted Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.

""The timing was unfortunate,"" acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said on NBC's ""Meet The Press.""

McAleenan said the long-planned raid received court approval before the operation that led to the arrests of 680 people, the majority of them Hispanic.

""That means those employers are just ignoring the law entirely in what they do,"" McAleenan said. ""That's why a judge gave us a warrant to go after them.""

McAleenan said the administration is aware that Hispanics feel targeted in the wake of the mass shooting Aug. 3 in El Paso that claimed at least 22 lives, days before the raids in Mississippi.

The Department of Homeland Security regards the El Paso shooting as an attack ""on our community"" at the U.S.-Mexican border and is working to address the threat of ""domestic terrorism,"" McAleenan told NBC News.

Asked whether authorities considered delaying the raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, McAleenan said, ""Something like this has been planned for over a year. This is a criminal investigation with 14 federal warrants issued by a judge, and ICE had to follow through on that. It was already planned and in motion.”

Only employees were arrested at the plants – not employers.

Officials said Thursday that 300 people arrested during the raids were released.

""We're in the middle of an ongoing investigation,"" McAleenan said. ""You get a warrant from a federal judge with probable cause. You then go gather evidence at the sites. And then you look at the appropriate charges in concert with the Department of Justice and U.S. attorney to see how you proceed.""

Congressional Democrats said they are looking into events that led up to the raids in Mississippi.

In a letter to Matthew Albence, acting director of ICE, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., lamented that the raids stranded children of the workers who were arrested.

""At a time when this country is grieving due to two domestic terrorist shootings, your agency has instead seemingly deliberately disregarded its own long-standing guidelines and carried out another form of family separation,"" Thompson said.

After the attack in El Paso, another mass shooting that weekend in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people.

""The blatant lack of planning and resulting chaos calls into question the true motivation behind these worksite enforcement operations,"" Thompson said.

Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, defended the operation on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""We still have to apply consequences, meaning enforce the rule of law, for those individuals that are here illegally against immigration law,"" he said.

According to a job listing from Aug. 9, the federal agency is seeking someone with at least one year of specialized experience in developing blockchain infrastructure and conducting research into blockchain technologies, crypto ledgers and crypto contracts.

Focus on identity management and crypto tokens

The Department of Commerce’s listing hints at the future hire’s duties and responsibilities in general terms, revealing only that they will be tasked with research and development into potentially disruptive technologies at the department’s Information Technology Laboratory.

It notes that the candidate’s role will include a focus on the cybersecurity capabilities and requirements necessary for the successful implementation of emerging technologies.

Yet in its outline of the experience required of candidates, the listing indicates that identity management in connection with blockchain will apparently be of particular importance for the role.

Applicants should have experience with:

“National and global identity management programs and identity tokens” and in “standards and national and international standards bodies developing identity management, blockchain and identity token interoperability standards.”

The appointment is for a short-term vacancy — not to exceed one year — at a salary of up to $166,500.

Federal agencies step up blockchain activity

This April, Cointelegraph reported that the U.S. federal government is expected to raise its blockchain spending to $123.5 million by 2022 — an over 1,000% increase as compared with the $10.7 million it spent in 2017.

In June, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration — which forms part of the Department of Commerce — reached out for feedback on blockchain policy, as officials forecast an increasing focus on the technology in coming years.

VA moving to deliver electronic health record modernization,https://www.militarytimes.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Leo Shane Iii']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2019/08/13/va-moving-to-deliver-electronic-health-record-modernization/,"The Trump administration is working to deliver a win for veterans that prior administrations could not: a unified electronic health record (EHR) solution between the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The solution will give doctors instant and seamless access to veterans’ full-service health records and history. The new solution will compile data from service records so it can be accessed years later by doctors at DoD, VA, and in the private sector, providing clinicians with a full picture of veterans’ medical history and driving faster, smarter connections between military service and health outcomes.

VA, DoD tout major progress in effort to join electronic health records systems The departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are eyeing the end of the summer for significant advances in their efforts for a new, joint electronic health record, a move that both bureaucracies have made the long-term centerpiece of medical reforms for their patients.

Republicans, Democrats, and veterans want this change, and we are on the way to realizing this dramatic improvement.

Here is how the Trump administration is working to accomplish this important goal:

First, we created the Office of Electronic Health Record Modernization (OEHRM) to oversee the transition. John H. Windom oversees OEHRM as the office’s executive director.

While at DoD, Windom led a team to acquire, test, integrate and begin deploying a new EHR solution for more than 9.6 million service members and their beneficiaries — the very system to which VA is transitioning.

Second, we made sure we understood the scope of the problem. This ambitious project is not just about synching DoD and VA records. It is about making VA health records compatible with each other — across the different systems where a veteran has received care — something that has never been done.

× Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.

The Trump administration inherited VA’s legacy EHR, the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA), a system that even today uses more than 100 different ways to collect and maintain patient records across the country. No administration has successfully created a single longitudinal health record before, but we intend to deliver this capability for veterans.

A related challenge is making sure we get VA staff up to speed with how to collect, enter and use health data under the new system. Proper education and training take time, and it is a big part of the reason why we are cascading deployment of the new EHR solution over 10 years. Caring for veterans remains our top priority, and VA is committed to supporting clinicians and care providers throughout the transition to maintain high-quality health care for veterans.

Third, we are closely aligned with DoD as it implements the same EHR solution. We work closely with DoD to capture lessons learned from their deployment and make VA’s implementation as smooth as possible.

When transitioning to a new EHR solution, many organizations struggle with change management and training, but VA is learning from DoD’s experience and ensuring it gains as many efficiencies as possible.

Fourth, we are hitting our deadlines. A data center will host all VA data and serve as the backbone of our new health record solution — and we completed it ahead of schedule.

Senators skeptical over long-term VA health records overhaul The $16-billion, 10-year plan is designed to bring VA medical records in line with Defense Department files.

We are on track to start using the new EHR solution at three VA medical centers in Washington state by April of 2020. VA will first deploy its EHR solution at Seattle, American Lake, and Mann-Grandstaff medical centers. These three were chosen as initial operating sites in alignment with DoD’s deployment schedule.

And finally, we are rolling out the new EHR solution at an achievable pace. The contract I signed to implement sweeping EHR reforms ensures uncompromised care to veterans by allowing VA to maintain legacy systems until all VA facilities have transitioned to the new EHR and provide comprehensive, on-site training and support to clinical and administrative staff.

The new EHR solution was a 10-year contract for a reason. It calls for a rolling implementation schedule through 2027, one that will move about a dozen hospitals to the new solution each year starting in 2021, along with dozens of associated VA clinics. We will be looking for and anticipate efficiencies along the way, and look forward to delivering our new solution to our veterans.

That schedule aligns with VA’s broader goal of making sure we avoid any possible risks to patient safety while we undergo this massive modernization effort.

Is there anything about VA’s EHR modernization effort that’s easy? No.

That is why we will continue to resist the pressure to rush the process and stay focused on doing it right. Neither veterans nor taxpayers want to see billions of dollars spent on another failed attempt.

They want a lasting result. That is why we are taking the time to do it right, to finish the job we started, and to fundamentally change how VA delivers veteran-focused, provider-friendly care."

In celebrating this controversial decision, Mr. Mulvaney laid bare the thinly veiled motivations behind uprooting researchers: not efficiency, but to drive talented workers out.

Since the relocation announcement in June, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has defended the controversial proposal, arguing that relocation will bring researchers closer to the subjects of their research and save the agency millions in employment costs and rent. But the haste and amateurishness of the process raised suspicions about true motives. And, now, Mr. Mulvaney has confirmed those suspicions by celebrating the gutting of the Economic Research Service, a federal statistics agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees grant money for agricultural research. The motivation fits with the administration’s broader hostility toward experts, science and honest data.

In June, a Politico analysis found that the Trump administration barred dozens of climate-change-related investigations from being publicized. Politico also discovered that the research service issued news releases on only two studies directly related to climate change — both of which were favorable to the meat industry.

Even if relocation were justifiable, the USDA’s handling of the process has, so far, been deplorable. The more than 500 agency employees affected by the move were given 33 days to decide between their career and the lives they had established in the District. Approximately two-thirds chose resignation over reassignment. The loss of talent and institutional knowledge creates an irreparable tear in the fabric of the agency — and an entirely foreseeable one. If the USDA’s plan was to “drain the swamp,” as Mr. Mulvaney put it, then it certainly is succeeding — if by swamp, as Post columnist Catherine Rampell wrote, they mean civil service expertise. But if the department wants to carry out its true mission of helping rural America, it should rethink this move.

Research by the USDA is vital to farmers. As economic challenges mount with the ongoing trade war with China, and as climate change poses a growing threat to farmlands worldwide, the work by the ERS and NIFA is indispensable. They not only help farmers improve efficiency and productivity but also help smooth access to international markets.

The relocation is not a done deal. The USDA’s watchdog, the Office of Inspector General, published a report this month that challenges the relocation, which is meant to be completed by Sept. 30. By acting without budgetary approval from Congress, the USDA may have violated the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Rather than waiting for a judicial rebuke, the department should cancel the relocation now."
Labor Department sends White House proposal for limited overtime expansion,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/labor-department-sends-white-house-proposal-for-scaling-back-overtime-expansion,"The Labor Department sent a proposed rewrite of the federal regulations covering overtime to the White House Monday for final approval, according to Trump administration officials.

The regulations are expected to expand the number of workers covered by the rule by an estimated 1.2 million, fewer than the 4 million envisioned in an attempt to rewrite the rule by the Obama administration.

""I can confirm the rule has been submitted for review,"" said a senior administration official. A Labor Department official also said it had been sent over to the White House Office of Management and Budget. The proposed draft of the rule will be posted online Tuesday. There is no scheduled date for when the administration will complete its review of the proposal. Liberal groups are expected to challenge the change once it becomes official.

The Fair Labor Standards Act says employees must be paid time-and-a-half once they work more than 40 hours in a week. However, businesses may exempt workers from the requirement if their duties are ""managerial"" in nature and they reach a certain salary threshold.

The Trump administration's proposed revamp would set that salary threshold at those earning up to $35,000 annually, up from the current level of $23,000. The Obama administration attempted to set the threshold at $47,000 in 2014, but its rule change was struck down in federal court before it could go into effect. The matter was unresolved when the Trump administration took office, and it opted to rewrite the overtime rule itself, announcing its version in March.

Former Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta argued during his Senate confirmation that while the rate should be increased, the Obama administration set the threshold too high and created problems for smaller businesses that needed more flexibility.

The Trump administration's move has drawn criticism from labor groups for rolling back the prior administration's changes and praise from the business community for loosening the regulations."
Editorial: An EPA decision reviving Alaska’s Pebble Mine endangers Bristol Bay and a vibrant fishing economy,https://www.latimes.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-09/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-bristol-bay-salmon-trump,"Just five years ago the Environmental Protection Agency determined that a proposal to dig a massive open-pit copper and gold mine near southwest Alaska’s Bristol Bay — one of the world’s most important salmon fisheries — threatened an environmental disaster. So it issued rules to severely curtail the potential project.

What a difference an election makes. Shortly after President Trump’s appointee, Scott Pruitt, took over the EPA in 2017 he met with the chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership, owned by Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals, and then just hours later rescinded the Obama administration directive to protect the sensitive wetland area from mining activities. Pruitt later backed off and sent the action for a fuller regulatory review — and then quit his job under a storm of criticism about ethical lapses.

But the EPA has continued Pruitt’s campaign to loosen environmental restrictions and greenlight controversial projects, and on Tuesday the agency announced that it would not use its veto authority under the Clean Water Act to block the mine. That frees the Army Corps of Engineers to decide whether or not to approve the project. (Interestingly, the Army Corps’ preliminary environmental analysis of the project was criticized as insufficient by a Seattle-based EPA official — the same one who, apparently under pressure from superiors in Washington, D.C., rescinded the Obama-era directive. Yes, it can make your head spin.)

Environmentalists, including Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Joel Reynolds, accuse the EPA of abandoning its own findings and opening the door for the Trump administration to deliver a “gift to a foreign mining corporation at the expense of Bristol Bay’s fish, aquatic resources and community.” We would add that the EPA has also abandoned common sense. Mining is an exceedingly messy endeavor which historically has ravaged landscapes and caused significant environmental degradation — just the kind of thing the EPA is supposed to protect against. The agency’s absurd decision to reverse itself and let the Pebble Mine permitting process proceed must be undone either through an unlikely reconsideration by the EPA, legal challenges, or, best yet, rejecting Trump and his cockamamie and dangerous approaches to economic development in the 2020 election .

What’s at stake in Alaska? The proposal is for an open-pit mine and support operations with a potential footprint as large as Manhattan, and a pit descending nearly three-quarters as deep as the Grand Canyon, according to an EPA analysis (which the developers have disputed). Even if it were only half that size, that is an extraordinary amount of environmental degradation at the mine site itself, which would include massive pits to hold millions of tons of mine waste and other leftovers of the mining process — much of it laden with toxic chemicals.

And the site is near two rivers that empty into Bristol Bay, which means that not only would the project destroy thousands of acres of near-pristine habitat and wetlands at the mining site, but it would also imperil the environmental health of Bristol Bay itself — something the Obama EPA recognized. As have the people of Alaska: 65% approved a measure in 2014 that gives the state Legislature veto power over future projects in the Bristol Bay watershed if it determines that the salmon fishery is at risk , a veto it ought to keep handy should federal regulators allow this mine to proceed.

There’s the friction point. Bristol Bay supports a vibrant, long-running economy based on a sustainable fishery — 14,000 jobs in a $1.5 billion-a-year economy, according to some estimates — as well as tourism and other non-extractive businesses. Allowing the mine to go forward would sacrifice the existing and more environmentally friendly economy for gold and copper extraction that could be disastrous for the environment.

The Trump administration is playing favorites here. Its affection for extractive industries has already put hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in the West in play for invasive mining leases for oil, gas, uranium and just about anything else of value the mining industry can find. And yes, many of these materials are vital to economic development, but the Trump administration has earned the nation’s skepticism over whether, in adopting policies and weighing proposed projects, it can be relied upon to shepherd our natural resources in a balanced, sustainable and sensible manner."
Trump DHS to block more immigrants who rely on government assistance,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-dhs-to-block-more-immigrants-who-rely-on-government-assistance,"The Trump administration in October will enlarge the pool of immigrants who can be barred from entry or denied visa renewals because of their reliance on U.S. government benefits, according to a rule change published in the Federal Register.

The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services formally submitted the update to a 1999 rule on Monday. The rule further expands the definition of a ""public charge,"" a term the government uses to indicate a noncitizen has a history of receiving long-term financial or other assistance.

""Through the public charge rule, President Trump’s administration is reinforcing the ideals of our self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful here in America,"" USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli said during a press conference Monday morning.

Immigrants seeking to enter the United States for the first time as well as those seeking renewal of visas will be judged based on assistance they have accepted from the federal government for at least 12 months in any 36-month period, including cash benefits, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, most forms of Medicaid, and some housing programs, according to the new rule. The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and Medicaid were not previously part of the 20-year-old rule.

Applicants who apply after the Oct. 15 effective date will be judged on whether they used SNAP or Medicaid prior to then. The other listed programs will also factor into the decision because they have been among the criteria for decades.

USCIS officers will not look at whether an applicant was a recipient of emergency medical assistance; disaster relief; the National School Lunch Program; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; Children’s Health Insurance Program; Medicaid, if the person is under 21 years old; energy assistance; and other assistance or related entities.

In 1999 the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service implemented the policy to limit green cards, or permanent residency, to legal immigrants who received cash benefits. However, a person's request for a green card, the step prior to being able to apply for citizenship, was not affected by his or her use of healthcare or SNAP benefits.

The Department of Homeland Security rolled out the proposal in September.

Cuccinelli said the change will be relevant in the review of about 400,000 annual applications."
"DOJ to craft bill to speed up executions for mass shooters, cop killers: AG Barr",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-introduce-bill-speed-executions-mass-shooters-cop/story?id=64926894,"The Department of Justice will craft a new bill aimed at speeding up death penalty proceedings for mass shooters and cop killers, Attorney General William Barr announced Monday.

""There will be a strict timetable for judicial proceedings that will allow the imposition of the death sentence without undue delay,"" Barr said of the legislation during remarks to law enforcement in New Orleans. ""Punishment must be swift.""

Barr said he expects the proposed legislation to be ready by the end of the Labor Day holiday.

President Donald Trump first made note of this directive to the Department of Justice last Monday in his statement on the El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, mass shootings.

""Today, I’m also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty, and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay,"" Trump said a week ago.

Opponents of the death penalty, however, have noted that there's little evidence to suggest that quicker executions would amount to a deterrent in the cases of mass shooters -- who often mount their attacks with plans to take their own life or to be killed by law enforcement at the scene.

The El Paso shooter, for instance, carried out his attack in Texas, where far more prisoners have been put to death by execution than any other state.

The announcement from Barr follows his move last month ordering the Bureau of Prisons to resume federal executions, beginning in December, which is expected to face significant legal hurdles.

Trump has long advocated for expanding use of the death penalty in the U.S. against cop killers and drug traffickers, even as several states have moved in recent years to ban or place a moratorium on executions. A majority of states, however, still allow for the death penalty."
USDA tried to cast doubt on UW-linked study about climate effects on nutrients in rice,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/science/usda-made-behind-the-scenes-effort-to-discredit-uw-assisted-study-looking-at-climate-change-impacts-on-rice/,"U.S. Department of Agriculture officials made a behind-the-scenes effort last year to cast doubt on a study co-authored by two University of Washington researchers about how climate change would affect the nutrients in rice.

The UW scientists were part of an international team that included two federal agricultural scientists. They studied how increased levels of carbon dioxide forecast for the end of the century could diminish the nutritional value of rice, and joined together to co-author a peer-reviewed study accepted by a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In May 2018, weeks before the scheduled publication, findings in the rice study became a source of concern for program leaders of the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS).

“The narrative isn’t supported by the data in the paper,” wrote Sharon Durham, a department public affairs specialist in a May 7, 2018, email to a Jeff Hodson, communications director for the UW School of Public Health.

Durham noted the USDA had decided not to send out a news release to publicize the study. “Please let me know how you will proceed with your own press release.”

A statement Durham released to Politico and later to The Seattle Times said the concerns had nothing to do with the study’s focus on climate change. They came from career scientists, Durham wrote, adding that no political appointees viewed the draft news release before the decision was made not to send it out.

“The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency,” the statement said.

But a veteran researcher with a lead role in the study thinks the politics of climate change in the Trump administration’s USDA factored into what he views as an attempt to discredit the findings.

“It was a very bizarre set of circumstances. I had been at USDA, altogether for 26 years, and nothing like that had ever occurred to me,” Lewis Ziska said.

The Agricultural Research Service where Ziska worked — and recently resigned from — has a long history of high-quality science that stretches back through decades of Democratic and Republican administrations.

But under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the science linking fossil-fuel pollution to rising global temperatures, Ziska said researchers who focus on sensitive topics such as climate change have become more cautious. Some worry their funding may get cut or they could get reassigned if their work comes to the attention of higher-level officials.

“There is basically a miasma of fear,” Ziska said.

Academic freedom

The USDA 2018 criticism of the rice study, first reported by Politico, did spur a response at the UW, which receives grants from the agency. The interim dean of the School of Public Health at that time was Joel Kaufman. He reviewed the study and reached out to the two UW researchers — Kristie Ebi and Adam Drewnowski.

In a May 15, 2018, email to Vice Provost Mary Lidstrom, Kaufman wrote that the methods and results seem straightforward, and the UW researchers involved in the study “stand behind the scientific content…I’m bringing you into the conversation on the possibility that you would be concerned about the potential risk of irritating the USDA or other potential funders. Do you want or need to be involved in considering this issue?”

“For academic freedom aspects, if the authors are supporting the press release, the university will not interfere,” Lidstrom wrote back.

One week later, the UW sent out its news release.

The multiyear study looked at what happens to a range of rice strains when grown under carbon-dioxide concentrations at end-of-the-century levels, which are forecast to be markedly higher due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The study involved eight researchers from the U.S., Japan, Australia and China. In test plots, some rice was grown with the higher levels of carbon dioxide, while control plots received no additional carbon dioxide.

The UW news release noted the study showed how rice grown at the century’s end is expected to have lower levels of four B vitamins as well as less protein, zinc and iron, and it noted that the impacts will have a disproportionate impact on poor countries where rice is a dietary mainstay.

The study had a much rockier path through the USDA bureaucracy.

Initially, Ziska said, the study appeared to be moving smoothly through an internal department review in the early months of 2018.

The paper also completed an independent peer review organized by editors of Science Advances that involved scrutiny from at least two independent experts, according to a statement from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

But in early May, shortly before the scheduled publication, Ziska said, he unexpectedly received a fresh round of questions from within the department’s Agricultural Research Service and he then found that a USDA news release he had helped to prepare about the study had been spiked.

Durham, in a statement to The Seattle Times, said all research service papers follow the same review and clearance process. “This paper was no exception.”

Media interest

Despite the lack of USDA support for the study, promotional efforts by UW and the editors of Science Advances helped stir media interest, with The Washington Post, The New York Times and other outlets in the U.S. and internationally reporting on the findings.

The USDA did make Ziska available for interviews. But after the splash of publicity for the study faded, Ziska, disillusioned, decided the time had come to leave. Now at Columbia University, he will continue his research on the impacts of a warming world on agriculture.

Ebi, his UW colleague, said Ziska’s departure is a significant loss for the department at a time when it’s important to follow through on research to determine what can be done to counteract the impacts of the declining nutritional values of rice on the global poor who depend on this food.

“We need to understand the breadth and depth of these problems, and what the solutions are,” Ebi said. “It is critically important science, and USDA should be involved.”"
Minneapolis housing authority leads county in evictions,http://www.startribune.com,"['Marissa Evans', 'Marissa.Evans Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-housing-authority-leads-county-in-evictions/535664982/,"The Minneapolis Public Housing Authority has gone to court to evict tenants more than 1,500 times in the past five years, making the county’s largest landlord also its biggest user of housing court, according to data compiled by Hennepin County.

The housing authority oversees more than 6,000 units across Minneapolis, providing homes for low-income residents who are often people with disabilities, older adults or people of color.

While emphasizing that it takes action only against a small number of its tenants, the housing authority is rethinking its approach to evictions amid a larger conversation in the city and across Minnesota over the fairness of the process and the long-term damage an eviction filing has for a prospective renter.

Public housing residents pay up to 30% of their income toward rent. But even with lower rent payments, housing authority officials and tenant advocates have found residents often fall behind due to job loss, reduced work hours or a health emergency.

The agency does not dispute the county’s data, but the numbers do not consider how officials work with residents until “practically at the very last minute to make sure that they stay housed,” said Tracey Scott, interim executive director for the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority. “It doesn’t show the whole story about how we do workouts and how we do everything we can to support our residents in keeping their housing.”

Between 2014 and 2018, the agency obtained 462 eviction judgments against tenants and 1,070 that ended with a noneviction judgment, according to a Hennepin County website that tracks these court actions. The county data show the second-largest eviction filer is Huntington Place Apartments, a property in Brooklyn Park that has 834 units.

A noneviction judgment means a landlord may not have shown up for a hearing, the landlord and resident came to an agreement on paying the back rent, or a tenant may have successfully fought off eviction after withholding rent because of maintenance issues.

Tarnishing tenants’ history

Part of the problem with evictions is how long they stay on tenants’ records and how often landlords can use that against them, said Ellen Sahli, president of the Family Housing Fund, an organization focused on housing access and affordability in the Twin Cities.

While state law allows residents to pursue eviction expungements, tenant advocates say that process can be costly and time-consuming for low-income households, forcing them to forgo it altogether. Sahli said that’s why it’s important for landlords and tenants in financial distress to know in advance that assistance exists and agencies are there to make sure that help is readily available.

“Our goal is to eliminate eviction filings, which means we have to have the services and support in place before so that the family gets the kind of help they need to avert the filing completely,” Sahli said.

Luke Grundman, a managing attorney for housing issues at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, said that his public-housing clients are often confused by the housing agency’s letters or unclear about where to go for help. The organization talked to the housing authority about changing the wording of the letters, sending texts and reaching out to emergency contacts to communicate with residents.

“Many times people who are in housing court facing a [Minneapolis Housing Authority] eviction are genuinely surprised,” Grundman said. “They didn’t even realize it was happening. They didn’t realize they were at the stage where they could be homeless in a matter of days.”

The housing authority says residents are given plenty of notice before action is taken. It does not file an eviction against residents until the second month after they’re late and even then always offers a settlement during the court appearance. Residents are sent two letters before an eviction is filed. While residents may reach a settlement with the agency, they’ll also be responsible for paying back the $297 eviction filing fee. The agency allows residents to pay the fee over three months.

Residents’ monthly statements include numbers to call for rent assistance and information about talking to property managers about hardships, said Mary McGovern, a tenant at the Elliot Twins apartments and president of the Minneapolis High Rise Representative Council, which advocates for the 5,000-plus tenants living in the housing authority’s high-rise apartments.

“It’s not like 1, 2, 3 and you’re out the door; they don’t work that way,” McGovern said.

She said tenants “would be lost” without the social workers from Volunteers of America who help residents with family problems, money issues, food assistance, clothing and paying their utilities.

“A lot of people struggle to afford housing and they manage to pay the rent, but we’re talking about incomes that are so low … you have to wonder whether they can even afford that rent,” said Andrew Aurand, vice president of research for the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.

Looking for solutions

The housing authority’s Scott said the agency formed an internal task force on eviction preventions to find solutions. The agency realized that tenants receiving benefits checks were not always getting them at the beginning or end of the month, often causing them to be late on rent.

In addition, the agency worked with the Hennepin County emergency-assistance fund so that tenants could apply for help using their initial notice of late rent instead of having to wait for an eviction notice for their application.

The housing authority also conducted a survey this spring of 150 residents. It found that 75% said they had a late rent payment, with the top reasons including the due date, medical problems, family problems, lack of income and that they forgot. The survey also found that less than half of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they “know where to get help with rent.”

“I think we’re getting better at working through the needs of residents, working with policy issues, working with partners at the county to facilitate residents keeping their housing,” Scott said. “We’re on that path and we’ll continue to refine it as best as we can.”"
State Department foreign service officer resigns in blistering criticism of Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/fso-resigns-washington-post-op-ed/index.html,"(CNN) A foreign service officer resigned from the State Department effective Thursday, writing in a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post that he could no longer serve in ""The Complacent State,"" particularly in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.

Chuck Park wrote in the op-ed that during his almost 10 years in the foreign service he ""worked to spread what (he) believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance.""

""But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home,"" he wrote.

Park said that after the election of President Donald Trump, he had remained ""complacent"" and had ""let career perks silence (his) conscience.""

""I let free housing, the countdown to a pension and the prestige of representing a powerful nation overseas distract me from ideals that once seemed so clear to me. I can't do that anymore,"" Park wrote.

""My son, born in El Paso on the American side of that same Rio Grande where the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter were discovered, in the same city where 22 people were just killed by a gunman whose purported 'manifesto' echoed the inflammatory language of our President, turned 7 this month. I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration. That's why I choose to resign,"" he said.

In an email to CNN, Park clarified that he made the decision to resign before the El Paso shooting, ""though it certainly reaffirmed it.""

Writing in the Post, Park noted that he has not seen an ""organized resistance from within"" to the Trump presidency, but rather ""The Complacent State.""

""Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore,"" he wrote.

""One thing I agree with the conspiracy theorists about: The Deep State, if it did exist, would be wrong,"" he said, noting that foreign service officers pledge to serve at the pleasure of the President -- or else they should quit.

Park told CNN that the reception to the piece has been ""almost uniformly positive"" with ""some mea culpas from personal friends still in the service; some offers of support as I transition to whatever is next.""

Asked why he chose to highlight his resignation in such a public way, Park said, ""I meant the piece more as allocution than a call to action or challenge to people in a similar situation, though most have read it as the latter.""

""Though we are keeping the metaphorical lights on, we are not the heroes that some make us out to be. The real 'resistance' must come from American voters in 2020,"" he said.

Park's cutting public rebuke is the latest by a former diplomat of the sitting President.

John Feeley, the former US ambassador to Panama, retired in March 2018. He wrote in The Washington Post that he made his decision shortly after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, noting ""The President's failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who provoked the violence made me realize that my values were not his values.""

""I resigned because the traditional core values of the United States, as manifested in the President's National Security Strategy and his foreign policies, have been warped and betrayed. I could no longer represent him personally and remain faithful to my beliefs about what makes America truly great,"" Feeley wrote.

Roberta Jacobson, who resigned as US ambassador to Mexico in May 2018, told NPR shortly after that Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policies were ""draconian and frankly un-American.""

She said ""part of the impetus"" for her departure ""was the increasing difficulty I had in trying to defend some of these policies and in trying to work with a Mexican government that was quite keen to work with us, only to see that sort of blown up periodically by tweets or rallies about the wall or about, you know, characterizing Mexicans, which was not what I experienced.""

Jacobson also penned a New York Times op-ed later that year detailing the ""disorder"" of working under the Trump administration and warning of deteriorating trust between Mexico and the US.

James Melville stepped down as US ambassador to Estonia in 2018 because he ""could no longer support President Trump's policies and rhetoric regarding NATO, our European allies and Russia."""
US DOE Dedicates $1.05M to Blockchain Energy Management Platform,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Kollen Post', 'Yuma Akito']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doe-dedicates-105-mil-to-blockchain-energy-management-platform,"The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded a grant worth $1.05 million to organizations working to commercialize a blockchain-based energy transaction platform.

From energy management to energy exchange

The news comes from an August 9 press release shared by energy company ComEd, one of the grant’s four reported recipient organizations. The others are the University of Denver, Virginia Tech and BEM Controls, a company specializing in energy management software.

The new project is reportedly a continuation of BEM Controls’ existing DOE-funded work on software to enhance energy efficiency in buildings. This latest grant is to expand and promote a new blockchain-based energy marketplace, with ComEd to use its Grid of the Future Lab to demonstrate the new system’s functionality.

The new initiative is expected to be in development for three more years.

Blockchain for a new energy grid

According to Dr. Amin Khodaei, chairman of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of Denver:

“The growing proliferation of distributed energy resources calls for advanced management frameworks that support peer-to-peer communications while being fast, scalable and secure [...] Now is the time to develop and demonstrate the technologies that can make a more sustainable and resilient future possible.”

Per the press release, BEM Controls cited security of a broad range of transactions as a primary reason for implementing blockchain in their platforms.

The DOE has shown growing interest in using blockchain in energy grid applications. As previously reported, in January, the department announced $4.8 million in funding for tech research including blockchain for purposes like securing data from fossil power generation sensors.

In April, the DOE announced a partnership with Colorado-based security firm Taekion to deploy blockchain in power-plant security."

In a letter sent to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan and ICE acting Director Mark Morgan on Monday, the lawmakers said the timing of the raids left communities in chaos and argued the agencies left children at risk by failing to provide sufficient warning to school districts.

“This raid, which is the largest ICE raid in our nation’s history, is a continuation of the Trump Administration’s politically driven immigration agenda and efforts to target Latino families. It is also not lost on us that this operation occurred just days after one of the most horrific mass shooting targeting Latinos in America,” they wrote.

The raids took place Wednesday, less than a week after a gunman killed 22 people in a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, that officials said targeted the Hispanic community. McAleenan said Sunday the timing was ""unfortunate,"" but added, ""This is a criminal investigation with 14 federal warrants issue by a judge. ICE had to follow through with it.

The group noted they voiced concerns over the administration’s announcement last month it planned to move forward with immigration raids, adding they believe they can lead to “inhumane family separations” and anxieties for both migrants and U.S. citizens.

“ICE raids of this scale are not conducted for the purpose of immigration enforcement; instead, their purpose is to instill fear in Latino and immigrant communities at a time when Latinos are already living in terror. These workplace raids decimate communities and target law-abiding immigrants who are just trying to earn an honest living,” they continued.

“Indeed the law enforcement effectiveness of mass-raid events like these have long been questioned. Instead of targeting undocumented workers with long-standing ties to communities, the Department of Homeland Security should use its resources to target nefarious and serious national security and public safety threats.""

The lawmakers are asking the agencies to provide information on the costs and source of funding for the raids and the preceding investigation; whether the funding from the recently passed DHS supplemental appropriation bill is expected to be used toward “any ICE worksite enforcement investigation and operation (including the one in Mississippi) planned for or ongoing as of July 1, 2019;” and the personal information of individuals taken into custody on Aug. 7.

Other questions include descriptions of any ICE requests “for assistance or support for at-large enforcement operations” from state and local law enforcement or additional agencies for the raid in Mississippi and what plans have been made to house detainees and whether there is a process in place to verify the conditions of temporary facilities.

The lawmakers are calling for the information to be provided by Aug. 30."
EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"The Trump administration has reauthorized the use of controversial traps dubbed “cyanide bombs” to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals across the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it would allow, on an interim basis, the use of M-44 devices, which trap wildlife with bait before spraying sodium cyanide into their mouths, according to CBS News.

The spring-loaded devices, which have killed more than wild animals since they were first introduced in the 1960s, have been blasted as inhumane.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“While the EPA added some restrictions, these deadly devices have caused too much harm to remain in use. We need a permanent nationwide ban to protect people, pets and imperiled wildlife from this poison,” she said.

The EPA has updated its rules to include some restrictions on the use of the devices, including banning their placement within 100 feet of a public road or pathway, increased from 50 feet. Warning signs also must be placed within 15 feet of each device, decreased from 25 feet.

A final decision on the use of the M-44s is expected to come down after 2021.

In 2017, a child was temporarily blinded and three pet dogs killed in two incidents involving the use of M-44s in Idaho and Wyoming, the BBC reported.

Canyon Mansfield’s family successfully sued the US government for $150,000 last year. One of the devices had been placed near their property in Pocatello, Idaho, and his dog triggered the device, The Guardian reported.

The EPA allows use of the devices by Wildlife Services, the animal-killing program of the US Department of Agriculture — and also authorizes their use by state agencies in South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Texas.

Last year, Wildlife Services got rid of over 1.5 million native animals — from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers, according to The Guardian. About 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s.

At the end of last year, the EPA proposed the renewed use of sodium cyanide, allowing time for public comment until March, CBS News reported.

More than 99.9 percent of the comments urged the agency to ban M-44s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity and Western Environmental Law Center.

“The overwhelming majority of comments from the general public, including the more than 20,000 letters from the write-in campaign, did not support the continued registration of sodium cyanide predacide uses (M-44 devices),” the EPA wrote in its proposal."
DC lawyer's trial to serve as test for Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement work,https://www.cnn.com,"['Katelyn Polantz', 'Erica Orden']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/politics/greg-craig-trial-justice-department-foreign-lobbying/index.html,"(CNN) One of Washington's most well-known and accomplished lawyers, the former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, goes to trial Monday in Washington in a case likely to be seen as a litmus test for the Justice Department's efforts regarding foreign lobbying.

Craig is accused of concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine after he left the Obama administration and joined the Skadden firm as a partner. According to his charges, he cut a deal in 2012 to earn $4 million from a Ukrainian client for the law firm by producing a supposedly independent report on the jailing of a political rival of the then-Ukraine president.

Craig had been caught up in the expansive federal probe of Ukrainian influence in American politics tracked by special counsel Robert Mueller and now led by the Justice Department's National Security Division and US Attorney's Office in DC.

The trial will discuss the influence efforts by Mueller defendants Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, both former Trump campaign leadership, who allegedly had tapped Craig to help with pushing a slanted report on Ukrainian politics among American media, according to court records.

The trial will also be, in many ways, a defining moment for the Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement efforts.

In March, the department said it would boost its pursuit of foreign influence operations, in part by appointing a prosecutor who worked on special counsel Mueller's team to lead a revamped unit intended to crack down on unregistered foreign agents.

In making the announcement, the department's national security division head, John Demers, specifically cited a settlement involving Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, over the work at issue in Craig's trial as spurring the department's interest in enforcement regarding foreign lobbying under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, also known as FARA.

The overhauled unit at Justice now has 11 prosecutors, an increase from years prior. The Craig trial -- with its high profile witnesses and recognizable defendant -- poses a test of the Justice Department's stepped up efforts.

""Disregard for truth undermines our political discourse and it infects our policymaking. If the people don't have the facts, democracy can't work,"" US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson , who is overseeing the Craig trial and presided over the Manafort case in Washington, said about these types of alleged lobbying violations at Manafort's sentencing.

Major trials regarding foreign lobbying violations have been few since the law was enacted in the 1930s.

This year alone, there have been two foreign lobbying cases stemming from Mueller's work: the Craig case and another recent trial in Virginia, where Bijan Kian, a former lobbying partner of Michael Flynn's, was convicted for working as a foreign agent of Turkey . A judge is still considering whether prosecutors presented enough evidence at Kian's trial for the conviction to stand.

""Every law firm and lobbyist who does this stuff has woken up,"" said Andrew Herman, a defense lawyer who counsels clients on foreign lobbying registration. ""Nobody would wish what's happening to Craig on anyone. I think he will be the poster child regardless of the result.""

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the potential impact the Craig trial will have for FARA enforcement.

While coordinating with Manafort's operation, Craig also allegedly reached out to American reporters to shape news coverage of the report -- and, through it all, hadn't disclosed to the Justice Department he was working for Ukrainians, according to prosecutors. Federal law requires those who work on public relations or lobbying efforts in the US to register with the Justice Department under FARA.

Manafort and Gates both admitted to working illegally on the report on behalf of Ukrainian politicians as part of their guilty pleas in the Mueller investigation last year.

In some ways, the Craig case has already imposed significant hurdles for the Justice Department, having bounced between numerous prosecutors' offices before being charged, CNN has reported. After the investigation of Craig was opened by Mueller in 2017, the special counsel's office referred the case to the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, which devoted significant resources to the investigation.

But that office, despite its aggressive reputation, declined to bring charges, determining that they didn't have sufficient evidence. In January of this year, the case was transferred yet again, this time to US Attorney's office for the District of Columbia.

But by the time Craig was finally charged in April by the DC office, the statute of limitations for the initial matter for which he was investigated -- failure to register as a foreign agent -- had expired.

Craig was charged at the time with two crimes: making false statements and concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine. He pleaded not guilty.

But in recent weeks, the Justice Department faced another setback: the judge threw out the charge over making false statements.

If found guilty of the remaining charge, Craig faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. It is unlikely he would have a sentence so steep, however. Craig was released on a personal recognizance bond following his arraignment in April.

Craig is the highest-profile Democrat to be indicted in connection to Mueller's work. He's so well connected in Washington that the list of people who may be mentioned or who may testify at his trial, according to court records, reads like a who's who list of power and influence inside the Beltway.

Aside from the obvious names of Mueller defendants like Manafort and Gates, jurors will be asked if they've known former congressmen like Jim Slattery, journalists like David Sanger of the New York Times, longtime Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills, lobbyist and political analyst Doug Schoen, prominent white collar lawyers like Brendan Sullivan or the Atlanta judge Clinton Deveaux. The list even includes two Kennedy family members: Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Ted Kennedy; and Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics and nephew of the former President. It's unclear if they would be mentioned or testify, either by presenting evidence or speaking about Craig's character as part of his defense.

Gates is expected to testify as a witness for the prosecution, though what he will say on the stand, especially about his interactions with Manafort, will be limited, prosecutors told the court.

Soon after the Mueller investigation began, defense lawyers in Washington realized how Mueller was spooking lawyers and lobbyists engaged in foreign work, and began pitching their advice on foreign lobbying registration to clients."
USDA releases August report showing production missing projections,https://www.kcrg.com,['Kristin Kasper'],,,,https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/538483372.html,"Between trade talks and unpredictable weather, it's been a challenging season for farmers this year. And now, there is data to prove it.

Monday morning, the USDA released its' monthly crop prediction and estimation report. The numbers say corn, soybean, and cotton production fell significantly compared to early summer projections.

One reason, USDA Crops Branch Chief Lance Honig says, is the unseasonably wet Spring, which kept farmers from utilizing nearly 5 million acres of land, overall.

""Obviously a lot of rain this year delayed plantings. We see some of that every year. Really the big difference this year is how wide spread it is,"" said Honig. ""It'll be a tough year but farmers are pretty resilient and they will bounce back and look forward to next season.""

The next report will be released on September 12th.
