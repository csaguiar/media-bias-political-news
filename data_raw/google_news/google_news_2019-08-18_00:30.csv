"Workers had 3 options: Attend Trump's speech, use paid time off or receive no pay",https://www.cnn.com,"['Sarah Westwood', 'Yon Pomrenze']",08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/17/politics/workers-trump-speech-attend-pto-no-pay/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Workers at the Pennsylvania petrochemical plant where President Donald Trump spoke Tuesday were told that if they didn't attend the event, they either had to use paid time off or receive no pay for the day.

At least some of the workers who attended the speech were instructed not to protest the President, who told the crowd of workers at the Royal Dutch Shell plant he would be imploring their union leaders to support his reelection.

The instructions to the workers came in a memo, a copy of which was obtained by CNN's Polo Sandoval from a congressional source. That source was given the memo by a person in Beaver County, Pennsylvania -- the site of the plant.

""Your attendance is not mandatory. This will be considered an excused absence. However, those who are NOT in attendance will not receive overtime pay on Friday,"" read part of the memo.

Shell spokesman Curtis Smith confirmed workers were told they would also miss out on some overtime pay if they skipped the event. Shell said it did not write the memo.

California woman who slapped Trump supporter during 2017 rally convicted of battery,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Bradford Betz', 'Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/sacramento-woman-who-slapped-trump-supporter-during-2017-rally-convicted-of-battery-prosecutors,"A California woman accused of slapping a Trump supporter during a Make America Great Again rally in Orange County more than two years ago has been convicted, prosecutors said.

Jessica Aguilar, 23, of Sacramento, was found guilty Wednesday of one misdemeanor count of battery for slapping a man twice across the face during the March 25, 2017 rally at Bolsa Chica State Beach.

According to The Orange County District Attorney’s Office, Aguilar was sentenced to 20 days in jail, 10 days of community service, and three years of probation. Prosecutors said Aguilar’s jail sentence will be “vacated” if she completes community service.

“The Orange County District Attorney’s Office does not condone random acts of violence,” Orange District Attorney Todd Spitzer said. “With political dissension on the rise across the country, it is important to remember that right to protest is afforded to everyone; no one has the right to commit an act of violence against someone because they don’t agree with their views. If someone chooses to commit violence, they will be prosecuted.”

"Trump has one playbook, and very few plays left in it",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dan Balz', 'Chief Correspondent Covering National Politics', 'The Presidency', 'August At Pm']",08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-has-one-playbook-and-very-few-plays-left-in-it/2019/08/17/b2ad7738-c062-11e9-b873-63ace636af08_story.html,"After a week in which the threat of recession rocked global financial markets, his trade war with China showed no signs of progress and the government of Israel got into a nasty dispute with two members of Congress, President Trump went to bed Thursday night with other weighty issues on his mind.

“Great news,” he tweeted. “Tonight we broke the all-time attendance record previously held by Elton John at #SNHUArena [Southern New Hampshire University] in Manchester!”

This is the frivolous mind-set of the president of the United States. Trump’s statements over the past few days have brought into focus once again something fundamental about him: He has little understanding of what it means to govern. He would rather tweet from the bleachers.

The 800-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average at the middle of last week and an inverted yield curve (an arcane but much-watched economic indicator) underscored why there is broad and growing concern about the direction of the economy.

Germany saw its economy contract in the past quarter and other nations’ economies appear to be slowing. The U.S. economy has been growing, and the stock market managed to regain some of the ground lost by week’s end. But given what is happening globally, how long this extended period of growth can last is a major issue for American families — and a consequential issue for Trump’s political future.

[9 key countries are on the verge of recession, driving fears the U.S. could follow]

The president’s trade war with China has contributed to the problems now facing the global economy. Yet the president accepts no responsibility — for his policies, his statements or his tweets, all of which have added to the uncertainty. He has a mixed message: Everything is great, and what isn’t great is somebody else’s fault.

Trump was reduced again last week to doing what he always does when there is trouble brewing. He attacked others. He hurled more insults at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, a Trump appointee who has become the president’s favored whipping boy. He blamed Powell for raising interest rates too high and now for not lowering them quickly or enough. “The Fed is holding us back,” he said in one tweet, which inexplicably ended with, “We will win!”

The Fed wasn’t the only institution in Trump’s sights as talk of economic problems intensified. He lashed out at another favored target: the media. “The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my reelection,” he tweeted.

Does anyone not believe that his principal focus these days is reelection?

Under pressure, Trump backed off his threat to impose a major new round of tariffs on China on Sept. 1, moving the deadline back to Dec. 15. Analysts had warned that the new tariffs, which would hit a broad range of consumer goods, could have had a negative impact on the holiday shopping season in the United States.

The president offered an upside-down explanation. “The American consumer is fine with or without the September date, but much good will come from the short deferral to December,” he tweeted. “It actually helps China more than us, but will be reciprocated.”

The president showed the sophistication of his thinking on another China issue, the huge pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong that have rattled the Chinese leadership. “It’s a very tricky situation,” he explained to reporters. “I think it will work out and I hope it works out, for liberty. I hope it works out for everybody, including China.”

The president offered no support for the demonstrators who have been massing for weeks in protest. Nor did he warn China against taking action to put down the protests. Unlike past presidents, he declined to stand for American values or the importance of human rights. He appears unwilling to criticize the Chinese government for fear that it would jeopardize resolving the trade war. For Trump, human rights can wait.

But the president was willing to offer Chinese President Xi Jinping some advice about Hong Kong. Calling Xi “a great leader” and “a good man in a ‘tough business,’ ” he recommended: “If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem,” he wrote. “I have no doubt!”

[Hong Kong’s protest movement faces its defining moment]

In another part of the world, Trump decided to stand with the government of Israel against two members of Congress, pressuring the Israelis to block an official visit to their country by Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).

Trump tweeted that a decision by Israel to allow Tlaib and Omar to enter the country would be showing “great weakness,” adding, “They hate Israel and all Jewish people and there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. . . . They are a disgrace!”

The two first-term congresswomen, who happen to be Muslim, have been highly critical of Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians. They support the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.

But the Israeli government’s decision drew sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a tweet that he disagreed “100%” with the views of Tlaib and Omar but added, “Denying them entry into #Israel is a mistake.”

(The Israeli government later said Tlaib could enter briefly on humanitarian grounds to see her elderly grandmother, who lives in the West Bank. But the government said she would have to sign a pledge not to promote a boycott of Israel. Tlaib declined the offer under those conditions.)

[Siding with Trump could hurt Israel’s long-term relations with the U.S.]

The president has tried to portray Tlaib, Omar and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) as the face of a radical Democratic Party and targeted them with a racist tweet urging them to “go back” to where they came from, even though three were born in the United States and all are citizens.

Meanwhile, the president is talking about trying to buy Greenland, a story first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Really.

The president’s supporters still love him, as his rally in New Hampshire on Thursday again showed. The president put on quite a show, a rambling discourse that lasted more than an hour and a half and revisited old lines and familiar themes (sometimes more than once).

Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sent out a series of rapturous tweets about it, comparing Trump with former presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. “These are masterful performances,” he wrote in one tweet. “No one in America can excite a crowd like @realDonaldTrump. . . . This is a unique and potent political weapon.”

Meanwhile, a new Fox News poll of the 2020 campaign showed Trump losing to every Democrat tested. More telling was that the incumbent president did not break 40 percent against any of them. Polls are polls, and the election is more than a year away, but those numbers should concern the president’s advisers.

Trump is following the same limited playbook that got him elected. Whether those tactics have the same potency they once did is the question that will determine his and the country’s future. Meanwhile, serious problems are in front of him, and he is struggling to find the answers."

Although an appeal of the lawsuit against Led Zeppelin is still ongoing, the Justice Department filed an amicus this week in support of previous judge’s ruling that stated that the copyrights of musical compositions prior to 1972 were only protected as sheet music; in 1972, Congress changed the law to protect sound recordings, NBC News reports.

“Taurus,” the Spirit song that Led Zeppelin allegedly infringed on for “Stairway to Heaven,” was written in 1967, making it applicable to the previous federal law.

The Justice Department added that despite the similarities between the two tracks, under the previous federal law, the contested passages must be nearly identical; since they are not, the Justice Department argued Led Zeppelin rightly prevailed in the previous trial under the pre-1972 copyright law.

“There should be no serious dispute that the passages of Stairway to Heaven and Taurus that are at issue here are not virtually identical. At a minimum, the notes and rhythm are not all, or even mostly, the same,” the government wrote in the amicus.

Despite the Department of Justice’s stance, in response to an appeal by the Wolfe estate, the three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals still ordered a new trial Friday, continuing the five-year legal battle. The appeals court found that the previous judge erred during jury instructions as well as refusing to allow the Wolfe estate’s legal team to play “Taurus” during Jimmy Plant’s testimony, Variety reports.

“Without a selection and arrangement instruction, the jury instructions severely undermined [the Wolfe trustee’s] argument for extrinsic similarity, which is exactly what the jury found lacking,” Circuit Judge Richard A. Paez wrote in his appeals decision Friday. The case will go before an appeals court in September."
"Some jail staffers not cooperating with DOJ investigation into Epstein suicide, source says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Vandana Rambaran', 'Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News', 'Politics At Foxnews.Com. She Can Be Found On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/prison-personnel-refuse-to-cooperate-with-doj-investigators-digging-into-epstein-suicide,"Personnel at the New York City prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide last week have not been initially cooperative with investigators from the Department of Justice, a federal source told Fox News Friday.

Attorney General William Barr sent two senior DOJ officials to personally visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center and speak with staff from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in order to gather information on Epstein's death after Barr said officials uncovered ""serious irregularities"" at the jail, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The officials have been on site since Thursday and the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are investigating conditions at the MCC.

NEW YORK MEDICAL EXAMINER: JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE BY HANGING

BOP officials from various regional offices have also been sent to the Manhattan facility to lend their expertise and insight. In addition, a separate BOP ""After Action Team"" went to MCC earlier this week in an effort to examine what happened the night Epstein died. The use of the ""After Action Team"" is part of BOP protocol whenever a ""significant event takes place at a prison.

Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Earlier Friday, New York City's medical examiner officially ruled the 66-year-old's death a suicide by hanging.

Fox News has also learned that 20 of 21 prison staff posts were filled between the hours of 4 p.m. and 12 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 9, the day before Epstein was found. Of those prison workers, six of them were working voluntary overtime. Between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, 18 of 19 staff posts were filled. Of those 18 staffers, 10 were working overtime and all but one of those were doing so voluntarily.

Conspiracy theories swirled following Epstein's death, as many wondered how the wealthy financier could have been able to kill himself in a high-security facility just over two weeks after being placed on suicide watch, though officials later confirmed Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.

Correctional officers did not check in with Epstein for ""several hours"" before his death, despite being required to visit him every 30 minutes, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News earlier this week.

Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein's death are also suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, The Associated Press reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.

Two staffers have been placed on administrative leave and the MCC's warden has been reassigned pending an investigation.

Late Friday, Epstein's attorneys issued a statement decrying what they described as ""the harsh, even medieval conditions at the MCC.""

""It is indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols,"" Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said. ""The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos - if they exist as they should - of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his death.

""We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner,"" the statement concluded. "" We will have a more complete response in the coming days

India and Pakistan have already fought two wars over the Himalayan territory, which both countries claim, and which is mostly divided between them. India recently revoked the constitutionally guaranteed autonomy of the part of Kashmir it controls and put nearly seven million people there under virtual house arrest. Pakistan’s prime minister compared India’s leaders to Nazis and warned that they’ll target Pakistan next. It seems like there’s potential for humanitarian and geopolitical horror.

Khan’s answer was not comforting. “We are two big countries with very large militaries with nuclear capability and a history of conflict,” he said. “So I would not like to burden your imagination on that one, but obviously if things get worse, then things get worse.”

All over the world, things are getting worse. China appears to be weighing a Tiananmen Square-like crackdown in Hong Kong. After I spoke to Khan, hostilities between India and Pakistan ratcheted up further; on Thursday, fighting across the border in Kashmir left three Pakistani soldiers dead. (Pakistan also claimed that five Indian soldiers were killed, but India denied it.) Turkey is threatening to invade Northeast Syria to go after America’s Kurdish allies there, and it’s not clear if an American agreement meant to prevent such an incursion will hold.

North Korea’s nuclear program and ballistic missile testing continue apace. The prospect of a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine is more remote than it’s been in decades. Tensions between America and Iran keep escalating. Relations between Japan and South Korea have broken down. A Pentagon report warns that ISIS is “re-surging” in Syria. The U.K. could see food shortages if the country’s Trumpish prime minister, Boris Johnson, follows through on his promise to crash out of the European Union without an agreement in place for the aftermath. Oh, and the globe may be lurching towards recession."

Lawmakers demand VA fix emergency claims after report shows vets wrongly paid $53 million,https://thehill.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/457792-lawmakers-demand-va-fix-emergency-claims-after-report-shows-vets-wrongly-paid,"Lawmakers are demanding answers in the wake of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) watchdog report report that found $53 million in veterans' medical claims were wrongly denied over just a six-month period.

The bipartisan group of 35 lawmakers wrote VA Secretary Robert Wilkie Robert Leon WilkieLawmakers demand VA fix emergency claims after report shows vets wrongly paid million VA to allow religious symbols at facilities Overnight Health Care: Court allows Trump abortion referral ban to take effect | GOP group launches M blitz against 'Medicare for All' | Star GOP lawyer raises constitutional concerns with surprise billing legislation MORE this week calling the VA inspector general's report ""damning"" and asking him to reconsider claims that should have been paid to veterans.

The inspector general report released last week showed that thousands of emergency care claims were denied between April 1 and Sept. 30 of 2017. An estimated 17,400 veterans were stuck paying medical bills totaling $53.3 million.

The watchdog report suggested one reason for the millions in rejected claims was due to the VA prioritizing speed over accuracy and offering incentives including overtime pay for claims processed quickly. The report found approximately 31 percent of denied or rejected claims were not properly processed.

“Facing a medical emergency can be stressful for any patient; however, the financial toll on veterans when VA erroneously denies or rejects payment can also be devastating,” the lawmakers' letter reads. “Nonpayment can bankrupt and destroy veterans’ credit histories. These administrative errors can remain with veterans for the rest of their lives.”

A spokesperson for the VA said in a statement that the agency ""appreciates the lawmakers’ concerns and will respond to them directly.""

""VA appreciates the inspector general’s oversight, which in this case highlights claims processed up to more than two years ago,"" the spokesperson continued.

""Prior to the report’s release, VA had self-identified the majority of the IG’s concerns, starting numerous efforts to fix them more than a year ago,"" the statement said.

""VA is reviewing the sample claims related to other health insurance highlighted in the report and will notify affected Veterans regarding their options for corrective payments and/or financial reporting revisions.""

The recent findings followed a 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that detailed similar issues involving the VA.

In their letter this week, lawmakers questioned why past issues raised by the GAO had not been addressed.

“This is not new territory for the VA,” the lawmakers wrote. “More than five years ago, GAO found that VA’s weak oversight of emergency care claims adjudication could lead to inappropriate denial of claims. It is disappointing the department has not done enough to improve.”

UN meeting on Kashmir ended without consensus,https://www.youtube.com,[],,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AFt1sxq27s,"Published on Aug 17, 2019

For the first time in nearly 50 years, the United Nations Security Council has held an emergency closed-door session on the crisis in Kashmir.

Council members met for 90 minutes amid heightened tensions in the contested Himalayan region, which has long been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan. The two countries both claim Kashmir in full but rule it in part and have fought two of their three wars over the disputed territory. India is also fighting a30-year rebellion in Jammu and Kashmir that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.

Pakistan requested the Security Council meeting in a letter on August 13 and it was subsequently called for by permanent member China.



The 15-nation body heard briefings from Oscar Fernandez-Taranco, the UN's assistant secretary-general for peacebuilding support, and Carlos Humberto Loitey, the UN military adviser for peacekeeping operations.

But the short consultations brought little respite, with the council failing to even agree on a joint statement.

"State Department officials berated staff, labeled some 'traitors,' report says",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/politics/state-department-officials-watchdog-report-political-retaliation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Top officials in the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs subjected employees to ""disrespectful and hostile treatment,"" accusations of disloyalty, and retaliation, a long-awaited report from the department's watchdog agency found. The report also said the bureau's leadership ""did not take significant action"" to address these concerns.

""Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff,"" according to the report released Thursday by the State Department Office of Inspector General.

The bureau's leaders labeled some employees ""traitors,"" if they felt they didn't support President Donald Trump. They berated others for following procedures, punished staff for not doing work the department's Office of the Legal Adviser had deemed ""inappropriate"" and targeted others for retaliation, in one case because of a staffer's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community.""

'Six to eight hostile interactions per day'

""Although some IO employees reported that they had never witnessed Assistant Secretary Moley or Ms. Stull behave unprofessionally, the majority of employees OIG interviewed either directly experienced hostile treatment or witnessed such treatment directed at others,"" the report said. ""In fact, one IO employee told OIG that working with Ms. Stull involved 'six to eight hostile interactions per day.'""

Stull left the department in January 2019 ; Moley remains in his post. Moley participated in an interview with the OIG, but Stull declined.

The report cited numerous examples of Stull and Moley berating employees for following established department procedures for tasks ranging from sending briefings to booking travel accommodations.

'Inappropriate accusations of disloyalty'

Stull and Moley also ""made inappropriate accusations of disloyalty and made positive or negative comments about employees based on perceived political views,"" according to the report.

""For example, several career employees reported that throughout her tenure at the Department, Ms. Stull referred to them or to other career employees as 'Obama holdovers,' 'traitors,' or 'disloyal,'"" the report said. ""Other career employees told OIG that Ms. Stull accused them of being part of the 'Deep State' and that the Assistant Secretary accused them of 'undermining the President's agenda.'""

In one instance, the report noted, Stull ""expressed displeasure"" with a legislative affairs employee accompanying a delegation of the Congressional Black Caucus ""because it consisted of only Democratic members."" Stull accused the employee ""of trying to 'thwart' President Trump and undermine his agenda"" and many of the employee's job responsibilities were reassigned. That employee eventually left the State Department.

Retaliation

Moley and Stull retaliated against other employees as well, according to the report. Moley removed a principal deputy assistant secretary, a career diplomat, after she raised concerns about Stull's treatment of employees and conflict of interest.

Moley ""told the PDAS that he did not believe that her concerns about Ms. Stull were valid"" and ""it was obvious to him that she had problems working with Ms. Stull and that, therefore, the PDAS should be prepared to leave the bureau,"" according to the report.

In another instance, the OIG found that Moley had canceled the selection process for a deputy director position in order to support Stull's move to block the leading candidate for that post. Stull did not like the candidate's work with the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees -- a point which Moley confirmed to the OIG. Stull also reportedly had a problem with that candidate's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community,"" according to the report.

She criticized two career employees ""whom she believed had been insufficiently supportive of her position"" in a work dispute stemming from her time at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. She also attempted to remove work responsibilities from one of those employees for failing to assist her, despite the fact that what she had asked them to do was deemed ""inappropriate"" by the Office of the Legal Adviser.

Failure to address concerns

Despite concerns raised by both IO employees and State Department management, Moley did little to address them, according to the report. Moley told OIG ""that no employees had 'ever' raised concerns with him regarding morale or treatment of employees.""

However, the report said he had conversations with two undersecretaries in April and on June 13, 2018, and with Deputy Secretary John Sullivan on June 25, 2018 regarding the issues raised about his bureau. In each, he was advised to address the misbehavior.

In the June 13 meeting, he was directed to take several steps -- let all IO employees know about his commitment to inclusion, develop a staffing plan to address two IO departures, ensure that Stull had recused herself from all activities related to her prior work at the UN, and direct her to stop ""all further public engagement"" criticizing State Department employees.

Although Moley took some of these steps, the misconduct continued. The report noted that OIG continued to receive reports about ""hostile treatment of employees, allegations of disloyalty, and conflicts of interest"" throughout the course of its review.

'We won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended'

The watchdog recommended in its report that the State Department ""develop a corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies"" in IO within 60 days. It also noted the department should consider whether to take disciplinary action for the conduct described in the 34-page document. The State Department agreed with both of these recommendations, the report said.

Thursday's report presented the findings of one of two OIG investigations into political retaliation at the department. It was opened in June 2018 after members of Congress expressed concern to the State Department about allegations of Stull's vetting of career employees were reported by Foreign Policy Magazine.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel said Thursday that the report ""confirms what we feared: 'disrespectful and hostile' treatment of career employees at the State Department."" The New York Democrat urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to fire Moley.

""There is more to come, and I hope it comes very soon. The delays from the Department on this matter have been frustrating. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is conducting an independent inquiry on these matters, and we won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended and everyone responsible faces stiff consequences,"" Engel said in a statement."

Hannity first mentioned this during his show Thursday evening while speaking to the Hill's John Solomon, who said DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's soon-to-be-released report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will find ""a lot more wrong than right"" and will be ""difficult"" for former top FBI officials such as James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok.

Hannity said there is some discrepancy between what he and Solomon expect in the watchdog report and the Justice Department inquiry being run by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham, who are examining the behavior of the FBI and Justice Department for possible wrongdoing.

""I want to know who's going to be held responsible. Because If I lie to a court, and I premeditated a fraud on the court, I have a funny feeling there’s not a lawyer in the country that is going to save my sorry ass from being sent to jail. I’m just guessing, but maybe — I’m Irish, I'm pessimistic,"" he said.

""Let me ask you this. So, we both agree on those. You think there might be an IG report alone on leaking?"" Hannity added, to which Solomon agreed.

""And I’m expecting, from what my sources are telling me, Durham, Barr, and everybody else, to get to the origins of what is a counterintelligence investigation, which Andy McCarthy rightly points out in his new book, would mean Obama knew because the president has to sign off on it but that origins of this counterintelligence investigation, what did Obama know, when did he know it?"" Hannity said.

He was referring to former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, who is promoting his new book, Ball of Collusion, and Thursday on Fox & Friends accused Obama of improperly using counterintelligence powers and law enforcement to assist Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

""But more importantly,"" Hannity continued, ""What will Barr, Durham, come out with in terms of — let's say the Barr-Durham report? ... Or whatever that ends up being. Because I hear that is where the single most explosive bit of information, outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering for the sake of circumventing American laws, took place, and a lot of people would be found in violation of spying on Americans against the law.""

Solomon warned that he did not want to get ahead of the Justice Department's findings, but did say that the Barr and Durham review will provide ""a much broader view"" of alleged spy tactics than what the IG report will show because they are not limited to what went on in the Justice Department.

Hannity later noted how there is ""a lot of activity"" in Europe tied to these investigative efforts, including the 16-hour interview conducted with British ex-spy Christopher Steele earlier this summer. He also suggested the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia were roped into the inquiry.

Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause."
Buying Greenland isn't a good idea — it's a great idea,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/buying-greenland-isnt-a-good-idea-its-a-great-idea,"The reaction to President Trump's sudden interest in buying Greenland from Denmark has been mostly one of derision. And Denmark, which owns the territory, appears to oppose any sale.

But don't laugh — an American purchase of Greenland could represent an extraordinary deal in terms of America's national security, economic interests, and environmental protection.

As much as it might seem out of the blue, U.S. acquisition of Greenland is not at all a strange or irrational idea. Following Denmark's fall to Nazi Germany in 1940, American forces defended Greenland. The roots of American-Greenland comradeship are thus old and formal. In 1946, one Harry S. Truman even attempted to purchase Greenland for $100 million. Was Truman crazy? On the contrary, he was the president who ended a global war and set America on its ultimate course to defeat the Soviet Union.

As for the contemporary utility of purchasing Greenland, it has extraordinary strategic value. Through the U.S. Air Force base already present at Thule, Greenland offers critical intelligence capabilities to conduct satellite operations and to detect possible over-the-North-Pole nuclear missile launches from China or Russia. Thule better allows the U.S. to warn its citizens of an imminent attack.

And it does more than that. Thanks to Thule's deep water port and long runway, the base provides a logistics hub for operations in the Arctic. And it gives the U.S. military the means to deter and defeat prospective aggression. Russia, in particular, has been working to secure territorial control over resource-rich areas of the Arctic. America's presence in Greenland is increasingly relevant for that reason.

The purchase of Greenland would further strengthen these existing national security benefits. Unbound from political sensitivities in Denmark, for example, the U.S. could station missile forces in Greenland, including intermediate range missile forces. Russia's Arctic ambitions would have to be put on ice.

Greenland also abounds with resources. An already energy independent U.S. would have unfettered access to a land rich not only in hydrocarbons but also in rare earth metals that are currently only available from an adversary, China. Greenland also controls flourishing fishing waters.

But this isn't just about American interests. Greenland's small population also has everything to gain from a massive influx of American investment. The surge in tourism alone would surely offer a vast untapped potential.

And Greenland offers many grand opportunities for environmental protection. Its waters are home to numerous species of Whale, its lands to numerous species of flower and animals, and its skies to numerous species of birds. Greenland offers the potential for vast new designated wildlife reserves, and it would give American scientists the chance to study the Arctic environment from a unique vantage point.

As odd as it might sound at first blush — and America's purchase of Alaska also seemed very odd at the time — Americans of all political stripes would benefit from Greenland and its 56,000 inhabitants joining our national family."
DOJ should take action against China's Twitter propaganda,https://thehill.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/457772-doj-should-take-action-against-chinas-twitter-propaganda,"Over the last few years, Chinese state media organs have accelerated a campaign to leverage U.S. social media platforms – namely, Twitter – to promote the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) narrative on several issues. All of China’s major state media outlets have Twitter accounts, through which they regularly disseminate a variety of material.Hu Xijin, who heads the state-run Global Times, has become the government’s de facto English-language commentator on trade tensions with the United States.

Beyond this, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai launched an account to share the party line on the recent Hong Kong protests and the Taiwan independence movement. Chinese state media outlets have even targeted a U.S. diplomat for meeting with Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, exposing her personal information and drawing a stern rebuke from the U.S. State Department.

The irony of this trend is not lost on anyone with some familiarity of China’s censorship regime. That China’s state-sponsored propaganda can freely subsist in the virtual echo chambers of Twitter while the platform is blocked entirely on the Chinese mainland is certainly a less than reciprocal arrangement. But beyond this, the circulation of propaganda by certain Chinese state media outlets throughout the United States via Twitter in its current form appears to be in violation of U.S. law.

Last fall, under the tenure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsLewandowski says he's 'happy' to testify before House panel The Hill's Morning Report — Trump and the new Israel-'squad' controversy Nadler subpoenas Lewandowski, former White House official for testimony MORE, the Department of Justice (DOJ) directed Xinhua News Agency and CGTN to register as foreign agents per the provisions of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. Xinhua is China’s major state-run media outlet, while CGTN is China Central Television’s overseas operation (the English-language China Daily has also been registered since 1983). This was indeed a major step toward ensuring that these entities meet the comprehensive disclosure requirements for foreign lobbyists seeking to influence U.S. politics. A critical aspect of their activity that has gone unpunished, however, is their unbridled sharing of CCP narratives on Twitter.

Per the DOJ, Section 4 of FARA “outlines the responsibilities of a registrant who disseminates informational materials on behalf of a foreign principal.” Section 4(b) of the law effectively requires that such entities provide a disclaimer on any informational materials disseminated that includes “a conspicuous statement that the materials are distributed by the agent on behalf of the foreign principal, and that additional information is on file with the Department of Justice.”

While it is unclear whether CGTN and China Daily (Xinhua has yet to register) have been regularly providing the DOJ with copies of each of their tweets (let’s just say it’s unlikely), their tweets currently do not include any obvious indication that they are being transmitted on behalf of the foreign principal, the Chinese government. More broadly, as a matter of policy, Twitter does not even distinguish between such foreign agents, their employees, and the rest of the Twitter user base. To date, the only means of distinguishing one’s account is the coveted “verified” status, which, according to Twitter, is granted to accounts “of public interest.”

Twitter providing foreign agents like CGTN and China Daily with the legitimacy that comes with the verified status without making clear that they are registered foreign agents is negligent, if not irresponsible, and warrants a review of this policy. But regardless, the frequent activity of these accounts on the platform – which most certainly falls under the umbrella of “informational materials for or in the interests of such foreign principal” – deserves the attention of the DOJ.

There is undoubtedly a lack of enforcement in this area, and the specifics of how the provision should be applied can be debated by the relevant authorities and Twitter personnel. Indeed, the attorney general has the statutory authority to “define what constitutes a conspicuous statement,” or disclaimer label. But the need for action is obvious. If our government considers Russian bot posts a threat to election security, and Twitter regularly takes action to combat such disinformation, then why are similar campaigns by Chinese state actors any less concerning?

Say what you will about China’s censorship regime and its ability to control narratives within its own borders. But Twitter is a U.S. company with more than 300 million active monthly users and, for better or worse, serves as the primary mouthpiece of the sitting U.S. president.

As a platform, it carries significant weight in U.S. politics. It thus bears significant responsibility, not only to help foster a secure election environment but also to prevent state-sponsored disinformation campaigns from gaining traction in U.S. political discourse through unfettered, noncompliant distribution of propaganda.

Given that the expressed purpose of FARA itself is to “protect the national defense, internal security, and foreign relations of the United States,” a first step toward this aim would be for the DOJ to require CGTN and China Daily, and eventually Xinhua (and by extension, other foreign agents like Sputnik and RT), to provide the required disclaimers on all media shared via Twitter and work with the company to hammer out the specifics of how this would be implemented.

We do not censor in the United States, and state-sponsored propaganda outlets should still be free to partake in the marketplace of ideas and enjoy the first amendment rights that often do not exist in their home country. But first and foremost, they must comply with existing U.S. law.

Opinion: 'Jawn Wick' and North Philly neighbors' response to the police standoff,https://billypenn.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://billypenn.com/2019/08/17/opinion-jawn-wick-and-north-philly-neighbors-response-to-the-police-standoff/,"What seems like disregard for law enforcement is really a defense mechanism.

In a world where unarmed black men are shot down by law enforcement for simply existing, Maurice Hill’s story has all the makings of a fable.

While Hill was engaged in a standoff with police that injured several officers and resulted in his eventual surrender, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram were awash with memes and skits. The jokes ranged from Grand Theft Auto references to “Jawn Wick” memes depicting Keanu Reeves adorned in a kufi and sporting a full beard — a Philly black male stereotype.

Many of those spread via Philly Scoop Hall, one of the top gossip Instagram pages in the city. Honestly, describing the account that boasts 113k followers as a gossip page would not fully encompass all the content it collects and produces.

The page’s usual fare includes fashion fails, up and coming rappers who’ve amassed a large groundswell, promotions for local businesses, and skits and memes from area comedians.

But often the videos and images on the page take a more serious tone. People go there to see police brutality that hasn’t made its way to the mainstream media or protests supporting criminal justice reform. And in the case of this past Wednesday, the shootout between Hill and Philadelphia police officers near 15th Street and Erie Avenue.

That area is a vibrant and heavily populated black neighborhood in North Philly. An area where folks are often out on the block chatting with friends and neighbors. It was a nobrainer that footage from the hours-long ordeal would end up on Philly Scoop Hall.

The first video appeared around 5 p.m., less than an hour after the initial police response, and the collection continued to grow.

One of the videos published on the page depicted officers being shoved, screamed at, antagonized and physically assaulted. Eventually, Fox29 picked up the video and published a news item describing the event. Instead of offering an analysis of the altercation, Fox29 included a disparaging viral tweet from a self-described MAGA supporter. CBS3 correspondent also Alexandria Hoff tweeted her disappointment at the fact that community members decided to taunt the officers.

Unlike Hoff, when I first saw the controversial video appear on Philly Scoop Hall, I held no feelings of disappointment. More importantly, in no way was I surprised by the reaction of the community members.

I’m from Philly. I grew up less than a mile from the incident in question. My lived experiences and the lived experiences of my peers have helped to inform my understanding of systemic racism and police relations within black communities. It helped to inform my understanding of the community backlash.

Simply put, many of us just don’t trust the cops.

What seems like disregard for law enforcement in that video and the Jawn Wick memes was in fact a coping and defense mechanism. Often our only power in a white-dominated society is our resilience — sometimes that resilience takes the form of comedy.

Black folks in Philly have been victims of unlawful stop and frisk, detainment, and assault at the hands of the PPD. On Wednesday, Hill reversed the tables and put the target we usually carry on the backs of the officers.

I would liken the response of the community members accused of taunting to the disenfranchised citizens of Sherwood Forest and their reception of Robin Hood. Albeit dangerously and unintentionally, in a way that should not be held up as a model to follow, Hill empowered a small group of black folks on Erie Avenue to engage officers in an indirect act of retribution.

In the face of decades of police brutality, what weight does a shoulder bump or a thrown bottle actually carry?

Again, I was not surprised by the actions of this small minority. In black communities, cops often are viewed as an ominous and abusive presence. Maurice Hill, Jawn Wick, or whatever you call him is now and forever a legend in black Philly lore. In an hours-long shootout with police, he managed to come out alive.

Philly folks are known for being a brash and direct bunch who wear our hearts on our sleeves — and this includes black folks as well, not just the Rocky Balboa types.

We too need the space to hold opinions that are not always nested with kindness. Most importantly, we require respect. Respect for how we share and distribute media. Respect for how we react in stressful environments — circumstantial and situational. Above all else, we require respect for our humanity in all its glory and flaws."
E.P.A.

The E.P.A. administrator, Andrew R. Wheeler, said he was withdrawing an interim reauthorization for the use of M-44 devices, which are used to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals that prey on livestock. The agency, he added, would re-evaluate the highly criticized practice.

“This issue warrants further analysis and additional discussions by E.P.A. with the registrants of this predacide,” Mr. Wheeler said in a statement on Thursday. “I look forward to continuing this dialogue to ensure U.S. livestock remain well protected from dangerous predators while simultaneously minimizing off-target impacts on both humans and nonpredatory animals.”

The federal Department of Agriculture, along with its state counterpart agencies in Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, have relied on the M-44s for farming since the mid-1970s."
DOJ files brief with Supreme Court opposing workplace discrimination claims by transgender workers,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Shannon Bream', ""Shannon Bream Currently Serves As Anchor Of Fox News Channel'S"", 'Fnc']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-files-brief-with-supreme-court-opposing-workplace-discrimination-claims-from-transgender-workers,"The Justice Department is signaling its opposition to providing federal protections for transgender employees who claim workplace discrimination.

In a brief filed Friday at the Supreme Court, the Trump administration is opposing the position taken by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which had been supporting a transgender employee in her lawsuit against a Michigan funeral home.

LINDSEY GRAHAM SLAMS DEM COLLEAGUES FOR BRAZEN WARNING TO SUPREME COURT

The justices will hear a pair of arguments Oct. 8 on whether the federal Civil Rights Act’s Title VII laws permit LGBTQ workers to sue for job discrimination. Federal courts have been divided on whether such protections apply, even though Congress did not specially mention that class of individuals when the law was passed more than five decades ago.

The cases involve challenges by gay men in Georgia and New York, and a separate case involving a Detroit-area funeral home that terminated a longtime employee after she began transitioning. Aimee Stephens first took her complaint to the EEOC, which ruled in her favor, as did a federal appeals court in Cincinnati.

The funeral home has argued in part that Congress was not thinking about transgender people when it included sex discrimination in Title VII.

In its filing with the high court on Friday, the Justice Department said the dispute is over the limits of the definition of “sex.”

“A transgender plaintiff therefore cannot prevail in a Title VII suit simply by showing that an employer relied on sex stereotypes,” said the administration.

The plaintiff must show that the employer treated similarly situated members of the opposite sex more favorably.

“Like any other plaintiff, a transgender person may use evidence of sex stereotyping in making that showing,” the DOJ wrote. “But the individual’s transgender status does not alter the legal standard. Here, Harris Homes did not discriminate against Stephens based on sex stereotypes in violation of Title VII. It terminated Stephens for refusing to comply with Harris Homes’ sex-specific dress code.”

Sources told Fox News that the Justice Department had been trying for weeks to get the EEOC to change its official position and support the new brief, but that a majority of commission members had refused.

It sets up an unusual dynamic of potentially having two federal entities opposing one another in court. It was unclear whether the EEOC would clarify its own legal position with the Supreme Court.

The Trump administration’s position is a setback for LGBTQ rights. Officials are also asking for courts to allow enforcement of its ban on transgender people joining the U.S. military to proceed."
Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund U.S.’s $1 trillion deficit — and that is a concern,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Joy Wiltermuth', 'Markets Reporter']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-treasury-is-about-to-flood-the-market-with-debt-to-fund-a-1-trillion-deficit-heres-why-that-is-a-worry-2019-08-15,"There may be some limitations to the U.S. government’s borrowing, after all.

An anticipated surge of U.S. borrowing in the global debt markets in the second half of this year is starting to create concern as the Treasury is expected to ramp up its issuance of bills, notes and bonds to fund a soaring $1 trillion budget deficit.

The U.S. government’s budget gap has widened 27% as compared with the first 10 months of fiscal 2018, as spending has risen 8% and receipts have grown by 3%. The federal fiscal year runs October through September. The Trump administration recently forecast a $1 trillion full-year shortfall, while the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more conservative, putting it at $896 billion.

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Not only does the Treasury needs to borrow to cover the fiscal deficit created by Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the inability of Congress to agree on spending cuts, but Treasury needs to rebuild its cash balance which was run down to pay the governments bills when the debt ceiling was hit in May.

The coming deluge of Treasury issuance has stoked worries on Wall Street about whether there is enough liquidity in the system in the short term to meet the supply without pushing up short-term borrowing costs and inverting the yield curve even further.

U.S. dollar liquidity is deteriorating and “is reaching a point where it may require drastic action if measures aren’t taken to address it soon,” warned Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, in a note on Wednesday.

To illustrate the concern, Saroliya pointed to the higher costs already faced by London-based banks lending to one other overnight in dollars, the popular dollar Libor-OIS spread, which has climbed in anticipation of the Treasury glut hitting markets.

This chart shows the rise of the 3-month dollar Libor-OIS spread since May, even as U.S. Treasury cash balances at the Federal Reserve have dropped from about $400 billion to closer to $150 billion.

Oxford Economics International funding squeeze

As the Treasury restores its cash balance with the coming supply, Saroliya expects liquidity woes to worsen, particularly in a scenario where long-term Treasury notes are yielding less than shorter-dated debt.

“With Treasury issuance set to surge in the wake of the recent debt-ceiling deal, an inverted yield curve could create a significant issuance indigestion in the market,” Saroliya wrote.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury 10-year note’s TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% yield briefly fell below the 2-year note’s TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.00% yield, an inversion of the funding curve that has foretold past economic slowdowns.

Meanwhile fears of an economic recession rattled U.S. stocks Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.20% closing down 800 points, its biggest one-day fall this year, before some recovery on Thursday morning in the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +1.44% .

Amid the stock-market rout, the chances of a half-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point rate cut next month.

Despite the rising Treasury debt issuance, investors globally have been buying U.S. government debt, pushing the 30-year U.S. bond TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.00% to a record low around 2% this week, as yields on many other developed-economy bonds are even lower, with about $15 trillion in debt now offered at negative yields.

Slowing global economic growth due to the U.S.-China trade war is resulting in central banks’ easing monetary policy, and an array of geopolitical risks from Brexit, to Italian political instability, to U.S. sanctions on Iran and violent protests in Hong Kong are encouraging investors into the safe haven of U.S. debt.

But in the short-term money markets, the coming flood of U.S. debt issuance may cause indigestion.

Bond dealers who underwrite the Treasury’s debt sales in the weekly auctions are already holding record amounts of U.S. Treasurys on their books as the fiscal deficit has increased. Now their need to borrow more cash in short-term money markets, using Treasuries as collateral, to buy even more government debt is pushing up short-term rates.

A key risk barometer, the U.S. “repo” market, where cash is borrowed overnight using Treasurys for collateral, has signaled that liquidity is tightening.

Repo rates have climbed recently in relation to what the Federal Reserve pay banks to hold excess reserves. The rate that lenders have charged for cash in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements was 2.22% on Tuesday, compared with the 2.1% that the Federal Reserve pays banks to hold excess reserves, known as the IOER rate.

See at WSJ.com: Rising repo rates fuel concern over mounting U.S. debt

Liquidity may also be tightening in the market for short term borrowing of U.S. dollars internationally, known as the “foreign repo pool” where non-U.S. investors keep cash balances with the Federal Reserve, and the rising costs of currency hedging given the strength of the U.S. dollar may make investing in U.S. Treasury debt less appealing, Saroliya noted.

China and Japan were by far the largest foreign holders of Treasury securities, as of July 16, in the most recent report of holders.

For Saroliya, it all boils down to the Federal Reserve needing to act to preserve liquidity, perhaps by cutting benchmark U.S. rates by another 50 to 100 basis points or through another round of quantitative easing or bond buying.

“And that needs to be immediate!” Saroliya urged.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Cabana also warned that the historically high levels of Treasury securities held by dealers could pose problems when it come to issuing more debt.

This chart shows dealer holdings of Treasury debt rising between January and July, at the same time custody holdings at the New York Fed have declined.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch

“We are concerned that the U.S. banking system is nearing reserve scarcity,” Cabana wrote in a note to clients. Ultimately, he said opening the Treasury “floodgates” would likely “force the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet by year-end.”

To be sure, not everyone sees doom in the U.S. adding to the already $22.4 trillion national debt.

“A lot of Street commentators have highlighted the fact that there is going to be a huge amount of supply in the Treasury market, and how that is going to affect rates,” said Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch.

“When you look at the space though this is a market that most people want to own at some point, especially given the fact that there are $15 trillion of bonds in negative yields,” he said. “It makes the U.S. look really attractive.”"
Exclusive: VA whistleblower-protection worker asks for protection,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/16/va-whistleblower-protection-worker-brandon-coleman-seeks-protection/1891494001/,"CLOSE VA whistleblower Brandon Coleman, hired by VA to do outreach to whistleblowers, has some issues with the office established to protect them. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – All Brandon Coleman wanted was a meeting.

The onetime addiction counselor and Veterans Affairs whistleblower known for exposing poor care of suicidal veterans at the Phoenix VA hospital has been doing outreach to other VA whistleblowers since 2017 on behalf of President Donald Trump’s whistleblower-protection office.

This year, the office got a new leader, VA Assistant Secretary Tamara Bonzanto, so Coleman asked her for a few minutes to brief her on his efforts, including a new mentorship program for other whistleblowers.

""'Absolutely, Brandon, we can work that in,'"" Coleman recalled her telling him during an encounter in March. But the next day, he said a supervisor told him his program was being “put on hold” and he hasn’t heard from Bonzanto since.

Coleman told USA TODAY he has learned from colleagues in recent weeks that he has been excluded from meetings, his program is being eliminated, and he and dozens of other employees at the VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection are being asked to submit resumes and worry they could face possible demotion or worse.

Coleman – one of the highest-profile employees of the whistleblower office – has now requested protection from another federal agency that protects whistleblowers, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. In his request, which he also sent to members of Congress, Coleman described the work environment as ""toxic"" and said the office has turned into a ""Dumpster fire,"" according to a copy of his complaint sent July 31.

In interviews and written complaints reviewed by USA TODAY, three other employees who requested anonymity described Bonzanto as a leader who has cut herself off from employees and issued blanket orders without listening to front-line staff.

""We need help,"" Coleman said. ""How can you treat your employees the exact way we’re trying to protect employees from being treated?""

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY, the VA said Coleman's use of the terms ""toxic"" and ""Dumpster fire"" shows a ""critical disregard"" for the fact that problems at the office have been ""over two years in the making""and include a ""substantial backlog of cases.""

The agency said in a statement that Bonzanto is reorganizing the office to enhance communications with VA employees who report wrongdoing across the country and speed up investigations of the complaints.

The VA said leaders who conducted meetings to inform staff about the ""proposed realignment"" reassured them they ""will not lose their job or have their pay reduced.""

""OAWP has remained transparent with staff throughout the realignment process; solicited and received feedback; and responded to staff questions during multiple meetings and discussions,"" the VA said.

Hearing: Head of VA whistleblower office reassures lawmakers improvements are underway

The complaints from Coleman and his colleagues are the first to become public from inside the office. VA whistleblowers and advocates outside the agency have complained its operations have been ineffective and even vindictive.

VA whistleblowers drive push for change

Trump signed an executive order and later a law in 2017 creating the office to look into claims made by whistleblowers, protect them from retaliation and hold their managers accountable. Coleman stood behind Trump during the signing of the executive order.

Whistleblowing employees who have gone public to expose failures at the VA in recent years have played a critical role in driving a push for improvements at the agency. Health care workers revealed in 2014 that employees were keeping secret wait lists for appointments at the Phoenix VA and veterans had died while waiting.

Since then, they have come forward about the over-prescription of opioids to veterans in Wisconsin, equipment shortages in Washington, and dangerous conditions jeopardizing veteran care in Memphis, among other revelations.

In response to inquiries about Coleman's recent complaints, the VA said Bonzanto didn’t hear from him after he asked for the meeting in March, and his customer service duties ""will continue even after the office is realigned.""

After USA TODAY reached out to the VA for comment about Coleman's request for a meeting with Bonzanto, a senior official told his lawyer he could schedule an appointment.

""If employees have concerns, we encourage them to discuss them with OAWP leadership or provide specific examples so that we can address their concerns directly,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Unfortunately that didn't happen in this case.""

The whistleblower office has been under investigation by the VA inspector general for months and a report is expected in September. A Government Accountability Office report last year raised concerns about the independence of the office’s investigations of wrongdoing reported by whistleblowers.

The VA said Bonzanto’s reorganization is a key improvement she’s making to help address those concerns.

""The inspector general and congressional stakeholders have expressed the need for improvements at OAWP, and that’s precisely what VA Assistant Secretary for Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Dr. Tamara Bonzanto has been focusing on,"" the agency said.

Personal crusade

Improving the VA has been a personal crusade for Coleman, a former Marine with six children, including three Marines. For years, he has backed giving veterans more options for outside care paid for by the VA – a proposal Trump ultimately signed into law.

After Coleman reported in 2014 that suicidal veterans were neglected and left to walk out of the Phoenix VA, his bosses at the time accused him of misconduct and shut down his addiction-treatment program. It took nearly two years to settle the case and get Coleman's program reinstated. He went on to testify before Congress about his experiences.

Coleman was hired to do outreach for the whistleblower office and provide insights to managers on policies and programs.

The office quickly began taking in reports from VA employees – more than 1,000 in the first six months, including more than 200 alleging retaliation by VA bosses for speaking out about problems and dozens about potential threats to veteran health and safety. The office staffed up with more than 50 employees to triage and investigate the reports.

Coleman created the mentorship program, which paired a whistleblower with a senior leader to create and implement an improvement project at their VA hospital. The first pairing Coleman oversaw was in Shreveport, Louisiana, where social worker Shea Wilkes faced retaliation in 2014 after he revealed schedulers had been manipulating appointment wait times.

He partnered with Shreveport VA Director Richard Crockett last year to work on a hotline for employees to anonymously report problems. The VA hailed Coleman’s success in Shreveport last October and said it would ""serve as a model nationwide.""

But complaints about the office’s investigative division had been mounting, including allegations in the GAO report last July that the office allowed officials accused of wrongdoing to participate in investigations of the accusations.

Bonzanto, who was previously an investigator with the House Veterans Affairs Committee, was brought in as a change agent in January.

Meanwhile, Coleman continued to vet new whistleblower applicants for his mentorship program – they had to submit resumes and do interviews to be considered. He said he had eight lined up when he approached Bonzanto to ask for the meeting in March.

Exclusive: Inside Trump's new VA office, early moves to help whistleblowers draw praise

After the program was put on hold, Coleman has continued to triage incoming calls from whistleblowers. When he was excluded from the reorganization meetings last month, he said he started receiving calls from colleagues reluctant to report problems because of fear of retaliation from their bosses.

That’s when, Coleman said, ""It hit me.""

""I no longer feel confident referring whistleblowers to come to OAWP for help,"" he said. ""Something’s wrong with the office, and that’s why it was time to come forward. This needs to be fixed.""

Advocates Slam New U.S. Labor Rule as ‘License to Discriminate’ Against LGBTQ Workers,https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/08/16/labor-rule-lgbtq-people/,"The U.S. Department of Labor in mid-August 2019 made public a proposed rule change that expands the field of employers who can use religion as a criterion for hiring and firing people while those employers still receive federal contracts. The proposal received harsh pushback from critics who say it will allow public dollars to be paid out to organizations that discriminate against members of the public.

Until now, the practice has been that, “If you want to work for the public, with public money, you have to be willing to employ the public,” Jennifer Pizer, law and policy director for Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal-advocacy organization, told The New York Times.

According to the Labor Department, the announcement by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), the agency’s civil rights division, is a rule change intended to protect the civil rights of employers. Per the agency, “The proposed rule would clarify that religious organizations may make employment decisions consistent with their sincerely held religious tenets and beliefs without fear of sanction by the federal government.”

We asked the department to clarify, and an agency spokesperson told us in an emailed statement that, “The exemption entitles an organization to take an applicant or employee’s religion into account when making employment decisions. It does not entitle an organization to take race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status into account.”

But advocates say the federal agency is protecting the religious rights of employers at the expense of their workers’ civil rights. Ian Thompson, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said in a statement that the new rule was an effort to “license taxpayer-funded discrimination in the name of religion,” vowing a legal challenge.

“Nearly one-quarter of the employees in the U.S. work for an employer that has a contract with the federal government,” Thompson’s statement read. “We will work to stop this rule that seeks to undermine our civil rights protections and encourages discrimination in the workplace.”

Naomi Goldberg, policy research director of the LGBTQ advocacy think tank Movement Advancement Project, told The New York Times that the new rule could put in jeopardy workers who are unmarried and pregnant, “workers who may not be coreligionists or who can’t sign a statement of faith, unmarried cohabiting workers and L.G.B.T. workers.”

The Washington Blade, a news outlet that focuses on LGBTQ issues, reported that the proposed rule undermines a 2017 declaration by the Trump White House that it would leave in place a 2014 executive order by the preceding Obama administration that protects LGBTQ people from workplace discrimination.

Others agreed.

“With this proposed regulation, the Trump administration is seeking to gut existing protections for LGBTQ people, women, and religious minorities, and we cannot stand idly by,” Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said in a statement. “This regulation, which directly contradicts Trump’s earlier promise, is a broad and sweeping effort to implement a license to discriminate against people on the basis of their gender identity and sexual orientation.”

The public has 30 days to comment on the rule proposal after the date of publication. All comments must be submitted by Sept. 16, 2019."

(Alastair Pike/AFP/Getty Images)

A report by the State Department’s inspector general concludes that leadership of a leading department bureau mistreated and harassed staffers, accused them of political disloyalty to the Trump administration, and retaliated against them.

In response to repeated counseling by more senior State officials that he address staff concerns, the report concluded, Kevin Moley, assistant secretary for international affairs, “did not take significant action.”

The report, released Thursday, is a sweeping condemnation of Moley and more specifically of his former senior adviser, Mari Stull. A former lobbyist and consultant for international food and agriculture interests, Stull left the department in January following press reports that, among other things, she had compiled a list of staffers deemed insufficiently loyal to the Trump administration.

The 30-page report — based on what it said were interviews with dozens of current and former employees, as well as documents — chronicled numerous episodes of Stull berating and belittling employees, and Moley’s repeated failure to deal with complaints reported to him.

Both Stull and Moley, it said, “frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff,” and reportedly moved to retaliate against those who had held their jobs under the previous administration.

Stull, it said, referred to some employees as “Obama holdovers,” “traitors,” or “disloyal,” and accused some of being part of the “Deep State” and the “swamp” — terms that President Trump has used to refer to federal employees. All of those so accused, the report said, were career staffers and not political appointees.

Some staffers said Moley accused them of “undermining the President’s agenda,” the report said.

In a response appended to the report, Moley said he had no recollection of much of the counseling, and said the description of his behavior with employees “does not represent the person I am or have ever been.” He said accounts of the departure of two senior bureau officials was inaccurate, and that he had not witnessed Stull’s reported behavior.

Stull, the report said, declined to speak to investigators.

Recommendations included in the report advised Undersecretary of Political Affairs David Hale, who supervises the international affairs bureau, to develop a “corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies,” and to consider other action, “including disciplinary action.”

The State Department response, contained in the report and repeated Thursday by a Department spokesman, accepted the recommendations. Noting that Stull was “no longer with the Department,” it said that “with regard to the second employee,” Moley, it would submit a “corrective action plan” within 60 days.

Moley served in a number of government positions in previous administrations, including as permanent U.S. representative to the Geneva-based United Nations office working with international organizations under former president George W. Bush.

The State Department’s international organizations bureau is in charge of U.S. relations with international organizations. Although Moley was nominated for the position under secretary of state Rex Tillerson, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate a week after Trump fired Tillerson in March 2018. Stull was appointed by Moley in April of that year — as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took over the Department — and left last January.

After Politico first published reports of personnel problems in the bureau in July 2018, congressional Democrats raised concerns with Pompeo. The secretary, the report said, referred the matter to the inspector general, which was already investigating what it said were “similar issues involving the Office of the Secretary.”

Inspector General Steve Linick later told Congress that he had decided to separate the matter into two reports — one on the international organizations bureau, and the other on those portions of the Department that reported directly to the secretary’s office. The latter report has not yet been released."

Trump intervention triggered EPA’s surprise biofuel waiver decision: sources,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/16/trump-intervention-triggered-epas-surprise-biofuel-waiver-decision-sources/,"WASHINGTON — A phone call from US President Donald Trump last week ended a nearly two-month-long review of the nation’s biofuels program, three sources familiar with the matter said, with the White House siding in favor of oil refiners over corn growers.

Trump gave Andrew Wheeler, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the green light for the regulator to announce it had granted 31 small refinery exemptions out of the 40 applications, saying he wanted the issue off his desk, the sources said.

Trump’s call triggered a flurry of action within the EPA, leading up to a surprise Friday afternoon announcement, after weeks of negotiations between US government agencies failed to make progress in addressing farmers’ concerns.

“The president has heard from all sides and in the end he has had enough of it. He called Wheeler and gave him the green light,” a source familiar with knowledge of the matter said.

The White House has sought to make changes to the nation’s biofuels laws since the beginning of Trump’s administration in early 2017, but found themselves caught between the powerful oil and corn lobbies, both of whom have allies in Washington in Trump’s Republican Party.

The debate underscores the rising political importance of the US Renewable Fuel Standard, a more than a decade-old federal policy that requires refineries to blend corn-based ethanol into their gasoline or buy credits from those that do.

Since Trump took office, the EPA has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refineries, including some operated by giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging farmers who claim the exemptions threaten demand for one of their staple products.

Refiners dismiss the argument, saying ethanol demand has not been affected.

The White House declined to comment for this story. The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump had ordered the revamp of the waiver program in June, after hearing from angry farmers during a trip to Iowa, the nation’s top ethanol producing state. Even though the corn lobby seemed to have the upper hand in early talks, the oil industry’s efforts eventually gained more traction, industry sources have told Reuters.

Iowa is a swing state that Trump carried in 2016 and is potentially crucial for his re-election efforts next year. Farmers in the state have also chafed under Trump’s trade war with China that has sapped demand for agriculture products.

Farmers slammed last Friday’s decision, saying the Trump administration was bailing out the oil industry at a time when U.S. farmers were suffering due to his trade war with China. The refining industry welcomed the move, saying the waivers are lawful and help shield small refiners from the burdensome cost of compliance with RFS."

The conservative provocateur and the Department of Justice have been sparring for a month over whether jurors can be shown a 4-minute-and-20-second clip from the film.

The video shows Corleone family mob leader Frank Pentangeli lying to Congress — and abandoning his plans to incriminate Michael Corleone — during a dramatic hearing in which Corleone makes an appearance in the audience.

""I don't know nothing about that,"" Pentangeli says in response to a question about Corleone's connections to organized crime. ""Oh — I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago.""

""I kept saying Michael Corleone did this, Michael Corleone did that, so I said, yeah, sure,"" Pentangeli says, downplaying his earlier comments, in which he accused Corleone of crimes.

Stone, who was indicted in January on charges including witness tampering, says the clip will make him out to be a ""murderous mafioso."" The Justice Department calls the video ""directly relevant to the charge.""

The Justice Department charged Stone in January with obstruction, false statements and witness tampering in a 24-page indictment that cites the 1974 crime drama."
Lawmakers Accuse State Dept. of Defying Federal Law by Missing Deadlines for Yemen Reports,https://www.nytimes.com,['Catie Edmondson'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/politics/state-department-yemen-reports.html,"WASHINGTON — In defiance of federal law, the State Department is refusing to submit reports to Congress detailing efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, according to legislators and congressional aides.

Trump administration officials have missed both congressionally mandated deadlines this year to submit the biannual reports, most recently last week. This has further inflamed tensions between the administration and legislators who were already furious with the administration’s unflagging support of the Saudi government and were still stung by the White House’s decision in May to circumvent Congress to sell arms to Riyadh.

“Congress has tried again and again to bring accountability and transparency to America’s role in the war in Yemen. At every turn, the Trump administration has blocked our efforts,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “But we won’t stop looking for ways to dial back our involvement in a conflict that’s fueling the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.”

Last year, Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, both of whom sit on the Foreign Relations Committee, successfully added a provision to the military defense policy bill that required the State Department to submit certifications to Congress describing the actions Saudi and Emirati officials have taken to reduce the risk of harm to civilians."

Jeff Merkley Jeffrey (Jeff) Alan MerkleySenate Democrats push Trump to permanently shutter migrant detention facility Senate Dem seeks answers from DHS on reports of pregnant asylum seekers sent back to Mexico Schumer backs Pelosi as impeachment roils caucus MORE (D-Ore.) on Friday asked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials to clarify reports that pregnant asylum-seekers have been forced to wait out their immigration cases in Mexican border cities.

Merkley wrote DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, asking why six late-term pregnant women were included in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program in May.

Under the program, known colloquially as “Remain in Mexico,” non-Mexican migrants seeking asylum in the United States are sent back across the border to await results of their asylum claims in U.S. immigration courts.

The Trump administration implemented the program in January with the acquiescence, but not outright support, of the Mexican government, which agreed to take in the migrants rather than deport them back to their countries of origin.

DHS in March expanded the program from the California border to El Paso, Texas, where the pregnant women were reportedly included in MPP.

DHS officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

“Policies and practices targeting pregnant women at the border are horrific and these allegations must be immediately investigated,” wrote Merkley.

Under U.S. law, children born in American territory would be natural-born U.S. citizens. If the children of third-country nationals are born in Mexico, they are also entitled to Mexican citizenship.

While Ciudad Juárez, the Mexican border city across from El Paso, has some infrastructure to provide medical services, migrant shelters in the city are reportedly overbooked and unable to care for guests with specialized needs.

Asylum-seekers with special medical needs are exempt from MPP, but that exemption does not explicitly include pregnancy.

""It is beyond question that pregnant women, particularly those nearing full term, have known health issues,"" Merkley wrote.

And Ciudad Juárez is among the most dangerous cities in Mexico, host to more than 170 murders per month.

“Forcing pregnant women to wait alone in Mexico for their asylum hearings puts them at extreme risk of abuse and extortion. Moreover, it creates significant health risks for mothers and children facing imminent delivery dates when proper medical care is not available,” Merkley said."
Justice Department issues warrant for Iranian tanker seizure,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Jeff Mordock']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/16/justice-department-issues-warrant-iranian-tanker-s/,"A U.S. court has issued a warrant for the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker at the center of a fierce international dispute, the Justice Department said late Friday.

The oil tanker, Grace 1, with more than 2 million barrels of oil aboard and $995,000 are subject to forfeiture based on a complaint by the U.S. Government.

Jessie K. Liu, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia said the tanker and its contents should be forfeited because of violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, bank fraud, money laundering and terrorism forfeiture statutes.

The Justice Department says the Grace 1 has ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which it had designated a terrorist organization.

“The documents allege a scheme to unlawfully access the U.S. financial system to support illicit shipments to Syria from Iran by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a designated foreign terrorist organization,” Ms. Liu said in a news release. “The scheme involves multiple parties affiliated with the IRGC and furthered by the deceptive voyages of the Grace 1. A network of front companies allegedly laundered millions of dollars in support of such shipments.”

The Justice Department released the warrant one day after a judge in Gibraltar allowed the release of the detained vessel.

British authorities boarded Grace 1 off the coast on Gibraltar last month alleging it was transporting millions of barrels of crude oil to the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad in violations of European Union sanctions.

On Thursday Gibraltar’s Chief Minister Fabian Picardo said he received assurances from Iran that Grace 1’s cargo was not destined for Syria.

“I welcome that assurance,” Mr. Picardo said in a statement, adding there were “no longer any reasonable grounds for the continued legal detention.”

Although Gibraltar lifted the tanker’s detention order, the legal battle became messy after a last-ditch U.S. effort to hold it.

Mr. Picardo said the U.S. request should be reviewed by Mutual Legal Assistance authorities who will make “an objective, legal determination of that request for separate proceedings.”

Exclusive: Google Insider Turns Over 950 Pages Of Docs And Laptop To DOJ,https://saraacarter.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://saraacarter.com/exclusive-google-insider-turns-over-950-pages-of-docs-and-laptop-to-doj/,"A former Google insider claiming the company created algorithms to hide its political bias within artificial intelligence platforms – in effect targeting particular words, phrases and contexts to promote, alter, reference or manipulate perceptions of Internet content – delivered roughly 950 pages of documents to the Department of Justice’s Antitrust division Friday.

The former Google insider, who has already spoken in to the nonprofit organization Project Veritas, met with SaraACarter.com on several occasions last week. He was interviewed in silhouette, to conceal his identity, in group’s latest film, which they say exposes bias inside the social media platform.

Several weeks prior, the insider mailed a laptop to the DOJ containing the same information delivered on Friday, they said. The former insider is choosing to remain anonymous until Project Verita’s James O’Keefe reveals his identity tomorrow (Wednesday).

He told this reporter on his recent trip to Washington D.C. that the documents he turned over to the Justice Department will provide proof that Google has been manipulating the algorithms and the evidence of how it was done, the insider said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the House Judiciary Committee in December, 2018, that the search engine was not biased against conservatives. Pichai explained what algorithm’s are said Google’s algorithm was not offensive to conservatives because its artificial intelligence does not operate in that manner. He told lawmakers, “things like relevance, freshness, popularity, how other people are using it” are what drives the search results. Pichai said even if his programmers were anti-Republican, the process is so intricate that the artificial intelligence could not be manipulated and it was to complicated to train the algorithm to fit their bias.

Google did not immediately respond for comment on the insider’s claims, however, this story will be updated if comment is provided.

The insider says Google is aware most people are unaware or not knowledgeable about these advanced IT systems and therefore unable to determine who is telling the truth.

“I honestly think that a free market can fix this issue,” he told this reporter at a meeting in Washington D.C. “The issue is that the free market has been distorted and what’s happened is that the distortion is so grotesque and the engineering is so repulsive, all we need to do is just expose what’s going on. People can hear that it is bad but that can be bias. But when they see what Google has actually written with the documents, this will actually be taught in universities of what totalitarian states can do with this type of capability.”

“It will be so revolting that it doesn’t matter what the solution is, a solution will just form as a reaction to this manipulation they have done,” the Google insider said.

He said he’s asked himself many times if he’s overreacting “and every time I simply look back at the documents and realize that I am not.”

“It’s that bad,” he said. “Disclosing Google’s own words to the American public is something I am, must do, if I am to consider myself a good person. The world that google is building is not a place I, or you or our children want to live in.”

— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) August 13, 2019

Another Google insider, who has come forward already, told O’Keefe and other media outlets recently that it is the programers at Google who use the algorithms to manipulate the information to advance its leftist agenda.

Greg Coppola, a software engineer, told Project Veritas that he doesn’t “have a smoking gun.”

However, “I’ve just been coding since I was ten, I have a Ph.D., I have five years of experience at Google, and I just know how algorithms are. They don’t write themselves. We write them to make them do what we want them to do.”

“I look at Search and I look at Google News, and I see what it’s doing,” he said. “I see Google executives go to Congress and say … that it’s not political, and I’m just so sure that that’s not true.”

Department of Justice officials declined to comment on the document dump. But SaraACarter.com has reviewed the documents and obtained proof from the Google insider that the documents were delivered to the DOJ.

The unnamed Google insider first spoke to O’Keefe’s Project Veritas. O’Keefe has been criticized by the left for outing the political bias of executives and employees of Google and other social media companies.

In the nonprofits most recent video, Project Veritas uses their undercover techniques to get Google employees to talk openly about their disdain for Trump and how their artificial intelligence operates.

Jenn Gennai, who heads Google’s Responsible Innovation Team, did not know she was being filmed by O’Keefe’s group. She told the undercover journalist that “the reason we launched our AI principals is because we’re not putting our line in the sand. They were not saying what’s fair and what’s equitable so we’re like, well we’re a big company, we’re going to say it.”"
"FBI 'indifferent' to possible China hack of Hillary Clinton's server, as State Department fought to protect her, interviews suggest",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-indifferent-to-possible-china-hack-of-hillary-clintons-server-as-state-department-fought-to-protect-her-interviews-suggest,"Interviews with intelligence community officials have revealed that senior FBI leaders ""seemed indifferent to evidence of a possible intrusion by a foreign adversary"" into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s non-government email server, and that State Department officials allegedly sought to ""downgrade classified material found on the server,"" according to Senate investigators still probing the matter.

The information was contained in a letter and interview transcripts sent Monday by the majority staff on the Senate Finance and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees to senior Senate Republicans including Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The letter also noted that “neither the committees nor the FBI were able to confirm whether an intrusion into the server occurred.""

The review began after two August 2018 news articles ""alleged that a Chinese state-owned company hacked former Secretary Clinton’s nongovernment server and inserted code that forwarded nearly all of her emails to the foreign company,"" the letter stated, citing an article in The Daily Caller, and a later piece by Fox News.

'OMG' -- TOP CLINTON AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT ATTEMPT TO HACK SERVER IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

A source briefed on the matter confirmed to Fox News at the time that the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) was so concerned by the revelation that officials drove over to the FBI to inform agents -- including anti-Trump agent Peter Strzok -- of the development soon after it was discovered via the emails' metadata in late 2015 or early 2016.

The source said the hack was from a Chinese company, describing it as a front for Chinese intelligence.

The letter to Grassley continued: ""The reporting indicated that two Intelligence Community Inspector General [ICIG] officials – Frank Rucker and Jeanette McMillian – discovered the code and brought the possible intrusion to the attention of the FBI.""

In a December 2018 interview with Senate investigators concerning the reporting on the potential foreign hack, Rucker said Strzok -- then the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division in charge of the Clinton investigation -- seemed ""aloof and dismissive.""

And Strzok didn't ask many questions, according to Rucker.

McMillian, meanwhile, said FBI employees were ""poker-faced"" during the roughly hourlong meeting about the potential breach, even though both the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) had ""significant equities"" in the information contained on the server.

STATE DEPT IDENTIFIES 23 VIOLATIONS, 'MULTIPLE SECURITY VIOLATIONS' AMID ONGOING REVIEW OF CLINTON EMAILS

The FBI did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

McMillian told investigators the episode began when Rucker identified an email address in Clinton's email metadata as a potential ""live dropbox"" for all her emails, which a foreign actor could access.

When Rucker then Googled the email address on the suggestion of then-ICIG Charles McCullough, the name of a Chinese company, ""Shandong Carter Heavy Industry Machinery,"" popped up -- leading Rucker and McCullough to suspect Chinese involvement, according to Rucker's interview with investigators.

In April, the ICIG and Justice Department IG determined that the address apparently matched the one that former Clinton technology aide Paul Combetta -- who managed her server and thoroughly deleted a slew of her emails -- had created as a ""dummy"" to create backups of Clinton's emails.

However, the DOJ IG and ICIG said they “did not identify any information obtained by the FBI during the [Clinton email] Midyear investigation reflecting that Combetta’s dummy email account was associated with a Chinese company or the Chinese government.""

Throughout, according to McMillian's remarks to Senate investigators, FBI brass generally seemed ""impressed"" with Rucker's technical abilities in finding the apparent breach, and apparently took the issue seriously. McMillian specifically said Strzok had found the email account's presence in Clinton's metadata ""strange.""

McMillian said she made sure to tell the FBI that the ICIG was not trying to usurp the FBI's authority after bureau officials asked how it had found information about the potential breach. The FBI made clear the ICIG would provide information to the bureau, but not the other way around, McMillian and Rucker said.

A May 2016 email from Strzok, obtained by Fox News last year, said “we know foreign actors obtained access” to some Clinton emails, including at least one “secret” message “via compromises of the private email accounts” of Clinton staffers.

Strzok, earlier this month, filed a lawsuit against the bureau and the Justice Department – arguing that the FBI caved to the “unrelenting pressure” of the president when it fired him.

DOJ IG Michael Horowitz previously concluded that although he could not prove Strzok had let his political bias influence official decisions during the Clinton email investigation, he did not have confidence that Strzok had acted without bias at critical junctures in the probe.

In text messages with his then-lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Strzok said on his government-issued phone that ""we'll stop"" Trump from becoming president, and called Trump supporters ""retarded.""

Separately, Rucker and McMillian offered more details into reports that the State Department sought to cover for Clinton by downgrading the classification of emails on the server.

FBI SCRAMBLED TO ANSWER TO CLINTON LAWYER IN DAYS BEFORE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, NEW DOCS REVEAL

“At first, State fought back against the intelligence community being involved,"" McMillian told investigators, before noting that they eventually relented.

McMillian claimed that two State Department employees tried to shield some of Clinton's emails from disclosure under the ""deliberative process"" exemption under the Freedom of Information Act -- rather than labeling the emails classified.

The employees, Austin Evers and Catherine Duval, did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. Evers has since launched the organization American Oversight along with other former Obama administration officials. The group says it is devoted to uncovering ethics issues in the Trump administration.

Rucker also claimed that then-Ambassador Patrick Kennedy questioned ""whether certain emails should be provided to the intelligence community for review and fighting against classifying other emails,"" according to the Senate investigators.

The State Department didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Interviews released in 2016, known as 302s, first revealed the serious allegation that Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.

Fox News was told as far back as August 2015 that Kennedy was running interference on Capitol Hill. But Kennedy, in his FBI interview on Dec. 21, 2015, “categorically rejected” allegations of classified code tampering.

“In return for altering the classification, the possibility of additional slots for the FBI at missions overseas was discussed,” then-House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said at the time.

In a lengthy statement, the FBI denied it had agreed to declassify any emails in exchange for more overseas slots from the State Department.

A comprehensive IG report into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct during the Clinton and Russia probes is expected soon.

A Pensacola business owner was arrested Thursday on charges that he operated a human trafficking ring out of Asian massage parlors across three states, a press release says.

David C. Williams, 41, faces multiple federal racketeering, money laundering and harboring illegal alien charges for his role as owner of parlors in Florida, Virginia and Pennsylvania, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Florida.

The release said Williams had locations in Pensacola, Gulf Breeze and Gainesville.

A joint effort of multiple law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, IRS and Homeland Security, led to Williams’ arrest. These agencies executed more than a dozen search warrants of businesses linked to Williams. Authorities seized his bank records as well.

The Washington Post reported Thursday that Trump ramped up his efforts to persuade Mnuchin to take the step after China allowed the yuan to weaken significantly against the dollar. Mnuchin had previously resisted making the designation, sources told the Post.

Trump last week labeled the move a ""major violation,"" and three sources close to Mnuchin told the Post that Trump's efforts culminated in the Treasury Department declaring China a currency manipulator later that day.

""China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called 'currency manipulation.' Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!"" Trump tweeted last week.

In an Aug. 5 statement, the Treasury Department said Mnuchin made the decision ""in auspices of President Trump"" and pointed to public statements made by Chinese officials as evidence that its government was artificially devaluing the yuan.

""Secretary Mnuchin, under the auspices of President Trump, has today determined that China is a Currency Manipulator,"" the department said in a statement.

“In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past,” Treasury said at the time. “The context of these actions and the implausibility of China’s market stability rationale confirm that the purpose of China’s currency devaluation is to gain an unfair competitive advantage in international trade.”

The International Monetary Fund has declined to concur with the U.S. designating China a currency manipulator.

One person close to Mnuchin told the Post that the intent of the designation was to coax Chinese negotiators back to the table for trade talks, though the source added that the strategy has not yet been successful.

Earlier this week, the White House trade office said the administration would delay the implementation of tariffs on certain consumer goods from China, from Sept. 1 to Dec. 15, while exempting other goods from the tariffs altogether.

The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan: Border Crossings Down 43 Percent Since May,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Mairead Mcardle', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'David French', 'Charles C. W. Cooke', 'Helen Raleigh', 'Jason Delisle', 'Preston Cooper', 'Read More', 'The American Conservative', 'The Week']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/acting-dhs-secretary-border-crossings-down-43-percent-since-may/,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan testifies in Washington, D.C., May 23, 2019. (James Lawler Duggan/Reuters)

Acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that border crossings have declined 43 percent since May, when arrests between ports of entry at the southern border increased for the fourth straight month to 132,887, up from 99,304 arrests in April.

“So those efforts are making progress, 43 percent reduction in crossings since May,” McAleenan said. “We’re hoping to continue the progress in August.”

McAleenan said DHS is working with Central American countries to protect migrants who need asylum as well as conduct an “aggressive effort against human smugglers,” a project he said “could really change the game.”

“I’ll be going back to Central America next week to try to build on that with El Salvador and Panama and really address this problem as a regional effort,” he said.

The number of immigrants being held at border stations is also down significantly from its June high of 20,000, McAleenan said. “This morning we have less than 4,000, and they’re not staying with us very long. We’re able to repatriate the single adults quickly. The unaccompanied children are going to a better situation with Health and Human Services.”

The acting DHS chief went on to take a shot at what he sees as a toxic political environment “where we’re demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs,” calling it “concerning.”

There have been several attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in recent weeks, including incidents on Tuesday in which shots were fired into two San Antonio facilities. The FBI is investigating those attacks as an “assault on a federal official case.”

“It can be dangerous, and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts, that are not in response to anything inappropriate that our men and women of ICE and enforcement removal operations are doing,” McAleenan said. “And I think we’ve got to tone that down, absolutely.”"
ANALYSIS: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-who-and-what-the-horowitz-report-is-likely-to-cover,"The 448-page report detailing special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year Trump-Russia investigation is public. Next up: Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report into how that investigation started.

That report, anticipated to be released after Congress returns from August recess, will come amid an ongoing contentious debate between Republicans who think the government unfairly targeted President Trump and Democrats who believe Trump deserved to be investigated for his alleged ties to Russia.

But what Horowitz's report, which is expected to delve into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the FBI's use of the salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, contains has been held close.

Still, recent developments have offered a sneak preview of the cast of characters who could make appearances when Horowitz explains what his team uncovered.

Former FBI Director James Comey received good news a couple weeks ago when the DOJ decided not to charge him over leaking his memos, despite a criminal referral from Horowitz, who concluded Comey leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor. But the leak inquiry was just a narrow slice of the broader investigation Horowitz launched in March of last year.

Horowitz is likely scrutinizing every aspect of the FISA approval process, and the head of the FBI plays an integral role. Comey signed three of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, who was never charged with wrongdoing, during the Trump-Russia investigation. Comey defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier but admitted the dossier wasn't verified when he approved its use, and investigators were still working to verify its contents when he was fired in May 2017. The final FISA renewal happened a month later.

The FISA filings required approval from top members of the FBI and the Justice Department, so other possible targets of Horowitz's inquiry likely included the approvers of the four applications and renewals: Comey; Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates; Dana Boente, the only signatory in active government service and currently Trump’s top lawyer at the FBI; then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to be special counsel the month before.

Mueller told Congress he wasn't involved in approving that final FISA warrant.

The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the Justice Department and the FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm and was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race.

Also last week, McCabe and former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, both fired during the Trump administration, separately sued the Justice Department alleging political bias played a role in their removals. Strzok demanded reinstatement and back pay, and McCabe demanded he receive his full retirement pension.

Horowitz has a history with both men. He previously concluded anti-Trump texts sent from Strzok to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, his mistress, not only showed Strzok was biased but also that he was willing to take official action to affect Trump's electoral prospects. Horowitz also concluded McCabe leaked information without authorization and ""lacked candor"" with investigators.

Horowitz's findings were cited in both their firings, and he's likely not done with them since both played prominent roles in the Trump-Russia investigation.

And last Thursday, FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI.

Horowitz is also likely looking into the FBI's use of an article by Michael Isikoff to bolster its FISA filings. The FBI told the court it didn't think the piece was connected to the dossier, even though Isikoff only wrote it after meeting with Steele.

The Justice Department inspector general said when he launched the investigation last year at the behest of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements"" related to FISA filings against Page and review the DOJ’s and the FBI’s dealings with Steele. But while Horowitz said he would consider including other issues that arose during the investigation, Attorney General William Barr has since suggested the inquiry is narrow.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker is also likely to be among those scrutinized, since he admitted he inserted himself into the FISA approval process and reviewed the first FISA application. Baker defended how the FBI handled the Steele dossier, claiming “we took it seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally.”

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Officials such as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec knew by October 2016 portions of Steele’s dossier were inaccurate. And State Department officials such as Jonathan Winer and Victoria Nuland seem to have been involved in spreading Steele's information within the U.S. government.

Many members of the media also received info from the Steele dossier, which may have contained Russian disinformation, at the behest of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.

The Steele dossier's central thesis was ""a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation"" between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Mueller didn't agree. Although Mueller concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election, the investigation did not establish the Kremlin and Trump's campaign criminally conspired. Mueller’s report also shot down at least one of Steele’s biggest claims — that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with foreign hackers in Prague.

Horowitz reportedly “homed in” on Steele, and his team reportedly interviewed the ex-spy in June.

Meanwhile, Barr, along with U.S. Attorney John Durham, launched his own inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Trump gave him broad declassification authority to look into it."
The USDA Dropped a Corn Bombshell. What It Means for Deere and Other Stocks.,https://www.barrons.com,['Al Root'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-usda-dropped-a-corn-bombshell-what-it-means-for-deere-and-other-stocks-51565705634,"Text size

The U.S. Agriculture Department, or USDA, zigged on Monday when the market expected it to zag.

The farming agency released its monthly world grain report, called WASDE, and, surprisingly, the agency sees a bigger U.S. corn crop—despite poor weather in the Midwest. Corn prices cratered as a result.

Corn futures contact prices dropped “limit down” on Monday—dropping about 6%—meaning futures reached their maximum allowable daily losses on Chicago exchanges. And corn prices were down again Tuesday. What roiled commodity traders was the USDA increasing the expected corn yield per acre for farmers in the 2018/2019 crop year. (For farmers the “crop year” goes from harvest to harvest.) The USDA now expect farmers to produce about 169 bushels of corn per acre, up from expecting 166 in July. (Bad weather has had an impact though—U.S. corn yield was more than 176 bushels per acre last year.)

That’s good news if you are a user of corn, such as a food company, such as corn buyer Post (ticker: POST).

“We view the USDA’s August WASDE report as positive for packaged food manufacturers, as fears over a run-up in grain-driven input cost inflation are being alleviated by a robust corn supply outlook,” writes Citigroup analyst Cornell Burnette in a Tuesday research report. “Thus, our positive thesis for the sector remains intact.”

But higher corn production isn’t such good news if you sell inputs or equipment to farmers, such as Deere (DE).

“Deere’s near-term fundamentals were challenging exiting the second quarter 2019 but there was hope that investors could look through near-term weakness as higher corn prices would deliver demand reacceleration in 2020,” writes Baird analyst Mig Dobre in a Monday evening research report. “The 2019 crop still has challenges that could drive prices higher, but the near term is decidedly more difficult after today’s USDA forecast updates.” Dobre rates shares of Deere Buy, but he cut his price target to $150 from $170 based on the USDA news.

Things could still change for the U.S. corn outlook. Weather, exports, ethanol demand all feed into the USDA models, and all inputs are fluid. Agricultural consultant Mark Feight of International Agribusiness Group, or IAG, believes the corn acreage figures could still come down when the USDA reports figures in October.

Stocks usually don’t overreact to a single crop report because equity prices reflect long-term business value—at least, that’s what the theory says. The long-term trend in agricultural prices and acreage matters more for stocks. Still, there were some big moves along the agricultural value chain on Monday.

Post , for instance, dropped 1.4% on Monday along with the 400-point drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That wasn’t a surprise, but ethanol producer Green Plains (GPRE) actually dropped 4.3%, even though corn is an input for the company. Ethanol demand also influences Green Plains stock. Input provider Corteva (CTVA) dropped 6%, and tractor maker Deere dropped 5% in Monday trading.

Department of Justice sides with Led Zeppelin in “Stairway to Heaven” copyright dispute,https://consequenceofsound.net,['Ben Kaye'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/08/doj-led-zeppelin-stairway-to-heaven-copyright/,"Led Zeppelin

Led Zeppelin has found an unlikely ally in its long-running “Stairway to Heaven” copyright dispute. Attorney General William Barr and the Department of Justice have come out in support of the iconic rockers, filing a friend of the court brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday (via NBC News).

Fans have debated for decades whether Zeppelin’s classic track ripped off the Spirit song “Taurus”. Michael Skidmore, trustee for the late “Taurus” songwriter Randy Wolfe, sought to get an official answer by suing the band for copyright infringement in 2014. Two years later, the case went before a jury, who ruled in favor of Led Zeppelin.



(Read: 10 Famous Cases of Alleged Music Plagiarism)

However, though the jury heard testimony from Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, the actual music in question was never played during trial. The presiding judge on the case had ruled that since “Taurus” was written in 1967, prior to a change in federal copyright law, only the sheet music for the song was actually protected. After the initial verdict, the case was sent to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel called for a second trial, stating that the jury should have heard the songs. Finally, in June, the Ninth Circuit decided they’d like to hear the appeal once more.

And this is where the Justice Department comes in. In its brief, the DOJ sided with the trial judge, agreeing that only the “Taurus” sheet music should be considered when questioning copyright. Audio recording didn’t fall under federal copyright protection until the laws changed in 1972, five years after Wolfe penned “Taurus”.

The DOJ’s brief went on to say that protection should be granted to “Taurus” only if the song is “virtually identical” to “Stairway to Heaven”, something the DOJ thinks can’t be proven. We’ll see if the Ninth Circuit heeds that advice when they hear the case again in September."

would have a conflict of interest and shouldn’t be allowed to serve on various scientific panels that advise the EPA.

The move outraged science and environmental advocates who countered that the policy would sideline some of the nation’s top researchers while paving the way for industry-funded scientists to gain more influence at the EPA.

A July report from the Government Accountability Office found the EPA increased the number of industry representatives and consultants on its top scientific board and failed to ensure the appointees met ethics requirements.

But the Trump administration has already had a victory in court.

A judge previously ruled that the scientists involved in the case have no recourse because EPA’s decision is not subject to court review.

Earthjustice argues the EPA’s rule on conflicts of interest violates ethics rules and the procedure for changing them.

EPA did not immediately respond to request for comment.

A similar suit from the Natural Resources Defense Council was filed in June. That case is still being litigated.

The legal battles come at a time when many critics argue that such committees are under attack by the Trump administration.

A recent executive order signed by Trump directs all federal agencies to cut their advisory boards by at least one-third.

Those boards are often filled by people considered to be at the top of their fields who can provide important technical advice to various departments as they consider crafting a wide variety of policies.

Tensions between the boards and the agencies they advise have been particularly high at the EPA.

Members of the Science Advisory Board recently pushed back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public."

After shots were fired into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office and another facility associated with the agency in San Antonio, Texas, early Tuesday, ICE said in a statement that, ""Political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts.""

McAleenan agreed, calling on those who oppose the Trump administration's policies to tone down their rhetoric before someone gets hurt, noting that this is the fourth such incident targeting an ICE facility.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS

""I think the environment where we're demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs, for enforcing the laws on the books, is concerning, it can be dangerous and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts,"" he said.

The FBI is investigating the ""targeted attack"" in which shots were fired at around 3 a.m. at an ICE building where two floors house administrative and executive offices, according to the San Antonio Express-News. The outlet reported another shooting occurred at a separate facility where an ICE contractor is located.

The Texas attack follows two separate incidents last month, when a man attacked an ICE building in Washington state and protesters raised a Mexican flag at a Colorado ICE facility.

Many on the left renewed their harsh criticism of ICE after 680 “removable aliens” were arrested last week at several Mississippi food processing plants where they were working. It was deemed the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in U.S. history.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said the raids were part of a ""campaign of terror"" by the Trump administration, while the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote in a letter to McAleenan that the purpose of the raids was ""to instill fear in Latino and immigrant communities at a time when Latinos are already living in terror.""

McAleenan said progress is being made when it comes to working with Mexico and Central American nations to stem the flow of migrants at the border, but the laws ""in the interior"" must also be enforced, including going after businesses who employ undocumented workers."

The US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) has signed a USD600 million contract with Cray Inc to build its first exascale supercomputer, El Capitan. The computer will be housed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California.

(Image: DOE)

Exascale supercomputers are capable of executing a quintillion (1018) calculations each second. This is much faster than the fastest supercomputers in the world today which solve problems at the petascale, or a quadrillion (1015) calculations per second. According to the Exascale Computing Project - a collaborative effort of the DOE's Office of Science and the NNSA - exascale computers represent the next milestone in computing achievement. Their ability to simulate more realistically the processes involved in a range of areas including precision medicine, climate modelling, materials science and nuclear physics will have profound impacts on everyday life, it says.

""The Department of Energy is the world leader in supercomputing and El Capitan is a critical addition to our next generation systems,"" US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said. ""El Capitan's advanced capabilities for modelling, simulation, and Artificial Intelligence will help push America's competitive edge in energy and national security, allow us to ask tougher questions, solve greater challenges, and develop better solutions for generations to come.""

El Capitan will be used to perform ""mission critical"" research to maintain the US nuclear weapons stockpile, NNSA said. ""It will be used by researchers … to run 3D simulations and calculations at resolutions that are difficult, time-consuming, or even impossible using today's state-of-the art supercomputers,"" the administration added.

The computer, which is scheduled for delivery in late 2022, will be the DOE's third exascale supercomputer after Aurora at Argonne National Laboratory and Frontier at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), both of which are scheduled for delivery in 2021. All three are to be built by Cray using their Shasta architecture, Slingshot interconnect, and new system software platform.

ORNL's Summit supercomputer in 2018 was recognised as the fastest supercomputer in the world, when it reached a speed of 122.3 petaflops, which it has since improved to 148.6 petaflops, according to the semi-annual TOP500 List ranking of the world's fastest computing systems. Second place is currently held by the Sierra supercomputer at LLNL, with a fastest speed of 94.6 petaflops. One petaflop is equal to one quadrillion calculations - or ""floating-point operations"" - per second.

The warden of the federal prison in New York City where Jeffrey Epstein was found dead has been reassigned, the Department of Justice says. Two other staffers were placed on leave.

The administrative moves took place amid official investigations into Epstein's death and following harsh official criticism of the Bureau of Prisons.

Epstein's death, the result of an apparent suicide, shows ""deficiencies in inmate protocol and has allowed the deceased to ultimately evade facing justice,"" wrote House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., in a letter to BOP.

Attorney General William Barr said Monday that investigators had already discovered ""serious irregularities"" at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where Epstein had been housed.

The warden who was supervising the center has been reassigned to the Bureau of Prisons' Northeast Regional Office, according to the Justice Department.

The warden was not identified in the announcement and the department has not responded to a request to confirm the name of a person connected in other documents with the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

James Petrucci, who was overseeing a prison in Otisville, N.Y., will take over as acting warden, the Justice Department said.

""Additional actions may be taken as the circumstances warrant,"" a spokeswoman said.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., released a statement Tuesday calling for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold an oversight hearing about the Bureau of Prisons.

""Every day that passes without action is another day that the safety of prison staff and inmates is at grave risk,"" Durbin said.

The Justice Department also didn't identify the two prison staffers who have been reassigned as the investigations move ahead.

The president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals, Eric Young, said the moves appeared standard.

""The actions taken today by the attorney general are typical to protect the integrity of investigations until any formal action, if any, is warranted.""

New Jersey Paralegal Allegedly Used DOJ Access to Help Son’s Gang Identify “Snitches”,https://slate.com,['Molly Olmstead'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/new-jersey-gang-paralegal-doj-access-snitches.html,"The state seal of New Jersey.

A paralegal in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office has been accused of using her government access to identify people in her son’s gang who cooperated with investigators, putting them in danger of retaliation from their fellow gang members, according to filings in a federal court in Brooklyn. The woman pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday.

According to prosecutors, Tawanna Hilliard, 44, used her access to Department of Justice computers to search databases to identify cooperating witnesses from the 5-9 Brims, a set of the Bloods street gang, at the direction of members of that gang. According to NJ.com, Hilliard had worked in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney Office’s Civil Division for nine years.

Hilliard also specifically targeted the co-defendant in a robbery case that resulted in her son, Tyquan, being sentenced to 10 years in prison. In May 2018, the man and Tyquan Hilliard robbed an AT&T store in Monticello, New York. The men threatened the store clerk and two shoppers with a gun and bound them with duct tape in a storage room. They fled the scene and led the police on a high-speed chase before crashing their car and being captured.

Texts between the mother and son allegedly show Tawanna Hilliard complaining that the co-defendant’s cooperation with the investigators after the robbery ruined her son’s defense. The man was “giving up murders, victims, shooters and all…SMH,” she wrote in a text, according to court documents. Tawanna Hilliard allegedly responded by posting a video on YouTube of the co-defendant talking to investigators about that robbery, with the title “NYC Brim Gang Member Snitching Pt. 1.” The man and his family then received death threats from other inmates linked to the Bloods, according to prosecutors.

According to NJ.com, the indictment contends that before his arrest, Hilliard told her son in an April 2016 call that she had “looked up” cases for another gang member who wanted to locate people who “snitched.”

Hilliard has been charged with witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and obtaining information from a government computer. She was released on bond with the order not to contact her son or other gang members. Her son is also charged in the indictment."
