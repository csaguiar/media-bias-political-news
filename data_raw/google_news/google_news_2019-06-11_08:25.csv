Justin Amash leaves House Freedom Caucus after ‘impeachable’ comments,https://nypost.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Fox News', 'June']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/11/justin-amash-leaves-house-freedom-caucus-after-impeachable-comments/,"Michigan Repubican Rep. Justin Amash announced Monday evening he was leaving the influential conservative House Freedom Caucus, just weeks after he attracted the ire of his colleagues by arguing in Twitter posts that President Trump had committed impeachable offenses, Fox News has learned.

Amash, speaking at a Freedom Caucus board meeting, insisted his departure was voluntary. Amash said he did not want to continue to be a “further distraction” for the caucus, which is chaired by North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows.

Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told Fox News’ “Ingraham Angle” Monday evening that Meadows and Amash mutually came to the decision after several conversations.

Jordan said the Republican members of the group still consider Amash a friend, but that their disagreements were “sharp” and significant.

“Some of the president’s actions were inherently corrupt,” Amash, who said Trump had “engaged in impeachable conduct,” tweeted in May. “Other actions were corrupt — and therefore impeachable — because the president took them to serve his own interests.”

Amash also accused Attorney General Bill Barr of intentionally misrepresenting Mueller’s report through lawyerly sleights of hand.

President Trump responded by writing that Amash was a “loser” and a “lightweight” seeking to gain national name recognition.

At a town hall in Grand Rapids, Mich., late last month, some of Amash’s constituents excoriated him for pushing for impeachment, while several others commended him for breaking ranks with his party and standing on principle.

“You talk about the Constitution and how important that is, but yet nothing that Mueller came out within this report, nothing that has been said about him and President Trump is constitutional and has been a smear tactic because that’s how the Democrats work,” one Trump supporter told Amash. “How can you become a Democrat when we voted for you as a Republican because you’ve just drank the same Kool-Aid as all the Democrats.”

Amash then defended his record in Congress, telling the town hall attendees he has “one of the most constitutionally conservative and fiscally conservative” voting records of all sitting lawmakers and that he’s at the top “of nearly all the scorecards” of conservative groups.

Amash had a high 88 rating from the American Conservative Union (ACU) in 2018, up from 78 in 2017. Jordan scored 100 for both years, while Meadows notched 91 and 100, respectively. The group’s Federal Legislative Ratings scores members of Congress based on how they vote in line with conservative principles. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., by contrast, had a 4 rating in 2018.

Another woman at the town hall, Anna Timmer, criticized Amash for “grandstanding” and trying to raise his “national profile,” while arguing that an impeachment inquiry would “tear this country apart.”

She later told Fox News the town hall was “packed with Democrats” who were “shaking their fists” at her.

In May, another caucus member, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, echoed Timmer’s complaints. (McCarthy’s ACU rating was 80 in 2018.)

“This is exactly what he wants, he wants to have attention,” McCarthy said on “Sunday Morning Futures.” He went on to express doubt over Amash’s Republican leanings in general.

“You’ve got to understand Justin Amash. He’s been in Congress quite some time. I think he’s asked one question in all the committees that he’s been in. He votes more with Nancy Pelosi than he ever votes with me. It’s a question whether he’s even in our Republican conference as a whole.”

Amash criticized Republicans and Democrats for rushing to judgment over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, accusing his colleagues of speaking out based on which side of the political aisle they are on, and not the facts.

“Few members of Congress even read Mueller’s report; their minds were made up based on partisan affiliation,” Amash tweeted, “and it showed, with representatives and senators from both parties issuing definitive statements on the 448-page report’s conclusions within just hours of its release.”

McCarthy, meanwhile, accused Amash of simply being contrarian, saying, “You could have a bill with 400 votes all supporting it, there will always be one opposed and that is Justin Amash.”

Amash stated earlier this year that he was considering running against Trump in 2020 as a third-party candidate.

"Opinion | Congratulations on Fixing the Border, Mr. President!",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michelle Goldberg'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/opinion/trump-mexico-tariffs-trade.html,"Months ago, Mexico consented to expanding a program in which migrants seeking asylum in the United States wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated, and to deploying more of its national guard to block migrants. It looks as if negotiators of the deal made on Friday simply ramped up the scale of these agreements to give Trump a face-saving way to back down from tariffs that threatened the American economy as well as the Mexican one.

As it became clear — at least to those outside the Fox News bubble — how little Trump had achieved, he grew even more splutteringly incoherent than usual. “Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had, or didn’t have,” until the deal, he wrote in one tweet. Trump went on to claim that Mexico had made further, secret concessions that would be revealed at a later date, which Mexico’s foreign minister denied. (Some have reported that Trump was referring to a potential regional pact on asylum that would include Central and South American countries and the United Nations, which Mexico said it could be open to discussing.)

All this was just the latest demonstration that, personal branding to the contrary, the president is terrible at making deals. What he’s good at is what might be called deal theater — made-for-TV melodramas with self-generated crises, over-the-top demands, and suspenseful arbitrary deadlines. The point of these exercises isn’t to solve a problem, but to pacify Trump with the illusion that he is winning so that he doesn’t feel the need to break anything.

The question for everyone else is whether to play along, because Trump is less dangerous if he thinks Mexico has submitted. Until now, the president has regularly stoked his nativist base by treating the humanitarian emergency at the border as a security threat. Now he has an interest in exaggerating the degree to which the problem has been solved, just as he now plays down North Korea’s nuclear capabilities rather than admit his own failure.

Facing widespread mockery for his Potemkin deal, Trump tweeted on Monday that if Mexico’s legislature fails to enact the provisions of its purported secret agreement with the U.S., the tariffs will go into effect. There’s an implicit threat here: Don’t provoke him. If he doesn’t get the headlines he wants, there’s no telling what he might do."

""He decided not to bring any charges regarding the obstruction of justice because there is no crime here. The bottom line is what the House is doing is politically motivated, trying to destroy the Trump presidency.""

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO HOLD MUELLER REPORT HEARING WITH WATERGATE FIGURE JOHN DEAN

Dean, the former White House counsel to Richard Nixon, testified before the House Judiciary Committee Monday saying that he sees “remarkable parallels” between Watergate and the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report.

Graham assured MacCallum that the Senate was done with the Mueller report.

""I can assure you that we are done with the Mueller investigation in the Senate. They can talk to John Dean until the cows come home, we are not doing anything in the Senate regarding the Mueller report,"" Graham said.

The senator also said that Attorney General William Bar and U.S. Attorney John Durham are focusing on the origins of the Russia investigation, trying to get answers to some important questions.

Opinion | Donald and the Delusion Discount,https://www.nytimes.com,['Paul Krugman'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/opinion/trump-trade-tariffs.html,"The events of the past few weeks destroyed whatever credibility Donald Trump may still have had on economic policy. And investors are celebrating. At this point, evidence that Trump tweets are sound and fury signifying nothing is, in effect, good news.

Let’s review what happened. First, having gone to great lengths to get a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada — an agreement that was very similar to the existing agreement, but one he could slap his own name on — Trump basically blew up his position by threatening to impose new tariffs unless Mexico did something about border issues that have nothing to do with trade.

This obviously weakens if it doesn’t destroy Trump’s ability to negotiate future agreements, on trade or anything else. After all, what’s the point of making deals with an administration that reneges on its promises whenever it feels like it?

But then, barely a week later, Trump called the whole thing off in return for a statement by Mexico that it would do … things it had already agreed to months earlier."

"Trump Needs a Target to Stay Interested in His Campaign. For Now, It’s Biden.",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Annie Karni', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/trump-biden-iowa.html,"Mr. Trump has been uninterested in the campaign’s mammoth online advertising efforts, which have surpassed $4.5 million. When it comes to digital advertising in general, his response is to ask aides, “Is this for television?”

Unlike his last presidential race, during which Mr. Trump was concerned about spending because it was his own money on the line, he has not pressed for details. And he has made it clear that he does not relish participating in fund-raisers, leaving much of the donor maintenance and hand-holding to Vice President Mike Pence.

Mr. Trump may be indifferent to the mechanics of running a presidential campaign, in part because he continues to view his 2016 victory as driven almost entirely by his own force of personality and messaging.

“His counterintuitive gut instinct that drove much of the 2016 race was spot on through the primary and the general elections,” said Jason Miller, who served as a communications aide on Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. “I wouldn’t expect that to change going into 2020. He’s always going to be the one who drives the message and makes the important political decisions.”

Mr. Trump is also aware that his signature campaign promise — to build a wall along the border with Mexico — has not come to fruition. He has been looking for opportunities to demonstrate to his core voters that he is fighting to get it done, according to aides, and that he is being stopped by intractable political forces.

But many of his private, election-related conversations, aides said, tend to center on Mr. Biden.

In conversations with donors and allies, the president has continued to refer to him as feeble (Mr. Biden is 76; Mr. Trump is turning 73 this week) and noted that he was part of the Washington establishment, giving Mr. Trump the opportunity to run as the outsider even from his perch in the Oval Office.

“He views Biden as a failed vice president who’s going to be savaged by the left in the primary to the point of unelectability,” said Sam Nunberg, who worked on the 2016 campaign. “He also doesn’t believe he has energy.”"
Justice Dept. Agrees to Turn Over Key Mueller Evidence to House,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/mueller-judiciary-committee.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department, after weeks of tense negotiations, has agreed to provide Congress with key evidence collected by Robert S. Mueller III that Democrats believe could shed light on possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power by President Trump.

The precise scope, volume or usefulness of the material was not immediately clear, but the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said it would include “interview notes, firsthand accounts of misconduct and other critical evidence” collected by Mr. Mueller from the White House and former officials.

The deal appeared to provide a rationale for House Democrats’ choice, announced last week, to back away from threats to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the materials in question. Out of an abundance of caution, the House still planned move forward with a Tuesday vote to empower the Judiciary Committee to take Mr. Barr and other noncompliant witnesses to court to fully enforce their subpoenas if necessary.

And another panel, the House Oversight and Reform Committee, is to vote on Wednesday to recommend that the House hold Mr. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for defying subpoenas in a different case related to the Trump administration’s addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census."
Homeland Security watchdog retires early after his office was forced to retract ‘feel-good’ audits of disaster response,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'June At Pm']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-retires-early-after-his-office-was-forced-to-retract-feel-good-audits-of-disaster-response/2019/06/10/a370f488-8b9d-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"A house on Staten Island that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Sandy, shown in 2012. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."

A tweet by French ambassador to the U.S. Gérard Araud on April 29 indicated that the tree was not missing, but was quarantined. The mandatory quarantine is for any living organism imported to the U.S. The tree was to be replanted later.

The tree was never replanted and died in quarantine, a diplomatic source told Agence France-Presse.

Barr said earlier this year that he intended to review the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia's election interference and intelligence collection directed at members and associates of the Trump campaign. It later became known that he tapped Durham to lead the review.

Barr has said he believes the campaign was spied on and that he’s interested in ensuring that the investigative steps were adequately predicated. Barr has faced blowback for his use of the word “spying” from Democrats and other Trump administration critics who argued he was amplifying a conspiracy theory.

In the letter Monday, Boyd described Barr’s review as “broad in scope and multifaceted"" and said it is ""intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals.”

“As the Attorney General has stated publicly at congressional hearings and elsewhere, there remain open questions relating to the origins of this counter-intelligence investigation and the U.S. and foreign intelligence activities that took place prior to and during that investigation,” Boyd wrote.

“The purpose of the Review is to more fully understand the efficacy and propriety of those steps and to answer, to the satisfaction of the Attorney General, those open questions. Among other things, the Review will seek to determine whether the investigation complied with applicable policies and laws,” he wrote.

The letter comes weeks after Trump ordered U.S. intelligence leaders to cooperate with Barr’s investigation. Trump also gave Barr broad authorities to declassify and potentially release sensitive documents related to the probe.

Boyd described the review as a “collaborative” effort between the department and the intelligence community as well as “certain foreign actors.”

He also wrote that the department had requested certain unnamed intelligence community entities preserve relevant records, make available witnesses who may be “pertinent” to the inquiry and begin “identifying and assembling materials” relevant to the review consistent with Trump’s order and federal law.

Boyd also wrote that, while Barr had been granted the declassification powers, “it is of great importance to the Department to protect classified information by preventing the unwarranted disclosure of sensitive sources, methods, techniques and materials where such disclosure would endanger personal safety of U.S. government employees or friendly foreign partners, harm U.S. national security interests, or compromise the ability of U.S. government agencies to conduct their important work to protect the American people.”"
Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447713-trump-appoints-social-security-administration-watchdog-to-also,"President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse panel seeks to block Pentagon funds for border wall Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi MORE has quietly appointed his Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general to also oversee a much different agency: the Interior Department.

On May 28, Gail Ennis began her second job overseeing the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a role she will keep for the foreseeable future, the OIG confirmed to The Hill.

The Trump administration is still awaiting the confirmation of Mark Greenblatt, the former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, to formally head the Interior’s OIG office.

Ennis was sworn into the SSA role just five months ago, her first time serving as an inspector general. Her professional background is in securities litigation, working previously as a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm WilmerHale, where she reportedly earned $2 million a year.

At the SSA, Ennis has most recently led efforts to thwart scam Social Security phone calls, at the Interior department she will oversee investigations into Interior’s newly appointed Secretary David Bernhardt's lobbying ties and two ongoing Justice Department investigations into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Investigators found Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act | Major union endorses Green New Deal | Group sues Trump over fishing permits said to endanger sea turtles Overnight Energy: Investigators found Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act | Major union endorses Green New Deal | Group sues Trump over fishing permits said to endanger sea turtles Federal investigators concluded Ryan Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act MORE. One of those investigations has reportedly made it to the grand jury.

The appointment of Ennis to Interior was not formally announced by the White House, however, the Interior Department’s website was updated last week to reflect her new position.

Ennis replaces former acting Inspector General Mary Kendall, who retired from the office at the end of May. Kendall oversaw multiple ethics investigations into Zinke, including recommending a number of them to the Justice Department for further investigation. Those investigations reportedly played a heavy factor in Zinke’s decision to leave the administration early this year.

Ennis is the second Trump political appointee whom the administration has attempted to put in the Interior OIG role.

Earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonBen Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' Ben Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' Trump administration to make it easier for adoption agencies to reject same-sex couples: report MORE announced to staff that Assistant HUD Secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would replace Kendall. Because Tufts had been previously confirmed by the Senate, she would not have to go through another confirmation process for the role.

However, following backlash to that announcement, the Interior Department later said the announcement was a misunderstanding and Carson reversed the move. Tufts resigned not long after.

“On May 28th, Social Security [Inspector General] Gail S. Ennis started at [Department of Interior] OIG as Acting Inspector General. Continuing with her responsibilities as SSA IG, Ms. Ennis will also lead our organization while Mark Greenblatt’s nomination continues to progress in the Senate,” an OIG spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

The White House referred comment to the Interior OIG. The Interior Department did not return a request for comment.

In addition to the ongoing investigations into Interior's current and former secretaries, the OIG is also investigating six high-ranking interior officials for ethics concerns.

Wilmer Hale, the law firm where Ennis previously worked as a partner, lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. For example, the law firm represents Twin Metals a Minnesota based mineral mining company that is lobbing to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Ennis, who was not a registered lobbyist, said the Interior OIG ethics office is currently reviewing her former clients.

""DOI OIG General Counsel is conducting a thorough ethics review that will ensure that I do not participate in any matter that would create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Ennis told the Hill in a statement.

"Ex-Nixon aide John Dean testifies on Watergate-Russia 'parallels,' as GOP mocks appearance",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-nixon-aide-john-dean-testifies-of-remarkable-parallels-to-watergate-as-dems-ramp-up-trump-probes,"John Dean, the former White House counsel to Richard Nixon, testified Monday that he sees “remarkable parallels” between Watergate and the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report – at a dramatic Capitol Hill hearing that Republicans panned as a political “show” as they repeatedly challenged the credibility of the witness.

In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Dean, an outspoken critic of President Trump, said several points in the Mueller report “echo Watergate,” especially relating to the obstruction of justice probe.

""In many ways the Mueller report is to President Trump what the so-called Watergate road map…was to President Richard Nixon,” Dean said, adding Mueller “has provided this committee a road map.”

NADLER PUTS BARR CONTEMPT PUSH ON HOLD AFTER STRIKING MUELLER REPORT DEAL

The hearing turned tense at times as Republicans and Democrats sparred over Dean’s credibility. Georgia GOP Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, mocked Democrats for bringing Dean in for testimony, accusing Democrats of using him to try to attack the president. “This committee is now hearing from the Seventies and they want their star witness back,” he said.

Collins mockingly added, “Let the show begin.”

During his questioning, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan referenced how Dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice 45 years ago, dismissively saying Dean's now ""coming in to enlighten the Judiciary Committee on obstruction of justice.”

He also pointed to comments that Dean, a CNN contributor, made on-air last February suggesting that Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, needed to stay away from testifying in front of Republicans for as long as he could. In response to Jordan's question on whether he ever gave advice to Cohen or Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, Dean responded: “I have known Lanny Davis for almost, a couple decades, and we have talked about it. I did say, as soon as you turn your testimony over, it will be picked apart.” He denied giving direct advice to Cohen before the lawyer's testimony.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Jordan of casting “aspersions on the witness."" Nadler countered that Dean had been truthful during the Watergate investigation.

Later, Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz accused Dean of “making money off” through books and television appearances by referring to multiple presidents as being worse than Nixon. He then asked Dean to explain how “Democrats plan to pay for Medicare for all,” saying, “I figured if we were going to ask you about stuff you don’t know about, we’d start with the big stuff.”

Dean dismissed Gaetz's remarks. “That was a speech. I don’t believe I can respond to it.""

In opening remarks, Nadler, a New York Democrat, referred to Dean as “a critical witness for prosecutors and congressional investigators"" during Watergate and said the committee will “rely on the expertise of these witnesses to help draw our own conclusions about the findings of the Special Counsel and other evidence before us today.”

At the outset of his testimony, Dean said, ""Clearly, I am not here as a fact witness,"" adding he accepted the invitation to give historical context to the Mueller Report. Dean, who testified before the committee in 1974 during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, eventually cooperated with prosecutors, pleading guilty to obstruction.

Dean used his argument to make numerous comparisons between Watergate and the Russia probe.

In comparing Watergate to Mueller's investigation, Dean said in testimony submitted to the committee: ""In both situations, the White House Counsel was implicated in the cover-up activity.""

Dean acknowledged being “an active participant in the cover-up for a period of time” during Watergate, but said he doesn’t believe Trump’s White House counsel, Don McGahn, “participated in any illegal or improper activity.” Still, he said, there’s “no question Mr. McGahn was a critical observer of these activities,” as “there is evidence he prevented several obstruction attempts.”

Among other parallels argued by Dean: In the Russia probe, the underlying crime was the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign. In Watergate, the underlying crime was the break-in of the Democratic National Committee, he said. While Dean pointed out that the Mueller report found no evidence that Trump engaged in aconspiracy with the Russians, he also said he doesn't believe Nixon himself was involved in the actual break-in and bugging during Watergate.

""Yet events in both 1972 and 2016 resulted in obstruction of the investigations,"" Dean said.

Arguing the president attempted to obstruct justice, he compared Trump’s comments in 2017 to then-FBI director James Comey about then-national security adviser Michael Flynn to Nixon’s comments to then-chief of staff H.R. Haldeman about the Watergate burglars. He also compared Trump’s firing of Comey to Nixon’s firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in the 1973 “Saturday Night Massacre.”

And in responding to the Mueller’s report finding that Trump directed McGahn to have Mueller fired over purported conflicts of interest (something McGahn never did), Dean said, “This is much like Richard Nixon’s attempt to get me to write a phony report exonerating the White House from any involvement in Watergate…Since I had conducted no such investigation, I resisted months of repeated efforts to get me to write a bogus report.”

The hearing – which comes as House Democrats ramp up efforts to investigate the president and suggest they could move to impeach him -- is titled, “Lessons from the Mueller Report: Presidential Obstruction and Other Crimes.”

On Monday, Trump ripped into Dean. “Dean has been a loser for many years,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday.

The Republican National Committee also tore into Dean over his testimony. ""House Democrats are going to new lengths to baselessly smear President Trump,"" the RNC's Steve Guest said in a statement. ""They are hauling in a relic from the past, John Dean, who has absolutely no connection to anything having to do with the Mueller investigation.""

Dean’s testimony kicks off what could be a dramatic week related to oversight of the Russia probe: Nadler announced plans Monday to hit pause on efforts to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt over his refusal to turn over Russia probe-related documents, Democrats could still move forward on a separate contempt-related resolution this week to enforce subpoenas for Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

Separately, the Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence announced plans to hold an open hearing on Wednesday titled, “Lessons from the Mueller Report: Counterintelligence Implications of Volume 1.”

DOJ outlines to Congress its investigation of the investigators,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-outlines-to-congress-its-investigation-of-the-investigators,"The Justice Department's investigation of the investigators involved in the Trump-Russia probe will look at actions both by the U.S. government and by foreigners.

That's what the agency said Monday, telling Congress its review is “broad in scope and multifaceted” in a letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.

The DOJ said the wide-ranging inquiry led by Attorney General William Barr, along with his right-hand man U.S. Attorney John Durham, would seek to “illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals.”

The letter made it clear that DOJ’s review is not limited just to their specific agency, but would also scrutinize the intelligence community as a whole. The letter stated that the DOJ review team had already asked certain intelligence community agencies to preserve records, make witnesses available, and start putting together documents that the DOJ would need to carry out its inquiry.

And the DOJ made it clear that they weren’t just looking to see if policies were violated — they’ll be looking at whether any laws were broken, too.

In 2016, the DOJ and FBI launched an investigation into any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller took over the ongoing effort in May 2017 after FBI Director James Comey was fired, and Mueller’s probe culminated in a 448-page report in April 2019. Mueller found that the Russians had interfered in the 2016 election through cyberattacks and social media disinformation campaigns, but did not establish that anyone associated with Trump criminally colluded with Russia. Mueller left the door open on obstruction of justice by Trump, but Barr and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined that he had not.

Barr believes “there remain open questions relating to the origins of this counter-intelligence investigation and the U.S. and foreign intelligence activities that took place prior to and during that investigation,” the letter states, and the DOJ review will look at “the efficacy and propriety“ of the steps that the DOJ, the FBI, the broader U.S. intelligence community, and foreign governments and actors took before and during the course of the probe — and to answer those questions “to the satisfaction of the Attorney General.”

The letter said Barr is coordinating with members of the U.S. intelligence community and ""certain foreign actors"" on the “collaborative” and “ongoing effort.""

Trump recently gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information"" during his review, a move that has been harshly criticized by many Democrats. Nadler called the move part of a “plot to dirty up the intelligence community, to pretend that there's something wrong with the beginning of the Mueller investigation and to persecute and bring into line the intelligence agencies."" And former FBI General Counsel Jim Baker called the move a ""slap in the face"" to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.

Apparently to push back against such concerns, DOJ said Monday it would work hard to make sure that U.S. intelligence agents as well as foreign partners were protected during the probe, along with sensitive methods, techniques, and materials that could compromise national security.

This broad probe by DOJ is separate from the investigation by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI. That inquiry includes a focus on the FBI’s handling of the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele and its extensive use in the FBI's FISA applications and renewals to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Barr has previously said, however, that Horowitz’s “ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the Department [of Justice] is very limited.” Thus, Barr picked Durham to carry out a beefed-up inquiry.

Durham will continue serving as Connecticut’s U.S. attorney, the DOJ said, but his review is already “being conducted primarily in the Washington D.C. area” and his DOJ team will operate out of “existing office space.”"

Who are the House Democrats backing Trump impeachment? House Homeland Security chairman introduces bill calling for annual domestic terror reports MORE (D-Miss.) announced Monday.

Thompson’s announcement was made on the heels of the disclosure by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that a subcontractor had suffered a data breach, compromising photos of travelers and license plates compiled by the border agency.

CBP told The Hill the subcontractor that had its network breached had not been given permission to transfer CBP photos to its system. CBP has not named the subcontractor, and told The Hill that as of Monday, none of the images involved in the breach has been discovered on the darknet.

Thompson criticized CBP and the Department of Homeland Security in general for allowing the data breach to occur, saying in a statement that the privacy of Americans can’t be compromised.

“Government use of biometric and personal identifiable information can be valuable tools only if utilized properly,” Thompson said. “Unfortunately, this is the second major privacy breach at DHS this year. We must ensure we are not expanding the use of biometrics at the expense of the privacy of the American public.”

A spokesperson for Thompson told The Hill that the committee “hopes to have government witnesses” at the hearings, but had no further details on dates in July the hearings will take place."

Why former Defense Secretary Ash Carter wouldn't work for Trump,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ash-carter-former-defense-secretary-would-not-work-for-trump/,"While he previously swore he would stay outside of politics, former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter says he wouldn't work for President Trump. Carter describes the commander-in-chief and his administration in his new book ""inside the Five-Sided Box: Lessons from a Lifetime of Leadership in the Pentagon"" as ""offensive, racist and divisive.""

""It's not politics, it's personal conduct,"" Carter said on ""CBS This Morning"" on Monday. Carter explained that he used to tell officers and soldiers in the military that they ""needed to behave themselves"" and would have fired an officer for acting as the president has.

""It's not just the president, it's the kind of behavior and personal conduct that you see everywhere in Washington today is not the kind of thing we tolerated in the military. I fired people for doing that and subordinates fired people for doing even less,"" Carter said.

Carter, who first began working for the Department of Defense in 1981, said he would not work under Mr. Trump if asked because he ""wouldn't know how to help him."" The Obama-era Defense chief said Mr. Trump appears to not take the advice of his Cabinet secretaries. That lack of concern for expert opinion is exactly what led Carter's successor, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, to step down from the post in December, who cited vast differences in viewpoints with Mr. Trump as a sticking point.

""Your first duty as a Cabinet secretary is to serve the president, to help him...I couldn't take a job knowing that what I know and what I brought to the job, I wouldn't be able to apply to helping him,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Carter said the most urgent threats posed to the United States include China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and general terrorism.

""The future is more concerning to me, it's a competitive world,"" he said. ""All five of those are potential opponents are focused on us and we have to deal with all five of them and its a fast-moving world in technology, and so we need to make sure we stay competitive, because being the best, which we are, isn't a birthright, you got to keep earning it.""

He noted, however, that he was ""confident in our plans and capabilities with respect to all five of those today."""
State: Pompeo believes 'only the American flag should be flown' at embassies,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/447786-state-pompeo-believes-only-the-american-flag-should-be-flown-at,"Top State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoRouhani, German diplomat to meet in effort to preserve Iran nuclear deal Rouhani, German diplomat to meet in effort to preserve Iran nuclear deal Some US embassies fly rainbow flag despite rejected requests from Trump admin MORE believes that only the American flag should be flown at U.S. embassies, after reports emerged last week that the Trump administration rejected requests from embassies around the world to fly the rainbow Pride flag.

“Pride Month, that we’re in right now, is celebrated around the world by many State Department employees, by many embassies,” Ortagus said in a Monday press briefing at the department. “The secretary has the position that, as it relates to the flag pole, that only the American flag should be flown there.”

The U.S. embassies in at least four countries — Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia — were denied the ability to fly the flag, NBC News reported Friday. The Washington Post reported that some U.S. diplomatic offices, including in Seoul, South Korea, and Chennai, India, were still displaying rainbow flags despite the policy.

Ortagus added that embassies are permitted to hang the rainbow Pride flag or display other Pride images without violating the State Department’s directive, but flag poles should be reserved for the U.S. flag.

She also told reporters that Pompeo “respects the dignity of every individual,” reflected in the Pride celebrations taking place in U.S. embassies.

“You can do a simple, easy Google or Twitter search and see the pictures of members of embassies and ambassadors, people of the foreign service celebrating Pride throughout the world,” Ortagus said.

When asked why Pompeo did not release a statement in honor of Pride Month or the International Day Against Transphobia and Homophobia, which was on May 17, Ortagus reaffirmed Pompao’s focus on “dignity.”

“He remains committed to this effort around the world,” Ortagus said."

VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

DOJ investigating 'non-governmental organizations and individuals' as part of 'broad' probe into surveillance abuses,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/durham-investigating-non-governmental-organizations-and-individuals-potentially-including-fusion-gps,"As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""

Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, let by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services."" Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.

The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation. The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Fusion GPS, in turn, hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to produce an unverified and largely discredited dossier that the FBI went on to cite in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

CARTER PAGE: FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMUNICATIONS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED

Last week, reports indicated Steele had agreed to talk with Durham if certain preconditions were met. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, meanwhile, that Durham is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions."" Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham in Washington, D.C.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

FMR TRUMP AIDE ALLEGES BOMBSHELL INFORMANT TRIED TO 'SEDUCE' HIM IN 'BIZARRE' EPISODE FOR RUSSIA DIRT ON TRUMP

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday he has seen ""additional documents"" that demonstrate that “prior to the first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier was not credible.” Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News in March showed FBI brass scrambling to respond to a concern from a senior DOJ official about the potential ""bias"" of a key FISA source.

Meadows, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointed specifically to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Solomon, reporting for the Hill, also recently unearthed a documented conversation Steele had with a State Department contact -- which were relayed to the FBI -- in which Steele claimed the Russians were running a “technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and that ""payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.""

There is no Russian consulate in Miami, a fact the State Department official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, emphasized in her notes. Additionally, Steele had suggested his client was ""keen"" to see his information come to light prior to Election Day. Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI and other government officials several days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page. Fox News has confirmed The Hill's reporting.

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' MICHAEL FLYNN

Further, in its original FISA application and subequent renewals, the FBI told the FISA court that it ""did not believe"" Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion. Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the dossier.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

Carter Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing, even though the FBI called him an ""agent of a foreign power"" in its October 2016 FISA application. On Sunday, Page told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that his actions had been ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

"Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says the bond market is telegraphing a Fed rate cut, not a recession",https://www.cnbc.com,['Michael Sheetz'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/mnuchin-bond-market-telegraphing-a-fed-rate-cut-not-a-recession.html,"Investors have been warning that the bond market is indicating a deteriorating economic outlook, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disputed that interpretation in CNBC interview.

Mnuchin believes that falling bond yields, rather than warning of a recession, are indicating that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months. Bond yields fell to 20-month lows last week after government data showed U.S. job creation slowed more than expected in May.

""I would say that the bond markets are predicting ... a lowering of interest rates,"" Mnuchin said in an interview Sunday on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia. ""

Mnuchin noted that he did not intend to comment on whether interest rates should be lowered, saying that he wants ""to respect"" the independence of the Federal Reserve. Mnuchin meets weekly with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. On Monday, President Donald Trump told CNBC the Fed made a mistake raising rates in December and is ""very disrputive"" to the economy.

Investor expectations of a June rate cut from the Fed rose last week to 27.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The market gives July a 79% chance of a Fed rate cut.

Mnuchin said the global economy is now in an environment where ""interest rates are very low around the world,"" which is what investors are ""seeing in the U.S. bond markets."" But the Treasury sees ""no signs of a recession"" in the U.S. economy, Mnuchin said, even as his department is ""somewhat concerned about what we see as a slowdown in Europe, China and other areas of the world.""

""We still see the growth in the U.S. as really quite strong,"" Mnuchin added."
Lawmakers try to save DHS lab that prepares first responders for terror threats,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/dhs-lab-first-responders-funding-house/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers are again attempting to keep a Department of Homeland Security laboratory that specializes in first-responder technology and assistance from shutting its doors.

The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Monday evening that would permanently authorize the New York City-based National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, which has been at risk of losing funding over the past couple of years and was not included in the administration's latest DHS funding request.

The lab ""is constantly developing and testing new tools for our brave first responders to use in the event of a terrorist attack, industrial accident or natural disaster and closely collaborates with law enforcement agencies like the FDNY, NYPD and the Nassau County Police Department in my district,"" Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who cosponsored the bill, said Monday on the House floor, urging her colleagues to pass the legislation. The final vote was 395-3.

She said the administration has proposed closing the lab in each of the last two federal budgets.

The potential funding cut comes amid budget battles between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill, as the administration has shifted its funding and influence to the department's immigration missions.

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

Citing Barr's refusal, House Democrats proposed giving congressional investigators the power to ""“to initiate or intervene in any judicial proceeding before a Federal Court."" Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, D-Mass., whose committee would take up the resolution, vowed to hold the administration accountable.

“We will not allow this president and his administration to turn a blind eye to the rule of law,"" he said."
"USDA Report Corn, Soybean Yield Preview",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-report-yield-preview,"Market attention continues to focus on the potential size of the U.S. corn and soybean crops.

Acreage totals look to remain uncertain for the rest of the year and any adjustments in the next WASDE report may not reflect the changes facing both crops this year.

U.S. average yields appear set to move lower in Tuesday’s WASDE report as severe delays in planting indicate reduced yield potential.

Expectations for the U.S. average corn and soybean yields this year continue to deteriorate over recent weeks, as planting delays dragged on over much of the Corn Belt. In particular, states in the eastern Corn Belt dealt with extreme moisture and massive delays this year.

Yield potential falls for corn planted after the second or third weeks of May, all other conditions equal. Even though progress accelerated last week on drier weather, corn planting after May 25 came in at a higher-than-average percentage.

Based on the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress report, an estimated 51% of the corn acreage in the 18 major corn-producing states went in the ground after May 25, compared with the average of 16.8% from 1986 through 2018. Typically, late-planted acres remain isolated in specific areas of the country. While most of the very late planting this year occurred in eastern corn-producing states, a substantial amount of late-planted acreage occurred in almost every Corn Belt state.

The USDA’s weekly ratings of corn conditions, due out this week in the Crop Conditions report, should provide an initial indication of the 2019 crop. This conditions report is setting up to be one of the worst on record. Data available since 1986 indicate that as of the 23rd week of the year (June 9 this year), an average of 67% of the crop rated in good or excellent condition at the end of the 23rd week (excluding 1995 when ratings were not yet available due to extremely late planting). The five worst years for good and excellent ratings (excluding 1995) were 1992 (42%), 1988 (47%), 1996 (50%), 1990 (52%), and 1993 (57%). Late-planted corn acreage including 1995 came in well-above average in each of these years except for 1992 and 1988.

Crop Yield History

Crop condition ratings usually fall as the growing season progresses. Early season ratings do not supply an unbiased indication of the final U.S. average yield. Even so, the upcoming rating, along with severe planting conditions, should keep yield expectations low. If one includes 1995 with the five years mentioned above with the worst good and excellent ratings, the U.S. average corn yield came in above trend in only 1992 (+11 bushels) and 1990 (+2 bushels). The average yield over all six years totaled 9 bushels below trend. While the upcoming WASDE report may not fade the corn yield very much, an expectation this year for corn yield at or below trend appears reasonable.

Soybean Yield History

Soybean planting lagged well behind average pace this year as well. As of the June 3 Crop Progress report, 39% of the crop in the 18 major soybean producing states was planted. An expectation of substantial planting progress over the next few weeks is in place.

Based on the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress report, an estimated 72% of the soybean acreage in the 18 major soybean-producing states went in the ground after May 25. This amount sits well above the average from 1986 through 2018 of 39.2%. Field trials in Illinois indicate yield losses higher than 10% after May 20 with increasing levels as planting moves into June. Planting after June 10 led to almost a 20% loss expectation for soybean yields.

While this seems drastic, actual national data on soybean yields rarely falls outside a range of 3 bushels from trend (see farmdoc daily article for more details). Due to the later planting of soybeans this year, the first crop condition rating for soybeans looks to be out in the next two weeks depending on the percentage of the crop emerged.

Crop condition ratings for soybeans tend to decline more than corn as the growing season advances. Like corn, early season ratings do not provide a reliable indicator of the final U.S. average yield.

Lower yield expectations for corn and soybeans seem plausible. By factoring in late planting, a conservative yield estimate for corn near 170 bushels per acre, 4.5 bushels below the current USDA projection, appears reasonable. Uncertainty regarding acreage levels for corn will linger, but acreage reduction in the 7 to 12 million acres range produces a corn crop 1.7 to 2.2 billion bushels smaller than currently projected by the USDA.

For soybeans, an average yield of 47.8 bushels, which sits 1.7 bushels lower than the current USDA projection, fits current conditions. If one assumes 2 million additional soybean acres due to switching, soybean production comes in 150 million bushels lower than forecast by the USDA.

The June 11 WASDE report should provide the first indication from USDA about the size of both crops this year. The June 28 Acreage report will be the next major indicator.

Plan to Reclassify Radioactive Nuclear Waste Spurs Anger,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-06-10/energy-department-plan-to-reclassify-radioactive-nuclear-waste-spurs-anger,"A welcome sign outside the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, May 10, 2017, in Richland, Wash. (Young Kwak/The Washington Post/Getty Images)

A Department of Energy plan to reclassify some of the country's radioactive waste to lesser threat levels in order to save time and money is angering environmental groups and raising questions among experts.

Last week, the Energy Department put into place its new interpretation for high-level radioactive waste, saying that the updated definition will allow the agency to more easily move less hazardous waste from old nuclear weapons facilities where it has languished without a permanent disposal solution.

The agency's previous classification efforts managed hazardous waste based on how it was produced instead of its radioactivity. For example, the use of uranium fuel in a nuclear reactor produces high-level radioactive waste. Classifications for the waste determine disposal methods, which can vary in things like how deeply such material is buried in the ground or how thick the protective material in which it is encased.

The Energy Department said its past approach cost billions of dollars and led to decades of delays.

""Recognizing this failure, this Administration is proposing a responsible, results-driven solution that will finally open potential avenues for the safe treatment and removal of the lower level waste currently housed in three states,"" the Energy Department's Undersecretary for Science Paul Dabbar said.

By changing the process to allow for some high-level radioactive waste to be categorized as low-level, the agency said it will be able to start moving waste that has been trapped in Energy Department facilities in Washington state, South Carolina and Idaho.

Management of high-level radioactive waste has effectively been at a standstill as Nevada's Yucca Mountain, which houses a deep geological repository storage facility, awaits proper licensing.

Yucca Mountain has suffered from ""technical and political disagreement"" for decades, says Rod Ewing, a professor in nuclear security at Stanford University.

""There's an understandable pressure to do something with at least some of the waste,"" Ewing says.

Under the proposal, waste newly deemed less harmful that is currently housed at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina and the Idaho National Laboratory could be removed for disposal.

But the National Resources Defense Council says reclassifying the waste is akin to the Energy Department giving itself the authority to declare victory and abandon cleanup at these sites.

""The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic and radioactive waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,"" Geoff Fettus, a senior attorney at the environmental group, said in a statement. ""No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.""

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said he would not stop state efforts to clean up the Hanford site to a higher standard and challenged the legality of the federal change.

""By taking this action, the administration seeks to cut out state input and move towards disposal options of their choosing, including those already deemed to be unsafe by their own assessments and in violation of the existing legally binding agreement,"" he said. ""We will consider all options to stop this reckless and dangerous action.""

Experts agreed that reclassification is a valid issue for the Energy Department to examine but had questions about the agency's process.

""In principle, it does make sense to try to tie these definitions more closely to hazards,"" says Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. However, the agency ""would have to do a much more rigorous job defining their methodology,"" he says.

Determining the class of radioactive waste involves assessments that can be ""highly controversial,"" Ewing says.

The assessment process can allow for some leeway, which ""opens the door for monkey business,"" Lyman says.

The Energy Department paired its announcement with a notice that the agency is starting an environmental impact analysis for an alternative disposal method for low-level radioactive waste at the Savannah River Site.

Tom Clements, the director of non-profit public interest group Savannah River Site Watch, pushed back against the agency's move."
Battle over science roils EPA,https://thehill.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447520-battle-over-science-roils-epa,"Environmental Protection Agency is battling its own board of science advisers over its controversial plan to dismiss certain types of scientific research from consideration when issuing rules.

A meeting this week between the agency and some of the nation’s top scientists highlighted the growing rift between the EPA and the scientific community, with members of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) pushing back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public.

Critics say the move would omit important research from EPA consideration and lead to a dramatic rollback of existing regulations.

ADVERTISEMENT

The SAB, a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, have been asking to weigh in on the controversial proposal since it was unveiled more than a year ago.

On Wednesday, it said it would do so —despite a request from the agency to review a narrow portion of the rule.

There’s mistrust between the scientific community and EPA’s leaders in the Trump administration.

Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittBattle over science roils EPA EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage MORE said the proposal, called Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would battle “secret science” when it was first introduced. That spurred scientists to call the proposal “censored science.”

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerBattle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T MORE on Wednesday appeared before the board, vowing to improve the relationship between it and the agency.

“I’ll be the first to admit that we have not utilized you in ways that we should. We can and we will do better,” Wheeler said.

But many in the science and environmental community walked away from the meeting disheartened at what they see is the agency’s plan to amplify pet policies and the voices of industry over those from scientists.

“I would say the way that the meeting proceeded kind of contradicted a lot of Administrator Wheeler’s statement at the beginning of the meeting,” said Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Their discussion showed that EPA has not really involved the Science Advisory Board and gotten their advice on several of the deregulatory actions they’ve proposed.”

Scientists have had a number of concerns over how the Trump administration values science, but things really came to a head when the EPA announced the science transparency rule without first consulting the SAB.

The group didn’t find out about the rule until it was publicly announced — a sign, scientists and environmentalists say, the EPA was not interested in meaningful feedback.

The proposal has since proven to be one of the most controversial EPA has written, prompting 600,000 comments. Critics say the rule will exclude some of the most important research from consideration simply because it does not rely on data that can be shared publicly.

The board sent a letter in May of 2018 with a number of questions and asking to weigh in on the rule but it took almost 11 months before the agency responded in April of this year.

Wheeler apologized for the delay Wednesday, saying it was the result of the agency taking time to rethink how it wants to work with the board going forward.

He asked the board to give its thoughts on how the agency can deal with studies that don’t make their data public because it includes confidential business information or personally identifiable information.

The board bucked that request and instead voted to review the proposal in its entirety.

“I’m wondering if any of the comments the EPA received gave you pause about proceeding with that rule?” asked Barbara Morrissey, chair of a separate EPA panel, the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee.

“I agree the confidentiality issue in an important and a thorny one so I’m glad that you referred that to us, but I’m concerned about whether the best available science can be ignored because it can’t be replicated for obvious reasons,” she said, nodding to studies of people who were exposed to harmful chemicals.

Watchers of the board were surprised by the vote given how the makeup of the board has changed under the Trump administration.

Fears that the EPA planned to sideline scientists started under Pruitt when he announced that scientists who receive grants from the EPA would not be allowed to serve on the board—a move that knocked out about half of the members sitting on the Science Advisory Board.

Reed with the Union of Concerned Scientists said there are pretty much two types of grants available to scientists—those from the EPA and those from industry. She didn’t understand why getting an EPA grant would present a conflict of interest when an industry grant wouldn’t.

“People who received these no strings attached grants and are experts on some of the most pressing environmental issues are kept from serving on the board,” she said. “It’s clearly a political maneuver to change the composition of these advisory committees.”

Twenty six of the 45 current board members were appointed during the Trump Administration, a huge amount of turnover in a board that otherwise loses under a fifth of its members each year due to term limits.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” Chris Zarba, who served as the former staff coordinators for SAB until last year, said of the vote to review the entire science transparency rule. It’s not that the Trump administration picks aren’t qualified, he said, but a good board needs diversity.

“Think of it this way. If I was picking a world class football team, and I only picked people that were world class, top-ranked players — if all those people I picked were field goal kickers, I’d never win a game,” he said. “It’s hard to question any single member on the board, and by law the administrator can pick anyone they want and any member that is qualified, but the bigger question is: is the entire team well equipped and accurately representing mainstream science? I think we will see how it turns out...There are certainly picks I wouldn't have recommended to the administrator.”

Robert Phalen is one Trump administration pick that has been questioned by scientists for views of air pollution that are out of line with most mainstream scientists. The University of California Irvine professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.""

Phalen was one of the few at the meeting to vote against reviewing the science transparency rule in its entirety.

“I can see and respect both sides of the debate on transparency,” he told The Hill in an email. “We need to know if the research used for regulations is free of serious errors, and that requires other scientists having access to the data. On the other hand if the data were widely available it could be improperly used, such as for disclosing private information. So both sides have validity.”

Wheeler said the agency will move forward with something, assuring the board that the administrator will always have the power to give an exemption to an important study, even if it can’t disclose all its data.

“I do fundamentally believe the more information we put out to the public as far as what is the basis for our regulatory decisions, the more sound our decision will be and the more easily understood and accepted by the public our decision will be because they see all the science we are using,” he told the board."

According to police, officers conducted a welfare check at the couple's home in Northwest D.C. on Friday. When they arrived they found a man, identified as 51-year-old Jason Rieff, with a handgun who appeared to fire a self-inflicted shot while they were on the scene. Authorities said they also found an unresponsive adult female identified as 45-year-old Lola Gulomova.

DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan announced the move in an email to agency staff Monday, though the mechanics of whether it would include an official nomination were not immediately clear.

In any event, Cuccinelli, head of the Senate Conservatives Fund and a former Virginia attorney general, is expected to take over at least on an interim basis at USCIS, which is responsible for the administration of legal immigration, including dealing with asylum claims, issuing green cards and handling the naturalization process.

He'll do so at a time when there is a backlog of roughly 700,000 people seeking asylum in the U.S., tens of thousands more are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border each month and the Trump administration is seeking to rewrite the rules for legal immigration.

Because of the rancorous relationship between his Senate Conservatives Fund and some GOP lawmakers, Cuccinelli would be expected to have a difficult time winning confirmation to a permanent post in the Trump administration.

""He's spent a fair amount of his career attacking Republicans in the Senate, so it strikes me as an odd position for him to put himself in to seek Senate confirmation,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told Politico last week. ""It's unlikely he's going to be confirmed if he is nominated.""

Though Cuccinelli was a one-time critic of Trump broadly — he threw his credentials on the ground in protest at the GOP convention in 2016 — he is seen as more of a hard-liner than his predecessor, Francis Cissna, who clashed with White House officials over various Trump administration policy proposals.

Cuccinelli is well-known in political circles for his social conservatism. During a failed bid for governor, he said homosexual acts are ""against nature and are harmful to society.""

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the appointment.

The exact scope of the material the Justice Department has agreed to turn over was not immediately clear.

""These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the president by the special counsel,"" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the committee chairman, said in a statement.

Nadler said he expected the department to begin sharing some of the material later Monday and noted that all members of the panel would be able to view the documents privately.

The development marks an unexpected breakthrough in the negotiations between the House Judiciary Committee and the White House over access to evidence obtained by Mueller throughout his nearly two-year investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 election, alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow and whether the president obstructed justice.

Discussions between the Trump administration and the House Judiciary panel appeared to come to a halt last month after the committee voted along party lines to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena to turn over Mueller's full report and underlying evidence — material which members of the House Judiciary Committee said they need to conduct an obstruction of justice investigation into the president. Trump also asserted executive privilege over Mueller's findings on the attorney general's recommendation.

Nadler's announcement comes a day before the House is scheduled to vote on a resolution on whether to hold Barr and White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas related to Mueller's report. He said Monday that he would ""hold the criminal contempt proceedings in abeyance for now.""

If the Justice Department, Nadler added that ""proceeds in good faith, and we are able to obtain everything that we need, then there will be no need to take further steps."" But, if important information is held back, he said, ""we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.""

Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, praised the Justice Department for turning over the documents, which he said ""debunks"" claims the White House is stalling Congress in their oversight efforts.

""The Justice Department has yet again offered accommodations to House Democrats, and I am glad Chairman Nadler — for the first time in months — has finally met them at the negotiating table,"" Collins said in a statement. ""In light of today's agreement from the Justice Department, it's logical to ask: Is the chairman prepared to rescind his baseless recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt, or do House Democrats still plan to green-light lawsuits against the attorney general and former White House counsel tomorrow?"""
"Daily on Defense: HASC chairman lays down his mark, Republicans cry foul, US-Turkey alliance unwinds over F-35, United Technology and Raytheon join forces",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/house-committee-members-deeply-divided-on-presidents-pentagon-budget-request,"OFF THE MARK: House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is drawing clear battle lines with President Trump’s proposed defense budget and its Republican backers in Congress with his “Chairman’s Mark” of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, released early this morning.

The plan proposed by the House committee controlled by Democrats would trim Trump’s $750 billion request to $733 billion, eliminate funding for low-yield nuclear weapons, bar the use of military construction funds for border barriers, prohibit Trump from pulling U.S. troops out of South Korea or send more prisoners to Guantanamo. Nor would it support a separate Space Force, a top priority for the president.

The plan not only conflicts with the administration’s Pentagon proposal but also the Senate version of the NDAA. That plan, passed with little fanfare by the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, enjoyed bipartisan support.

BY THE NUMBERS: Here’s the House FY 2020 proposal:



Department of Defense base: $632.9 billion

Department of Energy base: $22.6 billion

Other defense-related activities: $0.3 billion

Defense topline: $655.9 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $69 billion

Defense topline: $724.9 billion

Authorizations outside of HASC jurisdiction: $8.2 billion

Total defense authorization: $733 billion

For comparison here are the Senate numbers from two weeks ago:



Department of Defense base: $642.5 billion

Department of Energy base: $23.2 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $75.9 billion

Defense topline: $741.5 billion

Other defense: $8.4 billion

Total defense authorization: $750 billion



BORDER RESTRICTIONS: House Democrats, who have been fuming about President’s Trump’s legal use of emergency powers to divert military construction funds for his border wall, want to specifically bar the practice in the future.

The House NDAA includes a blanket prohibition on the use of DoD, military construction or counter-drug funds to build a “wall, fence, or physical barrier” along the southern border. It also specifically denies $7.2 billion in funding that the Trump administration planned to pay back to the construction fund to make up for the money shifted to border barriers this year.

DEEP PARTISAN DIVIDE: The ranking member on the committee, former chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, weighed in with his objections, noting the move away from what he called the traditional “broad bipartisan support” the NDAA usually enjoys. “There are a number of provisions in the bill that meet that standard,” he said. “There are others that are troubling.”

What troubles Thornberry:



The $17 billion cut from Trump’s budget, which he says doesn’t provide the 3%-5% in real growth to continue readiness restoration

No Space Force, despite bipartisan support on the committee

A $1.2 billion cut in military personnel funds, which he says will hurt service members and their families

Nuclear weapons restrictions. “In addition to prohibiting the deployment of new low-yield weapons, the Chairman’s Mark weakens our deterrent posture against Russia and China and defers essential safety upgrades,” Thornberry says.

A $2.3 billion shortfall in disaster relief funds for Offutt and Tyndall Air Force bases and Marine Corps bases at Cherry Point Camp Lejeune.

Guantanamo restrictions he argues “will ultimately lead to the transfer of current detainees to the U.S.”

Too many reports. The NDAA imposes 240 new reporting requirements, a 34% increase over last year.

The differences will ultimately have to be hammered out in a conference committee.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED? The U.S.-Turkey alliance is being strained to the breaking point over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s insistence that he should be able to buy both U.S. F-35s and Russian S-400 air defenses.

Friday the U.S. restated its position after learning Turkey had sent personnel to Russia for training on the S-400 system. “The S-400 is incompatible with the F-35,” said Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment at Pentagon briefing. “Turkey will not receive the F-35 if Turkey takes delivery of the S-400 system. Thus, we need to begin unwinding Turkey's participation in the F-35 program.”

Lord said Turkey would be disinvited from future program management activities, and she set a deadline of the end of next month for Turkey to capitulate to U.S. demands or be booted from the F-35 program. “If the United States and Turkey cannot reach a mutually agreeable resolution to this issue by July 31, all Turkish F-35 students and instructor pilots currently in the United States will be required to depart the country,” she said. “Turkey will receive no new workshare in the F-35 program. Its current workshare will be transitioned to alternate sources.”

But at the same time, Lord said the U.S. “greatly values,” the “strategic partnership,” with Turkey and is “trying to be respectful,” with the long-time NATO ally. ““None of the steps we are taking are irreversible. If Turkey chooses to forgo delivery of the S-400, we look forward to restoring normal program activity,” she said.

‘A MERGER OF EQUALS’: Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corp announced Sunday they agreed to an all-stock merger that it called “a merger or equals.”

The combined company, which will be named Raytheon Technologies Corporation, will have approximately $74 billion is 2019 sales, which would make it the second-largest defense and aerospace company in the U.S. after Boeing.

“The transaction will create a premier systems provider with advanced technologies to address rapidly growing segments within aerospace and defense,” said a release from the two companies. More on the merger from the Associated Press here.

‘WE’LL DÉMARCHE THEM’: On Friday, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan called actions of the Russian navy “unsafe and unprofessional,” and said the U.S. would file a formal protest after a Russian destroyer nearly collided with the U.S. guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville in international waters in the Philippine Sea.

""We’ll have military-to-military conversations with the Russians, and of course we'll démarche them,” Shanahan said in a brief exchange with reporters at the Pentagon.

The Navy released video Friday of the encounter showing the Russian warship coming within 50 to 100 feet of the American ship, forcing it to reverse its engine to avoid contact with the Russian vessel.

The Navy’s top admiral, John Richardson, chief of naval operations, also released a statement condemning the Russian actions as “irresponsible and reckless.”

""This unwise maneuver, combined with the unsafe maneuvers by the Russian aircraft in the eastern Mediterranean earlier this week, make it clear that these dangerous actions by Russian military forces across the globe do not match what the world expects from a responsible and trustworthy world power,” Richardson said. “The U.S. Navy will not be deterred from supporting the free and open use of the seas and skies where international law clearly allows all to operate.”

55 SYRIAN HOSPITALS BOMBED: The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organization says the Russian-backed air campaign of Syrian leader Bashar Assad against opposition forces in northern Syria has devastated the regions hospital system, causing widespread misery among the civilian population.

“The entire medical system of Northern Hama and Southern Idlib, Syria, is in a state of emergency, with 55 medical facilities shut down after a month of continuous bombing,” said the humanitarian group in a statement. “Since April 28, 25 medical facilities have been bombed, with some hospitals hit by airstrikes on multiple days. “

“In a region of Southern Idlib, only one hospital is left serving a population of over 500,000. The use of phosphorous (incendiary weapons) and barrel bombs in addition to airstrikes has created an apocalyptic landscape for civilians,” the statement continues. “UOSSM staff on the ground in conjunction with local health directorates report 347 civilians have been killed (including at least 75 children), over 1,000 have been injured and 400,000 IDPs displaced by bombardment on civilian areas.”

RECRUITING BY TWITTER: The RAND Corporation is out with a new report that finds while the Army’s @GoArmy’s Twitter feed helps build awareness of Army culture, it’s not so great at convincing young people to join up.

The report, “Social Media and the Army: Implications for Outreach and Recruiting,” analyzes social media and the Army web presence to see if and how potential recruits and others are engaging.

RAND found that GoArmy.com visitors are interested in career information and the site is used more intensively in densely populated areas and in immigrant and ethnic communities.

It called @GoArmy’s Twitter feed “a good source for building awareness of Army culture,” but concluded the platform appears to be less effective at producing recruits.

And it said GoArmy’s Facebook page “has an audience made up of the general public, soldiers, veterans, military families and potential recruits – and has substantial potential for creating a positive image of an Army career for precisely the people who are in a position to influence recruits.”

ARCTIC STRATEGY: The Pentagon has released updated Arctic Strategy in a report sent to Congress last week. The mission statement says the desired end-state for the Arctic is “a secure and stable region in which U.S. national security interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is defended, and nations work cooperatively to address shared challenges.”

The strategy outlines three objectives:



Building Arctic awareness

Enhancing Arctic operations

Strengthening the rules-based order in the Arctic

NO CASUATIES IN NIGER BOMBING: A U.S. military vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Niger while on the way to a training exercise Saturday, but the U.S. Africa Command says all of the soldiers inside survived the attack.

“There are no reported U.S. casualties, however, as a precaution, U.S. service members are being evaluated,” AFRICOM said in a statement.

The U.S. troops were riding in a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle when it triggered an improvised explosive device while entering a firing range in the vicinity of Ouallam, Niger.

U.S. forces are in the north-central African country assisting Nigerien troops in their fight against violent extremist groups like Boko Haram.

CADET IDENTIFIED: West Point has identified the cadet killed in last Thursday’s military vehicle accident. ""Cadet Christopher J. Morgan, Class of 2020, died due to injuries sustained from a military vehicle accident in the U.S. Military Academy’s training area,"" the school said in a press release.

Morgan, 22, of West Orange, N.J., was a Law and Legal Studies major and was part of the Army Wrestling Team.

""Cadet Morgan was a valued member of the Corps of Cadets and will be missed by all. The entire community is ensuring that our cadets are being cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually,” Superintendent Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Morgan family.”

EPA issues guidance critics say would limit state's authorities over pipeline projects,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447782-states-have-shut-down-pipeline-projects-epa-seeks-to-change-that,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a guidance Friday that critics say seeks to limit states’ influence over controversial pipeline projects.

Federal law through the Clean Water Act essentially gives states veto power over large projects that cut through their rivers and streams if they believe those projects would negatively impact their water quality.

Spurred by an

April executive order

“This seems to be another attempt by the Trump Administration to limit states, and by extension local communities, ability to protect their own waterways and to give pipeline developers or other project proponents an ability to skip over one of the steps in the process that had been there to protect local waterways,” said Nathan Matthews, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups weighing action against the EPA.

The Clean Water Act gives states a year to weigh permits and determine how projects would impact their water, but some feel states have used the process to block major projects.

“I welcome this announcement and hope EPA’s new guidance will reduce abuse of the Clean Water Act to block infrastructure needed to provide reliable and affordable energy,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA EPA issues guidance critics say would limit state's authorities over pipeline projects MORE (R-Alaska) said of the guidance in a press release. “EPA’s updated guidance will maintain vital protections for our water resources while promoting responsible development of our energy resources.”

The EPA said states should not take more time than is reasonable to review permits, encouraging them to “promptly begin evaluating the request to ensure timely action.”



The guidance says the timeline for reviewing the permits begins as soon as they are filed, and states should not wait for an environmental assessment to be completed as that may take longer than the year states are granted. The guidance also notes that the clock doesn’t stop because states have requested more information.



States have recently sidelined two large projects using the certification process through the Clean Water Act, actions that contradict the energy dominance strategy promoted by the Trump administration.

New York denied a certification for the Constitution Pipeline, a 124-mile natural gas pipeline that would have run from Pennsylvania to New York, crossing rivers more than 200 times. Washington state denied certification for the Millennium Coal Terminal, a shipping port for large stocks of coal.

“The Trump Administration’s attempt to attack our state’s right to protect the health and well-being of our residents, without any consultation with states or tribal governments, is wrong,” Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement to The Hill. “It will undermine four decades of state and federal cooperation in environmental stewardship.”

But even states with more conservative leadership have spoken out for maintaining states rights under the law.

“We urge you to direct federal agencies to reject any changes to agency rules, guidance, or policy that may diminish, impair, or subordinate states’ well-established sovereign and statutory authorities to protect water quality within their boundaries,” the Western Governors’ Association wrote in a January letter when the White House was still weighing an executive order.

Matthews said states are likely to have trouble getting the information they need in order to meet the timelines. The lengthy environmental assessment process means pipeline routes or construction plans might change long after they’ve applied for permission from the state. Trying to force states to approve a project before they have that information could backfire, he said.

“States cannot make a decision about whether a project will or won’t comply with state water quality standards until they know where and what rivers it will be crossing,” Matthews said. “If they encourage or later require states to make these decisions before all the information is available, states are going to have to deny these applications without prejudice and encourage them to reapply which could slow everything down rather than speed it up.”

Industry groups voiced support for the EPA guidance, arguing it helped restore the balance between the state and federal government.

“The balance between those roles has been disrupted and some states have viewed Section 401 as means of determining which interstate pipeline projects are in the public interest and which are not,” Don Santa, president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said in a release, referring to the specific portion of the law creating the state certification process.

Environmentalists say they are still weighing what response to take to the guidance, though some say they are more concerned about the coming regulations on the same topic that were also spurred by Trump’s executive order.

“I would say there are several alarming suggestions in this guidance that if taken to their extreme could be very problematic as they play out,” said Moneen Nasmith, an attorney with EarthJustice. “There are a number of places that provide the suggestion that EPA could weigh in in places within the state decisionmaking process that it has never participated in before and doesn’t have the authority to do now.”

She’s concerned the EPA may try to weigh in on what reasons states can give to deny a certification or try to define water quality issues more narrowly, blocking states from weighing certain aspects of projects. Both are things she said EPA is not legally allowed to do.

“I’m worried that in the guidance EPA seems to be contemplating having that kind of role,” she said."

U.S. government debt yields rose Monday after President Donald Trump said U.S. tariffs on goods from Mexico would be suspended.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Sunday that proposed tariffs on Mexican imports would be suspended indefinitely. Trump said in a Twitter post Sunday that he has ""full confidence"" that Mexico will crack down on migration from Central America, after the two neighbors reached a consensus. The New York Times reported Saturday that the deal to avert tariffs largely comprised actions Mexico had already agreed to take.

Meanwhile, investors will be watching trade developments between the U.S. and China ahead of a key meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Speaking to CNBC on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Trump will decide about further Chinese tariffs after he meets his Chinese counterpart later this month."
Congress Clashes With Justice Department Over Its Decisions Not To Defend Laws,https://www.npr.org,['Carrie Johnson'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/07/730722220/congress-clashes-with-justice-department-over-its-decisions-not-to-defend-laws,"Congress Clashes With Justice Department Over Its Decisions Not To Defend Laws

Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP

Lawyers for the House of Representatives are pushing back on the Justice Department's decision to walk away from a statute barring female genital mutilation — and an unusual argument that lawmakers shouldn't intervene to defend the interests of Congress in the case.

The fight is unfolding over the first federal criminal prosecution for female genital mutilation.

Last year, a judge in Michigan threw out charges against several women who had their daughters circumcised. The Justice Department notified Congress it would not appeal that decision because of constitutional considerations.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote to Congress in April to say female genital mutilation should be ""universally condemned"" but that DOJ had ""reluctantly determined"" it lacked a ""reasonable defense"" of the law following Supreme Court rulings in other cases.

In stepped the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center, which is working with Congress to mount a defense of the statute. The lawyers argued Congress has an interest in the enforcement and defense of the laws it has passed.

The ICAP lawyers were surprised, though, to face opposition from the Justice Department, which only once before has opposed moves by the House and Senate to weigh in on legal disputes.

""It's deeply concerning to see the Justice Department abandoning its defense of this important federal law,"" said Joshua Geltzer, the executive director of ICAP.

""It's further concerning to see the department resisting even the effort by the House of Representatives to offer its own defense of the law it helped to enact. The court should reject the department's effort and at a minimum hear the House's arguments in defense of the statute.""

ICAP is arguing that it wants to weigh in to support the law — which made it a crime to ""knowingly"" circumcise young women who have not yet reached the age of 18 — not to try to force the Justice Department to proceed with a criminal prosecution.

Four of the eight people who were originally charged in Michigan face other criminal allegations, including obstruction of justice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that half a million women and girls inside the U.S. have suffered genital mutilation or are at risk in the future.

Congress outlawed it, but the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs earlier this year asked Congress to amend that existing law to make clear that it applies to travel between states and when payments or offers are made in connection with the circumcision.

The issue is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which covers territory that includes Michigan.

DOJ distance from Congress

DOJ's position in the female genital mutilation case followed closely behind its refusal to defend President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy legislation, the Affordable Care Act.

In practice, the Justice Department routinely defends legislation passed by Congress so long as there are reasonable arguments that are lawful.

Attorney General William Barr and lawyers inside the White House opposed the decision to walk away from the defense of the health care law, but they were overruled by President Trump.

Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail have criticized that move. But Barr appeared unbothered about their concerns in testimony earlier this year — if the law is sound, they shouldn't be bothered, he said.

""You say that administration's position is hokey and then you say the sky is falling?"" the attorney general said. ""If this was such a hokey position to take, what are you worried about?"""
State Dept. denies embassies’ requests to fly rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-denies-embassies-requests-fly-rainbow-pride/story?id=63566900,"The State Department has denied multiple U.S. diplomatic posts' requests to fly the rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles during LGBT Pride Month, according to two State Department sources.

The decision is the latest in a string of moves by the agency under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tenure that LGBT rights activists say discriminate against the community.

Among the U.S. missions overseas that were denied are Brazil, Germany, Israel, and Latvia, one source told ABC News.

The denials fly in the face of the spirit of President Donald Trump's stated push to launch ""a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality."" While the president tweeted last Friday that the White House would ""celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation"" -– making him the first Republican president to do so – his administration has not proclaimed June as LGBT Pride Month.

Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images, FILE

Pride flags can be displayed elsewhere on a U.S. mission's grounds, but not the official flagpole, according to department guidance distributed in May. Flying any special flag on the official flagpole at a US diplomatic post overseas requires special permission, per the department's Foreign Affairs Manual.

The denial to the U.S. embassy in Germany is particularly striking since Trump's envoy to Berlin is Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the administration.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News, which was first to report on the denials.

In 2016, the Obama administration granted ""blanket written authorization from the Under Secretary for Management to display the pride flag on the external-facing flagpole"" during June, according to a cable sent at the time. But that permission was rescinded under the Trump administration, and individual posts had to request permission to fly the pride flag.

In previous years, an official cable was sent from Washington with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

But this year, Pompeo did not approve the cable and instead, the department sent guidance to posts via email that noted it would not transmit an [an official cable for and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia] and LGBT Pride Month this year.""

That meant embassies and consulates could still mark both with whatever actions they wanted. But they were not given encouragement as in years past to engage in outreach with local LGBT communities, and they had to again get permission to fly the Pride flag on the official flagpole.

This time, those requests were denied, the sources said. The State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

LGBT rights activists expressed concern last week after news broke that the State Department was planning to convene a new commission on human rights that was based on ""natural law"" -- often taken to mean a religiously-based interpretation that excludes LGBT rights.

The author of the commission's concept paper is Robert George, a prominent anti-LGBT academic who created the National Organization for Marriage, a source told ABC News.

The department has also come under fire from Congress for a policy that does not automatically grant birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens' children who are born abroad through assisted reproductive technology, which lawmakers say indiscriminately affects gay and lesbian couples.

Under State Department policy, children born overseas must be the biological child of a U.S. citizen to receive citizenship at birth. But citizenship will not be granted to the child if it is born through in vitro fertilization and surrogacy and the genetic parent is not a U.S. citizen, even if the couple is legally married.

In several cases, the children of same-sex couples have had their citizenship denied or delayed even though at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. The State Department is currently fighting lawsuits from two couples on this issue.

Nearly 20 Democratic senators and 80 House members signed two letters to Pompeo Thursday demanding he reverse the policy."

Police said they also found Jason Rieff, 51, Gulomova’s husband, with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the home.

The couple has two children, who were not at home at the time of the incident, which police said occurred shortly after 9 a.m. Friday.

Gulomova had been employed with the Department of Commerce for more than a decade, having taken diplomatic posts in various locations throughout Asia."

Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R) started in his new role as acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) today. http://bit.ly/2ZlsSpF

Why Cuccinelli was a controversial pick: ""The former Virginia attorney general ... could face a rocky road to confirmation should Trump nominate him to lead USCIS on a permanent basis. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump touts Mexico deal on migrants: Will be 'very successful' Trump touts Mexico deal on migrants: Will be 'very successful' Sweeping plans from 2020 contenders come with trillion-dollar price tags MORE (R-Ky.) has long opposed Cuccinelli, dating back to his effort to oust the top Senate Republican in 2014 as head of the anti-establishment Senate Conservatives Fund."" http://bit.ly/2ZlsSpF

How easy is it to order a custom ""...or else I will impose tariffs"" button?

Asking for a friend:

This morning, President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse panel seeks to block Pentagon funds for border wall Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi MORE threatened to impose tariffs on China if Chinese President Xi Jinping does not attend the Group of 20 (G-20) summit later this month. http://bit.ly/31obCSo

The tariffs: The imposed tariffs would be on $300 billion in Chinese goods.

These aren't the first tariffs: ""The president raised tariffs on roughly $200 billion in Chinese goods last month after trade talks collapsed, prompting Beijing to increase tariffs on around $60 billion in U.S. imports.""

What this could mean for the economy: ""The tit-for-tat has rattled financial markets worried about the trade dispute between the world's two largest economies spiraling out of control. The additional tariffs, if Trump imposes them, would cover nearly all Chinese imports and could dramatically raise consumer prices."" http://bit.ly/31obCSo

No longer going into effect today:

On Friday evening, President Trump announced that his administration has reached an immigration deal with Mexico, dropping his threat to impose a 5 percent tariff. http://bit.ly/2Zi415M

Trump tweeted on Friday: ""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""

The U.S.-Mexico deal: ""Mexico has agreed to deploy its national guard throughout the country to help apprehend migrants and fight gangs, boost intelligence sharing with the U.S. and allow the U.S. to deport migrants seeking asylum to Mexico to await adjudication."" http://bit.ly/2Zi415M

THIS MORNING -- THE EASIEST PUNCHING BAG:

President Trump praised Mexico this morning, tweeting, ""Now with our new deal, Mexico is doing more for the USA on Illegal Immigration than the Democrats. In fact, the Democrats are doing NOTHING, they want Open Borders, which means Illegal Immigration, Drugs and Crime."" http://bit.ly/2I4QjNT

ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL

Cough, cough, co-DROP OUT-ugh, cough

^ Nah, I didn't hear Democrats saying anything.:

Via The Hill's Alexander Bolton, Democrats are hoping that a few 2020 presidential candidates drop out and run for the Senate. http://bit.ly/2Iw2Qch

Why those three candidates: All three could give their states' Senate GOP incumbents a run for their money. Without those states, Democrats have a slim chance at taking the Senate majority in 2020 or 2022.

WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING IN CONGRESS THIS WEEK :

Government funding: The House is expected to vote on a ""minibus"" bill on Wednesday, the first of 12 appropriations packages.



The Mueller report: The House Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing today, ""Lessons from the Mueller Report: Presidential Obstruction and Other Crimes.""

Medicare for All: The House Ways and Means Committee has a hearing on the progressive ""Medicare for All"" plan this Wednesday.

The border: ""Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week as Senate Republicans push to pass emergency funding for the U.S.-Mexico border.""

Nominations: ""The Senate will take up six district judicial nominations: Sarah Daggett Morrison for the southern district of Ohio, Pamela Barker for the northern district of Ohio, Corey Landon Maze for the northern district of Alabama, Rodney Smith for the southern district of Florida, Thomas Barber for the middle district of Florida and Jean-Paul Boulee for the northern district of Georgia. Senators will also vote on David Stilwell to be an assistant secretary of State and Edward Crawford to be the U.S. ambassador to Ireland.""

The White House reportedly blocked climate testimony warning of a 'possibly catastrophic' future because it didn't 'jibe' with Trump's policy,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-blocked-climate-testimony-trump2019-6,"The White House is engaged in a war of words about climate change.

Last Wednesday, Rod Schoonover, a senior analyst at the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, was barred from submitting his written assessment of the effects of a warming world to the House Intelligence Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Schoonover was scheduled to testify on behalf of the bureau at a climate change hearing held on June 5. Though he was permitted to speak in person, his office's written statement was blocked by White House officials, who thought his scientific claims contradicted the policies of the Trump administration.

In his written testimony, Schoonover predicted that the ""the compounded effects of climate change"" would produce ""significant,"" ""possibly catastrophic,"" harm to the planet. The ability to prevent this future, he wrote, will depend partly on humanity's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A White House aide told the Washington Post that the testimony didn't ""jibe"" with the administration's official stance on climate change.

The testimony was reportedly opposed by members of the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council, including William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, who was dismissed from his post at the Department of Energy in 1993, has stated that most of Earth's warming ""has probably been due to natural causes.""

Before the White House barred Schoonover's written testimony, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research reportedly refused a request from the Trump administration to eliminate certain scientific claims.

Here are a few claims from the written document, first obtained by the Washington Post:

Extreme high temperatures are increasing worldwide, and will continue to increase, due ""largely"" to greenhouse gas emissions.

Today's levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been seen in ""at least 800,000 years.""

Oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Climate change will amplify ""stresses"" such as droughts, floods, and fires.

The effects of climate change could undermine trade routes, the global economy, and the world's food supply.

Climate change will ""almost certainly"" threaten national security in the coming decades.

The crackdown on Schoonover's testimony reflects a larger effort on behalf of the Trump administration to police government reports related to climate change.

In May, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to prevent the federally-funded National Climate Assessment from outlining the ""worst-case scenarios"" if climate change went unchecked.

The Times also reported that the White House aimed to prevent the US Geological Survey from making climate predictions beyond 2040. Scientists expect the worst effects of global emissions to manifest after that time period.

Re “Elizabeth Warren Wants Congress to Ensure Presidents Can Be Indicted” (nytimes.com, May 31 ):

Contrary to Senator Warren’s view, the mere fact that the current occupant of the White House has engaged in deplorable, and perhaps criminal, conduct provides no basis for revoking the Justice Department’s longstanding rule that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Senator Warren’s desire to use the criminal justice system against a president the Democrats find objectionable is shortsighted: Given our polarized times, if she were to succeed, it would surely not be long before we would see efforts to use the same tool against a Democratic president.

Moreover, the Justice Department policy, which has remained in force through Democratic and Republican administrations alike, is firmly rooted in the constitutional provision establishing impeachment as the course for dealing with presidential misconduct.

Lastly, as a practical matter, it is likely that the Supreme Court rues the day that it naïvely ruled, in Clinton v. Jones, that a sitting president can simultaneously handle his or her constitutional duties and defend against civil litigation. We saw how the Paula Jones litigation consumed President Bill Clinton’s second term, and having to defend against criminal charges would surely hamstring President Trump to a far greater degree."
"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

Trump claims 'collusion' between big tech and Democrats,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Allan Smith']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/06/10/trump-claims-collusion-between-big-tech-and-democrats/23746079/,"President Donald Trump thinks ""obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly"" regarding major tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, he said during an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday.

Initially asked if he thought Facebook, Google and Amazon are too big now and should be broken up, Trump said: ""Well, I can tell you they discriminate against me.""

Trump then veered away from potential antitrust actions against the companies and into his campaign's use of the platforms

""You know people talk about collusion. The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies, cause they were so against me during my election run, everybody said if you don't have them, you can't win,"" Trump said. ""Well I won, you know, and I'll win again, because we're doing well, and we're not the fools anymore, we're not the foolish country that does so badly.""

Google, Facebook and Twitter have come under increasing scrutiny from conservatives who claimed that the platform discriminate against their politics. The companies have in recent months taken steps to crack down on hate speech and white supremacist content, adding on to previous efforts to limit the spread of misinformation.

Trump continues to spend heavily on Facebook ads, and his 2020 campaign manager previously credited the social network as having played an important role in the president's win in 2016.

Later in the interview, pointing to the European Union's heavy fines against companies including Google, Trump said Europe was ""actually attacking our companies."" However, he added that ""we should be doing what they're doing.""

""They think there's a monopoly but I'm not sure that they think that. They just figure this is easy money,"" he said of the billions in fines. ""We'll sue Apple for $7 billion, and we'll make a settlement or win the case. So I think it is a bad situation but obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly.""

Trump's comments come as the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress are gearing up for antitrust scrutiny of big tech.

The records do not indicate why Ohr was given the bonus in November 2016, though they show he also received a $14,520 bonus a year earlier, totaling $42,520 over a two-year period.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CITED STEELE IN EMAILS WITH OHR AFTER FLAGGING CREDIBILITY ISSUES TO FBI, DOCS REVEAL

A Justice Department spokesman on Friday did not immediately return an inquiry from Fox News about the bonuses.

The conservative group Judicial Watch, known for suing for public records, released the documents related to Ohr’s salary Friday, saying they obtained them from the Justice Department through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Ohr’s actions during that time have been of interest to investigators, as it’s believed Ohr was the back channel between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and the FBI. It was also revealed that his wife, Nellie Ohr, conducted opposition research on Trump for the firm Fusion GPS – the same company that commissioned the dossier – raising conflict of interest questions.

Judicial Watch is questioning why Ohr, who was later demoted at DOJ, was given a bonus.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement.

Even though Ohr was removed from his position as Associate Deputy Attorney General in 2017, he later received a $2,600 pay increase in 2018, the records indicate, showing Ohr earned $189,000 that year.
