'A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall' on Obama's Bad Cops and Spies,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/28/a_hard_rains_gonna_fall_on_obamas_bad_cops_and_spies_140429.html,"The skies are growing dark and increasingly ominous for dirty officials at the top of Obama-era law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Leading the “I’m really worried” list are James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, Loretta Lynch, and their senior aides, all political appointees. They expected Hillary Clinton to win in 2016 and bury any traces of malfeasance, just as they had buried hers. It didn’t work out that way.

Now they need protection themselves. House Democrats and anonymous leakers are busy providing it. Many are delicately called “current and former senior officials” by the New York Times, Washington Post, and other legacy media. Gee, I wonder who they are?

These defenders of the old guard are sliming Attorney General Bill Barr, who heads the investigation into their actions. They have good reasons, if not clean hands, for their attack. First, they want to keep as much secret as they can. Exposure can only harm them. Their main argument is that any disclosures will damage U.S. national security. Second, they want to paint the disclosures and forthcoming indictments as President Trump’s revenge, the illegitimate use of powerful agencies that should be nonpartisan. That, of course, is precisely what they are accused of doing.

Barr won’t be deterred. He did not return for a second stint as AG to pad his résumé or protect Donald Trump. He returned to clean out the Augean Stables. He needs to muck out the mess left by his predecessors and find the horses that left it.

Barr is determined to do that. He intends to find out how and why the Department of Justice embarked on an all-consuming, two-year project to investigate Trump’s alleged cooperation with Putin’s Russia to win the presidency. The investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no such cooperation (going well beyond saying he simply could not indict). Now, Barr wants to understand the origins of the probe and whether the tools used to launch it were lies or distortions — and were known to be so by DoJ, FBI, and CIA officials. Barr wants to know if U.S. intelligence agencies were used to spy illegally on Americans, or if they outsourced that to friendly foreign services and then recovered the information from them. He wants to know if the investigations really began in July 2016, as the FBI testified, or earlier, and what evidence was used to begin them.

None dare call it spying. At least no Democrats or Obama officials will. But that’s exactly what it was. As that master of the English language, Winston Churchill, put it, “Short words are best and old words when short are best of all.” That’s far too clear for bureaucratic obfuscators, presidential contenders, and their media allies. They prefer long, Latinate terms like “surveillance” and “surreptitious investigation.” Barr is effectively telling them to “pound sand.”

Over the next few months, the public will finally see what kind of malfeasance there was. At least they will see some of it. Some will remain classified to protect sources and methods; some will be released only after criminal charges are filed. The initial evidence will come from two sources: a major report by DoJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and the steady declassification of underlying documents by AG Barr, who was given that task by the president. Barr needed that authority because the FBI and intelligence community are resisting disclosure with all their institutional power. They fear years of abuse will be exposed.

Horowitz, a highly regarded career prosecutor, initially appointed by President Obama, will issue a public report and is virtually certain to make criminal referrals. The referrals will then be handled by John Durham, a skilled, apolitical U.S. attorney, who has successfully prosecuted major corruption cases for AGs in both parties. Apparently, he has already convened a grand jury. Another federal prosecutor, John Huber, has been working on related problems. Durham will coordinate, supervised by Barr.

These joint efforts will show whether there were good legal reasons to spy on Americans, whether the secret intelligence courts were given complete and honest information before they issued search warrants, whether top officials leaked secret information to the media, and whether U.S. intelligence agencies (which cannot legally spy on Americans) evaded that restriction. They may also show if outside contractors illegally tapped into classified databases and spied on American citizens, including political opponents.

These are very serious charges, and, if proven, serious crimes. What makes them worse — far worse — is that they may well be connected to each other. If they are, they would represent a high-level conspiracy by government officials, appointed by one party and directed at political opponents during and after an election.

This assault on democracy has not been proven, but the evidence emerging in dribs and drabs strongly suggests the possibility. If it is proven, and if the Obama White House was directly involved, as some FBI texts plainly say, the scandal would be one of the biggest in American history.

How big? Big enough that major news organizations, which always favor transparency (“Democracy Dies in Darkness”), are now deeply troubled by the release of any secret documents. They know the stakes are too high and transparency too dangerous for their side, politically.

Right now, we don’t know how big the scandal is, how extensive the coordination was, and how far up it went. But we certainly need to know, just as we needed to know if Donald Trump won the presidency by cooperating with a hostile foreign power. He did not, according to the Mueller report. Now, we need to know if the U.S. government itself worked secretly and illegally to prevent his election and, when that failed, to damage his new presidency. That conspiracy would be equally serious, and for the same reasons. It needs to be rooted out, exposed, and punished.

The fundamental problem was identified by James Madison, who led the drafting of our constitution. “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men,” he wrote in Federalist Paper 51, “the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself."" Under Comey, Lynch, Brennan, and Clapper, under Obama and Biden, it failed to control itself.

Over the next few months, we will learn the extent of that failure. We will see if top officials misused their agencies to investigate and crush their political opponents. Constitutional democracies cannot permit that. They cannot wave it off as yesterday’s news and expect to survive unscathed. If undetected and unpunished, it will happen again to another party, another candidate.

As the evidence comes out, a hard rain’s gonna fall. The damage will be compounded by partisan divisions, corroding trust in our basic institutions, and an impending election. For democracy’s sake, let’s hope the bitter winds are not a Cat-5 storm."

He’s dominating in the polls, his fundraising is going gangbusters and he’s showing broad support from key political players in the early presidential states.

So where are the big energetic crowds, the lines around the block to get into Joe Biden’s events?

Story Continued Below

The question is no small matter in a party still recovering from a bitter 2016 defeat — a loss marked by a lack of enthusiasm for an establishment nominee in several critical states.

Attendance at the former vice president’s launch rally paled next to some of his rivals. In his first Iowa visit, he didn’t match the crowds that greeted Elizabeth Warren or even the less well-known Pete Buttigieg in their initial visits. So far, he’s kept his events to smaller venues where there’s little danger of empty seats.

In the eyes of Biden’s progressive critics — as well as President Donald Trump, who has publicly mocked him for it — the seeming lack of excitement or teeming masses at his events is a leading indicator of a lack of passion for his candidacy.

“I started to think the polls were wrong about Biden because it’s not what we’re seeing on the ground,” said Aimee Allison, founder and president of She the People, a national network devoted to promoting women of color.

“Inspiration is the X-factor and we’re waiting for the inspiration from Biden,” she said. “When the inspiration isn’t there, the turnout from the core of the Democratic base — women of color — isn’t there. And then we lose.”

To Biden’s campaign, attendance figures are a meaningless metric. Focusing on crowd size is Trump’s game, it says, an emphasis on style over substance that attempts to turn audience engagement into an argument about the 76-year-old Biden’s energy level.

Crowd size, after all, is an imperfect metric to measure a campaign’s vitality. While it can be a revealing indicator, it still lacks the scientific underpinning of polling or the fixed-dollar figures associated with fundraising. Nor does it account for the judgment of elected and influential Democrats across the country.

Just as critics doubted Biden’s popularity before he got in the race, his campaign is confident he’ll have the crowds when he needs them.

""We're seeing enormous enthusiasm for Joe Biden's candidacy across the country, beginning the very first day of the campaign when he got over 100,000 contributions — 65,000 of which were brand new to our lists — from all 50 states,” said Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo.

Even so, since announcing his candidacy more than a month ago, Biden has yet to draw anything near the 20,000 people who showed in Oakland to cheer on Kamala Harris when she announced, or the 13,000 who turned out in Brooklyn for Bernie Sanders’ launch.

Last Saturday, when Biden held a rally for his headquarters’ opening in Philadelphia, his campaign estimated the crowd size was 6,000 — a count that some local observers thought might be generous. One local elected Democrat who supports Biden privately told POLITICO the rally was smaller and less energetic than expected.

The event fell far short of the size his surrogates predicted in one of the nation’s largest Democratic cities. Just before Biden formally announced his candidacy last month, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who helped organize a fundraiser for Biden, had loftier expectations.

“He’s enormously popular here,” Rendell, a former Philadelphia mayor, said in a late April interview. “We could get tens and tens of thousands of people … For one rally, I think we could do that.”

The crowd size was similar to what President Barack Obama drew at a 2016 rally for Hillary Clinton at the same venue. As a candidate, however, in April 2008, some 35,000 people flooded Independence Mall to see Obama — before he was the nominee.

Trump — for whom crowd size borders on obsession — seized on Biden’s Philadelphia launch, mocking the former vice president two days later at a rival Pennsylvania speech in which he exaggerated the smallness of the crowd.

“We have thousands of people … look at the thousands and thousands of people we have,” Trump said at a Montoursville rally, for which his campaign declined to release an estimated crowd count. “They said [Biden] had 600 people ... I’d say 150.”

It’s not the first time Trump has needled Biden over crowd sizes. In 2018, when the president and Biden held dueling Nevada rallies in the homestretch of the midterm campaign — and Trump’s Elko rally had more attendees than Biden’s Las Vegas rally — Trump used the occasion to point to Biden’s prior presidential race defeat and joked that Biden “was thrilled that’s one of the biggest crowds he’s ever had.”

It’s not just the size of Biden’s events that are modest, he’s also holding far fewer of them than his primary competitors. Since his launch, he’s visited Iowa only once. And while Democrats crisscrossed early presidential primary states during the long Memorial Day weekend, Biden took it off. (On Tuesday, he travels to Houston where he and his wife, Jill, will join an American Federation of Teachers town hall.)

There are signs that the theme could become more prominent as the campaign progresses. One of the president’s top surrogates, Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, said Biden won’t have the energy to campaign full time once he gets off “the French workweek campaign schedule” that the Democrat is currently on.

“He wants to make America bored again. It’s like he wants to put his audience to sleep,” Gaetz said.

“Trump’s rallies are big and raucous and enthusiastic. And the reason that matters is that in today’s politics, people want to be part of something,” Gaetz said. “Joe Biden’s rallies looks like an event where you would give a gold watch to the Democrat for a lifetime of service.”

James Carville, one of the masterminds behind Bill Clinton’s campaigns for president, said those criticisms miss an essential point about the kind of no-frills-no-thrills campaign he is running.

“He’s never been a candidate who has run on excitement. He has run on ‘you can trust me. I’m a good guy. My heart is in the right place. I’m human. You know me. I’m well-liked,’” Carville said. “Their theory of the case is people are tired of the circus. And it takes an experienced hand to settle everything down to get us back to some era of sanity.”

To that end, some Democrats say Biden’s sometimes listless crowds aren’t cause for concern, but merely reflective of the part of the electorate backing him: older, middle-of-the-road Democrats who are more likely to turn out to the polls than to boisterous megarallies.

Polk County Democratic Chair Sean Bagniewski said there weren’t lines around the block for Biden during his Iowa visit, but that at a local Democratic Party dinner, the former vice president’s campaign dominated local chatter.

“The polls are picking up the people who might not be going to the rallies, might not be going to the meetings. But the polls can still be right,” Bagniewski said. “The rank and file can be reliable Democrats. They’re the people who have been around for awhile.”

Brian Fallon, former spokesman for Hillary Clinton, said the Biden campaign isn’t going for big crowds and passion and is instead underpinned by “a very pragmatic argument. It’s not an argument designed to electrify. It revolves around electability ... It’s not the type of message that inspires a movement. It’s very practical.”

There’s also the matter of Biden’s long tenure in politics. Crowds that flooded to Buttigieg or Beto O’Rourke in this cycle did so in part because they’ve never seen the candidates before.

Tad Devine, who was part of Sanders’ insurgent 2016 campaign against Clinton, added that Biden doesn’t need the big crowds the way Sanders did in the previous race because the former vice president doesn’t need to show he’s a legitimate candidate — he’s the front-runner.

“Biden’s not a crowd candidate. He’s not Obama. He’s not Bernie,” Devine said. “Drawing big crowds is more important for Beto [O’Rourke] or Mayor Pete to get into the mix.”

Trump Administration Hardens Its Attack on Climate Science,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Coral Davenport', 'Mark Landler']",05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/us/politics/trump-climate-science.html,"The administration’s prime target has been the National Climate Assessment, produced by an interagency task force roughly every four years since 2000. Government scientists used computer-generated models in their most recent report to project that if fossil fuel emissions continue unchecked, the earth’s atmosphere could warm by as much as eight degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. That would lead to drastically higher sea levels, more devastating storms and droughts, crop failures, food losses and severe health consequences.

Work on the next report, which is expected to be released in 2021 or 2022, has already begun. But from now on, officials said, such worst-case scenario projections will not automatically be included in the National Climate Assessment or in some other scientific reports produced by the government.

“What we have here is a pretty blatant attempt to politicize the science — to push the science in a direction that’s consistent with their politics,” said Philip B. Duffy, the president of the Woods Hole Research Center, who served on a National Academy of Sciences panel that reviewed the government’s most recent National Climate Assessment. “It reminds me of the Soviet Union.”

In an email, James Hewitt, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, defended the proposed changes.

“The previous use of inaccurate modeling that focuses on worst-case emissions scenarios, that does not reflect real-world conditions, needs to be thoroughly re-examined and tested if such information is going to serve as the scientific foundation of nationwide decision-making now and in the future,” Mr. Hewitt said.

However, the goal of political appointees in the Trump administration is not just to change the climate assessment’s methodology, which has broad scientific consensus, but also to question its conclusions by creating a new climate review panel. That effort is led by a 79-year-old physicist who had a respected career at Princeton but has become better known in recent years for attacking the science of man-made climate change and for defending the virtues of carbon dioxide — sometimes to an awkward degree."

They've been banned from Facebook, purged from Twitter and blocked from Instagram. Some of them have been barred from setting foot on the continent of Australia. But you can still find them all on the fledgling social media network Parler.

The Twitter-like platform was initially hatched last year as a tool for digital news outlets to claw revenue back from big social networks like Facebook. But as those platforms purge some of the internet’s most inflammatory supporters of President Donald Trump over posts deemed dangerous or offensive, Parler has carved out a niche among these banned right-wing influencers — like Gavin McInnes, Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos.

Story Continued Below

As conservative distrust of social media giants rises to the top of Washington’s political agenda, Parler has also gained the notice of some bona fide Republican leaders: Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and Utah Sen. Mike Lee both began posting on the site this month.

According to one person close to Trump’s campaign, the president’s team is considering setting him up with an account on the site. A senior Trump campaign official said that there was no imminent plan to have the president join the platform, but that Parscale is scouting Parler. “It’s something he's aware of and is checking out,” the official said of Parscale. “We don’t currently have a plan to make a big move to the platform.”

Having Trump’s imprimatur would give the platform overnight cachet and satisfy calls from his social media-savvy supporters for the president to stick it to the Silicon Valley companies with which he maintains a strained, symbiotic relationship.

""Donald Trump should just switch social media platforms altogether because everyone will follow him,” said Candace Owens, a pro-Trump activist close to Trump’s campaign team. Owens, who is black, was recently banned from Facebook — and then swiftly reinstated with an apology from the company — for posting “Black America must wake up to the great liberal hoax. White supremacy is not a threat. Liberal supremacy is.”

Owens — who recently departed the conservative youth group Turning Point USA — introduced Parler to the pro-Trump grassroots with a December tweet that began, “Wow. Everyone just found out about the new Twitter. Just want to say that I WAS THE FIRST CONSERVATIVE TO JOIN.” Her tweet in turn linked to a tweet from the chairman of X Strategies, a conservative communications firm, promoting Parler.

Parler’s founder, John Matze, said the Owens tweet swamped his site with 40,000 new users, causing its servers to malfunction. (He also said that X Strategies approached him after the tweet. The firm now does public relations work for Parler.)

Parler is the french word for “Speak,” and is pronounced “par-lay.” But as its user base has grown, Matze has seen that Americans tend to pronounce the word phonetically, as in “parlor,” evoking the room in a house where friends might sit down to chat.

Matze and Owens said they first encountered each other late last year in New York at the Gatestone Institute, a think tank that was formerly chaired by Trump’s national security advisor, John Bolton, and is known for its hostility to Islam.

Owens was there to speak, and Matze was working on integrating Parler with Gatestone’s website. Matze, who leans libertarian in his personal views, had not set out to cater to Trump supporters. Originally, he had conceived of Parler as a commenting plugin with social features that media outlets could integrate into their websites as a way to capture more engagement with their content themselves — rather than letting the bulk of engagement and ad dollars flow to established social media platforms.

He said he expected left-leaning digital publishers to become core partners. But as large social media platforms have responded to calls to curb extremism on their sites with bans of several far-right figures and other, more opaque measures like “shadow banning,” conservative users have become increasingly distrustful of the likes of Facebook and Twitter.

This has created an unexpected opening for Parler with pro-Trump users, though it is still far from challenging large social networks. Many aspects of its user interface, such as its search function, remain clunky. And its user base remains miniscule in the grand scheme of things.

Matze said the site had about 100,000 users in total. Twitter, by comparison, claims 326 million.

Activity on the site appears to be devoted mostly to a small universe of Trump-friendly discussions. On a recent Tuesday, trending topics on the site included “#IslamExposed,” “#IllegalImmigrants,” “#BuildThatWall” and “#WomenForTrump.” Even among Trump’s most avid online supporters, many have never heard of Parler. At the moment, the two outlets that appear to use the site most actively are Breitbart News and the Epoch Times, a newspaper associated with Falun Gong — a Chinese spiritual movement on the outs with China’s ruling Communist Party — that has attracted notice for its pointedly pro-Trump editorial line.

Given its limitations, even those sympathetic to Parler remain skeptical of its prospects. Will Chamberlain, who recently relaunched the conservative publication Human Events with a focus on social media censorship, said that though he plans to post his outlet’s content to Parler, he does not expect it to displace the reigning platform for news. “I think Twitter has a natural monopoly,” he said. “I think there are profound network effects.”

And even by the standards of free speech Twitter alternatives, Parler is small. Another platform, Gab, founded in 2016, claims a million users. “Parler is a ghost town,” said Gab’s founder Andrew Torba.

Like Parler, Gab takes a laissez-faire approach to offensive speech and has been a magnet for those banned from other platforms. Its users include white nationalist Richard Spencer and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The perpetrator of a 2018 mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue was also a Gab user. There are even questions about whether Gab’s frog logo is an homage to Pepe, the cartoon frog symbol of the alt-right, though Torba has said the frog is an allusion to the Book of Exodus. Gab’s popularity with the virulently racist alt-right has tainted Gab’s brand, stymying its prospects for growth into a mainstream platform even as it amassed a large user base.

While Parler’s founder does not want to be limited to a far-right user base, much of the content posted on Parler falls into categories deemed offensive and discouraged by the large platforms — such as anti-Islam and anti-feminist sentiment. In one post typical of the site, a user with the handle @liberalismiscancer, shared a meme criticizing the burka, the body covering worn by some Muslim women, along with the comment, “Where are my fellow feminists why is the oppression of women ok if it's in the name of ISLAM ? Why are Moslems treated differently free from criticism.”

Matze said he still hopes to attract users of all political persuasions. ""We're pretty much bipartisan from our standpoint,” he said. “I really don’t want to take a stance at all on the political side of things. However it seems extremely relevant right now for conservatives at least to build a platform where they can build trust. They feel extremely abused by social media.""

Matze said he plans to bypass these issues by using the FCC’s definition of obscenity to determine what posts cross the line, and to leave up anything that does not meet that threshold, while giving users tools to personally filter out content they do not want to see.

Ongoing fights about the sorts of speech and users that tech giants permit on their platforms have returned to the fore in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the White House posted an online survey seeking to collect information about possible political discrimination by these platforms.

The senior Trump campaign official said that the campaign is also using its financial leverage with social media platforms like Facebook to push back against perceived bias. “We're a significant advertiser so we make sure our viewpoint is heard,” the official said. Trump’s campaign has spent roughly $5 million so far this year on Facebook ads, far more than any of his Democratic rivals, according to a New York Times analysis.

Despite this heavy ad spending, distrust of large social media platforms has loomed large in the strategic thinking of Trump’s team. In October, POLITICO reported that Trump’s 2020 campaign was investing heavily in efforts to reach supporters directly, such as via text message, in order to bypass the platforms.

Earlier this month, Matze swung through Washington, where he ran into Parscale at the Trump Hotel. The Trump campaign manager posted a photo of himself with Matze and Elise Rhodes, a vice president of client relations at X Strategies, to Parler.

While in town, Matze also met with Lee, the libertarian-minded senator, and sold him on Parler’s free speech ethos.

Lee was so taken he decided to set up an account. Matze said he offered to help Lee’s staffers set up an account for him, but the senator insisted he did not want his staff to have access to the account, because he wanted to post directly to it himself.

A spokesman for Lee, Conn Carroll, said he could not confirm the specifics of the conversation, but did confirm that Lee personally posts to Parler himself.

Lee has posted a handful of times in recent weeks on the site -- though he hasn’t exactly been unleashed. When a user named “Anon, yo!” called Lee a “typical RINO fake congressman” for not sponsoring term limits, Lee responded, “I’ve cosponsored term-limits every year I’ve been in the Senate.” This elicited an apology from “Anon, yo!” to the senator.

Matze said he hopes the site will foster civil discussion, and that he has seen users wish each other good night at the end of evenings of heated debate. That civility though, may be a function of the fact that most of the platform’s heavy users share a broadly similar worldview. And it is not clear whether an initial user base that is so invigorated by arguing with liberals — a recent trending topic was “#Triggered” — will find as much satisfaction on a platform dominated by their fellow travelers.

Michael Morrison, a conservative activist who operated a Twitter parody account of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez until being banned from that platform, said many right-leaning social media figures are treating Parler as a backup. They are attracting modest followings on the platform in case they are banned from the larger social networks.

“Obviously I’d like to see it build up,” he said, “For now, it’s a small, nice, conservative community."""

"Trump EPA backs away from smog breaks for Foxconn, Indiana steel mills",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-foxconn-indiana-smog-trump-epa-20190516-story.html,"When the Trump administration exempted parts of the Chicago area last year from federal limits on lung-damaging smog, it delivered a huge financial break to steel mills, chemical plants and other industries that are some of the region’s biggest polluters.

Scott Pruitt, who at the time headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also freed the Foxconn Technology Group from spending millions of dollars on pollution-control equipment as it builds a new electronics plant in southeast Wisconsin, just north of the Illinois border in an area with some of the region’s dirtiest air.

But faced with a legal challenge from environmental groups and a coalition of cities and states, including Chicago and Illinois, federal lawyers are having second thoughts about Pruitt’s controversial decision.

In a few densely worded paragraphs buried at the end of a 63-page document, attorneys for the EPA and Justice Department asked a federal appeals court this month for what, in legal terms, amounts to a do-over.

Administration officials aren’t admitting they did anything wrong, the lawyers contend. But they can see EPA data showing the region’s smog problems are getting worse, not better, and that polluters in four counties singled out by Pruitt for special treatment are contributing to chronically dirty air breathed by millions of people.

The court shouldn’t rule against the Trump administration, the lawyers pleaded. Rather, they said, it “could benefit from additional explanations” and the EPA could end up revising its designations.

“These federal attorneys looked at the record, relied on their professional judgment and realized there isn’t any evidence to justify Pruitt’s last-minute switcheroo,” said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, one of the nonprofit groups that sued to overturn the EPA’s smog designations in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.

By dramatically reducing the size of areas required to crack down on dirty air, Pruitt overruled the agency’s career scientists, a move that saved Foxconn and other polluters from either installing more effective pollution-control equipment, scaling back production to reduce emissions or brokering costly trading agreements with cleaner industries.

Other beneficiaries included then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who made Foxconn the centerpiece of his 2018 re-election campaign. Walker already had wooed the company to Racine County with $3 billion in financial incentives, promises to relax state environmental laws and access to Lake Michigan water.

Walker, who ended up losing to Democrat Tony Evers in November, blamed Chicago for making the air unhealthy to breathe in Wisconsin. But an EPA staff analysis concluded Wisconsin is at least partially responsible for its own smog problems, and documents filed with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources show Foxconn will be a major new source of smog-forming pollution.

Newly released emails show EPA scientists strongly objected to Pruitt’s decision, which they said could not be supported with data despite political pressure from Trump administration officials and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. The emails were obtained Friday by the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin as part of a federal public records request.

“I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,” Jennifer Liljegren, an EPA scientist, wrote to colleagues in an April 11, 2018, email. “I will need the wordsmithing of the legal and policy experts if we are really going to do this — I am still in disbelief.”

One of the recipients of that email, EPA scientist Lars Perlmutt, replied, “I have a background in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally, this is hard to digest and support.”

Another email from Liljegren concluded that Wisconsin polluters are responsible for up to 15 percent of the smog detected by air quality monitors — enough to register violations in all of the areas exempted by Pruitt.

Smog, also known as ground-level ozone, is formed by a reaction between sunlight and pollution from car tailpipes, power plants and factories, fumes from volatile solvents and gasoline vapors. After a scientific review required every five years by the federal Clean Air Act, the Obama EPA tightened the national smog standard in 2015 to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75 ppb limit set during the Bush administration.

Average smog concentrations in the counties at issue exceeded the new federal limit during the past three years, according to monitoring data. In Racine County, for instance, smog levels peaked at 90 ppb last year and averaged 78 ppb between 2016 and 2018, even without Foxconn operating.

More perplexing is Pruitt’s reversal of the EPA staff designation for northwest suburban McHenry County.

Unlike Wisconsin officials, who under Walker insisted the state’s air was clean enough to pass muster, the Illinois EPA had repeatedly included McHenry in its lists of areas required to take additional smog-fighting measures. Monitoring data supports that decision: Smog concentrations in McHenry averaged 72 ppb between 2016 and 2018 and peaked at 77 ppb last year.

But Alec Messina, a former industry lobbyist who headed the state agency under Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, abruptly reversed course after phone conversations with Clint Woods, a top Pruitt aide."

TRI-CITIES (WJHL) - The United States Department of Labor has accepted a letter from the USDA, saying the Forest Service will withdraw from operating Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (CCC).

According to a release from the U.S. Labor Department, ""this action creates an opportunity to serve a greater number of students at higher performing centers at a lower cost to taxpayers by modernizing and reforming part of the Job Corps program.""

The USDA says the mission for CCCs is to ""train eligible youth, ages 16 to 24 with educational, social and vocational skills, while assisting in the conservation of the Nation's public natural resources.""

A review was performed at all CCCs going over outcome measurements, internal controls, ongoing needs, and other items.

According to the department, 16 centers will continue under a new contract operator or partnership.

Locally, Jacobs Creek CCC will continue to operate in Bristol, Tennessee.

The 16 centers under new management are featured below:

Angell CCC in Yachats, Oregon; Boxelder CCC in Nemo, South Dakota; Centennial CCC in Nampa, Idaho; Collbran CCC in Collbran, Colorado; Columbia Basin CCC in Moses Lake, Washington; Curlew CCC in Curlew, Washington; Great Onyx CCC in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky; Harpers Ferry CCC in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; Lyndon Johnson CCC in Franklin, North Carolina; Jacobs Creek CCC in Bristol, Tennessee; Mingo CCC in Puxico, Missouri; Pine Ridge CCC in Chadron, Nebraska; Schenck CCC in Pisgah Forest, North Carolina; Trapper Creek CCC in Darby, Montana; Weber Basin CCC in Ogden, Utah; and Wolf Creek CCC in Glide, Oregon.

A Federal Register notice will propose nine CCCs to close. Locally, the Flatwoods CCC in Coeburn, Virginia will be up for deactivation.

The nine CCCs up for deactivation are: Anaconda CCC in Anaconda, Montana; Blackwell CCC in Laona, Wisconsin; Cass CCC in Ozark, Arkansas; Flatwoods CCC in Coeburn, Virginia; Fort Simcoe CCC in White Swan, Washington; Frenchburg CCC in Frenchburg, Kentucky; Oconaluftee CCC in Cherokee, North Carolina; Pine Knot CCC in Pine Knot, Kentucky; and Timber Lake CCC in Estacada, Oregon."

Bloomberg Environment: ""EPA Curbs Use of 12 Bee-Harming Pesticides"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency has canceled registration of a dozen pesticides, from a class of chemicals known to harm bees.

""The cancellations are effective as of May 20 for 12 neonicotinoid-based products produced by Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer.

""The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act requires pesticides sold or distributed in the U.S. to be registered by the EPA.

""Under a December settlement agreement linked to an Endangered Species Act challenge by environmental groups, the companies voluntarily agreed to petition EPA to cancel 12 out of 59 products containing the active ingredients clothianidin and thiamethoxam.

""Developed as an alternative to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, neonicotinoids are chemically related to nicotine, and attack the nervous system of insects.""

Washington Post: ""The Energy 202: EPA blocks a dozen products containing pesticides thought harmful to bees"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

""The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

""For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.""

Trump awards ‘President’s Cup’ at sumo match in Japan,https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-awards-presidents-cup-at-sumo-match-in-japan,"President Trump is accustomed to congratulating sports stars in the United States. But no president before him has ever presented a championship trophy to a sumo wrestler in Japan.

Trump on Sunday awarded a giant, eagle-topped “President's Cup” to wrestler Asanoyama, a 25-year-old athlete who clinched a tournament win a day earlier.

The president -- the first American to participate in the tournament -- then congratulated Asanoyama on his “outstanding achievement.”

JAPAN WRESTLING WITH TRUMP GOING TO SUMO DURING STATE VISIT

Then, with a little help, Trump handed the heavy cup to the champ. The White House said the 54-inch-high trophy weighs 60 to 70 pounds.

Asanoyama, whose real name is Hiroki Ishibashi, weighs 390 pounds, according to the Associated Press.

Earlier, Trump sat ringside and watched some wrestling action, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie – along with a crowd of about 11,500 wrestling fans.

The size of the crowd was half the normal capacity, as part of security preparations for Trump’s visit, and spectators went through security checks, the Associated Press reported.

Department of Homeland Security Detains Miami Activist at Homestead Facility for Migrant Children,https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Brittany Shammas'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/homestead-shelter-for-migrant-children-alessandra-mondolfi-detained-by-homeland-security-11181156,"Alessandra Mondolfi was painting hearts on a poster board outside the Homestead child migrant camp last Friday when she spotted a pair of law enforcement officers walking toward her. An artist and activist who's part of a group of protesters maintaining an almost daily presence outside the facility, Mondolfi was working on a memorial to migrant children who have died in custody. ""Here they come,"" one of the other activists said as the officers approached.

The two men — one in a Department of Homeland Security police uniform, the other in plainclothes — asked Mondolfi her name, then pushed her against a car and cuffed her, she says. They then allegedly put her in the back of a car and questioned her for about an hour, asking, bizarrely, whether she had aliases or a neck tattoo, and if she knew the names of the other protesters. Then, about an hour after first approaching Mondolfi, the officers let her go.

Days later, it's still unclear why she was detained. DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Mondolfi says the Miami-Dade Police Department and, weirdly, the Miami-Dade Schools Police, sent squad cars to the scene. The El Paso Police Department has a warrant out for Mondolfi's arrest over a protest she and other activists held at the U.S. Border Patrol Museum. But why would DHS be involved in a city-level case?

Mondolfi has a theory for why she was detained: It was done to rattle her after months of protesting. She notes it was her group that spotted John Kelly — former Homeland Security chief and White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump — touring the Homestead shelter last month, around the same time congresswomen were being denied entry. Soon after Kelly's visit became public, CBS News confirmed he had joined the board of Caliburn International, the for-profit company that runs the place.

""They are trying to scare me, intimidate me,"" Mondolfi says.

Her detainment comes amidst a series of instances of the government watching and prosecuting protesters. Earlier this year, the Intercept revealed that DHS had monitored anti-family separation protests held across the country, treating them as if they were security threats. A contractor working with the agency reviewed demonstrations across South Florida, from West Palm Beach to Miami. The information was shared with DHS and state-level law enforcement.

Meanwhile, two University of Arizona students were arrested in late March for protesting the appearance of Customs and Border Protection officers. The Arizona Republic reported they were among people who stood outside the event calling the officials “murderers” and “an extension of the KKK.” A group of protesters followed the agents as they left the presentation, calling them ""Murder Patrol."" Anti-Dakota Access Pipeline protesters have also been arrested.

At the Homestead shelter, another protester was detained on April 24. That day, MDPD officers handcuffed a New York man named Joshua Rubin and put him in the back of a squad car. Rubin said the cops told him he was being stopped on suspicion of trespassing. He refused to give them his name, he said, because he was on a county road. Eventually he identified himself and was released. MDPD told New Times it had no record of Rubin's detainment.

""You have to expect, when you're protesting, that people are going to try and get you to go away,"" said Rubin, who for months held a one-man vigil outside a camp for migrant teenagers in Texas. ""But the extent to which it's happening here is more extreme.""

Mondolfi says Homeland Security officers began showing up at the facility several weeks ago. When the two men approached her last Friday, they asked for her ID, but it was in her car. She says she asked to go get it, but instead ended up being questioned in the back of a police car. The MDPD and schools police cars showed up.

Daisy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, tells New Times there is no record of a call for service on that date, and questioned whether a photo provided by protesters was actually taken on the date in question. MDPD did not respond to a request for information.

For her part, Mondolfi says she hasn't been back to the shelter since the day she was detained.

""I am not in Homestead; I have not been all week,"" she says. ""I'm not able to do the work that I'm doing. And I am scared, which is all the things they want. They want you to be scared, they want you to be intimidated... and at this point, they're winning, and that's angering me."""
Trade War Sparks Fears of China Weaponizing U.S. Treasuries,https://www.ozy.com,['Joe Rennison'],,,,https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/trade-war-sparks-fears-of-china-weaponizing-us-treasuries/94604,"Beijing’s recent sales of securities are triggering concerns that it might dump U.S. securities for leverage in the ongoing spat with Washington.

It was an unnerving piece of data for investors two weeks back, buried halfway down an esoteric spreadsheet released by the U.S. government that tracks how many Treasuries foreign investors buy and sell. China, the largest foreign creditor to the U.S. government with total Treasury holdings in excess of $1.2 trillion, sold $20 billion of securities with a maturity exceeding one year in March, according to U.S. government data. The sales amounted to China’s largest retreat from the market in more than two years.

The move came shortly before tensions over trade between Beijing and Washington heated up again, with the U.S. slapping additional tariffs on the country’s imports, and Chinese officials retaliating with measures of their own. What’s more, the sales could not be explained away by the typical ebb and flow of China’s Treasury holdings that result from managing its large reserves to keep the currency stable.

If China starts dumping its Treasuries, it would cause huge financial instability. Mark Sobel, former Treasury Department official

The data reignited fears that Beijing may weaponize its holdings as part of the trade war, wreaking havoc with the biggest bond market in the world, pushing interest rates higher and increasing the U.S. government’s cost of borrowing.

“If China starts dumping its Treasuries, it would cause huge financial instability,” says Mark Sobel, a former Treasury Department official who spent nearly four decades at the agency, adding that he considered this an unlikely scenario.

China’s holdings of Treasuries are inextricably linked to the country’s trade with the U.S. China receives dollars in payment for its exports to America, and then needs to invest that money somewhere. The Treasury market has long been China’s destination of choice because the market is not only big enough to host its enormous reserves but it also offers a better return than other supersafe investments. Moreover, China avoids currency fluctuations that could come from selling those dollars to buy other assets.

As a result, China’s Treasury holdings typically dip if its reserves fall. It has also sold Treasuries over the past year to support its beaten-down currency, as tariff talk has intensified. On this occasion, though, neither of those forces appears to have been a factor. To some analysts, it seems as though China simply decided to sell.

“One should take notice of a month of sales during a period when reserves appear to be stable by most indicators,” says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Treasury Department official. “It is certainly something that warrants attention.”

While concerns are mounting, investors and analysts are wary of jumping to conclusions. Setser cautioned that the March data is a snapshot and not yet a trend. Moreover, few see any alternative for China, other than remaining invested in Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is currently 2.42 percent, well above the negative yields on equivalent German and Japanese sovereign bonds and still markedly higher than the 1.03 percent offered on 10-year gilts in the U.K. Other markets are also much smaller than the U.S. Treasury market, meaning they would struggle to digest any inflows from China’s massive holdings.

“Even if this were to be a threat, it’s a very noncredible one,” says Sonal Desai, chief investment officer for fixed income at Franklin Templeton in California. “What else [is China] going to buy?”

Meanwhile, there are few signs that recent bouts of selling by China have pushed U.S. interest rates higher. In the second half of 2011, China ramped up its sales of Treasuries but interest rates dropped too. The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled from a peak of 3.74 percent earlier in the year to 1.88 percent by the year-end, amid a general bout of risk aversion caused by Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.

In 2016, China sought to prop up its currency and sold a net $160 billion of long-term Treasuries, with its holdings hitting the lowest since 2010 in November that year. Ten-year interest rates did rise in the U.S. — from 2.30 percent to 2.44 percent over the course of the year — but that seemed spurred primarily by the election of President Donald Trump, which brought renewed hopes of growth for the economy.

In March this year, during the latest round of selling, the 10-year Treasury yield slipped 30 basis points over the month to 2.41 percent.

Still, few disagree that if China wanted to cause an upset in U.S. interest rates by heavy selling of Treasuries, it probably could. The catch is that it would lead to a revaluation of the country’s own U.S. bonds as it sold.

“China selling its Treasury holdings is a nuclear option, because it will hurt their own portfolio,” says Shawn Matthews, a former Cantor Fitzgerald trading head who launched his own hedge fund, Hondius Capital Management, last year.

“It depends on what the goal is,” says Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. “If the goal is to disturb the U.S. Treasury market, then they may not care about inflicting self-harm.”"

"Edmund Morris, acclaimed presidential biographer of Roosevelt and Reagan, has died at 78",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Brian Pascus'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/edmund-morris-died-acclaimed-biographer-presidents-theodore-roosevelt-ronald-reagan-dead-age-78/,"Edmund Morris, the famed author who wrote acclaimed presidential biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, died Friday in Danbury, Connecticut, according to The New York Times. The cause of death was not disclosed, though The Times did report the 78-year-old was at a hospital following a stroke he suffered Thursday.

Morris was a true master of biographical literature. He won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and the 1980 National Book Award for biography for his first book, ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt."" The book was the first in a trilogy of works exploring the 26th president's life, the others being ""Theodore Rex,"" published in 2001 and ""Colonel Roosevelt,"" published in 2010.

Edmund Morris, author of ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" poses at Random House in New York, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 1999. Morris said he welcomes the controversy over the literary technique he uses in the biography, in which he makes himself a fictional character in Reagan's early life and invents a few other people, too. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler) MARTY LEDERHANDLER

In 1999, he published his most controversial work, ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" an authorized biography written in an experimental style. Starting in 1985, Morris had been granted ""fly-on-the-wall"" privileges by the Reagan White House, allowing him to interview the President and First Lady and their children. He wrote the biography to include a fictional Edmund Morris who was added to the narrative as an observer and one of Reagan's childhood friends. Within the book, the fictional Edmund Morris told the story of the 40th president's life from his childhood in Illinois to the White House. While some praised the book, others were not so kind.

Morris was born May 27, 1940 in Nairobi, Kenya, the son of South African parents. He married Sylvia Jukes Morris in 1968. According to the author's Penguin Random House biography page, Morris worked as an advertising copywriter in London before immigrating to the United States in 1968. His other biographies included a work on Ludwig von Beethoven titled ""Beethoven: The Universal Composer"" as well as a collection of essays.

According to The New York Times, he is survived by his wife, a brother, Eric and a sister, Judy Davidowitz."
USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"
47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans,https://www.npr.org,['Cat Schuknecht'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727002406/47-states-call-on-betsy-devos-to-forgive-student-loans-for-disabled-veterans,"47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Updated Sunday at 2:14 p.m. ET

On Friday, three days before Memorial Day, attorneys general for 47 states wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to automatically forgive student loans for eligible disabled veterans.

The Department of Education has identified more than 42,000 veterans who qualify for a federal program known as Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, or TPD, that offers to relieve borrowers from repaying certain government student loans. These veterans, the letter says, shoulder over $1 billion in education debt that could be forgiven.

To get the benefit, veterans must first apply for the program. According to information obtained by the group Veterans Education Success through a Freedom of Information Act request, almost 60 percent of eligible veterans had defaulted on a loan payment as of April 2018. Yet only about 20 percent had applied to the loan forgiveness program.

The attorneys general want that to change. In the letter — which was also signed by attorneys general for the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories — they propose making the forgiveness program automatic for veterans who have been identified by the Department of Education.

""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,"" the letter reads. ""There is no statutory or legal requirement that the Department of Education demand that eligible veterans affirmatively apply for TPD discharges before the Department will forgive their loans.""

In a statement to NPR, the Education Department said it recognized the sacrifices that veterans make for their country, adding that it has worked to streamline the TPD discharge process.

""While we have worked to make this process as easy and as seamless as possible for veterans, the last thing we want to do is cause unintended consequences for them,"" according to the statement.

The department said discharges could raise veterans' tax bills or inhibit them from taking out more student loans.

In their letter to DeVos, the attorneys general dismissed the department's concern about increasing borrowers' tax bills.

""[F]ederal tax law now excludes loan discharges for disabled borrowers from taxable income, and most states' tax codes do likewise,"" said the letter. ""Moreover, we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill.""

The letter from the attorneys general follows at least two other similar letters that Republican and Democratic members of Congress sent to DeVos last year."
Mark Meadows views fresh 'Strzok coverup' material at DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-views-fresh-strzok-coverup-material-at-doj,"Rep. Mark Meadows said he was at the Justice Department to review new information about former FBI agent Peter Strzok.

The North Carolina Republican was spotted at Justice Department headquarters in D.C. with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday.

Asked by a reporter why he was there, Meadows said, ""I was reviewing text messages and new correspondence that pertains to the Strzok coverup.""

Hours after their visit, President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Meadows and Jordan's visit to the Justice Department also comes after House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes said he learned that an August 2016 text from Strzok about an ""insurance policy"" had to do with the FBI's use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Both Strzok and Lisa Page, who are no longer with the FBI, have been a focus of GOP investigators concerned about potential bias within the Justice Department and FBI."
Trump Takes Credit for Obama’s Gains for Vets,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/05/27/trump-takes-credit-for-obamas-gains-for-vets/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful on the occasion of Memorial Day, President Donald Trump and his Veterans Affairs secretary are claiming full credit for health care improvements that were underway before they took office.

Trump said he passed a private-sector health care program, Veterans Choice, after failed attempts by past presidents for the last “45 years.” That’s not true. The Choice program, which allows veterans to see doctors outside the government-run VA system at taxpayer expense, was first passed in 2014 under President Barack Obama.

Trump’s VA secretary, Robert Wilkie, also is distorting the facts. Faulting previous “bad leadership” at VA, Wilkie suggested it was his own efforts that improved waiting times at VA medical centers and brought new offerings of same-day mental health service. The problem: The study cited by Wilkie on wait times covers the period from 2014 to 2017, before Wilkie took the helm as VA secretary. Same-day mental health services at VA were started during the Obama administration under Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin.

A look at the claims:

TRUMP: “We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability to give our veterans the care that they deserve and they have been trying to pass these things for 45 years.” — Montoursville, Pennsylvania, rally on May 20.

THE FACTS: Wrong. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to get Congress to pass Veterans Choice; Obama did it in the wake of a scandal at VA’s medical center in Phoenix, where some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) to a VA facility.

Trump did expand eligibility for the program. Now, starting June 6, veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.

Still, VA’s top health official, Dr. Richard Stone, described the new program’s start to “almost be a non-event” in testimony to Congress. That’s in part because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at VA. In 2018, 34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians, down from 36 percent in 2017.

Also key to the Choice program’s success is an overhaul of VA’s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of them with private physicians, a process expected to take up to 10 years. Wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded Choice program is “years” away.

WILKIE: “The first thing I did was change out the leadership at VA. … (The president) also allowed me to change out leadership in the VA centers. If someone wasn’t walking the post, getting to know the people who work for her or him, or getting to know those veterans, they had to leave. And, as a result, the Journal of the American Medical Association this year said that our waiting times are now as good or better than any in the private sector.” — interview Thursday with Fox News.

THE FACTS: It’s true that a study by the medical association came out in January that found wait times at VA medical centers on average were better than the private sector. But the improvement wasn’t a “result” of anything that Wilkie did: The study involved a period largely covering the Obama administration — and before Wilkie became acting VA secretary in late March 2018.

In fact, in a VA press release in January announcing the study’s results, Wilkie credits the department’s “concerted” effort to improve access to care “since 2014.”

The study covered four specialties, primary care, dermatology, cardiology and orthopedics.

It found that in 2014, the average wait time at VA medical centers was 22.5 days, compared with 18.7 days in the private sector, which was not statistically different. By 2017, the wait time at VA improved to 17.7 days, while increasing to 29.8 days for private doctors. Wait times at VA medical centers were shorter in all specialties except orthopedics.

According to the study, the number of patients seen yearly in VA increased slightly between 2014 and 2017, to about 5.1 million. VA patient satisfaction also rose, according to patient surveys cited in the study.

WILKIE: The VA “had suffered from bad leadership. And that’s a bipartisan comment. And the second thing I had to do was make sure that as we approach our veteran population that we make sure that they are at the center, their needs are at the center of what we do … I think we’ve had it backwards at VA for many years. … One of the things that we’re doing at VA is that we have same-day mental health service. … It is huge.” — interview with Fox News.

THE FACTS: Same-day mental health service started at VA before Trump took office in January 2017, let alone Wilkie.

VA’s effort to provide same-day primary and mental-health care when medically necessary at every VA medical center was publicized in April 2016 under the Obama administration. At the time, Shulkin was helping lead the effort as VA’s top health official. By late 2016, the department’s blog announced that the goal of same-day mental health services would be achieved by year’s end.

A Dec. 23, 2016, article in the Harvard Business Review cites new same-day services at all VA hospitals as evidence of notable progress at the department. Shulkin, who was then named by Trump to be his VA secretary, told Congress in late January 2017 the services already were fully in place.

Trump selected Wilkie to be his VA secretary after firing Shulkin in March 2018 because of ethics charges and internal rebellion at the department over the role of private care for veterans. Trump’s initial replacement choice, White House doctor Ronny Jackson, withdrew after allegations of workplace misconduct surfaced. While Wilkie has been credited by both parties in Congress for bringing stability to the department, the VA improvements he attributes to himself this past week are misplaced."

WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show that Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog.

The decision by Mr. Pruitt was notable because it came as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was campaigning for a third term and trying to bring a Foxconn factory, and thousands of new manufacturing jobs, to a part of the state where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.

Mr. Walker ultimately lost his re-election bid to Tony Evers, a Democrat. And Foxconn , the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, announced in January that it was reconsidering its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, though the company later said it would build a smaller factory in the state.

But, in spring 2018, as the governor’s race was heating up, Mr. Walker championed the Foxconn deal and the 13,000 jobs it promised to create. The factory, however, also threatened to create a new source of pollution in the region."

Among the charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images legal DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

Story Continued Below

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

"Department of Education agenda: Reading, writing and religion",https://www.salon.com,[],05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.salon.com/2019/05/26/department-of-education-agenda-reading-writing-and-religion_partner/,"The Trump administration has proposed a 12% cut in Department of Education spending under its yearly budget. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is busily eliminating programs to help public schools and promoting private education efforts under the motto of choice.

Yet somehow, magically, there is support for the growth of teaching Christian Bible classes in public schools.

Advertisement:

Once again, we have an out-and-out statement about what is important in this administration—not school shootings, not affirmative efforts to improve public education, not help with student debt or even the pursuit of growing sexual assault on school campuses.

Counseling Today magazine argues, for example, that it has become necessary to lobby seriously to keep federal money for school mental health. The Trump administration’s federal budget proposal cut $8.5 billion from the Department of Education, including the Student Support and Academic Enrichment program. That program supported, among other things, mental health, school security and safety, community engagement — the kind of programs that would address the issues we hear after every school shooting.

Instead, Washington Post religion writer Julie Zauzmer detailed the movement of church Bible classes from churches into public schools. She took us to Kentucky, where a new state law — one of several pending in other states — is encouraging public high schools to teach the Bible, not as part of a survey of religions, but as Bible study.

Through a legislative effort Project Blitz, activists on the religious right, have drafted a law that encourages Bible classes in public schools and persuaded at least 10 state legislatures to introduce versions of it this year. Georgia and Arkansas recently passed bills that are awaiting their governors’ signatures. Among the powerful fans of these public-school Bible classes is President Trump. “Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible,” Trump tweeted in January. “Starting to make a turn back? Great!”

Tipping point

According to the Post, proponents of Bible instruction, including Chuck Stetson, who publishes a textbook that he says is in use in more than 600 public schools across the nation, are enthused. “We’re not too far away from a tipping point. Instead of having to find a reason to teach the Bible in public schools academically, as part of a good education, you’re going to have to find a reason not to do it,” Stetson said. “When the president of the United States gives us a shout-out, that’s pretty crazy…. It’s got the momentum now.”

On the other side, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a nonpartisan advocacy group organizing opposition to the state laws, coordinated a statement signed by numerous religious groups that oppose Project Blitz’s efforts.

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled that school-led Bible reading is an unconstitutional religious practice. But the court noted that teaching the Bible was allowed: “Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.”

""Free exercise of religious values""

Both those in favor of Bible classes and against see the Bible as a key component of a well-rounded education, particularly if part of history classes. Sometimes schools have offered “released time” rules that let students use part of their school day attending church-taught classes. But that is not what is called for in the state bills supported by Project Blitz, an effort of the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, which describes its purpose as protecting “the free exercise of traditional Judeo-Christian religious values and beliefs in the public square.”

The model for many states is Kentucky, where state standards for elective Bible education became the law in 2017. The American Civil Liberties Union swiftly responded, issuing a letter that said it would closely monitor all school districts in the state. The organization flagged four school districts in Kentucky, warning that the materials used to teach the Bible in those schools suggested they were violating the Constitution and might lead to a future ACLU lawsuit. Two of the four districts have since stopped offering a Bible class, saying student interest was low. In the other two, rural counties, dominated by evangelical Christians, teachers lead prayers over the loudspeaker.

The content of these classes has clashed with conclusions reached elsewhere in science classes, say, concerning evolution or even information about other religions.

DeVos has made clear that she supports moving public school support to parochial schools. It would seem that several states just want to merge the two."
USDA to shift some inspector tasks to pork plant workers — in everything but name,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

The Agriculture Department is attempting to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

At a Smithfield hog plant in central Illinois, federal meat inspectors examine pig carcasses on the slaughter line, remove diseased and contaminated meat, and mark it “condemned.” They have the exclusive responsibility for performing this work.

At another hog plant about 75 miles away, JBS USA Food Co. employees are part of a long-running test program in which they perform tasks similar to those done by federal inspectors. When plant employees do this food safety work, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says they are “sorting” and “removing” or “disposing” of the meat, not inspecting or condemning it.

The shift in language is central to the USDA’s efforts to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors.

The proposed new inspection system transfers some responsibilities that traditionally have been handled by USDA inspectors to employees of pork plants. The USDA says it has studied the new inspection system for 20 years and that pork products from the test plants are at least as safe as those produced by traditional inspection. They say federal inspectors will spend less time visually assessing pork and more time ensuring sanitary conditions are maintained throughout the plant.

Several food safety lawyers, Democratic members of Congress and a former agriculture official say that the USDA is using sleight-of-hand tactics to get around legal mandates that have been in place for more than a century. Those mandates require federal regulators to inspect — and either pass or condemn — every live hog that arrives at a slaughterhouse and every hog carcass on the slaughter line.

“They are playing these linguistics games,” said Rena Steinzor, a food safety expert who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “What they are doing is illegal. If they have a problem with the statute because they think it’s a waste of energy for federal inspectors to eyeball every single animal, they could go to Congress. . . . The Constitution requires them to do that, not gut the law by regulation.”

The test hog-inspection program is expected to expand this summer after the agency approves new rules. Certain pork plants would have the option of using the new inspection system. Thirty-five plants plan to join the five test plants in using the new program; they would produce 90 percent of the pork consumed in the United States.

The number of federal inspectors on hog slaughter lines at the plants new to the program will be reduced from 365 to 218, a 40 percent cut, according to a USDA analysis published in the Federal Register. The overall number of inspectors at those plants will drop from 400 to 288, a decline of 28 percent, according to figures provided by the USDA.

The new rules will allow slaughter-line speeds to run as fast as the plant desires. The current cap on line speed is 1,106 hogs per hour, or 18 per minute.

Records show there have been no serious public health problems or pork food poisoning outbreaks linked to the test plants. Critics of the test plants say they have more food safety problems than the traditional plants; the USDA disputes that.

A half-dozen food safety groups, along with the USDA inspectors’ union, say they are concerned that increased line speeds and federal staff reductions on those lines will cause diseased and contaminated meat to slip by the remaining inspectors. They also cite an inherent conflict of interest among plant employees because they work for pork producers and not the public. Training for those workers, they point out, is also done entirely at the plant owners’ discretion.

Pat Basu, a former chief veterinarian for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) who retired in 2018, is critical of the proposed regulation. He says the agency is using semantic tricks as it reassigns duties to plant employees that the law says inspectors should perform.

“These are word games they are playing,” Basu said. “What they are really doing is removing hogs that are diseased and contaminated. Why are these suddenly not inspections?”

USDA officials say that they are modernizing the inspection process and that the new system will not violate existing laws and regulations. They say the agency has the authority to change how federal inspections are performed so long as a carcass-by-carcass inspection is performed on all of the hogs presented by the plant as fit for human consumption.

“In the proposed rules, we are just giving the plant employees the opportunity to more fully execute their [food safety] plan before we make that final verification that the product is safe,” said Phil Bronstein, an assistant administrator with the FSIS.

Bronstein acknowledged that under the proposed rules, the number of USDA inspectors on the slaughter line in most large plants will be reduced from seven to three. Bronstein said the remaining inspectors would be more experienced and have a higher level of training. Also, the number of USDA inspectors who will roam large plants to ensure sanitation procedures are in place and to check on animal welfare will grow from one to two, officials said.

At least 17 members of Congress, all Democrats, have stated their opposition to the new system. “It is appalling to watch the Trump Administration and [USDA] leadership justify their gutting of hog slaughter inspections with meaningless technicalities and semantics,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee and chair of the Food Safety Caucus, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Who do they think they are fooling? This giveaway to corporate special interests means company-based employees will carry out responsibilities that are currently performed by government inspectors.”

Defining inspection

In addition to the term “condemnation,” other transferred tasks have also been given different names under the proposed new program, records show.

For example, when plant workers have examined a hog’s head and internal organs, looking for and removing signs of disease and contamination, they have “trimmed dressing defects and contamination, and identified pathology defects on the carcasses,” the proposed regulation says. They have not inspected the animal, the USDA says.

“The agency has trivialized what we have done and what we do by calling it sorting and other consumer protections,” said Charles “Stan” Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which represents inspectors. “The plant workers are clearly expected to do food safety inspections.” Painter said that given the increased role plant workers will have on slaughter lines, he believes federal inspectors are “now nothing more than window dressing at the end of the line.”

The USDA has long used different terminology for the same tasks, depending on whether they were performed by federal inspectors or employees in the test plants. But it has become more steadfast in asserting the need for others to adopt its language, and the proposed new inspection system has focused attention on the matter.

The proposed regulation emphasizes that plant employees’ primary jobs involve “non-food safety standards concerned primarily with diseases of no public health significance.”

However, records show that nearly every transferred task involves food safety issues. For example, when plant workers are removing defects, such as blemishes, from a carcass, they might also trim abscesses that could be a sign of a serious disease or trim spots with fecal contamination that may contain dangerous pathogens.

When they remove internal organs and examine them, they are looking for signs of disease such as septicemia, which would mean the entire carcass could be filled with harmful bacteria.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

“They are, in a sense, performing part of the inspection process, doing a pre-screening,” said Daniel Kovich, director of science and technology with the National Pork Producers Council. “Yes, they are looking at it, and they are supposed to move things from the line that are not supposed to pass inspection. But only FSIS can inspect an animal.”

In an interview, USDA officials acknowledged that many of the tasks handled by plant workers would be related to food safety but said they are not inspections.

Although there is no cap on how fast line speeds may run, the USDA anticipates about a 12.5 percent increase at the large plants under the new system, records show.

Zach Corrigan, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Food & Water Watch, said that means the fewer remaining inspectors would need to examine an average of 6.1 heads per minute versus about 2.7 heads per minute in the traditional system.

Corrigan said the new system places a heavy burden on the USDA inspectors who remain on the line and must inspect every carcass. He said the new system will sometimes make it impossible for the USDA to comply with the law.

“The definition of inspection is a ‘critical appraisal,’ ” said Corrigan, citing a 2000 court case that dealt with USDA inspections. “That legal threshold cannot be met when you remove inspectors from the lines and you increase the line speeds.” He called the USDA’s varying terms for the same food safety tasks “Orwellian doublespeak.”

The USDA said a 2002 legal ruling found that the hog test program did not violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act. However, that court decision was limited to the test program and said it “may not necessarily foreshadow the outcome of judicial review of such future regulations.”

The USDA says only a federal inspector or veterinarian has the power to place the department’s mark of inspection on the pork — under the traditional and the alternative new system.

The department also says the word “inspection” is a technical term and can be applied only to situations in which a USDA inspector or veterinarian has performed a food safety oversight task. At meat plants, veterinarians are typically the highest-ranking federal official.

In response to a recent Washington Post article that said the proposed rules would shift much of the power and responsibility for food safety inspections at hog plants to plant employees, the USDA wrote: “By law, only federal inspection personnel conduct inspections of animals, carcasses and parts — and USDA inspection personnel inspect every carcass and part before it leaves the slaughterhouse and processing plant.”

However, inside the test pork plants, USDA inspectors use the term “inspector” — as in “TS [trimming and sorting] inspector” — to refer to their plant employee counterparts. For example, in a 2013 citation for a food safety violation, a USDA inspector said a diseased hog had “passed all three of your TS inspectors” without them spotting the problem, and the carcass had to be condemned.

And in job advertisements, owners of the test pork plants consistently call some employees inspectors or use the word inspector in job descriptions. In a recent job posting by JBS, “quality control inspector” was used as a job title, and it said tasks include performing “various quality control functions including but not limited to line inspection, audits.” JBS did not respond to several requests for comment.

Spotting problems

Five USDA inspectors said in sworn affidavits, taken by the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, that plant workers routinely miss problems in the test plants that they believe are potential food hazards.

They also said plant workers aren’t in a position to stand up to plant supervisors when they do spot problems.

“On numerous occasions, I witnessed them fail to spot abscesses, lesions, fecal matter and other defects that would render an animal unsafe or unwholesome,” said one inspector, who was not named. “Furthermore, plant inspectors don’t actually want to shut off the line to deal with the problems they spot on the job. . . . Obviously their employer will terminate them if they do it too many times.”

Outside evaluations of the test plants have exposed problems. The most recent review was done in 2018 by Food & Water Watch. In its assessment, the group compared USDA inspection reports from the five test plants with those of five comparably sized traditional plants.

The group received copies of citations from 2013 to 2016 through a Freedom of Information Act request. In all, more than 3,500 citations were issued by USDA inspectors to the 10 plants. Food & Water Watch determined that 73 percent of citations issued for a carcass contaminated with feces, bile, hair or dirt were at the five test plants.

In the five test plants, 32 citations were issued after inspectors spotted carcasses that were “so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.” Five comparably sized traditional hog plants received no citations for this offense, which is considered to be one of the most serious food safety violations because it can lead to possible recalls and food-poisoning outbreaks.

Carmen Rottenberg, who runs the FSIS, said the evaluation was not a meaningful comparison. She said citations to the test plants were higher because plant workers had assumed more responsibilities. When they fail to properly perform these new jobs, she said, the plants are then cited for those failures.

“We are holding the plants accountable for a lot more tasks,” Rottenberg said.

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Inspection reports illustrate some of the problems USDA inspectors found with the work done by plant employees.

At one test pork plant in Michigan, employees assigned to remove sick and diseased live hogs overlooked one that had collapsed and died, then presented it to USDA inspectors as fit for slaughter.

At an Illinois test plant, its workers failed to identify more than a dozen abscesses in the internal organs of a slaughtered hog — a clear sign that the entire carcass was contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

And in Minnesota, employees at a test plant overlooked patches of yellow and green material on the chest wall and hindquarters of a hog carcass. It was fecal matter that could have contained dangerous pathogens.

The Food & Water Watch evaluation followed two independent government audits of the test program that were critical of the alternative inspection system. In 2013, the USDA’s inspector general found that three of the five test plants were among the worst in the nation for food safety and sanitary problems. Also in 2013, the Government Accountability Office raised food safety concerns due to the faster line speeds in those plants.

In the USDA’s self assessment the following year, the agency said its data showed the test plants “are performing as well as comparable large [traditional] market hog establishments and are meeting FSIS expectations.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) and 16 other Democratic lawmakers opposed to the new inspection system asked the USDA inspector general’s office last month to investigate whether the department properly disclosed data on worker safety during the public review and comment period for the proposed regulations.

In a statement to The Post, Kaptur cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that say 1 in 6 Americans get sick and 3,000 die because of foodborne diseases each year: “If we are to improve those numbers, we cannot hand over the integrity of inspections to an industry focused more on profit and less on human and animal welfare.”"

For those who enjoy heading south of the border for vacations, the U.S. Department of State has updated travel warnings for Mexican states where tourists are more vulnerable to crime.

Ahead of Memorial Day weekend, the Mexican state of Tamaulipas - which borders south Texas - is on the list of Do Not Travel states because of high crime and possible kidnapping.

Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common in the state.

The first quarter of 2019 set a new record for homicides in Mexico, where violent crime has claimed more than 250,000 lives since 2006, according to the Associated press.

The State Department cautioned people on where not to go and also offered tips on how to avoid becoming a victim.

The Mexico Travel Advisory is divided into four levels of caution from the least dangerous – the ""exercise normal precautions"" list, to the most dangerous – the ""do not travel"" list.

EPA wants to triple level of rocket fuel chemical allowed in drinking water,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-rocket-fuel-chemical-drinking-water-e6ee56c9ee13/,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to raise the threshold for a chemical found in rocket fuel to triple the previous limit allowed in drinking water supplies. This is the first new drinking water rule introduced by the agency since the George W. Bush administration.

In the EPA’s latest move to weaken environmental and health protections, it released a notice on Thursday requesting public comment on its proposal to raise the maximum level allowed for the chemical perchlorate — which is linked to thyroid problems — to 56 micrograms per liter.

This is three times higher than what the EPA previously recommended as a safe level for drinking water (15 micrograms per liter). The previous recommendation was just an advisory to help guide states, as opposed to an enforceable limit, which is what the agency is now proposing.

In addition to this change, the EPA is seeking comment on three other alternate options: setting the level to 18 micrograms per liter, to 90 micrograms per liter, or simply abolishing the rule regulating perchlorate in drinking water.

The news comes after a decade-long delay following a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) demanding the EPA set an enforceable standard for the chemical.

“This is enough to make you sick—literally,” Erik Olson, senior director for health and food at NRDC, said in a statement on the new proposed limits. “As a result, millions of Americans will be at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of this toxic chemical in their drinking water.”

In addition to rocket fuel, perchlorate is found in fireworks, airbags, matches, signal flares, some food packaging, and munitions. Health risks from exposure include disruption to the thyroid’s ability to produce hormones needed for normal growth and development, along with potentially causing reproductive problems.

According to NRDC, scientists recommend a limit that is “10 to more than 50 times lower” than what the EPA is currently proposing. Two states currently have much stricter, enforceable standards than required by the EPA: California (at 6 micrograms per liter) and Massachusetts (at 2 micrograms per liter).

The EPA’s proposal comes as the agency has been dragging its feet on implementing a similar legally enforceable standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a group of man-made chemicals that are toxic to humans and can increase the risk of cancer — in drinking water. Currently there is no maximum level for PFAS chemicals under EPA rules. Numerous communities in 43 states are currently suffering from the toxic chemical polluting their water.

These delays or weakening of chemical standards come despite EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler recent arguments that water issues are the world’s leading environmental crisis.

“This is another Trump administration gift to polluters and water utilities that have lobbied to be off the hook for cleaning up the problem,” Olson said of the proposed change to perchlorate.

The Trump EPA features several top officials who once worked for the chemical industry. This includes a former Koch Industries staffer, David Dunlap, who worked on water and chemical policy and now serves as deputy EPA assistant administrator for research and development, and a former chemical industry attorney, Steven Cook, who oversees Superfund sites. Meanwhile, Nancy Beck, the Trump administration appointee who oversees the EPA’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups.

What’s more, a 2009 House Committee report found that Beck, a former Bush administration official, was slowing progress in confirming the health threats from chemicals like perchlorate found in drinking water. The committee concluded she had been “inappropriately intervening in agency science.”

Ties to the chemical industry also extend to Wheeler. In a letter sent to the EPA administrator last month, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D- MD), accused Wheeler of failing to disclose his previous lobbying on behalf of Darling Ingredients, which is involved in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA."
USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth,https://www.politico.com,['Catherine Boudreau'],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/agriculture-dept-ends-job-corps-conservation-centers-1472208,"The program — known as the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. Employment USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has decided to end a U.S. Forest Service work program that trains at-risk youth to be first responders to natural disasters, maintain national forests and work on rural infrastructure projects.

The program — known for operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. As part of the move, the department intends to close nine of 25 centers, according to a statement released Friday. The action could lead to a significant cut of the number of Forest Service employees.

Story Continued Below

“There are reasons why the secretary made this decision,” Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen told staff members during a conference call announcing the move on Friday morning, less than an hour before the Department of Labor’s news release. She said she learned of the decision only four days ago.

“Perdue has a goal of efficient and effective government,” Christiansen said, adding that the secretary believes the mission of the program better aligns with the Labor Department. The Forest Service’s Civilian Conservation Centers is the only Labor Department Jobs Corps initiative operated by federal employees.

“This was a high-level policy discussion and decision. It in no way reflects on your excellent work and dedication,” Christiansen said.

Perdue, in a letter to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, wrote the move would help the Forest Service prioritize its “core natural resource mission to improve the condition and resilience of our nation’s forests, and step away from activities and programs that are not essential to that core mission.”

Forest Service officials did not disclose how many employees will be affected by the change, which is expected to be completed by September. However, a spokesperson for the National Federation of Federal Employees, the union representing Forest Service workers, told POLITICO that as many as 1,065 workers could be let go.

Another Forest Service official on the conference call said the agency will request authority for a reduction in force, which must go through the Office of Personnel Management because of the size of the staff cuts. The Civilian Conservation Centers closing are in states such as Montana, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Forest Service official said that agency will try to help employees find other jobs within the department and push “voluntary separation incentives,” or buyouts.

The Labor Department said 16 of the 25 centers will be replaced by new contract operators or a partnership overseen by DOL. The announcement added that the “new operators will implement new policies and approaches that will offer students the skills they need to earn an independent living and succeed in meaningful in-demand jobs.”

The Civilian Conservation Corps dates to the Great Depression but was disbanded during World War II. The current iteration was designed during the Johnson administration as part of its Jobs Corps effort. Today, thousands of young people aged 16 to 24 from low-income communities participate in the program.

“During hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, these students are some of the first people to respond,” said Brittany Holder, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Federal Employees. The organization, in a recent review of the Civilian Conservation Corps, found that in 2017, more than 300 students were sent to wildfire assignments, providing about 200,000 hours of support, among a range of other services.

The union argues the program has been a success and that the administration is misrepresenting data to make its case to privatize the centers. The Trump administration — in annual budget requests — and Republican lawmakers have criticized the program as being wasteful of taxpayer money and having little accountability.

“They have no plan for the students, no idea how to stop the loss of 613,000 hours of student service, and are not concerned about the impact on rural jobs and local economies,” Beverly Tobin-Ford, the union’s Forest Service Council vice president, said in April. “It’s as if this administration just decided to do this without reservation or any forethought.”

10-year Treasury yield drops to 19-month low as trade fights threaten US growth,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/28/us-bonds-wall-street-set-to-monitor-economic-data-treasury-auctions.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to a 19-month low Tuesday as Wall Street grew more certain that the U.S.-China trade war will last longer and afflict GDP growth more than first thought.

At around 11:45 a.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 2.269%, a 19-month low. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond yield traded at 2.699%, its lowest level since 2017; the 2-year Treasury note yielded 2.133%.

The 3-month Treasury bill yielded 2.361%, keeping a portion of the yield curve inverted. The German 10-year bund yield hit a low of -0.163%, its lowest level since Sept. 30, 2016.

The U.S. bond market was closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day.

President Donald Trump said from Japan on Monday the U.S. was ""not ready"" to make a deal with China, adding to recent investor angst that the tit-for-tat trade war between the world's two largest economies is far from over.

Washington and Beijing have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods since the start of 2018, battering financial markets and souring business and consumer sentiment. Most recently, the U.S. hiked the tax rate on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% and threatened to imposed stricter levies on another $300 billion worth of Chinese products.

That's kept a lid on Treasury rates in recent months as retailers, chipmakers and other trade-exposed sectors of the American economy scrambled to find new supply chains and relocate operations. But lowering interest rates — often applauded on Wall Street for their ability to encourage borrowing — may not be a positive sign in the current environment, according to Credit Suisse chief market strategist Jonathan Golub.

""Since troughing in late December, the S&P 500 has returned 20.2%, while 10-year Treasury yields have fallen from 2.74% to 2.32%. Simple math would suggest that falling rates contributed to this improvement in stock prices. However, a more thorough analysis challenges this consensus view,"" Golub said in a note Tuesday.

""Higher rates from here should support further upside for equities, while a potential Fed rate cut would be less positive for stock prices than many investors believe,"" he added.

A growing number of investors now believe that the U.S. central bank may have to cut its overnight lending rate later in 2019 as the waning effects of Trump's tax cuts and mounting trade disputes weigh on economic forecasts."
Atlanta Braves Latin American scouting records requested by Justice Department,https://tomahawktake.com,"['Jonathan Magel', 'Alan Carpenter', 'Scott Polacek']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://tomahawktake.com/2019/05/26/atlanta-braves-latin-american-scouting-records-subpoenaed-by-doj/,"Atlanta Braves must send Latin American scouting reports to the Department of Justice.

According to a report in the Washington Post, The US Department of Justice (DoJ) served subpoenas on the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Diego Padres “seeking records relating to scouting and signing of players from Latin America.”

While this report is dated May 23rd, there was no indication of when these subpoenas were actually issued, though the investigation is known to have been in progress for close to a year now.

Last September Jeff Passan reported that a Federal Grand Jury subpoenaed officials from several teams including “at least one former Atlanta Braves official as well as people involved with the signing of Cuban star Hector Olivera.”

Agents from the FBI have spearheaded the investigation, according to sources familiar with it, and lawyers from the Department of Justice who specialize in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases – which typically involve bribery of foreign officials – are involved as well.

This news comes just a year after MLB severely sanctioned the Atlanta Braves for their actions in Latin America during the John Coppolella/John Hart regime.

Alan wondered at the time why Gordon Blakeley’s name never appeared in Passan’s post, as he helped the Yankees scout and sign in Latin America before coming to Atlanta to assist Coppolella. We may now have an answer,

What’s it all about Alfie?

The probe centers on something called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which Alan explained in layman’s terms in his original post.

the provisions of the FCPA are an attempt to level the playing field for those doing business internationally by telling US citizens that they can’t pay a bribe to (or anything that looks like there’s a bribe) to a ‘foreign official’ to facilitate a business transaction.

In the Post article, Hobson says that more than a dozen people associated with the game, including scouts and a former MLB official (Bud Selig comes to mind) testified before the Grand Jury, as well as players and at least one agent.

The DoJ indicted a native Cuban agent Bart Hernandez sports and trainer Julio Estrada also from Cuba. At their trial, documents produced suggested the New York Yankees were aware crimes were being committed.

… State Department document summarized an August 2012 interview … between a U.S. consulate official and a Cuban pitcher, Omar Luis … (that Luis) “Was directly recruited from Cuba by the Yankees,” the State Department official wrote. When asked about how he got residency in Haiti, the report said the player replied, “The Yankees contacted a Haitian functionary who make [sic] it all happen.”

Blakeley left the Yankees in 2014 and joined the Atlanta Braves."
California probably will pick next president,https://www.sfchronicle.com,"['Joe Mathews', 'Syndicated Columnist', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Heather Knight', 'Rachel Swan', 'J.K. Dineen', 'Tony Bravo', 'Bill Van Niekerken']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/California-probably-will-pick-next-president-13896017.php,"Beto O’Rourke falls face first into the water while trying to surf off La Jolla.

Joe Biden dons a paper hat to take orders — “I love mine ‘animal style’ too, ma’am” — in an In-N-Out drive-through.

Bernie Sanders, desperate to catch front-runner Biden, packs a bong with legally grown California cannabis — and smokes it. The meme breaks the internet.

For now, these scenes are merely the product of one columnist’s imagination. But in the next 10 months, don’t be surprised if they show up in the reality show we call the presidential race.

Traditionally, California has had little say in picking presidents. Other Americans — out of a commitment to electing steady, even boring presidents — allowed dull states — Iowa and New Hampshire — to drive the process.

But Americans no longer are attached to sober-minded presidents. That cultural shift — in combination with an early California primary (March 3), and an unpopular Republican president — means that the Golden State might well pick the next president.

The process of selection should involve the whole state — because Democrats decided to allocate delegates to anyone who wins at least 15% of the vote in any California congressional district. While more delegates are allocated to districts with more Democrats — which will push candidates to spend more time in Democratic-heavy coastal districts — lesser-known contenders are likely to make hay by going into the state’s interior to pick up delegates, in districts where there may be less competition.

The race will not be easy for anyone, even California’s own Sen. Kamala Harris, who could struggle to meet expectations that she should win her home state. And while California has been represented in the Senate exclusively by women since 1992, it remains to be seen whether it is favorable turf for women seeking the presidency. Yes, Hillary Clinton won the 2008 and 2016 presidential primaries here, but, as a state, we’ve been less inclined to select women to executive positions. California has never had a female governor, and Los Angeles has never had a female mayor.

California is also not fertile ground for a Republican challenger to the president. Republicans here like Trump nearly as much as Republicans nationally.

But it’s not just about the candidates; California is likely to shape the issues of the presidential campaign. Previous presidential races have focused on the economy, health care and national security, but housing and homelessness, as the top priorities of many Californians, will become national issues next year. Other lower-profile issues that divide Californians — like water and high-speed rail — also should become big points of contention as presidential candidates spend more time here. And California teachers’ unions have been asking candidates to back federal regulations to curtail the growth of charter schools as a condition of their support.

Climate change debates — over the state’s policies to curtail it through cap-and-trade, and growing anxiety over disasters like the fire that destroyed Paradise — also could move from California to the national arena. And our state’s commitment to protecting immigrants and their families, regardless of legal status, should shape the race. In California, perhaps more than anywhere else, Biden is likely to face potent attacks from rivals who point to his service in an Obama administration that engaged in massive deportation of immigrants.

But our votes are not the only way that Californians will impact the selection of the president. Despite new methods of online fundraising from small donors, the state’s richest people will have even more power and influence than usual, as candidates grow desperate for funding in such a large field. The struggle for attention also could make the backing of Hollywood figures even more important. Look for next year’s Oscars, which will take place just three weeks before the California primary, to be the most political in history, with perhaps some candidates walking the red carpet to boost their name recognition.

But it is through technology that Californians are likely to have the most impact on the identity of the next president. This cuts many ways. The decisions made by Menlo Park-based Facebook in handling political content will affect Americans’ very perceptions of the contest. And, of course, the other California titans of the internet, including Google and Twitter, could potentially be harnessed by those who mean American democracy harm. At the same time, Facebook and other tech giants are becoming a major issue in the race. Should they be broken up? How do we defend our privacy from them?

There are reasons to worry about a president picked by California. This is a wonderful place of beaches and innovation, but it is also the volatile, crazy state that gave us Proposition 13 and the Kardashians. If we Californians give America a president who reflects our state’s true preferences and character, the whole world may feel as though it has smoked something.

""First of all, that is not happening. We're separating children in maybe one case a day out of the 3,000 families arriving,"" Kevin McAleenan said Thursday in an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""It's very rare,"" he added. ""It's for the safety of the child first and foremost.""

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

McAleenan, 47, a native of Hawaii, was appointed to DHS by President Trump in April, after the departure of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He previously served as a commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a unit of DHS.

On Thursday's show, McAleenan responded to a clip of MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski talking about family separations on Thursday morning.

""This is our responsibility as a country and as a nation,"" Brzezinski said. ""We are not being given answers as to what is happening to small, young children, to teenagers, to girls, to boys [who were] being taken away from their families, from their parents and left alone in our custody.""

McAleenan also discussed his recent appearances on Capitol Hill asking for funding, including a hearing where Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that children in U.S. custody were living in poor conditions and alluded to news reports that several children in U.S. custody had died.

McAleenan told Ingraham that he objected to Underwood's depiction of the situation.

""It's a sad state of affairs in our politics but we have an actual crisis and we have solutions on the table and clarity of what the men and women on the border need from Congress and yet that is the kind of thing we are hearing,"" McAleenan said.

McAleenan also spoke about illnesses afflicting migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""We are seeing younger children arriving sicker every single day. We had an H1N1 outbreak yesterday at McAllen [Texas] station, the infectious disease with the teenager who passed away on Monday. It looks like he had the flu, a very virulent strain of the flu, H1N1. We have seen measles, we've seen mumps, folks in ICE custody that are quarantined due to mumps. It's a tremendous challenge,"" McAleenan said, adding that the situation with smugglers exacerbates the illnesses."
US Energy Department Wants to See Lighter Offshore Wind Turbines,https://www.greentechmedia.com,[],,,,https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-energy-department-wants-to-see-lighter-offshore-wind-turbines,"Offshore wind power could be a lot cheaper if the generators inside the turbine nacelles were lighter. The U.S. Department of Energy is here to help.

DOE recently made available up to $8 million for four projects aiming to “develop more efficient, smaller, and lighter-weight generators.” According to DOE, the prospective designs could result in 50 percent smaller and lighter generators, which could reduce the levelized cost of wind energy by as much as 25 percent.

With an eye toward the mammoth wind turbines coming online by the mid-2020s — GE announced plans in March 2018 to commercially deploy a 12-megawatt offshore turbine in 2021 — the Energy Department wants to nudge manufacturers to build generators that can more easily be hoisted atop hubs topping out more than 100 meters above the waterline.

Project teams led by ABB, WEG Electric Corporation, American Superconductor and General Electric Global Research, respectively, were each to receive up to $400,000 to design a wind turbine generator capable of scaling to a capacity of 10 megawatts or more. ABB subsequently confirmed to Greentech Media it will not pursue the research project it had planned under the DOE grant, but the other three remain active.

After an initial one-year conceptual design phase, DOE will select one of the projects to receive up to $6.4 million for the construction of a scaled prototype. The full research program is expected to last four years.

Next-gen direct drive generators

The teams involved in the DOE-funded research project are developing direct-drive technologies for their planned high-efficiency, lighter generators.

Direct-drive machines generate electricity without using a gearbox, resulting in avoided maintenance. “Having all of those moving parts makes the gearbox one of the highest-maintenance parts of a wind turbine,” noted the DOE in a recent blog post.

According to Aaron Barr, senior consultant at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, the current generation of direct-drive wind generators “has reached technical and commercial maturity,” accounting for 26 percent of the wind turbines installed on land and 50 percent installed at sea globally in 2018.

But direct-drive turbines come with their own tradeoffs. Current designs rely on permanent magnets that require expensive, heavy rare earth elements. This in turn increases the weight of direct drive generators relative to those used in geared wind turbines.

WEG Electric Corporation plans to develop a lightweight generator designed both to use less rare earth materials than conventional geared turbines and to be integrated into its existing platform. ABB had planned to develop a generator that uses a magnet cooling system for use in either geared or direct-drive turbines as large as 15 megawatts.

The other two project teams — American Superconductor and GE — are developing superconducting generators expected to greatly reduce the need for rare earth materials.

GE’s proposed ultra-light low-temperature superconducting generator relies on lessons learned from the company’s decades-long magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) work. The goal is a solution customized for offshore wind turbines larger than 12 megawatts.

“Superconducting electric machines aren’t really anything new. What is new is some of the cryogenic technologies that have evolved over the years for MRI we can now bring to electric machines to make them practical,” David Torrey, GE’s team leader, told Greentech Media in an interview.

He added, “To the extent you can raise the magnetic field, you can produce more power with less heat, making your generator more efficient.”

Superconducting generators' path to market

According to WoodMac's Barr, superconducting generators have been researched for years but manufacturers have yet to develop a commercial prototype.

Wood Mackenzie estimates that the technology is at least a decade from commercialization, with deployment likely to come in next-generation 15-megawatt or larger offshore wind turbines.

“However, this will require an intensive R&D effort from OEMs, supply chain partners, and government-funded research,” Barr said.

That's the reasoning behind the Department of Energy’s push to jump-start R&D in this space.

Direct-drive and superconducting generators have the most market potential at sea, where the reduced size and weight of the next-generation generators envisaged by DOE are likely to have the greatest impact.

“Offshore turbines are expected to be 60 percent direct-drive by 2025,” said Barr.

DOE sees high-efficiency, lightweight generators as one way to reduce the weight and cost of towers and foundations for both bottom-fixed and floating offshore turbines.

“As we look to the future with floating offshore wind platforms to access wind resources where the water is too deep for conventional foundations, lightweighting while maintaining high efficiency becomes even more important,” wrote the DOE’s project team.

Just don’t expect the DOE-backed generator designs to take over the market in the near term.

“The design cycle for offshore turbines is very long, due to the massive scale of the technology, significant supply chain investment, and high risk that dictates extensive validation periods,” said Barr.

“The DOE-funded research is unlikely to be applied commercially on the next generation of offshore wind turbines until 2030 or later.”

However, GE’s Torrey was optimistic that earlier deployment might be possible.

“We consider the MRI technology to be quite mature right now. Barring any unforeseen surprises, I think we can certainly have something deployed well before 2030.”"

U.S. State Department misses deadline to explain Iran arms control report: aide,https://www.reuters.com,"['Arshad Mohammed', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-armscontrol/u-s-state-department-misses-deadline-to-explain-iran-arms-control-report-aide-idUSKCN1ST2VY,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department failed to meet a deadline on Thursday to provide information to three congressional committee chairmen looking into whether an annual arms control report slanted and politicized assessments about Iran, a congressional aide said.

In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.

The chairmen’s letter cited a Reuters article on April 17 about how the administration’s annual report to Congress on global compliance with international arms control accords provoked a dispute with U.S. intelligence agencies and some State Department officials.

The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.

A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”

The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S.-Iranian tensions rose following U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and his reimposition of tough economic sanctions. They sharpened earlier this month after Trump tightened sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports.

Strains further deepened with Saudi Arabia accusing Iran of ordering armed drone attacks on two oil pumping stations and the May 12 sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. government sources said Washington strongly suspects militias with ties to Tehran were behind those attacks as well as a rocket strike in Baghdad’s Green Zone.

Iran denied involvement in the incidents.

In their May 16 letter to Pompeo, the three chairmen said they were “deeply concerned” the arms control report may have been produced by political appointees “disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning.”

The State Department, they noted, was legally bound to submit to Congress a “detailed report” on compliance by the United States and other countries with international arms control accords.

Instead, they wrote, this year’s report was only 12 pages long, “contains no meaningful discussion” of U.S. and Russian compliance with such agreements and “consists largely of hypotheticals or opinion.”

Several sources told Reuters that the report made them wonder if the administration was painting Iran in the darkest light possible, much as the George W. Bush administration used bogus and exaggerated intelligence to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq."
Trump moves to escalate investigation of intel agencies,https://www.sltrib.com,"['Zeke Miller', 'Eric Tucker']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/05/24/trump-moves-escalate/,"Washington • President Donald Trump directed the U.S. intelligence community on Thursday to “quickly and fully cooperate” with Attorney General William Barr’s investigation of the origins of the multi-year probe of whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia, granting a loyalist sweeping powers to review and potentially release highly classified information.

The move marked an escalation in Trump’s efforts to “investigate the investigators,” as he continues to try to undermine the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe amid mounting Democratic calls to bring impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump is delegating to Barr the ""full and complete authority"" to declassify documents relating to the probe, which would ease his efforts to review the sensitive intelligence underpinnings of the investigation. Such an action could create fresh tensions within the FBI and other intelligence agencies, which have historically resisted such demands.

Barr has already asked John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to examine the origins of the Russia investigation to determine whether intelligence and surveillance methods used during the probe were lawful and appropriate. Still, Barr has been directly involved, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, and is also working with CIA Director Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

Trump is giving Barr a new tool in his investigation, empowering his attorney general to unilaterally unseal documents that the Justice Department has historically regarded as among its most highly secret. Warrants obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, for instance, are not made public — not even to the person on whom the surveillance was authorized.

Trump explicitly delegated Barr with declassification power — noting it would not automatically extend to another attorney general — and only for use in the review of the Russia investigation. Before using the new authority, Barr should consult with intelligence officials ""to the extent he deems it practicable,"" Trump wrote in a memo formalizing the matter.

Trump has frequently claimed his campaign was the victim of ""spying,"" though the intelligence community has insisted it acted lawfully in following leads in the Russia investigation and conducted surveillance under court order.

Wray vocally opposed the release by Congress last year of details from a secret surveillance warrant obtained by the bureau on a former campaign adviser, Carter Page. The White House had eagerly encouraged Republicans on the House intelligence committee to disclose that classified information, believing it could help undermine the Russia investigation.

Wray, though cooperating with Barr in a review of the origins of the Russia probe, would presumably balk at declassifying classified information that could reveal sensitive sources or methods of investigators.

Despite Mueller finding no evidence to support criminal charges against Americans related to Russia's actions, his report documented extensive Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign and willingness on the part of some in Trump's orbit to accept their aid.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff accused Trump and Barr of trying to ""conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies.""

“The coverup has entered a new and dangerous phase,” Schiff said in a statement released late Thursday. “This is un-American.”

Thursday's move further solidifies Barr's position in Trump's eyes as a legal warrior on fighting on his behalf.

After Mueller submitted his report to Barr in March, the attorney general released a four-page summary to Congress. Barr's letter framed the debate about the probe over the next few weeks and, White House officials believe, allowed Trump to declare victory before the release of the full report, the contents of which are far more ambiguous.

Trump also appreciated Barr's combative stance with lawmakers and reporters as he defended the Justice Department's handling of the report, and again when he declined to appear before Congress and defied a subpoena, drawing a possible contempt charge. Trump has told close confidants that he ""finally"" had ""my attorney general,"" according to two Republicans close to the White House who were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.

""Today's action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the actions that were taken, during the last Presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions,"" Sanders said.

Two of Trump’s congressional allies, Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan, were seen by reporters earlier Thursday at the Justice Department.

“Recent DHS statistics on the number of arrivals at our southern border are clear proof that what is currently being done, is not enough,"" the group wrote.

The letter noted that two weeks ago U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost told the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration that, ""as of March 31, 2019, 361,087 migrants have been apprehended between the points of entry (POEs) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, representing a 108 percent increase over the same time in FY 2018.”

“Current projections are that more than 1 million people will have crossed our southern border illegally this year. Our constituents, the American public, are confounded as to why more is not being done by your Department,” the letter said.

Proposals include expanding a training program for border patrol agents to conduct fear interviews, where an undocumented immigrant is referred to an asylum officer if they express fear of returning to their home country.

Other proposals include limiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement's parole policy, limiting work authorization to only those whose asylum applications have been approved, increasing asylum fees and terminating the Flores settlement agreement.

“As the President continues to show leadership on this issue, we strongly encourage you to exercise the same manner of enthusiasm for fixing this crisis,” the letter says. “Included in this letter are proposals that would undoubtedly slow the surge at the border and provide context for long term immigration solutions.”

The group of immigration hard-liners also called for a third country agreement to be negotiated to allow undocumented immigrants to be relocated to another country that didn’t pose a threat in addition to enforcing “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which would require individuals from Central America to remain in Mexico while they await their immigration hearings."
USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Quint Forgey', 'Burgess Everett', 'John Bresnahan', 'Nancy Cook']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/22/usda-agriculture-economists-trump-policies-1340168,"Following Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's announcement of a staff relocation within the department, employees have been wondering who would be able to stay in Washington. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo agriculture USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies Those who examine the impact of tariffs, climate change and taxes on rural America are among employees being relocated.

The Agriculture Department is moving nearly all its researchers into the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps – subjects of controversial Trump administration initiatives – outside of Washington, part of what employees claim is a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.

Since last year, employees in the department’s Economic Research Service have awaited news of which members of their agency would be forced to relocate, after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stunned them by declaring he was moving most of the agency to a location outside the capital. The announcement sparked claims that Perdue was trying to pressure economists into leaving the agency rather than move their families.

Story Continued Below

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington, but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person if they made the cut.

But current and former employees compiled one anyway, covering all 279 people on staff, 76 of whom are being allowed to stay in Washington.

The current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, say the specialties of those who are being asked to move corresponds closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with the president’s policies, including tax policies, climate change, and the farm economy. The list, shared exclusively with POLITICO, shows a clear emphasis was placed on keeping employees whose work covers relatively non-controversial issues like crop planting over those whose research focused on areas sensitive to the administration.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told POLITICO, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

A former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved put it this way: “You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS. They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

A USDA spokesman declined to directly address the employees’ allegation of political bias, but provided a written statement from Perdue saying that the moves were not prompted by the work being done by ERS

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our . . . employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government,” Perdue said. “These changes are more steps down the path to better service to our customers, and will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone. . .”

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run. And we are increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from land-grant universities.”

But employees claim the department’s leadership, including Perdue, turned against the research service after an estimate early last year suggested that the Republican-backed tax plan would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers.

Perdue’s decision to move ERS came several months after news outlets highlighted the USDA study on the Republican tax changes. In response to Perdue’s move, cities from all over the country submitted bids to host the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which will also move. The finalists, announced May 3, were the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Accompanying his announcement of a final selection, which is expected as early as this week, Perdue has promised to provide Congress with a cost-benefit analysis detailing why USDA says the move makes financial sense.

The impending announcement comes as pressure builds on Capitol Hill to stop the move. On Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider a spending bill that includes a provision barring the Agriculture Department from moving the two agencies out of the national capital zone. It also would block Perdue’s decision to put ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, a move that placed oversight of the agency closer to the secretary’s office.

Employees said that moving nearly all researchers out of Washington would have a clear impact on the agency’s work. Researchers said they usually draw on information from other USDA divisions, members of Congress and Washington-based stakeholder groups, which would be more difficult from a remote location. Allowing 76 members of the agency to stay in Washington while the other left also impacts morale, they said, and limits collaboration.

Among the employees staying in Washington are senior analysts who conduct global market and crop-outlook estimates and administrative personnel. According to the list, approximately 49 percent of agricultural economists will be allowed to remain in Washington, compared with 14 percent of researchers.

Rumors had been swirling among staff for months about who would be allowed to remain in Washington when all ERS employees were called into an auditorium in March to be briefed by Acting Administrator Chris Hartley. He then read aloud the names of those who qualified to stay. But it wasn’t until employees compiled a full roster of who was staying and going that they got a clear picture of how the agency would be split up.

Decisions on who would stay in Washington were made by ERS leadership and approved by Perdue, according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” document distributed at the March meeting. The FAQ states that “every ERS employee had the ability to provide input” on the move. Senior managers “proposed critical ERS functions” that they believed needed to remain in Washington.

Some employees said that description of the decision-making process validates their concerns that Perdue was behind the move.

“They went in and handpicked who they wanted and called them ‘critical,’” said a current ERS employee.

Neil Conklin, a former senior administrator at ERS under the George W. Bush administration, said the agency stands to be fundamentally changed by the relocation.

“This is going to be very destructive of the agency, as certainly as we’ve known it,” Conklin said.

Northport VA hospital gets new director,https://www.newsday.com,['Martin C. Evans'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.newsday.com/news/health/northport-va-medical-center-director-antonio-sanchez-1.31504710,"The Northport VA Medical Center is getting a new director after nearly a year under the leadership of an interim chief.

Dr. Antonio Sanchez, 51, is an 18-year employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs and currently is chief of staff of the VA Caribbean Healthcare System based in Puerto Rico, the agency said Friday. He served as acting director of the Caribbean system for roughly two years, from December 2016 to January 2019.

Sanchez, a psychiatrist, will take over Northport's top job from interim head Dr. Cathy Cruise in the next 45 to 60 days, said Dr. Joan E. McInerney, who oversees the VA's New York regional office.

He will be responsible for everything, from managing 1,800 employees and a multimillion-dollar budget to ensuring the care of more than 30,000 patients a year and running a string of satellite clinics that stretch from Valley Stream to Riverhead.

In the past few years, the medical center has been dogged by crumbling infrastructure and high turnover in virtually all its key administrative roles.

In an interview from San Juan, Sanchez talked about the many challenges of Long Island's only veterans hospital.

“That is part of the excitement of arriving there,” Sanchez said. “There are issues we need to address … so I’ll be pretty busy.”

Sanchez said he spent four or five days at the medical center a few weeks ago, meeting with McInerney and other regional leaders.

McInerney praised Sanchez, pointing out what she described as his ""sound leadership qualities and proven experience.""

Two members of Long Island's congressional delegation didn't comment on Sanchez directly but did speak about the medical center and the VA broadly.

“Northport has had a lot of turnover in the last two and a half years,"" said Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove). ""The Northport VA historically has been one of the best VAs in the country. It’s had a rough few years, and I hope this new leadership can turn it around.”

Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) criticized VA leaders for not keeping members of Congress up to speed on developments at Northport. He said he hadn't been told that Cruise was going to be replaced.

“Obviously there have been real problems there, so I think it would help them to contact us early and bring us in,” King said. “It would have been a show of good faith to let us know beforehand.”

King pressed for a meeting between the Long Island delegation and the incoming director as soon as possible.

Sanchez has a New York connection: He did his undergraduate studies at SUNY Brockport upstate. He received both a medical degree and a master's degree in Healthcare Services Administration from the University of Puerto Rico's School of Medicine. He is a fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives and a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.

Sanchez joined the VA in August 2000 as a staff psychiatrist at the Caribbean system. He served as the system's chief of psychiatry service from June 2006 to July 2009, according to the VA.

As psychiatry service chief, Sanchez improved access to mental health care and established a foundation to expand more programs for veterans.

Sanchez's next VA position was interim chief of staff. He then was chief of staff until he began his time as acting director.

Cruise, a Huntington native, became Northport's acting director in July after director Scott Guermonprez resigned a year into his tenure, citing personal and family reasons. She also holds the title of chief of staff.

Since 2016, when Cruise arrived from the VA’s New York regional office, the medical center has had four medical center directors, three chiefs of staff and three nursing department directors, as well as the heads of the human resources department and physical plant.

And the 91-year-old medical center is showing its age. Last year brought two crises, for example. In January 2018, Northport had to close a homeless shelter on its campus after the heating system went out. A month later, the hospital had to shut down all five of its operating rooms to repair the air conditioning. The homeless shelter is still closed and isn't expected to open until at least October.

In September, three months after Cruise took over, the VA's independent watchdog released the findings of a yearlong investigation into nursing shortages at the medical center. Northport’s senior leaders, the report said, knew about the staffing shortages, mismanaged the nurses to fill the gaps and allowed overtime costs to balloon to $1.5 million in 2017, a nearly $750,000 increase from the year before.

In an addendum to the report, Cruise told the VA's Office of the Inspector General that she agreed with the findings and would address the staffing shortages.

One project that Cruise will turn over to Sanchez is the consolidation of more operations into the hospital, one of nearly two dozen buildings on the 268-acre campus.

A consolidation will improve communication between employees and their supervisors and will limit the need for patients with several medical conditions to go to several buildings for care, Cruise said.

In an interview in late December, Cruise had made it clear that she wanted the job of director.

The new director will face other challenges.

Health analysts warn that growing pressure to increase the privatization of VA health care — allowing more veterans to see private doctors paid for by federal dollars — could divert resources during a time when the agency is already stressed by staffing shortages and squeezed to keep up with the latest technology.

Already, more than 2 million veterans have used VA health dollars to schedule 41 million appointments under the Veterans Choice Act, signed by President Barack Obama in 2014. Under the program, for example, a veteran could see a private doctor if the nearest VA hospital was too far away or if the VA couldn't provide care within 30 days of requesting an appointment.

And that outsourcing is expected to increase under the VA Mission Act of 2018, which President Donald Trump signed in June to replace the Veterans Choice Act. Many of the new law's provisions build on the 2014 legislation, especially on the timeliness of appointments and distance of travel."
DOJ Attorneys Reportedly Ready to Block T-Mobile/Sprint Merger,https://gizmodo.com,"['Dell Cameron', 'About The Author', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Tech Policy', 'Email', 'Dell Gizmodo.Com', 'Xmpp', 'Dell Jabber.Ccc.De']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/doj-attorneys-reportedly-ready-to-block-t-mobile-sprint-1834961808,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"
Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

FORMER OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ON INCREASING NUMBER OF BORDER APPREHENSIONS

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., first allowed Underwood's words to remain on the record, stating that ""the language is approprite and that it should not be taken down.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Underwood later took to Twitter to comment on what happened.

""For over a year, it’s been clear that policies at the border have harmed the physical and mental health of migrant children,"" she said. ""I believe, at this point, failure to change these broken policies based on that knowledge is intentional and unacceptable.""

President Donald Trump won’t release White House visitor logs, he refuses to hand over his tax returns, he made staffers sign non-disclosure agreements and he’s balking at congressional investigators.

Yet during a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday, he again proclaimed himself “the most transparent president” in U.S. history, adding to the reporters gathered before him, “I think most of you would agree.”

It may be true that Trump reveals more of his personal thoughts and emotions than any of his predecessors. But by most other measures of presidential transparency, including the congressional oversight at issue during his White House appearance Wednesday, Trump operates behind dark-tinted windows.

The end to White House visitor logs, a way for the public to see who is getting direct access to the most powerful man in America, is a break from Obama administration practice. He’s the first president in decades not to release his tax returns. No modern White House has held as few daily press briefings as Trump’s, a ritual his Pentagon and State Department have also largely phased out. And while many presidents have battled Congressional oversight requests, Trump has dismissed the queries of House Democrats as illegitimate partisan inquests.

All of which has many critics saying that Trump has it backwards.

“It is for sure the least transparent administration in modern history,” said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a prominent Washington consumer advocacy group.

Norm Ornstein, a longtime government reform advocate and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called the Trump administration “the opposite of transparent.” Trump’s statement, he deadpanned, “made me laugh -- before I cried again.”

Even by the standards of Trump’s penchant for embellishment and falsehoods, Trump’s claim of unprecedented transparency — which he and his aides have made repeatedly — is particularly outrageous to the cadre of outside groups who’ve spent the last 2.5 years clashing with an administration they view as deeply secretive.

There is no universal definition of government transparency. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defines transparency as “the disclosure of government information” that can be used to “hold the federal government more accountable for its actions or inactions.”

Measured by that sort of standard, critics say, Trump has fallen far short.

Within the first year of Trump’s presidency, the federal government denied or censored more public information requests than at any time in the last decade. And Freedom of Information Act lawsuits intended to force the administration to turn over records reached a record high last year, increasing by nearly 70 percent compared with the last full fiscal year of President Barack Obama’s term.

“There’s only one way in which he’s the most transparent president and that’s that we can see him broadcasting his thoughts on Twitter when he gets angry in the morning,” said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government accountability group. “Otherwise, it’s ridiculous.”

White House officials counter that Trump is more accessible than any modern president, broadcasting his thoughts to his millions of followers everyday, answering shouted questions from reporters and granting regular print, television and radio interviews. By that measure, the public likely has a better understanding of Trump’s minute-to-minute opinions than they did of other recent presidents, who were often reluctant to spout off in public until their ideas had been vetted by their advisers.

Though White House aides hold up Trump as a pillar of accessibility, they have also sought to tightly control Trump’s interactions with the media. Trump’s exclusive interviews tend to be with friendly news outlets. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last appeared in the press briefing room in April to answer children’s questions during “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day,” and White House officials argued that her answers should be off the record.

Watchdog groups said accessibility alone isn’t enough to claim the transparency mantle.

“I don’t think that’s meaningful transparency,” said Liz Hempowicz, public policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, adding that the true transparency requires a government-wide commitment across federal agencies.

Hempowicz and other experts noted that the lack of transparency at federal agencies has massive consequences for the public, but often gets less attention than Trump’s headline-grabbing statements.

Just this week, for example, the Washington Post disclosed the existence of an internal Defense Department memo restricting the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress. And POLITICO recently detailed efforts by the Agriculture Department to reassign nearly all its researchers who study the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps, in what employees call a crackdown on economists whose assessments don’t square with Trump’s policies.

Then there is Trump’s categorical rejection of House Democratic oversight requests, including the extraordinary use of lawsuits to fight back against his investigators.

Trump’s claims of unprecedented transparency seem to be increasing as he grows more frustrated with the investigations encircling him. Aides and associates say Trump is furious that the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report has not dampened appetites for more investigation into subjects like his finances and tax returns.

“The President was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation. He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations,” White House spokesman Steven Groves said in a statement. “The White House and the Administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting Executive Branch rights and privileges. In addition, the President and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day.”

On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of engaging in a “cover-up,” countering that his administration had cooperated extensively with Mueller’s inquiries. Trump did give current and former staffers the green-light to participate with Mueller, although he himself refused to sit for an in-person interview, answering written questions instead.

“I think most of you would agree to this,” Trump said after abruptly ending a meeting with Democrats and vowing not to work with them until they end their investigations. “I’m the most transparent president, probably, in the history of this country. And instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said I was doing a cover-up. I don’t do cover-ups.”

Trump isn’t the first president to throw around transparency-related superlatives. Soon after winning the presidency, Barack Obama vowed to make his administration the most transparent in history. And he did take steps toward that goal, including through the first-ever release of White House visitor logs. But watchdog groups often complained that Obama was betraying that promise when he blocked access to records or his Justice Department prosecuted government leakers.

“The [Obama] administration’s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I’ve seen since the Nixon administration,” former Washington Post editor Len Downie wrote in a 2013 report.

“It’s unwise for a president to make a statement like that” unless he can back it up, Hempowicz said of Obama’s boast, noting that good government groups criticized the 44th president throughout his time in office. “It makes it very easy for us to push back.”"
U.S. considers duties on countries that undervalue currency: Commerce Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Lawder', 'Min Read']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-currency/us-considers-duties-on-countries-that-undervalue-currency-commerce-department-idUSKCN1ST2TU,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it was proposing a new rule to impose anti-subsidy duties on products from countries that undervalue their currencies against the dollar, another move that could slap higher tariffs on Chinese products.

The new rule also could put goods from other countries at risk of higher tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, India, Germany and Switzerland.

Those countries, along with China, were all listed on the Treasury Department’s semi-annual currency report’s “monitoring list”, which tracks currency market interventions, high global current account surpluses and high bilateral trade surpluses.

The department said its proposed rule would amend the normal countervailing duty process to include new criteria for currency undervaluation. Trump administration officials have long viewed China’s yuan as undervalued against the dollar, despite the U.S.-China trade war, which foreign currency experts say has hurt the yuan’s value.

“This change puts foreign exporters on notice that the Department of Commerce can countervail currency subsidies that harm U.S. industries,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.

“Foreign nations would no longer be able to use currency policies to the disadvantage of American workers and businesses,” he said.

It was a step toward making good on a campaign promise by U.S. President Donald Trump to address unfair currency practices, Ross said.

The department did not identify the specific criteria that it would use to evaluate whether U.S. pricing of a product was artificially low because of currency undervaluation."
