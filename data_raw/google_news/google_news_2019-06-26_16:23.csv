"Trump hits back at Mueller hearing plans, as analysts warn subpoena could backfire: 'It never ends'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Greg Wilson'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-subpoena-could-backfire-on-democrats-say-political-legal-experts,"Key Democratic lawmakers who triumphantly announced that Robert Mueller will testify under subpoena next month about his report on alleged Russian collusion may have played right into Republican hands, several legal and political experts told Fox News.

And for his part, President Trump lamented that the testimony is yet another chapter in the Russia probe saga.

""It never ends,"" Trump said Wednesday in an exclusive interview on Fox Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria.""

The president reiterated that the investigation itself did not find collusion, while complaining that Mueller and his team were biased against him.

""They got caught and they're running around going wild trying to do everything they can, but they spied on my campaign, it's as simple as that,"" Trump said, referring to the probe's origins at the FBI. ""It's so illegal, it's probably the biggest political scandal in history and they got caught doing it.""

With the former special counsel set to testify on July 17 to the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, both controlled by Democrats, Trump’s complaints could well be pursued and amplified by his GOP allies on Capitol Hill.

His most vocal critics hope to have the legendary lawman spell out the commander-in-chief’s misdeeds in sound bites that could fuel an impeachment drive. But given that Mueller ultimately found no evidence the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, and his pledge to not deviate from the 448-page report made public in April, the hearing may backfire.

""The bottom line is, after all of your looking and all the time you had and all the money you spent, did Trump collude with the Russians? No - Do you stand by your report? - Yes,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity late Monday. ""It is 'case-closed' for me. They can do anything they want to in the House, and I think it will blow up in their face.”

REP. MATT GAETZ: I HOPE MUELLER SUBPOENA NOT PRECURSOR TO 'IMPEACHMENT-BY-SURPRISE

In his report, Mueller declined to reach a conclusion as to whether Trump obstructed justice during the investigation. During a subsequent news conference, he seemed to base that decision on a longstanding Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but he later walked that claim back. Although Attorney General William Barr, together with then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that the report did not demonstrate Trump obstructed justice, critics of Trump believe the report is replete with examples of obstruction that could propel impeachment and even post-presidency prosecution.

Republicans on the two panels will get their chance to query Mueller about the dubious basis for federal surveillance warrants used to spy on Trump associates, what initially prompted the FBI probe that preceded Mueller’s investigation and, perhaps the biggest question of all: At what point during his nearly-two year probe did Mueller determine Trump did not collude with Russians.

""He can't refuse to answer questions about the FISA application,"" Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz told Fox News Channel’s Laura Ingraham, referring to a request by the FBI to surveil a member of the 2016 Trump campaign under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

""Those are the kind of questions that I think Republicans will be very well prepared to ask,” Dershowitz added. “Those are the kind of questions which are currently under investigation by the inspector general whose report we are waiting for. But those are not in any way precluded. So I think that they will regret having called him.""

Both committees were taken over by Democrats when the party retook the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. They are chaired by two of Trump’s biggest adversaries, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., of the Judiciary Committee and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of the Intelligence Committee. But both are stacked with able Republicans, including former federal prosecutor and Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe, Rep. Devin Nunes, of California, who previously chaired the Intel Committee and who, as a member of the “Gang of Eight” has seen key evidence still not made public.

Ratcliff is a member of both committees, and is joined on Judiciary by Trump supporters Rep. Louie Gohmert, a former Texas judge; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., who has used his position to release closed-door testimony of several witnesses from the FBI and Department of Justice.

“Bob Mueller better be prepared,"" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told Ingraham. ""Because I can tell you, he will be cross-examined for the first time and the American people will start to see the flaws in his report.""

Schiff told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow that the subpoena was necessary because Mueller “did not want to testify.”

""Nonetheless, they will respect the subpoena,” Schiff said. “He will appear. He'll be testifying before our committee in open session. Each of our members will have an opportunity to ask questions of the special counsel. And the American people get a chance to hear directly from him and have their questions answered. So I think it's a good result.""

Fox News contributor Geraldo Rivera said Schiff and Nadler may come to regret forcing Mueller to answer questions.

""I think that the price that this testimony will cost the Democrats will be grievous to them,"" Rivera said. ""They will rue the day that Nadler and Schiff let their ambition get ahead of their common sense, their political science, and drag this man back into center stage of the American public."""

Tucker Carlson: The media's new star witness against Trump is unraveling and only trying to sell books,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Tucker Carlson', 'Tucker Carlson Currently Serves As The Host Of Fox News Channel S', 'Fnc']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-the-medias-new-star-witness-against-trump-is-unravelling-and-only-trying-to-sell-books,"There was joy in newsrooms across America last week when a 75-year-old writer for Elle magazine called E. Jean Carroll came forward to accuse President Trump of sexually assaulting her.

Carroll made serious claims but they were confusing. She says that sometime in 1995 or 1996 -- she doesn't remember the year exactly -- Donald Trump groped her in a New York City department store. Somehow, the two wound up together in a dressing room. Carroll decided to model lingerie for Trump, a full lace outfit, she says, and then the assault took place. That's her story.

Carroll says she was devastated by what happened, but she did not report it to law enforcement for some reason. Nor did she write about it -- though she is a writer during Trump's presidential campaign or for the last two and a half years of his presidency.

Instead, she waited nearly a quarter century to include the story in a book that is literally entitled ,""What Do We Need Men For?"" In that book, by the way, Carroll also accuses CBS head Les Moonves of sexual assault. She writes that Moonves attacked her in an elevator in Los Angeles after she had finished interviewing him for a piece in Esquire magazine. And yet, amazingly, she never mentioned the attack in the story that she wrote about Moonves.

Both Trump and Les Moonves, by the way, deny that any of this ever happened, and there's no corroborating evidence that it did. And yet, according to The Atlantic, and HuffPo and Stephen Colbert and countless other arbiters of American news, Carroll's allegation against the president -- which is a felony -- is ""credible."" It's a ""credible"" accusation.

Harvard graduate Lawrence O'Donnell was so impressed by it that he gave Carroll half his show.

E. Jean Carroll: I wish I had said, ""I'll tell you my age if you show me your tax returns.""

Lawrence O'Donnell, MSNBC host: Yes, that would have been -- so would you consider bringing a rape charge against Donald Trump for this?

Carroll: No.

O'Donnell: Why not?

Carroll: I would find it disrespectful to the women who are down on the border who have been raped around the clock down there without any protection.

Alisyn Camerota, CNN anchor: What do you want to say to Donald Trump?

Carroll: That terrifies me that you said that. That is -- that --

Camerota: At the thought of confronting him?

Carroll: No.

""I wish I'd asked for his tax returns."" ""I won't bring criminal charges because it would disrespect women at the border who are getting raped 24/7.""

Come on. This is absurd. These aren't serious statements from a rape victim. They are wacky soundbites from someone trying to sell a book. Obviously.

Monday night on CNN, even Anderson Cooper appeared to realize the media were being had in the story. As people tried to interview E. Jean Carroll, she suddenly launched into a bizarre digression in which she described rape as quote, ""sexy.""

Carroll: So this one incident ... this one, what? Three minutes in this little dressing room? I just say it's a fight that way. I'm not the victim. All right, I'm not the victim.

Anderson Cooper, CNN anchor: You don't feel like a victim?

Carroll: I was not thrown on the ground and ravished, which the word ""rape"" carries so many sexual connotations. This was not sexual. It just -- it hurt. It just was --

Come on. This is absurd. These aren't serious statements from a rape victim. They are wacky soundbites from someone trying to sell a book. Obviously.

Cooper: I think most people think of rape as ... I mean, it is a violent assault. It is not --

Carroll: I think most people think of rape as being sexy.

Cooper: Let's take a short break --

Carroll: [They] think of the fantasies.

Cooper: We are just going to take a quick break. If you can stick around, we'll talk more on the other side.

Carroll: You're fascinating to talk to.

""We're going to take a quick break."" Could you imagine if that was you? How is that for the weirdest exchange of the week? You could see Cooper desperately trying to dump out into a commercial break.

When your star witness starts rambling on about rape fantasies, it's time to shut the whole thing down before it undermines your case. And they're making a case.

Asking questions might reveal the truth. And of course, that is literally the last thing they want to happen, ever.

‘Complete This Sentence: Donald Trump Wins Reelection If … ’,https://www.politico.com,"['Tim Alberta', 'John F. Harris']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/26/trump-2020-democrats-campaign-election-strategy-227210,"Tim Alberta is chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine.

Never has there been a presidential race as sprawling and wide-open as the 2020 Democratic primary. It would be a landscape entirely without a map, except that a small handful of battle-hardened veterans have navigated similar terrain before.

At the kickoff of the primary debate season four years ago, no fewer than 16 candidates were jockeying for position in the largest Republican presidential field in history—only to end up being mowed down by Donald J. Trump in what became a slaughterhouse of a campaign.

Story Continued Below

What’s in store for this year’s Democrats? To get an insider’s view, POLITICO Magazine invited four of the Republican strategists who managed those 2016 campaigns to a literal smoke-filled room in Washington to talk shop: Danny Diaz (Jeb Bush), Beth Hansen (John Kasich), Jeff Roe (Ted Cruz) and Terry Sullivan (Marco Rubio).

Over drinks and cigars at the Civil Cigar Lounge, they unloaded about the difficulties of breaking through in a massive field, gossiped about the strengths and weaknesses of this Democratic crop, aired old grievances still lingering from 2016 and offered some tactical advice for how to face off against President Trump.

The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity. Check out the audio in the newest edition of POLITICO’s Off Message podcast.





On Debates and Campaign Strategy



Tim Alberta: Here we are, heading into the first Democratic debates of the 2020 cycle. Four years ago, all of you were walking into Quicken Loans Arena for the first Republican presidential debate of the last campaign. What are your most vivid memories from that night? And what were your strategies going in?

Terry Sullivan: We were trying to walk this fine line because, up until that point, we were very much seen as the candidate who could give inspirational speeches and was expected to shine at the debates. But at the same time, our campaign strategy, for better or worse, was to try to fly as much beneath the radar as humanly possible. To not put a huge bull’s-eye on us. To not run out there on Day One and become the front-runner. Also, we sure as heck didn’t have the resources financially to become a front-runner. So, what was running through your head is—do well, meet expectations, do not beat expectations and don’t break away. It was kind of a weird way to walk into it, but we weren’t looking for a breakaway moment; we were looking to check the box, keep our head down and keep moving.

Jeff Roe: I think, at this stage of their campaign, maybe somebody will have a moment against Biden. They’d be smart to do that. He’s starting to drop. If they want to bring him all the way down, they ought to. But in our campaign, we called it “rubbing paint.” You know, a NASCAR reference—kind of trade a little paint in the corners. That wasn’t our game. We were playing golf at that time: right down the fairway, play your own game. There was no Greco-Roman wrestling. You had 7½ minutes of actually speaking, so be a strong conservative and just play your game and try not to make any mistakes. Remember, we almost didn’t make the debate stage. And if we had gotten relegated to the second debate, Ted was going to drop out.

Tim Alberta: Going into these first Democratic debates, who do you all think has the most pressure on them?

Terry Sullivan: I think there are two. It’s Mayor Pete, whose last name I can’t pronounce, and it’s Beto. Because those two are the most a creation of the media, the D.C. media. And so, if they can’t meet expectations, it’s the end of them. Whereas Biden could totally crap the bed, but he’s still going to make [future] debates.

Beth Hansen: I completely agree with that, and I might put somebody like Kamala Harris in there. These are people who voters don’t know a lot about. People know something about Biden; they know something about Sanders; they think they know something about Warren. They know something about those people. It’s these other people where it’s, “Oh, I think I like that person. Let me see.” Those are the people who are going to have to come out and make that first impression.

Danny Diaz: I think it’s the people who are worried about making it through the summer and being on the stage in the fall. It’s pretty clear that Sanders is going to be on the stage, and it’s pretty clear that Biden is going to be on the stage. I think if you’re Kamala or Warren, you’ve got to be like a really good rebounder in a basketball game. You’ve got to hang around the hoop, and you’ve got to get rebounds. I think [for] the folks that aren’t going to make the stage in September … they need to change the game for themselves so that they’re viable. They’re hoping just to make it until the early states [begin voting], and then it’s a totally different game.

Terry Sullivan: It’s an expectations game more than anything else. At the end of the day, perfect example, we finished third in Iowa.

Jeff Roe / Danny Diaz: [Loud and indiscernible mocking of Sullivan, whose campaign famously took a victory lap after Rubio’s third-place showing in Iowa.]

Left to right: Danny Diaz, Beth Hansen, Jeff Roe and Terry Sullivan. | Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Terry Sullivan: Hold on, though! It wasn’t an accident that we finished third in Iowa, and we got a ridiculous amount of press. We got more press than the first or second did. The point is that it was about expectations.

Beth Hansen: It always is.

Jeff Roe: I hate to agree with Terry, but I owe him one. If Robert Francis [Beto O’Rourke’s given name] has a bad night, that’s real bad. It reinforces the trend line where he starts at 11 and he ends up at 4. He’s at 2 nationally. He has to fix it. Mayor Pete, same thing. Reinforce his trend line up. He’s going from nothing to 13 in Iowa, I think it was an 8 nationally. But I think there’s another contingent, which I think, as you were describing, [is] Kamala. She’s kind of the best political athlete in the field. She seems to have the diversity of being able to speak to donors, be able to speak to the press, be able to speak to grassroots. She’s got a core competency around an issue. She has experience. All of us had great candidates, but Marco was the best natural political athlete in the field. I think he had a lot to prove—

Terry Sullivan: So, you’re saying it’s my fault we lost?

Everyone: [Indiscernible shouting, finger-pointing.]

Beth Hansen: As we sit here talking about the debates, talking about the process of the debates, taking a step back: At the end of the day, is this the best way? I’m not saying I have a better idea, but my God, are the debates really the best way? Those debates with 11 people on the stage? Were they really a good way to indicate who is going to be a good leader of this country?



On the Democratic Contenders



Tim Alberta: Is there a comparison that any of you see at this early stage for your candidates in this 2020 field? Somebody who you look at and you say, “Boy, they sort of remind me a little bit of the candidate I had and the sort of campaign we were running”?

Beth Hansen: I’m going to have to take a minute to think of that because it does not come to mind. Because what we had was experience, and not only at the state level, the popular governor of a big, diverse state; we had 18 years of congressional experience. And at the end of the day, [Kasich] was a Midwestern populist and he was a good communicator and that was the package we had, and I don’t see that in a Democrat.

Terry Sullivan: The better question might be how do we see each other’s candidates? Because [all] of us are going to say our candidate was unique and special. I can say, “John Kasich is Elizabeth Warren. Has zero chance of winning and 100% chance of spoiling another candidate.”

Tim Alberta: OK, that’s a better game. I already made the Biden-Bush comparison, Danny. What do you think? Are any of these folks reminding you of anyone?

Danny Diaz: That’s easy for me quite obviously because he wears the weight of being the front-runner out of the gate. I do notice [that] Warren has placed a premium on policy and ideas at least thus far in her effort, and we played to our candidate’s strength, which was ideas and policies and experience. And I see her doing that once again, with the caveat that [Bush and Warren] couldn’t be more different.

Tim Alberta: What do you think, Jeff?

Jeff Roe: I’ve got Jeb and Joe, Cruz-Sanders, Kasich-Bullock, Rubio-Harris.

Tim Alberta: Wait, Kasich-Bullock? Walk us through that.

Jeff Roe: So, he’s just like a genteel governor who talked a lot about being governor. Bullock’s talking a lot about being governor. It used to be the path to salvation to be president is you’re a governor, not a senator. He’s a moderate, and he’s going to try this kind of statesman route, which there’s not a lot of oxygen for outside your own state.

Tim Alberta: Jeff, you talked about Kamala Harris, in your opinion, being the best political athlete in the field. My question to you all is, regardless of whether they’re underperforming or overperforming at this point in the race, whose campaign would you want to manage just based on raw political talent?

Beth Hansen: Possibly Kamala Harris.

Danny Diaz: I’m conflicted in the answer for this reason: I think the mayor thus far has vastly exceeded expectations. I question the durability of that and—

Beth Hansen: I was going to say the same—

Danny Diaz: It’s very hard for me not to answer the question with [Sanders], the person who took the Clinton operation to two minutes left in the fourth quarter. He has the organization built-in. He has the message built-in. He has the money built-in. He has kind of a lot of energy on his side, and these are people who believe they were jilted, and he has a strong, strong message. Superdelegates and the establishment running the process and whatnot—he can push that button, push it with a high degree of frequency and yield a response that is favorable to his side.

Tim Alberta: What do you say, Terry? You already had the best athlete in ’16 and Jeff says you screwed it up.

Terry Sullivan: The two that are exceptional candidates aren’t going to surprise you: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The knock on Joe Biden is that he’s an old guy and he says stupid things. But this general election is genetically engineered for Joe Biden, because he won’t be the oldest guy, and no way in hell is he saying the stupidest things. Donald Trump is a match made in heaven for him. [Biden’s] a good politician, and he’s designed for this race. He appeals to that disenfranchised Archie Bunker. He can win those back from Trump. The person I think is going to surprise everybody is Cory Booker. Not out of anything he’s done so far, but he’s a damn good candidate back to when he was mayor of Newark. The media may move on because he doesn’t seem as sexy at the moment, but I think he might have some ability to really kick it into next gear. And I think Kamala Harris is going to go the distance. The African American community is the single biggest bloc in the Democratic nominating process, full stop.

Tim Alberta: Especially by virtue of the new primary calendar, the way that it’s organized—

Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Terry Sullivan: I mean, just raw vote totals. It matters. And so, the question becomes can Biden wrestle enough African American votes away from Kamala, or does she win it by overperforming with African Americans but also doing really well with the rest of—

Danny Diaz: As of today, he’s doing it in South Carolina.

Terry Sullivan: That’s what I’m saying. That’s why I put him as the best candidate. They figured it out. Biden knows that basically his nomination largely depends on his ability to communicate with African American voters, specifically in the South.

Tim Alberta: Let’s talk about Biden a little bit. He’s treated in some quarters of the Democratic Party as a front-runner, if not a prohibitive front-runner, for some of the reasons that you all were mentioning: The combination of name ID, big donor support and establishment backing casts a shadow over the rest of the field. But the doubts come into play when we get to this discussion about whether he’s in step with today’s Democratic Party. Danny, you faced a similar situation with Jeb Bush. When you look at the Biden campaign—his handling of the Hyde Amendment, for instance—what is your advice to them? What warning would you give the Biden campaign, so they don’t suffer the fate of Jeb Bush four years ago?

Danny Diaz: You have to have a theory of the race, and you have to pursue it. And from his standpoint, he’s wearing the colors of the front-runner. He’s on a stage with nine other people. There’s one commonality among those nine, and it’s bringing him down. And he’s got to navigate that. But what does he have working for him? He has working for him, once again, March 3 [Super Tuesday]. You’ve got, what is it, like 13 states? Half of the delegates are almost decided in Texas and California alone, and he can run a big campaign. He can run a well-financed campaign. He’s got a pretty good foil in the president of the United States, and he understands that. So, he needs to maintain continuity. That’s his goal, and the longer he maintains continuity, the more of the doubters he brings into the fold. What works against him is he’s been around forever. He has said things, voted on things and done things that he doesn’t recollect, and all of those are going to come to bear.

Terry Sullivan: He’s a 747 that’s tough to get off the ground, but once it gets off the runway and clears the trees, it’s tough to bring it down.

Beth Hansen: And that will be key for him. You say continuity, and I say it’s almost remaining presidential. Just stay above—to the extent that you can—stay above the rest of that fray and not get dragged into it. That is his winning ticket, and the fact that he is the most likely to be able to defeat Trump next November.

Jeff Roe: So, I didn’t get to answer the first one, whose campaign I’d like to run.

Tim Alberta: Well, I assumed that because Kamala Harris is the best athlete…

Jeff Roe: She is, but I’d like to do Sanders. First of all, Kamala is going to be on the ticket no matter what—

Terry Sullivan: Because Sanders is just as crazy as Ted. [Hooting and heckling]

Jeff Roe: Kamala is going to be on the ticket, so that would be kind of fun. But Sanders is being undervalued. He’s an undervalued stock. It could be a lot of fun. And I think I could actually—I don’t know. He might be as bad as they say he is as a person, but Biden can only underperform. I think Biden is really overvalued as a front-runner. I feel like his ceiling, which he just reset at the highest poll, is at 41. He can’t get 41, so he can really only underperform. I think his floor-ceiling is a real problem for him, whereas with Sanders, he’s probably got a ceiling of 35 and a floor of 25. I also think that Biden is really playing out his hand poorly. He’s running a Rose Garden strategy. I would actually saturate and try and be their [version of] Trump in this race. When he does a gaggle, when he does the pizza parlor, when he does whatever, it’s him. I don’t think Rose Garden is going to work for Biden. I think I’d saturate and suck up all of the oxygen. I think he’s more Trump than anybody else they have for the earned media impressions.

Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Terry Sullivan: Yeah, it’s all about earned media impressions, period. When we measured and I’m sure other guys did and gals did here, but we measured the impressions on the target universe in our analytics every single week for the life of the campaign that we were in it, and from the day that Trump went down that escalator to the day that we stopped measuring when we dropped out, he had more earned media impressions every single week than every other candidate earned and paid media combined, except for two weeks.

Tim Alberta: Was one of those weeks when Marco accused him of having small hands?

Terry Sullivan: No, no, no, because we were talking about him, No. 1. No. 2, everybody asks, “Oh, what was the week?” Nobody knows. He was playing golf. It wasn’t because anybody else did anything smart. It was that—

Tim Alberta: Trump took a little breather.

Terry Sullivan: Yeah, he took a breather. It had nothing to do with anything else.

On the DNC Primary Rules

Tim Alberta: The Democratic National Committee is fighting a war that many felt was lost by the RNC back in 2016, about how to manage a primary field with a historic number of candidates. You four were running campaigns in a field of 17; the Democrats have even more this time around. Are these new DNC rules governing the debates and superdelegates going to be effective? Or do you expect unintended consequences?

Danny Diaz: I do think the qualifications are the big difference between ’16 and ’20, and I think ultimately it’s pretty clear that after the two summer debates, once they get to the fall, they’re going to narrow the [number] of the folks on the stage—and narrow it substantially. So, based on the qualifications that they’ve delineated, what’s going to be interesting here in Miami is going to be how aggressively people seize their moment.

Tim Alberta: The DNC chairman, Tom Perez, is being much more aggressive than RNC Chairman Reince Priebus was four years ago in trying to winnow this field in a hurry. Basically, post-Labor Day, because of the debate requirements, there might only be five, six, seven candidates left who qualify for the stage.

Terry Sullivan: Being so aggressive at limiting [the number of candidates] is only going to end up hurting the more establishment candidates. Joe Biden benefits from a 20-person field. An eight-person field hurts Joe Biden, and in the same way that the law of unintended consequences brought about Donald Trump on the Republican side.

Beth Hansen: When you have arbitrary criteria that you’re [using], it might seem like a good idea now, but then after June and after July you’re stuck with the five or six candidates that you have, and you might want to rethink that. But by then, it’s too late. Part of running any campaign is this: It’s an arduous ordeal. It’s town halls and it’s donor meetings, and it tests those people who are going to be good at this. And I’m just not sure if cutting the field by that much that early on is actually going to be the best thing for them.

Jeff Roe: It’s remarkable. I haven’t heard a lot of people talk about how intrusive the consequences of these [DNC] decisions on what their measurements are needed to get into the debates. When you’re telling somebody how much prospecting email they have to [send], when your entire campaign is based on money management, that’s a really intrusive trigger. It also ratchets up what I think they’re trying to avoid, which is their lurch left. You’ve got candidates who otherwise would be talking about, ‘Well, I’m a capitalist, but I understand that we need to protect the underprivileged,’ and now, they’ll just have to go full-blown [left], or they will be punished immediately on email and Facebook and the other ways that they traditionally raise money. And so, if they’re trying to incentivize a mainstream nominee, which it seems to me that they’re trying to do, I think they’re going about it the wrong way.

Tim Alberta: To Beth’s point about this being a marathon and not a sprint, you think back on the Republican side, the winner of the Iowa caucuses in ’08 and ’12—Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, respectively—these guys were in single digits almost all the way until the final six to eight weeks, when they started to take off. You’re not going to be able to see anybody fly way below the radar like that for the next eight months and then pop in December, because they’re not going to be able to stay on the debate stage.

Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Jeff Roe: I think what [the DNC] has done with the proportional delegates is interesting. And with the removal on the first ballot of superdelegates, they’ve incentivized effectively a 45-day campaign. But you can’t—with these requirements, a candidate can’t lay and build a framework to exercise a campaign to then have momentum at the right time. They’ll be washed out because of the process, because of what the requirements are from funding. If you have 120,000 donors and you’ve been cranking on it for six months and you’re 10,000 unique donors away from making the next debate stage, as we know, that takes 80 or 90 grand that you might not have. So now, you’re sacrificing [hiring] staff for online fundraising.

Terry Sullivan: It’s not just that they’re making these campaigns contort themselves financially; it’s that they’re making them contort themselves on issues. It means the more of a bomb thrower you can be, the more likely you are to get hits online and the more dollars you’re going to raise.

Tim Alberta: You need those viral moments.

Terry Sullivan: You need those viral moments, so you’re going to become more and more extreme in what you’re saying in order to try to capture that.

Beth Hansen: It’s almost counterintuitive: You’re chasing the very things that are going to make it difficult for you to be a good general election candidate, because you’re incentivized to chase those things to be able to continue to participate in the primary.

Jeff Roe: So, the biggest differences are, because of the criteria being so stringent, it’s going to diminish substantially the number of people they can get on the stage. That’s No. 1. And I think No. 2 is the law of unintended consequences, i.e. superdelegates. The role that they play in the convention now, if the threshold, whatever it is—just under 1,900—is not met, then they basically come in and can anoint the nominee of the party.

Tim Alberta: Yes. For all the talk of superdelegates being sidelined on the first ballot, they could play a more decisive role than ever. They can swing the entire second ballot.

Jeff Roe: Yeah. On live TV.



On the Democratic Primary Voters



Tim Alberta: Let’s talk about the role ideology plays in all this. Trump proved that many Republican voters weren’t looking to the Club for Growth or the Wall Street Journal editorial board as their guiding light, ideologically speaking. They were looking for something that was a little bit more authentic and a little bit more populist. So, my question is: Do you all believe that the Democratic Party’s base is significantly farther to the left than they were four or eight or 10 years ago on a lot of these big issues? Or do you think that that’s all of us spending too much time on Twitter and CNN?

Danny Diaz: Well, you’ve got to weigh what you need to say and what you think gets you there versus should you get the job in governing, right? And people may disagree with that, but there’s a reality to that and they’re operating in a post-AOC world. So, there’s a lot of energy on their side with respect to that. It’s going to force the dialogue in a direction where there’s one ultimate beneficiary and his initials are D.J.T., 100 percent.

Terry Sullivan: I think the bigger thing is … people don’t care about issues. They’re going to claim they care about issues. But we haven’t trusted our government in a long time. We don’t trust our financial institutions because God knows what they’re doing. We don’t trust our churches anymore because God knows what they’re doing. We’re in a situation now where people don’t trust anything or anyone, and what they want is some sense of authenticity. It doesn’t matter what you believe; it matters that you believe it. And they saw that with Trump because, in their mind, no one would say crap that crazy because it was poll-tested. He seemed authentic. It was his perceived authenticity that mattered. So, when he said something that was completely against Republican orthodoxy, he doubled down on it. He tripled down on it. And they’re like, “Well, I don’t agree with it, but at least he’s not a politician.”

Tim Alberta: So you don’t believe the Democratic base is moving farther to the left?

Terry Sullivan: I believe they are; I just think it doesn’t matter on the issues.

Beth Hansen: That’s exactly what I was going to say.

Terry Sullivan: It’s personality-driven. Donald Trump did not get elected by his position on any issue at all, period.

Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Jeff Roe: Well, that’s the general. But during the primary, they care.

Terry Sullivan: Wait, wait. This is important. Ted was right on 10 times as many issues in the Republican primary electorate as Donald Trump.

Jeff Roe: And we called him a liar for everything that he said—and he’s actually followed through. Everything he said on the debate stage [were] the right things. We just called him a liar because he had a record that didn’t back it up. Now, he’s actually done it which is why he’s got a 90 percent approval rating.

Terry Sullivan: Yeah, but he’s all over the map on stuff.

Jeff Roe: Not during the campaign. Over his 72 years of life, he has been, but in the campaign, he actually said all the right things. He said he would appoint judges that were pro-life; he had a record of not being that. He said that he was with the NRA on all gun rights, and he didn’t have a record of that.

Terry Sullivan: I guess we didn’t talk about trade during the campaign.

Tim Alberta: If the issues don’t matter in a primary, then why the rush to embrace Medicare for All, which was a fringe position in the Democratic Party 10 years ago? Why the rush to embrace the Green New Deal?

Terry Sullivan: Because they’re missing the point. Because these candidates are missing the point, which is authenticity. People want a candidate that they can identify with, that they can believe in, that they believe is telling them the truth way more than one that agrees with them, whether they say it or not.

Jeff Roe: If Bernie Sanders was a moderate Democrat, he’d be at zero. If Mayor Pete, by the way, was straight, he would be at zero. So, it does matter.

Terry Sullivan: Mayor Pete being straight has nothing to do with where he’s at on the issues, and it has everything to do with whether they believe him.

Danny Diaz: Well, it’s identity—

Terry Sullivan: It’s identity. It’s identity. And that’s what I’m saying: Mayor Pete seems authentic. Mayor Pete is where he’s at because no one knows where the hell he’s at on the issues.

Danny Diaz: It’s identity politics on their side. There’s a greater premium placed on it than our side, I think. And I do think the party has moved to the left.

Beth Hansen: Yeah, that’s what I was agreeing with. I was actually not agreeing that issues don’t matter; I was agreeing that the Democrat Party has moved to the left. I actually think issues do matter, and that’s why they’re coming out with baby bonds and Medicare for All. They do matter, but the importance is the authenticity. The importance is whether or not what you’re saying is something that you believe in, and that’s where I think that Biden can actually—it’s not exactly a Rose Garden strategy, but if he can stay above the day-to-day fray and remind people that he has been a Democrat leader and somebody who is on their side and he can have that authenticity, he is going to end up being their nominee.

Jeff Roe: And both can be right, by the way. You can be a liberal and authentic, and that’s probably who will be the nominee.

Tim Alberta: We’ve talked a lot about Biden. We have not talked a lot about Bernie Sanders, the only other candidate in the Democratic primary who’s had that built-in floor of 18, 20, 22 percent nationally and in Iowa and New Hampshire polls. And look, these are two different races—the 2016 Republicans and 2020 Democrats—but I do think there are some parallels. And one big one for me is that I hear from a lot of Democrats, “Look, even if this guy wins Iowa, even if he wins New Hampshire, the party is not going to let him be nominated.” They say they will pull out the stops, they will do something to keep him from being nominated. And damn, does that not sound familiar?

Jeff Roe: It sounds awesome. [Laughter]

Tim Alberta: No, but really, we heard this same thing with Donald Trump four years ago. So, is there any reason to believe that if Bernie Sanders gets that head of steam—let’s say he wins Iowa or New Hampshire or maybe both—can you see a scenario in which the Democrats succeed where the Republicans failed four years earlier, which is to have a bunch of candidates drop out and coalesce around an alternative because they don’t want Bernie to be their standard bearer?

Terry Sullivan: Well, first of all, you’re never going to have a scenario where all the other candidates drop out, because you’re always going to have the John Kasich jackasses who are so fixated on their own ego that they can’t drop out to defeat the greater evil.

Jeff Roe: There we go! There we go!

[Beth Hansen rolls her eyes]

Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Terry Sullivan: At the end of the day, look, Bernie Sanders is a niche candidate. The only reason he became a top-tier candidate is he was running against the worst candidate in the history of mankind. So, he ran against Hillary Clinton and still lost. You had a freshman senator with two years of experience who beat her the first time he ran for office. You had Donald Trump on the heels of all sorts of offensive stuff he said, and the lowest points of his campaign beat her. So, the fact that Bernie Sanders got close is not some sort of badge of honor.

Danny Diaz: Well, I don’t think that guy is walking around with rose-colored glasses on. He knows he needs to meet the threshold on the first ballot on the convention floor or the thing will be taken away—

Tim Alberta: Or those superdelegates will take it away from him.

Danny Diaz: And who has—an open question—who has the operation in place at this juncture to do it?

Jeff Roe: Biden, maybe.

Tim Alberta: Beth, what do you make of Bernie Sanders?

Beth Hansen: I think his time was four years ago, and I think that he has, to Jeff’s point about a floor-ceiling of 25, 35, I just don’t think that four years—he made a big splash then against Hillary Clinton, and he was so different from Hillary. Hillary was establishment. Hillary was mainstream, and he was—he was out there. Now, there is just competition for that out there, crazy space, and I just respectfully don’t think that he is going to take it as far four years later. There are too many other people.

Jeff Roe: Sanders isn’t a niche candidate because he drives the agenda and he is authentic.

Terry Sullivan: I agree with that.

Jeff Roe: He ran a terrible campaign and actually was not in the campaign to win, as he self-expressed. He was in the campaign to advance his agenda. Now, he’s in the campaign to win. I just wouldn’t count the guy out because I think a lot of these other guys could really be flashes in the pan.

Danny Diaz: Look, man, you get through these early four [states]. Durability, organization, playing in a bunch of states—this thing is not going to be decided before March 3, OK? And if you can put in place the team that can allow you to gain a bunch of delegates on March 3, which he does, to me, it’s very hard to just like to cross him off the list.

Jeff Roe: And it’s who can get hot. I think this is a big thing about—it’s like the NCAA Tournament: Who actually has the ability to get hot and stay hot for 45 days? And he definitely has that. We’ve seen him do it.

Terry Sullivan: But it’s tougher to get hot a second time.

Beth Hansen: Yeah, that’s what I agree with.



On Defeating Donald Trump

Tim Alberta: I’m sure that you’ve all wondered what could have been done differently to defeat Donald Trump. And I’m wondering, is there a weakness of his that was not exploited four years ago that has become more apparent since? One that you believe the right Democrat with the right message and the right tactical approach could exploit in this general election campaign?

Jeff Roe: I’ll take a shot at this. You look at the state polling. National polling is great, but look at the state polling, which is kind of the better barometer here—the Rust Belt. It’s kind of like Johnny Obvious, but Pennsylvania, Michigan and, I think, kind of that blue-collar voter, to Terry’s point, that didn’t show up for Hillary. You can malign these people all you want. But they’re Obama-Trump voters, and that’s what’s in play there. And the question is—look, there’s a valid argument that a Bernie Sanders inspires them to some degree. There’s a valid argument that a Joe Biden, because of what he represents, can appeal to those folks. There are a lot of people in the Democratic Party right now that are asking, like, “Where do I fit? How do I fit into this scheme at the moment?” And I think the Trump team understands that; they are laser-focused on that. To me, that’s the play.

Terry Sullivan: I completely agree. And it’s actually two interesting groups. It’s the blue-collar Rust Belt folks, but it’s also the suburbanite Rust Belt folks who think, “You know what, I couldn’t ever vote for Hillary Clinton. I don’t want to vote for Donald Trump. I did just because it’s anti-Hillary, but you know what? If it’s maybe a Mayor Pete or a Joe Biden or someone that you can just hold your nose as a suburban probably soft Republican and vote for.” Those are the two things that he’s really got to worry about.

Tim Alberta: Because they all just did last November.

Jeff Roe: You had presidential-level turnout across the board, and Michigan elected a Democrat governor and Wisconsin elected a Democrat governor.

Terry Sullivan: And I expect you’re going to have record turnout this time. I think it’s going to be higher than [2016]—it’s trended up.

Beth Hansen: Your question was whether or not there was a weakness that had not been exposed in Trump. And I would answer that question that there is not, because I don’t think we have learned anything new about him—he is exactly the person that he said he was going to be. There’s nothing new. The question is whether or not in 2020 the voters want that.

Terry Sullivan: With those Rust Belt voters, it’s not going to be how it’s played out on TV. It’s their pocketbook. And that’s why it’s interesting on this trade stuff. We can talk about all of these other candidates, but the greatest impact on Trump’s reelection has nothing to do with who the Democrat nominee is and everything to do what the economy is. Because they’re willing to put up with his crazy Twitter shit and all the stupidity as long as the economy is good. The second their job is on the line or the prices are higher for them, it all goes out the window.

Tim Alberta: So, Jeff, I want your answer on the kryptonite to Trump, but before I do, just quickly on the Rust Belt because these are my people, and I feel the need to speak up for them. It’s interesting because all of mythologizing of Trump in the Rust Belt and connecting with these forgotten voters, Donald Trump wins the presidency off of three states, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania—

Jeff Roe: 100,000 votes combined—

Tim Alberta: 77,000. It was 77,744 votes combined in those three states. And Hillary underperforms Obama 2012 in those states by 600,000 votes. So, it’s not just the question of the Obama-Trump voters; it’s the question of the Obama voters who stayed home, right? And the folks who felt so disillusioned by the general election campaign in 2016 that they just didn’t come out and cast a ballot and a lot of Democratic voters or lean-Democratic voters who just could not bring themselves to go out and vote for Hillary Clinton as much as they may have disliked Donald Trump. I wonder if Democrats are at risk of not nominating someone who can bring those people out.

Jeff Roe: They’re positioned to have an identity politics nominee. They also are going got take the bait. Terry, I respectfully disagree this time. If I have one more of these [points to cocktail] I’ll disrespectfully disagree.

Tim Alberta: Get this man another drink.

Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Jeff Roe: Tariffs are like a red herring. That’s a negotiating tool. If you want to take a position of who is going to hold China and Mexico hostage over tariffs to get a better deal—whether it’s a better deal, whether the deal was already done, it doesn’t matter. That’s for New York Times A18 readers. That is winning politics in those states.

Danny Diaz: It’s got to be weighed against the Sunbelt right now. And I’m thinking like Georgia, particularly if [Stacey] Abrams gets in the Senate race. I’m thinking Arizona.

Tim Alberta: Let’s throw Texas in there.

Jeff Roe: If I was going to run a [Democratic] campaign and I was thinking tactically, I would be up early, very early, attack early, because you can get him from talking about the issues he cares about. Give him Florida. You can fight like a dog the whole time, but you’re not going to win. Do not fight for Florida. I know you’re supposed to, but just let it go.

Tim Alberta: You could even give him North Carolina.

Jeff Roe: You could even give him North Carolina. I probably wouldn’t.

Terry Sullivan: Florida is crazy like Trump; North Carolina is different.

Tim Alberta: But you come back and win the Rust Belt, and you don’t need Florida or North Carolina. It doesn’t matter.

Terry Sullivan: If you’re going to expand the map, go do it out West. Not Texas, but real out West. I think there’s some ways to do it.

Jeff Roe: Do things that [any other] Republican would get assaulted for doing. He could do a deal for Dreamers and a wall, and every Republican would take it.

Tim Alberta: Right, which a President Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio would never be able to get away with.

Jeff Roe: And because of his latitude that he has with Republicans, he could actually do this tariff fight and I don’t think voters care. They do not care about trade. They care that he’s fighting for them.

Terry Sullivan: Absolutely.

Jeff Roe: And he’s fighting the Mexicans, and he’s fighting the Chinese.

Tim Alberta: Beth, as a fellow Midwesterner, why don’t you have the last word here. Can Donald Trump be defeated in those Rust Belt states by the right Democratic candidate, even if, as Jeff was saying, many of those voters feel as though he’s fighting for them?

Beth Hansen: The economy is going to be important, to Terry’s point. The economy is going to be important, but what’s also important is the number of people who were voting for Donald Trump because they were voting against Hillary Clinton. And I think that that was particularly pervasive—I’m a Michigan native, I live now in Ohio, and I think that was particularly pervasive there. So, I really think it’s up to Democrats to nominate somebody who can actually be competitive in those states.

Jeff Roe: And who besides Biden?

Beth Hansen: Well, I think it’s Biden.

Jeff Roe: That’s it.

Beth Hansen: I wouldn’t say that’s it, but he’s the obvious one.

Terry Sullivan: If he’s the nominee, he would be the front-runner.

Jeff Roe: Who could they nominate that would be a coin-toss favorite the day after the Democratic convention—besides Biden?

Danny Diaz: I think Harris is a sleeper in that category.

Terry Sullivan: I think Mayor Pete only because he seems authentic. Who knows—

Beth Hansen: I just don’t think he’s—

Terry Sullivan: He has the ability to blow up, but he seems authentic.

Danny Diaz: Let’s remember, a great July does not equal a great October.



On November 2020

Tim Alberta: Complete this sentence: Donald Trump wins reelection if…

Danny Diaz: If the Democrats nominate somebody who is ideologically not on par with the general election electorate, by and large defined by voters who don’t have a place at the Democratic table.

Terry Sullivan: That was a long answer.

Danny Diaz: It was the correct answer.

Terry Sullivan: Elizabeth Warren.

Tim Alberta: Wait, he wins reelection if she’s nominated?

Terry Sullivan: Right. Your question was, he wins if the Democrats nominate … and I said Elizabeth Warren.

Danny Diaz: There are like 20 names that you could fill in—

Terry Sullivan: There are, but she is the most awkward individual. It has nothing to do with her being a woman. It has nothing to do with her being a Native American and all of her tribal ancestry. It has everything to do with like she’s weird, she’s awkward. And so, he’ll beat her like a drum.

Tim Alberta: Jeff, Donald Trump wins reelection if…

Jeff Roe: Dow Jones stays about 24,000. Job growth continues. And they nominate somebody to the left of the Democrat Party.

Tim Alberta: Beth, Donald Trump wins reelection if…

Beth Hansen: Summarize everything that this auspicious group has said. If they nominate somebody who is out of step, inauthentic and doesn’t have the ability to appeal to regular people the way Donald Trump does. And if they nominate somebody who is out of step with that and the economy stays good, he is going to be reelected.

Danny Diaz: One point on the economy: I don’t think the economy needs to be great through November of the election year.

Beth Hansen: Agreed. It doesn’t have to be great.

Danny Diaz: I think it’s baked in during the summer, and at that point, it’s a done deal.

Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Tim Alberta: Terry, we’ll start with you: Democrats win back the White House in 2020 if…

Terry Sullivan: They can get out of their own way.

Tim Alberta: Elaborate on that. If they can get out of their own way, in what sense?

Terry Sullivan: Look, Donald Trump can win when he makes it about his opponents and their weakness. You asked how you beat Donald Trump. The way to beat Donald Trump is to make Donald Trump the issue, not you. He’s got this approach to dragging you down in the mud pit with him. Make him the issue and not you, and you can rise above it. I think the trick is, Trump is his own worst enemy; don’t get in the way of that.

Tim Alberta: Danny, Donald Trump is defeated if…

Danny Diaz: I’m going to take a different tack here: If [Democrats nominate] somebody who can get in the ring with what is a great prizefighter and who can kind of manage him and deal with him and deal with the counterpunch, because he is a great political athlete and he will find that weakness, he will exploit that weakness, and he will take advantage of it to the greatest degree possible.

Tim Alberta: Beth, you’re nodding.

Beth Hansen: Yeah, I think that the Democrats are going to win when they find somebody who can get in the ring. But importantly, they’re not going to be distracted and they’re not going to take the bait. They are going to win if they are able to get into the ring and fight. But at the same time, convince people that they care about them, that they are authentic. It’s going to have to be something different. It cannot be that I’m going to be unlike the policies and programs of Donald Trump. It’s going to have to be something different, and if they can articulate something different and make it authentic and something that resonates with people and stays in the ring without getting distracted, they will win.

Tim Alberta: Jeff, Democrats win back the White House if…

Jeff Roe: I think history holds on this. I know we’re in new times and that we’re trying to think about things in ways because everything has changed in the last 10 years, but I think the normalcy of politics holds. You don’t lose reelection unless the economy is a mess. So, I think they need two things. They need the economy to take a downturn and they need a message of what their candidacy would change. [Trump] has taken very populist, outside-the-norm positions that the Republicans accept because he’s doing so much for them and because he’s a standard bearer and he fights the Democrats every day. They would have to have an economic downturn and they would have to have an overwhelming message that 51 percent could get behind—51 percent of the Electoral College. They’ll probably win the popular vote. But I don’t see anybody that does that if this continues the way it is. You still lose. That math holds up. That’s why we all thought we were running. It didn’t matter [that] Hillary was the worst [candidate] in the history of the world. It was only 100,000 votes. I get all that. But a Republican was going to win last time. I think any of our people—it pains me to say, even Kasich probably would have won.

Terry Sullivan: But Jeff, I think that so much is out the window now—

Jeff Roe: To defeat an incumbent something has to be wrong and nothing is wrong.

Danny Diaz: It’s very dangerous to judge this by viewing it through the prism of a referendum. It’s a big, big mistake. It’s [got to be] a choice, and I get back to my kind of two people in the ring with a prizefighter.

Tim Alberta: Jeff, when you say nothing is wrong, nothing is wrong on paper. But in November 2018, you have all these suburban congressional seats that had been held by Republicans for 10, 20, 30, 40 years from the Salt Lake suburbs to the suburbs of Detroit, where suddenly they’re flipping. And that’s while the economy is booming. So clearly, some individuals, including a lot of traditional Republican voters, did believe something was wrong.

Jeff Roe: Ronald Reagan had some tough midterms, and he did pretty well.

Terry Sullivan: I know Donald Trump. I’ve seen him on TV, and Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan.

Jeff Roe: I never said he was.

Tim Alberta: So, you’re all tasked in a hypothetical universe with getting Donald Trump reelected. You are Brad Parscale [Trump’s 2020 campaign manager]. It’s your job to get him another four years in the White House. Who is the one Democratic candidate you do not want to see next November?

Beth Hansen: I think Mayor Pete. If Mayor Pete takes off—and I’m not sure that he has got enough experience as a mayor—but if he takes off, I think that is a very difficult race for him.

Danny Diaz: I want to say Joe Biden because it’s like the easy answer to give, but I also want to say Bernie Sanders. And I want to say despite being kind of quote “wrong” on a lot of issues, he brings into play a dynamic that I think is kind of interesting from a general election perspective, to be very honest with you.

Terry Sullivan: I don’t disagree with Danny, other than I wouldn’t work for Donald Trump out of conscience.

Danny Diaz: Can I add one thing? Once again, the sleeper—Kamala Harris.

Terry Sullivan: Yeah, I think she’s real. She’s real because she can go the distance.

Jeff Roe: I think the only one that’s a worry is Biden. I think the rest—I don’t think it’s any layup at all, but I also think that the president will get the highest number of African American votes that we’ve seen for a long time.

Tim Alberta: Terry, Marco Rubio had an otherwise really good debate performance in Manchester except for that—

Terry Sullivan: Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?

Stephen Voss for Politico Magazine

Tim Alberta: Yes, exactly. We all know that moments are sort of the currency of a presidential campaign. Those moments, those inflection points that people remember that inform perceptions of candidates and campaigns and that shift the narratives at a fundamental level. I’m wondering, have any of you seen a moment in this early stage of the 2020 Democratic race, a moment that you feel has that capacity for sort of reshaping the narrative, reshaping the perception of candidates and of the field at large?

Danny Diaz: Not yet. It’s early.

Terry Sullivan: I think there’s one. I think it’s Joe Biden’s response to all of these women rolling out with the #MeToo [allegations], and he’s not apologizing. I think that that proves that their campaign has their crap together, that they’ve thought through stuff and that they’re built for the long haul. Because he was damned if you do, damned if you don’t. If he would have taken the bait and said, “I’m sorry,” no one would have believed it —he would have seemed fake and phony. He’s a creepy old man. That’s who he is, and he kind of doubled down on it. He genuflected in the direction of [it], and he acknowledged that it’s kind of creepy. But he didn’t apologize, and I think that was a telling moment that he didn’t do that. And I think it matters.

Jeff Roe: I think it’s early.

Beth Hansen: I think it’s early.

Jeff Roe: I think Biden reading his notes on Hyde, we will see in an ad.

Danny Diaz: I agree with you on that.

Jeff Roe: And the press tick-tock, which is stunning at this moment in a campaign—I completely disagree with them having their shit together. It could not be further from the truth in my opinion, because of what we read in the follow-up of how he arrived at his decision. The blow-by-blow of liberals on his campaign that were going to walk from the campaign if he didn’t change his position. That is a weak-sauce operation. He’s on the teleprompter, which—I was interested in that moment. I follow politics fairly closely, and all of a sudden, he just looks down and starts reading what he now believes about abortion. And watching that was a moment for the entire party. To watch a person flip on abortion and federal funding of it, and have to read his notes—it felt like exactly what they said it was, which was a campaign manager going to him and saying, “You’ve got to flip.” And his campaign people threatening to revolt. I think that is the first nail in what will eventually be a November coffin for him."
Trump's protocol chief suspended amid State Department investigation ahead of G-20,https://www.cnn.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/state-department-protocol-chief-suspended/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's protocol chief, Sean Lawler, has been suspended indefinitely just ahead of the G-20 meeting in Japan pending the outcome of a State Department investigation into his conduct, according to multiple State Department officials with direct knowledge of the matter.

Two State officials told CNN that Lawler was called into the office of the deputy secretary on Monday afternoon and told he needed to leave due to the status of the investigation.

On the same afternoon, senior staff in the protocol office met with State Department management and were told that Lawler had to leave over personnel issues, according to the officials.

They were also told in this meeting that their new acting chief of protocol is Mary-Kate Fisher, and her acting deputy is Cathy Fenton, who served as social secretary in the George W. Bush White House and also handled social affairs‎ for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush. State Department sources said both are highly respected.

Supreme Court gives Marine seeking VA benefits second chance in lower court,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Devan Cole']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/supreme-court-kisor-wilkie-marine-veteran-federal-agencies/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a Marine Corps veteran who sought disability benefits for his service-related post-traumatic stress a second chance to prevail in a case that will impact the amount of power federal agencies have.

But lurking behind the case was a dispute over government agencies that some conservatives feel have become too powerful, upsetting the balance of power.

Writing for five of the nine justices, Justice Elena Kagan narrowed the circumstances in which courts will defer to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous language in its own regulations. But Kagan stopped short of overturning court precedent.

Kagan wrote that such deference ""retains an important role in construing agency regulations,"" but she said it is ""sometimes appropriate and sometimes not."" She outlined ""markers"" for when courts should and should not defer.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment outlining those markers.

""The underlying regulation must be genuinely ambiguous; the agency's interpretation must be reasonable and must reflect its authoritative, expertise-based, and fair and considered judgment; and the agency must take account of reliance interests and avoid unfair surprise,"" Roberts wrote.

Paul Hughes, a lawyer for Kisor, praised the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision will significantly narrow agency authority."" Hughes noted that the lower court had applied a ""reflexive form of deference"" to the agency that was not warranted.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined in full by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, wrote to say they thought court precedent should have been ""easy for the Court"" to overturn. Gorsuch said that while the opinion manages to leave court precedent ""maimed and enfeebled"" the justices should have found the ""nerve"" to wipe it off the books.

""Although it's easy to get lost in the administrative law weeds of this case, the major headline here is that Chief Justice (John) Roberts declined to join the four other conservative justices in overruling prior precedent, and instead joined his more progressive colleagues in narrowing but not ditching the idea that courts should sometimes defer to how administrative agencies resolve ambiguities in their own regulations,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""The chief justice wrote separately to suggest that there isn't that much daylight between the result the Court reached and the one the dissenters would have adopted, but lower courts may well disagree as cases like these go forward,"" he said.

Vladeck added that the Court ""was unanimous in agreeing to send the case back to the Federal Circuit, but split as to what should happen thereafter.""

""Five Justices still think there is some room for deference to the VA, although they're not sure whether such deference is warranted in this case. Four would have the lower courts resolve the issue without any deference to the VA,"" he said.

Mnuchin: 'We were about 90% of the way' on China trade deal and there's a 'path to complete this',https://www.cnbc.com,['Holly Ellyatt'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/mnuchin-says-us-china-trade-deal-was-90-percent-complete.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday the U.S. and China were close to a trade deal, and he's optimistic that progress can be made during weekend talks between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. ""We were about 90% of the way there [with a deal] and I think there's a path to complete this,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Manama, Bahrain. He said he's confident Trump and the Chinese president can make progress in stalled trade talks at the Group of 20 meeting. ""The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship."" He did not provide any detail on what the final 10% of an agreement might entail, or what the sticking points are to completing a deal.

Trump is meeting his Chinese counterpart on Saturday at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The outcome of the meeting could be pivotal for the global economy and financial markets, which has been rattled by 18 months of trade tensions between the economic giants and an escalation of tariffs on each other's imports. Officials have yet to negotiate a breakthrough, but there are hopes that a meeting between the two presidents could help the discussions. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of investors found that about two-thirds expect no deal this weekend, but there would be no new tariffs either. ""I'm hopeful that we can move forward with a plan,"" Mnuchin told CNBC. ""President Trump and President Xi have a very close working relationship. We had a productive meeting at the last G-20."" At their meeting in December at the G-20 in Buenos Aires, Trump and Xi reached a truce in the trade war, but talks in May broke down, and the countries added additional tariffs. Mnuchin said he was hopeful a deal could be struck by the end of the year but said ""there needs to be the right efforts in place."" Dow futures jumped after Mnuchin's comments and signaled a higher open for Wall Street Wednesday.

Slowing growth

Talks between the U.S. and China broke down in May because China reportedly did not want to commit to changes in its laws to help allay U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and currency manipulation. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has previously played down hopes for a Trump-Xi breakthrough this weekend, saying in mid-June that ""the most that will come out of the G-20 might be an agreement to actively resume talks."" The trade war has impacted the Chinese and U.S. economies, despite both presidents insisting otherwise. In April, the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3%, down from an earlier forecast of 3.5%, citing ongoing global trade tensions as the rationale for the downgrade."

In a civil complaint filed Tuesday in Washington federal court, Justice Department attorneys said that Newman, the former reality star and longtime associate of President Donald Trump, had been told about the form before she left her position, and ignored multiple email requests for it in the weeks after her departure.

Newman declined to comment about the lawsuit, according to her attorney, John Phillips.

In a statement, Phillips said the White House had chosen ""to abuse process and use the Department of Justice to carry out retaliation.""

""The lawsuit alleges that Omarosa Manigault Newman 'knowingly and willfully' failed to file a report. This is untrue,"" he said in a statement.

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

In 2017, shortly after he took office, Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Morgan as Border Patrol chief. But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

“Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful,” Mr. Sanders, a former chief technology officer at the Transportation Security Administration who helped spearhead the agency’s PreCheck program, wrote, “I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of C.B.P. has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”"
FedEx Sues U.S. Commerce Department Over Export Controls In Huawei Dispute,https://www.npr.org,['Avie Schneider'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/25/735681134/fedex-sues-u-s-commerce-department-over-export-controls-in-huawei-dispute,"FedEx Sues U.S. Commerce Department Over Export Controls In Huawei Dispute

FedEx has been caught in the crossfire in the conflict between the Trump administration and China's Huawei Technologies. Now, the giant shipper is suing the U.S. Commerce Department to block the agency from enforcing export regulations against FedEx.

""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" the company said in a statement announcing the lawsuit on Monday.

The lawsuit, which also names Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, does not mention Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecom equipment. But FedEx has become embroiled in the dispute between the U.S. and China over trade and Huawei, and China is reportedly investigating FedEx over misdelivered Huawei packages.

Business FedEx Pushes Back On Trump Administration's Efforts To Target Telecom Giant Huawei FedEx Pushes Back On Trump Administration's Efforts To Target Telecom Giant Huawei Listen · 3:34 3:34

The Trump administration has been pushing other countries to drop Huawei as a supplier of key networking equipment, including the next-generation 5G wireless phone system. The U.S. says it believes Huawei could use its technology to spy on behalf of the Chinese government, a charge that Huawei has repeatedly denied.

In its lawsuit, FedEx says U.S. export regulations ""essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally."" FedEx says it receives about 15 million packages per day for shipment and its system spans more than 220 countries and territories.

""To comply with the Export Controls,"" the lawsuit says, ""FedEx screens the names and addresses of its shippers and the designated recipients prior to delivering any package in order to identify whether the sender and/or recipient are an entity or person"" on the Commerce Department's ""entity list"" of persons that could pose risks to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.

In a statement to NPR on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said: ""We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting U.S. national security.""

FedEx says it faces substantial penalties — criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $300,000 per violation. That puts FedEx ""between a rock and a hard place — absent the availability of review, FedEx must either forgo lawful activity because of its well-founded fear of prosecution, or willfully violate the Export Controls, thereby subjecting itself to criminal prosecution and punishment,"" the suit says. It also says that ""requiring FedEx to indiscriminately inspect every package abroad could place"" the company in violation of privacy laws.

The suit adds that the export controls require ""considerably more screening than possible from common carriers like FedEx."" Matthew O'Connor, a spokesman for UPS, told NPR on Tuesday that UPS ""continues to follow government directives in the markets where the company operates. UPS will not join the lawsuit filed by FedEx.""

On May 15, the Commerce Department placed Huawei on the entity list, saying there was a ""reasonable basis to conclude"" that the Chinese company ""is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest."" That essentially prevents the transfer of American technology to Huawei without a special license.

Google said it would stop supporting Android devices for phones made by Huawei, the world's second-largest supplier of smartphones, because the Chinese company was on Commerce's list.

Then on May 20, the Commerce Department issued a 90-day delay to give companies doing business with Huawei time to make ""other arrangements.""

On June 1, FedEx said its relationships with Huawei and all of FedEx's customers in China ""are important to us. FedEx holds itself to a very high standard of service. FedEx will fully cooperate with any regulatory investigation into how we serve our customers."""

Robert Mueller To Testify In Open Hearings On July 17 Before House Committees,https://www.npr.org,"['Ryan Lucas', 'Barbara Campbell']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/25/736065083/robert-mueller-to-testify-in-open-hearing-before-house-committees,"Robert Mueller To Testify In Open Hearings On July 17 Before House Committees

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP

Updated at 11:14 p.m. ET

Robert Mueller has agreed to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, giving Democrats the star witness they've long wanted to put before the American public.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced Tuesday that Mueller agreed after he was subpoenaed to testify publicly. He will be questioned separately by the two committees on July 17, according to a congressional aide.

The two committee chairmen said in a statement, ""Americans have demanded to hear directly from the Special Counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia's attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign's acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates' obstruction of the investigation into that attack.""

Mueller has spoken in public only once about his investigation, making a statement to reporters at the Justice Department in May. In it, he said he hoped it would be his last comment on the subject.

The announcement sets the stage for possible blockbuster hearing broadcasts, live on radio and television.

Democrats have been stymied by the White House in their efforts to secure high-profile public testimony related to the Russia investigation. The president has prevented key witnesses, such as former White House Counsel Don McGahn, from testifying. He also has asserted executive privilege over Mueller's unredacted report to deny Congress the full document.

Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump's private attorneys, tells NPR's Tamara Keith he is ""not concerned.""

""Bob Mueller has already stated that his report is his testimony we now expect that his testimony will be what is in his report. It is important to note the irregularities that took place during this investigation will also be discussed during his testimony,"" Sekulow said.

Trump himself tweeted, ""Presidential Harassment!""

The ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins of Georgia, said in a statement that he had encouraged Nadler to subpoena Mueller to ""bring to House Democrats the closure that the rest of America has enjoyed for months, and may it enable them to return to the business of legislating.""

""While the special counsel found that no Americans conspired with Russia to attempt to interfere in our elections, many have willfully misrepresented that conclusion while Democrats have neglected their responsibility to safeguard future elections from foreign influence. I hope the special counsel's testimony marks an end to the political gamesmanship that Judiciary Democrats have pursued at great cost to taxpayers,"" Collins said.

Democrats have pinned their hopes on Mueller, who closed up the special counsel's office and resigned from the Justice Department in May, to resuscitate their flagging investigations. They hope his appearance will grab the American public's attention in a way that his office's 448-page report on the investigation did not.

It's unclear, however, how cooperative a witness Mueller will be. The former FBI director is famous for his straight-shooting, by-the-book approach.

In his brief statement in May from the Justice Department podium, he emphasized that the probe did not exonerate the president, and that Russia's systematic effort to interfere in the election ""deserves the attention of every American.""

He also made clear that he does not want to testify before Congress. If his office were to be dragged up to the Hill, he warned, any testimony ""would not go beyond our report.""

""It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself,"" Mueller told reporters in May. ""The report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.""

Still, House Democrats are anxious to get Mueller — even against his will — in front of a national TV audience. The calculation may be that any clips of Mueller speaking, even if he sticks to the script of the report, will register with many Americans in a way the special counsel's report did not.

Democratic leadership in the House remains opposed to impeachment at this time. But a growing number of the caucus' rank and file — nearly 80 members — support beginning impeachment proceedings against the president."
"FTC, Justice Dept. takes coordinated action against robocallers – TechCrunch",https://techcrunch.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/ftc-justice-department-robocall-action/,"Federal authorities have announced its latest crackdown on illegal robocallers — taking close to a hundred actions against several companies and individuals blamed for the recent barrage of spam calls.

In the so-called “Operation Call It Quits,” the Federal Trade Commission brought four cases — two filed on its behalf by the Justice Department — and three settlements in cases said to be responsible for making more than a billion illegal robocalls.

Several state and local authorities also brought actions as part of the operation, officials said.

Each year, billions of automatically dialed or spoofed phone calls trick millions into picking up the phone. An annoyance at least, at worse it tricks unsuspecting victims into turning over cash or buying fake or misleading products. So far, the FTC has fined companies more than $200 million but only collected less than 0.01% of the fines because of the agency’s limited enforcement powers.

In this new wave of action, the FTC said it will send a strong signal to the robocalling industry.

Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Americans are “fed up” with the billions of robocalls received every year. “Today’s joint effort shows that combatting this scourge remains a top priority for law enforcement agencies around the nation,” he said.

It’s the second time the FTC has acted in as many months. In May, the agency also took action against four companies accused of making “billions” of robocalls.

The FTC said its latest action brings the number of robocall violators up to 145.

Several of the cases involved shuttering operations that offer consumers “bogus” credit card interest rate reduction services, which the FTC said specifically targeted seniors. Other cases involved the use of illegal robocalls to promote money-making schemes.

Another cases included actions against Lifewatch, a company pitching medical alert systems, which the FTC contended uses spoofed caller ID information to trick victims into picking up the phone. The company settled for $25.3 million. Meanwhile, Redwood Scientific settled for $18.2 million, suspended due to the inability for defendant Danielle Cadiz to pay, for “deceptively” marketing dentistry products, according to the FTC’s complaint.

The robocalling epidemic has caught the attention of the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the telecoms and internet industries. Last month, its commissioners proposed a new rule that would make it easier for carriers to block robocalls."
"Acting ICE director: Detailed leak about planned raids was 'egregious,' put agents' lives at risk",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-ice-director-mark-morgan-leak-raids-egregious,"Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Mark Morgan said Tuesday that the detailed leak about planned ICE raids last week was ""egregious"" and placed agents' lives ""at risk.""

Morgan was asked on ""Fox & Friends"" about a report that Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan leaked the plans and ordered him to call off an operation that was expected to target 2,000 families living illegally in up to 10 cities across the country.

President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

Morgan declined to address the alleged stand-down order from McAleenan, saying it would not be ""appropriate"" for him to talk about ""privileged"" discussions with McAleenan or the White House.

""Detailed information about the operation was leaked and that's egregious. The operation was compromised and when that happens, the lives of agents and officers are absolutely put at risk,"" said Morgan.

The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April — prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello’s departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up — and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

“He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,” the source told Fox News. “He has been fighting this operation since its inception.”

McAleenan's office vehemently denied the accusation, saying through a spokesperson to ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan has never leaked anything in his 18-year career.

""That's exactly what I've heard ... that the acting secretary has denied that the leaks came from him,"" said Morgan.

A former senior Commerce Department official refused to answer more than 100 questions during an interview with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that centered on the Trump administration’s controversial decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, according to a transcript released Tuesday.

Commerce Department lawyers instructed James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Secretary Wilbur Ross, not to answer the committee’s questions about his contacts with the White House and his conversations with Ross.

Story Continued Below

Uthmeier was also directed not to discuss the contents of a memo he wrote to a senior Justice Department official, John Gore, that purportedly outlines legal arguments surrounding the addition of a citizenship question to the census. On several occasions, Uthmeier was also blocked from disclosing details about his own conversations with Gore.

The Trump administration has sought to block several witnesses from cooperating with House Democrats’ investigations, including the Oversight Committee’s investigation of the census and the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. In both cases, the Trump administration has asserted that current and former officials are immune from testifying about their conversations with the president and their tenure in the administration.

Earlier this month, the Oversight Committee voted to hold Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents about the citizenship question and the Justice and Commerce departments’ coordination in creating it. The vote came after Trump asserted executive privilege over all of the documents.

Late Monday night, the committee officially filed its contempt report.

Uthmeier, who worked at a law firm that counted Trump’s presidential campaign as a client, told the committee during his June 11 interview that he “spoke with White House personnel” about the citizenship question, but Commerce Department lawyers blocked him from stating the names of those White House officials. Uthmeier also acquiesced to the department’s demands that he refuse to answer questions about his conversations with Ross.

But Uthmeier did tell the committee that both Ross and Earl Comstock, Ross’ policy chief, asked him to look into the legal arguments about a citizenship question in early 2017. Commerce Department lawyers objected to every follow-up question seeking more details about those conversations, but Democrats said Uthmeier’s response showed that Ross lied to Congress about the true origins of the citizenship question when he said it was added to the census “solely” at the request of the Justice Department.

Uthmeier delivered his memo analyzing those legal questions to Gore, who then formally asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question.

Administration officials have said that the citizenship question was added to the 2020 census in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have been skeptical of that claim. Uthmeier did not answer a question about whether the memo he wrote for Gore discusses the Voting Rights Act.

When asked why he wrote the memo, Uthmeier said: “In my research, the Voting Rights Act came up, and I am not very familiar with the Voting Rights Act and all of its nuances, and thus, I was hoping John [Gore] would provide legal advice that dealt with the memo and the topics that I was investigating.” Uthmeier did not answer follow-up questions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the committee, said in a statement: “Official after official appearing before the committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-whites. The census is the foundation of our democracy, and our committee will continue doing everything in its power to ensure that it counts every single person in the United States.”

The committee has made the census probe — and the reasons a citizenship question was added — a central focus in its various investigations, which are also targeting Trump’s personal finances and the White House security clearance process.

Democrats say they’ve uncovered evidence supporting their claim that the Trump administration added the citizenship question in order to boost Republicans in future elections. Excluding noncitizens from the official census count, they say, would lead to redrawn congressional districts that favor Republicans.

Their investigation has revealed that administration officials spoke with immigration hard-liners known for their views on the citizenship question, including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, now-deceased GOP operative Thomas Hofeller, and John Baker, a law professor.

The White House blocked Kobach from answering the committee’s questions about his conversations with Trump and other senior officials, arguing that they are privileged. Hofeller opined frequently about how Republicans would benefit from a citizenship question. And Uthmeier told the committee that Baker, who espoused similar views, was a “long-time mentor.”"

Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images, FILE

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

""This has nothing to do with who’s in office. Things got worse two years ago because the media's attention turned off whistleblowers and turned on to politics and other things,"" she said Tuesday.

""It has nothing to do with who's in the president's office or who controls Congress. This is a malignant leadership culture that will outlast us all unless someone has the courage to break rank in leadership and finally change it."""
Student loan borrowers who say they were defrauded sue Betsy DeVos for failing to cancel their debt,https://www.cnbc.com,['Annie Nova'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/student-loan-borrowers-who-say-they-were-defrauded-sue-betsy-devos.html,"More than 150,000 former students of for-profit colleges filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday, claiming the agency is depriving them of the student debt relief to which they're legally entitled.

The plaintiffs, represented by Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates, accuse the Department of Education under DeVos of failing to implement an Obama-era regulation known as ""borrower defense, "" which allows students to have their federal student loans cancelled if their school misled them or engaged in other misconduct.

""The law is clear: Students who experienced fraud should not be required to pay back federal loans that should never have been made by the Department in the first place,"" said Toby Merrill, director of Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending.

Around 160,000 people have filed claims with the government that their school defrauded them, and new applications continue to pour in. Almost all of these complaints concern for-profit schools, of which there are some 7,000 around the country and which take in around 15% of government financial aid.

However, student loan borrowers have found themselves waiting without answers. The Department of Education hasn't approved or denied a borrower defense claim since June 2018.

An audit in 2017 by the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General found that government staff working on borrower defense claims had been instructed not to submit any additional applications for approval."
Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/24/735525569/treasury-department-launches-investigation-into-delays-behind-harriet-tubman-20-,"Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."
New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450169-new-epa-rule-would-allow-more-administration-officials-to-weigh-in-on-foia-requests,"More political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could soon have the authority to weigh in on public information requests.

The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as Wednesday and will not allow for a public comment period.

According to the new language in the FOIA rule signed by EPA chief Andrew Wheeler last week, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle FOIA requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

“It’s allowing political appointees to make the decision that records someone has presumably identified as being responsive are not actually responsive. That theoretically would allow sensitive documents, that the agency doesn't want to send you, to withhold those records -- and that should shake out eventually in a lawsuit if that's what's happening,” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights.

EPA strongly disputed that interpretation, saying the new rule does not grant appointees the ability to label responsive documents as non-responsive.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” said Michael Abboud, EPA spokesman.

Topic, who reviewed the text of the rule, said it’s common for FOIA officers at government agencies to initially find responsive documents to requests that other officials later dispute in terms of qualifying for public release.

He said the new language in the EPA rule suggests officials may have the opportunity to prevent release of the documents on the basis that they don’t meet the criteria, and are therefore non-responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” he said. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

EPA officials who would be authorized to make that decision include the administrator, deputy administrators, assistant administrators, deputy assistant administrators, regional administrators, deputy regional administrators, general counsel, deputy general counsels, regional counsels, deputy regional counsels and the inspector general or delegates of those individuals, according to the final rule.

The latest version differs from the previous rule, which granted the same rights to the “head of an office, or that individual's designee.”

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“It’s exceptionally difficult to litigate on the ‘basis of responsiveness.’ There is no record,” said Kevin Bell, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “FOIA litigation is always pretty one-sided, there is no discovery … now they are just saying, ‘Oh, it’s not responsive. Oh, we don’t have to tell you.’”

Bell equated EPA’s new FOIA rule to a similar regulatory action unveiled earlier this year at the Interior Department, called an “awareness review,” which allows political appointees 72 hours to review documents that mention them by name prior to release.

“It seems like EPA is doing about the same thing,” he said. “On the ‘basis of responsiveness’ and ‘no records responses’ are both things that we've seen in the environmental FOIA community time and again.""

EPA officials characterized the rule change as a much-needed update to regulations as stipulated by 2007, 2009 and 2016 congressional updates to FOIA processing. The Obama administration failed to change its FOIA regulations as charged by Congress, and the new rule brings EPA into compliance.

“The changes in today’s rule bring EPA’s regulations into compliance with non-discretionary provisions of the amended statute and reflect changes in the agency’s organization, procedure, or practice,” said a senior career EPA official who helped devise the regulation.

Critics argue the new rule specifically bestows more powers on political appointees to weigh in on specific FOIA cases.

“This new notice turns that upside down by substituting a wide array of political appointees for the career officials that heretofore have responded to FOIA requests for records in the possession of their offices,” said John Walke, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The rule changes, for the first time, place an army of EPA political appointees as the gatekeepers for determining whether Americans receive responsive government records in response to FOIA requests.”

The EPA official said the change to the “final determinations” authority in EPA’s new rule largely combines two previous FOIA rules and is not a significant change.

“This provision is not intended to be broader than the old regulations, which covered the subject in several provisions,” the official said.

“The old regulations state that ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of that office or other agency records when appropriate.’ All positions listed in the updated regulations fall within the ordinary meaning of ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee,’” the official added.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” according to a statement provided by EPA on the rule change.

The agency official described the change as a way to align regional office FOIA responses with the national office.

“We took a look across the agency and saw there were different practices as to how they reached out to requesters in the first instance after a request has come in. We saw an opportunity to create greater uniformity. One of the practices we’ll be adopting as this goes into effect is reaching out consistently to FOIA requesters with an initial letter,” the official said.

Bell warned that the new order could allow EPA political appointees to better control the documents ultimately released by regional offices. He said regional offices often have less political pressure to withhold more responsive materials.

“This is just making sure that every FOIA request that gets reviewed gets taken down the hall or next door to Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerTrump pick brings scrutiny to 'revolving door' between Pentagon, industry Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests MORE's office,” Bell said. “Basically, anytime a FOIA request goes up to the administration you can extend however long it will take and reduce what you get back.”

The EPA official said the changes would neither speed up nor slow down the FOIA process. Under President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump campaign buys full page ads in Miami newspapers ahead of Dem debates Trump administration's 'forced diplomacy' with Iran isn't working Roy Moore trails Republican field in Alabama MORE, the agency has experienced a huge uptick in FOIA requests and major backlog in processing, which has been exacerbated in some instances by a lack of funding to hire new staff to help with those requests.

“I don’t think this will change the speed or response at all. We’re trying to be consistent with outreach to requesters and not anticipating this will slow down our response,” the senior official said. “Our aspiration is to come into compliance with the statue, in the most straight and most direct way possible, without coming into any discretionary changes with the statue.”

The EPA has come under criticism for its handling of FOIA requests under Trump’s presidency. Last fall, agency heads clashed with top Democratic lawmakers over an admittance by then acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s chief of staff to investigators with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that certain FOIA requests were put under more intense scrutiny because they were “politically charged.”

The Trump administration made an unusual last-minute plea to the Supreme Court Tuesday, telling the justices that actions by lower courts make it urgent to act quickly to resolve the legality of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The Justice Department move followed an appeals court order earlier Tuesday, which returned one lawsuit over the census to a district court judge to address recently-discovered evidence that the addition of a citizenship question may have been intended to diminish the political impact of the Latino vote.

Story Continued Below

The latest tumult in the litigation was prompted by citizenship question opponents gaining access to evidence that the views of a deceased GOP redistricting expert, Thomas Hofeller, may have played a role in a Justice Department request that led to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross adding the citizenship query to the census questionnaire.

In a two-page letter to the high court, Solicitor General Noel Francisco essentially invited the justices to shut down the pending lawsuits by declaring that Ross’ decision was lawful and that further inquiry into the motives for the decision is unnecessary.

“The Fourth Circuit’s order underscores the need for this court to address the equal-protection claim and the immateriality of the Hofeller files in its disposition of the above-captioned case so that the lawfulness of the secretary’s decision can be fully and finally resolved,” Francisco wrote. He said the government needs a quick and clear decision by the end of this month in order to finalize the print version of the census forms for use next year.

However, late Tuesday night, civil rights groups fired back in a letter to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Trump administration is trying to short-circuit the normal judicial process by having the justices rule on something that hasn’t been formally presented to them.

“The Solicitor General’s request would require this Court to render an improper advisory opinion on issues that have not been briefed or argued before this Court, relating to cases that are not before this Court, based on a trial record that is not before this Court,” wrote Denise Hulett of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, or MALDEF, and Niyati Shah of Asian Americans Advancing Justice.

They also disputed the government’s claims of urgency, noting that the Census Bureau’s chief scientist testified that with additional resources the questionnaire could be finalized as late as October.

Before the Justice Department’s Supreme Court latest salvo, civil rights advocates celebrated the order from the Richmond, Va.-based 4th Circuit as an indication that arguments against the citizenship question were gaining traction.

“The always-flimsy house of cards shielding the Trump administration’s biased and nefarious intent in adding a citizenship query to Census 2020 is rapidly collapsing,” said Thomas Saenz of MALDEF. “We look forward to presenting our enhanced case demonstrating the unlawful nature of the late addition of the citizenship question, and to vindicating one of our most enduring and important constitutional principles.”

The Trump administration has maintained that it added the question to enhance Voting Rights Act enforcement, but opponents say it was done for partisan reasons to discourage citizen and noncitizen immigrants from responding to the census.

Three federal judges have ruled that the addition of the question was illegal because it was justified inadequately by the officials involved.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling on the issue this week. Decisions in some cases are expected Wednesday and additional releases are possible later in the week before the justices depart for their summer break.

DOJ Lawyer Receives Death Threats After Appearing In Viral ‘Toothbrush’ Video,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Jack Crowe', 'David French', 'Kevin D. Williamson', 'John Hirschauer', 'A. G.

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CBP provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CBP holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CBP and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CBP, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CBP agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate. Under current law, CBP agents must admit virtually all asylum seekers pending an immigration hearing, which as many as 90 percent of them fail to appear for.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that the Senate will vote in the coming days on a $4.5 billion aid package designed to address the government’s inability to adequately shelter the more than 100,000 asylum-seekers that have begun arriving at the southern border each month."
10-year Treasury yield falls below 2% after weak consumer confidence data,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/us-treasury-yields-lower-ahead-of-powells-speech.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% on Tuesday as investors looked for safety following the release of much weaker-than-expected confidence data.

Short-term rates rose off their lows, however, following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard and Chairman Jerome Powell.

The yield traded at 1.994% as of 3:33 p.m. ET. The 2-year rate held steady at 1.736% while the 30-year bond yield declined to 2.52%.

Bullard said Tuesday he doesn't believe the U.S. central bank needs to lower borrowing costs by 50 basis points at its next meeting despite his push to cut rates last week.

""Just sitting here today, I think 50 basis points would be overdone,"" Bullard told Bloomberg News. ""I don't think the situation really calls for that, but I would be willing to go 25 (basis points).""

In a speech in New York, Powell reiterated that inflation — or how much prices rise throughout the economy — continues to run below the central bank's 2% objective.

""The crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments,"" he said at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The central bank leader also said in prepared remarks that the Fed ""is insulated from short-term political pressures — what is often referred to as our 'independence.'""

""Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence,"" he added.

Those comments may allude to President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Fed and its monetary policies, which he believes are preventing stronger economic growth and keeping a lid on the stock market. Trump has also said the central bank's interest rate strategy undermines the administration's negotiating position in trade deliberations with China.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 121.5 in June, reaching its lowest level since September 2017. Conference Board senior director Lynn Franco said escalating trade fears appear to have ""shaken consumers' confidence.""

""Those survey readings of higher consumer confidence were just a lot of hot air as it turns out,"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note. ""If the Fed had had this almost ten point drop in the confidence number last week it may well have tipped the scale and led them to cut interest rates."""
USDA Confirms Silage Corn Can Be Planted On Prevent Plant Acres,https://www.dairyherd.com,['Anna-Lisa Laca'],,,,https://www.dairyherd.com/article/usda-confirms-silage-corn-can-be-planted-prevent-plant-acres,"This week, farmers in much of the eastern Corn Belt will be eligible to plant cover crops as the late-plant period on prevent plant acres ends there on June 26. Following last week’s announcement about the potential to harvest cover crops on September 1 instead of November 1 many farmers, particularly in the upper Midwest, started to wonder if silage corn would be eligible. According to Richard Flournoy, deputy administrator of product management for the USDA-Risk Management Agency (RMA), silage corn can be eligible for planting on prevent plant acres.

“A cover crop for crop insurance purposes, we have a broad definition, and it's generally many things that any crop that can be planted for erosion control, soil improvement, or any other type of conservation practice,” he told AgriTalk host Chip Flory.

If producers have questions about what could be considered a cover crop in their state, Flournoy suggests a visit to the local National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) office. Individual states can have a list of what crops can be considered cover crops.

Additionally, he says an “ag expert” can deem a crop eligible by determining the prospective crop meets all the cover crop definitions.

“We have on our website a link to all the folks who can be considered an expert,” he said. “A certified crop advisor is [someone] that could say in your area, corn for silage could be a cover crop. One key distinction there is it can't be corn for grain or seed, as long as it's for silage it meets that cover crop definition.”"
Mark Meadows: DOJ exploring 'unbelievably unusual activity' in final months of Obama administration,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-doj-exploring-unbelievably-unusual-activity-in-final-months-of-obama-administration,"Rep. Mark Meadows said the Justice Department is examining irregularities in the intelligence community as part of its review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Reacting to newly released documents on changes in U.S. procedures for sharing raw intelligence, Meadows said there was ""unbelievably unusual activity"" in the final months of the Obama administration.

""I can tell you that [U.S. Attorney] John Durham and Attorney General [William] Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,"" the North Carolina Republican said Monday evening on Fox News. ""They are including in part of their surveillance — really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.""

On Sean Hannity's show, before Meadows was brought on to speak along with colleague Rep. Jim Jordan, attorney Jay Sekulow discussed the latest findings by his conservative watchdog group, the American Center for Law and Justice.

The records obtained by the ACLJ showed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under James Clapper pushing to increase access to raw signal intelligence before President Trump took office. The New York Times first reported the expanded access to intercepted communications in January 2017. Although Hannity and Sekulow played up the newly released records, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, as suspiciously timed and ""rushed,"" the Times noted the discussions for such changes to remove bureaucratic barriers stretched back years dating back to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Still, Jordan said he suspects there was evidence of nefarious intent, tying the changes to an interview Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer did in January 2017 in which the New York Democrat warned then-incoming President Trump that intelligence officials ""have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.""

""So this is one of those six ways,"" Jordan said, adding that the other ""ways"" include British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier the CIA's use of informants to make contact with members of the Trump campaign.

Barr tasked Durham, a U.S. attorney from Connecticut, with leading the inquiry focused on the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, which the FBI began in the summer of 2016. The DOJ review of the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action.

Jordan noted how first Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to wrap up his investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse and that could influence Durham's efforts. ""The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation. And they have told us this is broader than just the FBI — they're going to look at all of this,"" Jordan said.

""First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.""

The Justice Department's examination of the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign has been cheered by Republicans and criticized by Democrats. After Trump granted Barr sweeping powers to declassify secret information and instructed a handful of agencies to cooperate with his investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff panned the effort as a ""disturbing"" scheme to politicize intelligence.

A DOJ letter written to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler outlining the scope of its investigation said the review is ""broad in scope and multifaceted"" and includes a look at actions both by the U.S. government and by foreigners."
VA health care workers say managers are trying to silence them on veteran care,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/25/veterans-affairs-health-care-workers-say-punished-speaking-out/1549658001/,"CLOSE Radiology technologist Jeff Dettbarn, alleges thousands of tests at the Iowa City VA were improperly canceled, potentially risking veterans’ lives. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Health care professionals from the Department of Veterans Affairs testified at a congressional hearing Tuesday that they are being punished for reporting problems with VA care, to the detriment of veterans and despite proclamations by the Trump administration that whistleblowers are celebrated and not scorned.

A physician from the Phoenix area, a psychologist from Baltimore and a CT technologist from Iowa City, Iowa, said they believe managers retaliated against them and tried to stop them from disclosing more issues at VA medical centers.

Their claims, first made in interviews with USA TODAY last week, contradict assertions by agency leaders and President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order and a law creating a VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within months of taking office. The office, he said, would ""make sure that they're protected.""

The VA inspector general has since launched an investigation of the office's handling of whistleblower cases. A report from the Government Accountability Office last year raised concerns about the office allowing employees accused of wrongdoing by whistleblowers to be involved in investigating the accusations.

The employees who testified Tuesday have a track record of raising concerns about VA health care – and all three have been stripped of patient care and oversight duties.

Dr. Katherine Mitchell reported inadequate training and triage in the emergency room of the Phoenix VA. Psychologist Minu Aghevli reported improper removal of veterans from wait lists for opioid-addiction treatment at the Baltimore VA. CT tech Jeff Dettbarn revealed administrators had mass-canceled diagnostic test orders at the Iowa City VA without determining if veterans still needed the tests.

Dettbarn has been assigned to paperwork duties since his revelations in 2017, Aghevli was transferred to a data entry post in April and Mitchell has been kept from patient safety issues and oversight for nearly five years.

Mitchell said the retaliation against her and others who speak out has sent a signal to other VA employees to keep their mouths shut and ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

Aghevli likewise said she feels her treatment is ""being used as a threat against other employees"" and has a ""chilling effect"" on their speaking up about problems.

“It has a terrible effect on veterans,” she said.

""For every person who wants to speak up, there are thousands that have tried, only to be removed, demoted, (and) silence(d),"" Dettbarn said.

They recommended that more resources and staff be provided to an outside federal agency that helps whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel, and an independent board that vets employee disciplinary appeals. They called for an overhaul of the Trump-created office.

Jacqueline Garrick, founder of nonprofit peer-support group Whistleblowers of America, testified that they are not alone – almost 200 VA employees have contacted her since 2017 complaining of retaliation for speaking out about problems at the agency.

""VA employees are ignored, attacked,"" she said, adding that the VA whistleblower office has not been the solution. ""Instead, it causes more harm,"" Garrick said.

Tom Devine, legal director at the Government Accountability Project, another nonprofit group that helps whistleblowers, said the office lacks comprehensive regulations and works on an ""ad hoc"" basis.

""This maximizes confusion and enables arbitrary action,"" Devine said.

VA spokesman Randall Noller told USA TODAY last week that an assistant secretary who took over the office in January, Tamara Bonzanto, has been ""working on a number of key improvements.""

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" he said.

Inspector General wants to know if USDA concealed worker safety data,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

Under a proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

The Office of Inspector General is evaluating whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture concealed information and used flawed data to develop and promote a new hog inspection system that would shift many food-safety tasks from federal inspectors to pork industry employees.

The USDA’s inspector general, Phyllis Fong, notified 16 members of Congress on Friday that her office has launched the probe in response to concerns the lawmakers raised in March, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

Under the proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want, a provision that has worker safety advocates concerned that worker injury rates would rise. The USDA said in a proposed rule — which if finalized would create the new system — that its data shows worker injury rates probably would be lower than those at traditional plants where limits are placed on line speeds.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat, and more than a dozen other Democrats sought the inspector general’s probe after two university experts reviewed the USDA’s data and analysis and concluded “it is impossible” for the department to “draw any statistically valid conclusion about worker injury rate differences.”

The data was not released until months after the 60-day public comment period for the rule had closed in April 2018 and only after Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by a Texas State University researcher and a worker safety advocacy group, the National Employment Law Project.



Durbin, who says he worked in a slaughterhouse for a year as a college student, said Monday he is glad the inspector general is heeding his request, adding that line speeds are “directly linked to worker safety.”

“Bowing to the meatpacking industry, the USDA relied on sketchy data to justify a major inspections change that could create unsafe working environments at pork processing plants in America,” Durbin said in a prepared statement for The Post. “I am concerned that the USDA also tried to hide this data from the public.”

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Debbie Berkowitz, a worker-safety expert with the law project, asked USDA officials to extend the public comment period to allow others to examine and remark on USDA’s data and its worker safety analysis, records show. No extension was granted.

A Post analysis of the public comments showed that out of 84,000 public remarks made on the rule, 87 percent were either opposed or expressed negative opinions about the proposal. In numerous instances, groups asked for additional information to properly evaluate the proposal.

“The bottom line here is USDA is rushing this rule through and really abandoning any effort to be transparent,” Berkowitz said in an interview.

USDA declined to comment on the Inspector General probe. In earlier statements, it has said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not USDA, has the “statutory and regulatory authority to promote workplace safety and health.”

Berkowitz, who was OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said the USDA does not “police companies about worker safety.” However, she said, “They should not be in the business of giving a green light to something that could cause further injury to workers.”

Illness rates for people who work in the meatpacking plants — including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis — are 16 times higher than the average for all other industries, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The proposed hog-slaughter rule is based on a study that began 20 years ago, ultimately including five large plants. Efforts to expand the program have sputtered under past administrations, but Trump administration officials have pushed forward with the rule and hoped to finalize it this summer.

The USDA expects 40 of 612 hog plants will use the new system. Collectively, agriculture officials say, these plants will account for 90 percent of the pork produced in the United States.

In her letter to Durbin and other lawmakers, Fong said her office will seek to determine whether the USDA did the following: complied with federal public transparency requirements; made information about its preliminary analysis on worker safety clearly accessible to the public during the comment period; adhered to the department’s own data quality guidelines; came to a reasonable determination about the reliability of OSHA injury data; and consulted with OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as it developed the rule.

The inquiry is expected to be complete by the end of the year, an inspector general spokeswoman said.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a 2020 appropriations bill that provides funding for USDA. However, the bill also requires that the Inspector General perform a more extensive data review before any funds are used for the new inspection system.

That requirement, proposed by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), would also include an examination of USDA data the department used to conclude that pork produced under the new system would be as safe as pork produced at plants using the traditional inspection system. It would also examine data USDA used to conclude the increased line speeds would not impact animal welfare. DeLauro called the proposed rule a “giveaway to large corporate meatpackers.”

In response to the inspector general’s probe, DeLauro said it is “an important first step toward ensuring the swine inspection rule changes are based on sound science by opening an investigation into the department’s use of flawed worker safety data. However, the OIG must expand their investigation to encompass all data USDA used to develop the proposed rule — as would be required by a provision I included in this year’s USDA funding bill.”

In an earlier statement, the North American Meat Institute, an industry group that supports the proposal, said: “This rule is founded on years of sound scientific data and experience. NAMI supports risk-based, science-driven food safety systems. Consumers deserve no less.”

Oregon plant that discharged tons of ammonia signs consent decree with U.S. Justice Department,https://www.oregonlive.com,"['Maxine Bernstein', 'Mbernstein Oregonian.Com', 'The Oregonian Oregonlive']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2019/06/oregon-plant-that-discharged-tons-of-ammonia-signs-consent-decree-with-federal-justice-department.html,"A company that failed to report a large-scale ammonia discharge from its plant just outside St. Helens and annual ammonia emission estimates has entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay a $492,000 fine and buy $931,500 in fire emergency equipment for area responders to handle environmental emergencies.

Dyno Nobel’s civil settlement with federal officials comes a year after the company paid a $250,000 fine for releasing more than six tons of anhydrous ammonia vapor into the air from the plant over three days starting on July 30, 2015 in a separate criminal case.

“We have worked cooperatively with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over the past eight-plus years to address these matters. Independent of its work with EPA, Dyno Nobel has implemented extensive upgrades to the facility to better manage emissions and improve our reporting protocols,” Jeffrey Droubay, the company’s senior vice president of legal and business affairs, said in a statement. “The health and safety of our employees and communities in which we operate is our first priority.''

Federal regulators accused the plant of failing to report hazardous releases of ammonia in a timely way, failing to accurately report annual releases of ammonia and failing to comply with all requirements to reduce the risk of a chemical accident at its plant, according to court records.

Under the decree, the Delaware-based company must hire an independent auditor to conduct regular compliance reviews, submit a revised risk management plan and adopt environmental safety procedures including the purchase of the emergency gear for Columbia Fire & Rescue and the Scappoose Rural Fire District.

The company must buy 50 sets of personal protective equipment, commonly known as “turnout gear,” for Columbia Fire & Rescue, 74 sets of self-contained breathing apparatus for Columbia Fire and 52 sets of the breathing apparatus for Scappoose Rural Fire District.

The Environmental Protection Agency will review all steps the company must take under the decree. If the company violates any of the required changes, it could face further financial penalties ranging from $1,000 per violation per day to $7,500 per violation per day.

A federal judge will retain oversight over the consent decree until the settlement’s terms are completed. It will remain in effect for at least three years after the reforms are adopted.

Dyno Nobel is located on 90 acres of Deer Island near St. Helens, employs 80 people and operates around-the-clock every day of the year. The Oregon plant makes ammonia and nitric acid, which is used in fertilizer, under high pressure and temperature, and other chemical products for fertilizer, refrigerant, and other agricultural and industrial applications, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In a separate settlement reached last year with federal prosecutors, the company acknowledged that it didn’t immediately notify the National Response Center, which is required under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, known as CERCLA, of its excessive ammonia discharge in 2015.

Company officials knew the excessive ammonia emissions were occurring but made no effort to alert authorities until Aug. 7, 2015, more than a week after the first discharge, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Bounds and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Karla Gebel Perrin.

Anhydrous ammonia is a pungent gas with suffocating fumes. Exposure to high concentrations can lead to death, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The emissions triggered numerous complaints from neighboring residents in Columbia County, who reported foul odors, eye irritation and difficulty breathing, prosecutors said.

“Dyno Nobel has taken actions to address air emission issues over the past few years including tens of millions of dollars in new technology, investments, and upgrades to improve the facility’s ability to control emissions,’’ Droubay said in the statement.

The Cuyahoga River caught fire 50 years ago. These stomach-churning photos highlight why the EPA exists.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-photos-of-cuyahoga-river-on-fire-before-epa-2019-6,"Fifty years ago, on June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire.

At the time, the river was one of the most polluted in the US. Journalists filled glasses with pitch-black river water, while politicians dipped cloth into the waves that came up oil-soaked.

The river fire lasted roughly 20 minutes, but it sparked public outrage that in part led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office tasked with making sure ""Americans have clean air, land, and water.""

Take a look at what the Cuyahoga River — and other waters around the US — looked like before the EPA existed."

His LinkedIn profile lists “June 2019” as the end of his Treasury job, without providing a specific date. Bloomberg wrote last week about Phillips’ departure.

Phillips’ LinkedIn profile now says: “He supported Secretary Mnuchin in the development of policy for comprehensive housing finance reform.”

What it doesn't say: Oversaw the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Phillips, the ultimate Wall Street insider, was seen by some as the great hope for reforming and releasing the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, from government conservatorship. In a New York Times story last month saying he planned to leave, Phillips said he would return to Wall Street but didn’t have a job lined up yet. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t list a current position.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said earlier this month that he hoped Treasury’s plan to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would come by the end of June. The White House is reviewing a draft of the proposal, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. The two mortgage giants guarantee more than half of the outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data.

The departure of Phillips “matters” to the prospects of getting Fannie and Freddie back to anything resembling the footing they had before the housing crisis a decade ago, Jaret Seiberg, Managing Director at Cowen Group, said in a note to clients on Friday.

“Phillips was one of the few senior folks at Treasury with the clout to negotiate on GSE reform,” Seiberg wrote in the note. “While we believe he finished the Treasury white paper on GSE reform before he left, his departure means that Phillips cannot push the National Economic Council to approve the document. More broadly, Mnuchin has few other senior advisers and he devotes much of his time to trade disputes. The argument is that Mnuchin simply lacks the time and energy needed to advance a housing finance reform plan given the controversy that will surround any plan to recap and release Fannie and Freddie.”

After more than three decades at Wall Street firms, some of it spent as a mortgage trader, Phillips joined the Trump administration in 2017. He left a position as managing director at BlackRock to become Mnuchin’s top housing advisor. Prior to BlackRock, he held managing director positions at both Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, according to LinkedIn.

Last year, Phillips said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Trump administration wants to end the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie that began in July 2008 during the financial crisis.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”"

Several Democrats criticized Monday the Trump administration after POLITICO reported the Agriculture Department has largely stopped promoting its own climate science.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who's also running for president, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue expressing ""deep concern and alarm"" over the report. The Minnesota Democrat asked the department to explain its justification for not publicizing certain studies and to immediately release ""any [Agricultural Research Service] study related to climate science that was ignored, downplayed, or its findings held back.""

""When federally-funded scientific research is curtailed or withheld because of its attention to the consequences of climate change, farmers are cut out of participating in climate solutions and, at worst, unable to effectively mitigate and adapt their operations and infrastructure to its effects,"" she wrote.

Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) tweeted the story, calling it ""outrageous.""

""Climate change is an urgent threat to our farmers,"" she said. ""The Administration should not be burying vital research that will help us understand and combat the effects of climate change.""

Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, also took to Twitter to criticize the department. The Vermont Democrat said USDA scientists lead the world in studying the effects of climate change.

""While our farmers fight against #ClimateChange, #USDA is shamefully fighting against #science,"" he wrote.

In addition to Klobuchar, two other 2020 contenders logged their disapproval. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) tweeted about the story twice today and issued a statement.

The Trump Administration’s attempts to suppress climate science are unacceptable. This isn’t a political game — this is the livelihoods and futures of farmers & ranchers across the country.



We need answers. That’s why I will be calling on @USDA to release the science. https://t.co/Urzj7z0wAn — Michael Bennet (@SenatorBennet) June 24, 2019

""Our farmers and ranchers know as well as anyone the devastating effects of climate change, because they're living with the realities of droughts in places like Colorado and floods in places like Iowa,"" he said.

Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur, tweeted the story soon after it posted Sunday evening: ""Suppressing scientific research and findings is the opposite of what we should be doing.""

There are two principal complaints, as related in the New York Times and The New Republic. The Trump administration is inconsistent on human rights, giving a pass to allies such as Saudi Arabia while coming down hard on adversaries such as Iran. And the commission will try to push a narrow theocratic conception of human rights, one that scants gay rights and the right to abortion.

The first complaint is correct, but not distinctive to President Trump. No administration is or can be entirely consistent on human rights. . . . The U.S. has a lot of interests and they cannot always be simultaneously pursued. The Barack Obama administration was softer than Trump on Iran and harder on Saudi Arabia, in keeping with its own larger foreign-policy aims.

"Homeland Security, other federal agencies remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, Senate panel finds",https://www.dispatch.com,"['Jessica Wehrman', 'Jessica Wehrman Dispatch Washington Bureau']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190625/homeland-security-other-federal-agencies-remain-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-senate-panel-finds,"The Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, a Senate subcommittee chaired by Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has found.

WASHINGTON — Federal government offices are wildly vulnerable to cyberattacks, with the number of cyber incidents reported by federal agencies increasing more than 1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.

But those being attacked are doing very little to protect themselves, according to the results of a 10-month Senate investigation of eight federal agencies.

The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, found that the Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, leaving them susceptible to cyberattack and Americans’ personal information vulnerable to theft.

The problems range from systems so antiquated that they can’t be updated with new security patches to agencies that year after year fail to protect the personal information of millions of Americans.

Get the news delivered to your inbox: Sign up for our politics newsletter

The subcommittee studied 10 years’ worth of government audits of the IT systems of the Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Education departments and the Social Security Administration.

Their investigation comes after a surge in data breaches in the federal government, with agencies including the Postal Service, the IRS and the White House reporting attacks.

In 2015, for example, a hacker broke into government databases to gain access to 22 million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel Management.

In 2017 alone, federal agencies reported 35,277 cyber incidents.

Federal agencies often have access to sensitive information because of the very nature of what they do.

The Department of Education collects financial data on students and parents applying for college loans.

Disabled Americans must provide years of health records to prove they are entitled to disability benefits from the Social Security Administration.

And homeowners must provide payroll and savings information to HUD to qualify for home loans.

Congress tasked agencies with securing their information technology networks as far back as 2002, and asked each agency’s inspector general to annually audit compliance with basic cybersecurity standards.

But the subcommittee found that most of the agencies studied were failing to comply with even the most basic standards, including properly protecting personally identifiable information.

Five agencies did not maintain a comprehensive and accurate list of IT assets, meaning they had no idea which applications were operating on their networks.

All eight agencies failed to install security patches and other updates to prevent their systems from being vulnerable to attack.

In the most recent audits, seven of the eight agencies failed to provide for the adequate protection of personally identifiable information.

And all of the agencies used legacy systems that were so old that vendors no longer support or issue updates to patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Homeland Security, for example, uses Windows 2003 on some of its systems.

The setup used by HUD to initiate and track loan-case numbers and associated data is so old that lenders are unable to submit loan applications electronically and must instead send hard copies through the mail.

In some cases, Social Security’s system to hold retirement and disability information on millions of Americans uses a programming language developed in the 1950s and 1960s — a language that will become increasingly obsolete as the IT professionals who know the language retire.

Some of the agencies are particularly susceptible to attack. The Department of Education, for example, has been unable to prevent unauthorized outside devices from easily connecting to the agency’s network since 2011.

In its 2018 audit, that department’s inspector general found that it had been able to restrict unauthorized access to 90 seconds — still enough time for a hacker to “launch an attack or gain intermittent access to internal network resources that could lead to” exposing the agency’s data.

Portman said federal agencies “have failed at implementing basic cybersecurity practices, leaving classified, personal and sensitive information unsafe and vulnerable to theft.”

“The federal government can, and must, do a better job of shoring up our defenses against the rising cybersecurity threats,” he said.

The report makes a list of recommendations aimed at securing government IT systems. Among them are ones urging federal agencies to consolidate security processes and capabilities in order to better detect cybersecurity incidents and another calling on each agency to give broader authority and latitude to their chief information officer to make organization-wide decisions regarding cybersecurity.

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, the ranking member of the subcommittee, said the Office of Management and Budget — the agency responsible for cybersecurity efforts across government — “must provide the necessary leadership to ensure that agencies are staying vigilant and prioritizing good cybersecurity practices.”

“We know that the threats posed by cyberattacks continue to evolve and grow every day, so it is crucial that agencies across our government prioritize efforts to better protect their networks from hackers,” he said.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)

Jeff Alson was sitting in his apartment in Ann Arbor, Mich., when he felt like he was going to explode.

The retired environmental engineer, who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency for 40 years, had just read a letter written by one of his old bosses, agency chief Andrew Wheeler.

In it, Wheeler told Congress that EPA career experts had not been cut out of the process of crafting one of the Trump administration's most controversial environmental proposals to date — one that would abandon one of President Barack Obama's signature climate policies.

Alson was one of those EPA experts before retiring in April 2018. He was fuming, he later said, because he believed what Wheeler was saying was wrong.

“I gave myself five minutes,” the 63-year-old retiree said in an interview Friday. “I sat there and tried to calm down. But I said, 'You know what? Enough is enough.' ""

Alson is speaking out at a moment of rising tension between Trump officials and California regulators as the federal government prepares to freeze in place pollution rules for new cars and light trucks for the next six years — rather than ratchet them up to rein in carbon emissions as the Obama administration wanted to do.

Wheeler and Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, spent Thursday trading barbs after failed negotiations to allow California to keep its waiver allowing the state to set its own rules under the Clean Air Act, a practice the federal government has sanctioned for decades.

In prepared testimony, Nichols told lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee that in more than a dozen meetings with federal officials, “the Trump Administration has been unwilling to find a way” toward a resolution between with California.

She also said that “U.S. EPA’s professional staff and California’s engineers were cut out of this proposal’s development.”

Responding in his own letter to lawmakers, Wheeler said Nichols never offered a counterproposal and accused Nichols of not being “a good faith actor in this rulemaking.” He added that ""[h]er testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false.”

It was that last statement that got Alson's blood boiling.

“I can speak from direct experience that Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying,” he said.

According to Alson, under previous administrations technical staff at the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Transportation Department, would spend hours ironing out details of how fuel-efficiency standards should work before the agencies jointly rolled out the tailpipe rules for new cars.

But Alson said before the Trump administration's proposal was rolled out, there were no such technical meetings between the technical staffs of NHTSA and the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, the EPA's state-of-the-art facility in Michigan where investigators helped uncover the Volkswagen emissions scandal and where Alson worked for decades.

Instead, he said, there were only a few what he calls “check-the-box"" meetings between the agencies in early 2018.

“NHTSA was unwilling to tell EPA what they were doing,” Alson said. “At the end of the day, they completely controlled every piece of analysis.”

During a joint hearing of two House Energy and Commerce subcommittees Thursday, Democrats grilled the EPA’s air policy chief, Bill Wehrum, about his office's involvement in the proposal.

“Was it accurate that they had little involvement in the process?” said Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), referring to the Office of Air and Radiation.

“Through the course of this rulemaking, EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum responded.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud reiterated the points made in Wheeler's letter. “The letter speaks for itself,” Abboud said. “Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule.”

But documents released in the rulemaking process last year show bitter disagreement between the two agencies over the logic of the move.

The Transportation Department agency said that upping car mileage per gallon make new cars more expensive and lead to consumers putting off purchases. That, in turn, would mean more older cars on the road that would not perform well in accidents and more auto fatalities.

An internal EPA analysis at the time, however, found that not going through with the Obama-era rules would lead to slightly more fatalities. At one point, the disagreement became so pronounced that an EPA staffer asked for the agency's name and logo to be removed from a key regulatory report.

California and other states have vowed to challenge the freezing of the fuel-efficiency standards in court once they are finalized. If the EPA's technical staff were cut out of the process, as Alson contends, that may provide fodder for a lawsuit.

“The Clean Air Act requires EPA to be 'the decider' for its own rules, so IF it could be clearly shown in the record that EPA relinquished decision-making authority to NHTSA, that could be a problem for EPA in the courts,” Jody Freeman, director of Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program, wrote by email.

Alson said he is going public now because most of his former colleagues still work at the agency and can't “set the record straight” without fear of reprimand.

“I felt a responsibility to do that because I'm the only person who could stand up and do that,” he said. “Everybody else who still works there can't say that.”

— Jay Inslee releases another climate plan: This latest one from the Washington governor and climate-focused candidate for president aims to end subsidies for fossil-fuel production, ban new federal fossil-fuel leasing, restrict drilling and mining under existing leases and create a new office in the Justice Department to prosecute polluters. The plan, released Monday morning, earned early praise from environmentalists. ""I'm really heartened by Jay Inslee's commitment to tell hard truths to fossil fuel industries, and in offering a truly comprehensive climate plan for American voters,"" said RL Miller, founder of Climate Hawks Vote.

— White House unveils draft guidance on how agencies must account for climate change: The White House Council on Environmental Quality issued draft guidance Friday telling federal agencies they no longer have to take long-term climate impacts into account when reviewing how projects affect the environment.. The proposal means agencies “no longer have to take a project’s long-term climate impacts into account when assessing how they will affect the environment,” The Post’s Juliet Eilperin reports. The guidance reverses an April 2016 directive that agencies must quantify their long-term contribution to climate change.

But: Legal experts warn the new guidance: ""could cause further problems for the administration in court, where judges have suggested officials need to do a better job of assessing the climate impact of their decisions,"" Eilperin writes.

— Standoff continues in Oregon: After Republican senators walked out of the state capitol last week to avoid a vote on a climate change bill, the GOP members were absent again on Sunday.

One Republican state senator, Cliff Bentz, told the Oregonian in a phone interview from somewhere in Idaho that he’s glad there is increased attention around “one of the biggest issues of our time,” meaning climate change, and the party’s concern with the Democratic-backed cap-and-trade bill. The Post’s Reis Thebault and Michael Brice-Saddler reported Friday the state capitol was shut down because of credible threats from militia groups. “Friday night’s menacing escalation was the latest in a bizarre feud between the state’s Democrats and Republicans, who have clashed repeatedly during this year’s legislative session,” they write.

Why this is happening now: “Democrats have a supermajority in Oregon, allowing them the rare opportunity to pass the legislation of their dreams — but without Republicans, they can’t achieve a quorum,” Thebault and Brice-Saddler report. “No quorum, no vote. GOP senators said they had two options: allow a bill that they said would devastate their constituents to pass, or make a run for it.”

— Court strikes down federal approval for Cadiz pipeline: A federal judge has thrown out approval that the Bureau of Land Management under President Trump granted to Cadiz Inc. to build a water pipeline across public land in California. The agency under Trump reversed a 2015 decision by the Obama administration to say Cadiz could not use the existing railroad right of way across federal land, the Los Angeles Times reports.

— Climate-related studies blocked: The Trump administration has blocked the release of dozens of government-funded studies that warn about various climate-related dangers — all peer-reviewed and cleared by scientists at the non-partisan Agriculture Research Service, Politico reports.

A spokesperson for the Agriculture Department said there have been no such orders within the agency to stop the promotion of climate science. “The studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment … to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle,” per the report. “None of the studies were focused on the causes of global warming – an often politically charged issue. Rather, the research examined the wide-ranging effects of rising carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures and volatile weather.”

— Supreme Court sides with property owners: The high court sided in a 5-to-4 decision with a Pennsylvania woman in a case involving land-use regulations, overturning a precedent that required landowners to bring claims against local governments in state court before going to federal court. The ruling is “likely to have ripple effects on land use and environmental regulations,” E&E News reports. “[Chief Justice John Roberts] reasoned that landowners have a claim under the Fifth Amendment — which bars the government from taking property without compensation — as soon as the taking occurs and therefore have access to federal court right away.”

— A proposed wildfire fund in California: In an effort to assist utilities in the state and protect ratepayers from the rising costs associated with liability claims after catastrophic wildfires, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has proposed a new wildfire fund. The money for the $21 billion fund would be generated by $10.5 billion from extending an existing charge on utility customer bills, the Los Angeles Times reports, as well as $10.5 billion matched by investor-owned utilities. “The proposal stops short of meeting investor demands that the state change its doctrine of inverse condemnation, which holds utilities responsible for wildfire damage linked to their equipment,” per the report. “But Newsom’s advisors said they were confident that a fund coupled with a new safety certification process would stabilize the industry’s finances, ensure that wildfire victims can recoup losses and reduce fire risks.”

— What goes up must come down, as litter: According to the environmental nonprofit group Alliance for the Great Lakers, there were 18,000 balloons or balloon debris, including strings, found along the shorelines of the Great Lakes between 2016 and 2018, the Detroit Free Press reports. “Heightened understanding of problems associated with balloon litter has led five states to limit or ban intentional releases. At least eight others are considering restrictions,” per the report.

— Philadelphia refinery fire extinguished: The fire that erupted at a crude oil refinery in Philadelphia on Friday morning was extinguished over the weekend, as an investigation into the cause began. “Officials said the gas valve that had been fueling the blaze has been shut off and the tank involved in the explosion has been isolated,” the Associated Press reports. “Officials say the fire department’s hazmat unit and the public health department are still monitoring air quality. No threat to public health has been reported.”

— A bump in the road for the energy storage boom: Energy storage researchers and advocates are closely monitoring the ongoing investigation over an April fire and explosion of a massive battery in Phoenix. The incident underlined some of the concerns and risks associated with the burgeoning technology that will be key to the growth of renewable energy, the Associated Press reports. “Nearly all of the utility-scale batteries now on the grid or in development are massive versions of the same lithium ion technology that powers cellphones and laptops. If the batteries get too hot, a fire can start and trigger a phenomenon known as thermal runaway, in which the fire feeds on itself and is nearly impossible to stop until it consumes all the available fuel,” per the report. George Crabtree, director of the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research, told the AP the probe is “getting attention, and I think everyone realizes that too many safety incidents . . . will be detrimental going forward.”

POLITICO Investigation Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change The Trump administration has stopped promoting government-funded research into how higher temperatures can damage crops and pose health risks.

The Trump administration has refused to publicize dozens of government-funded studies that carry warnings about the effects of climate change, defying a longstanding practice of touting such findings by the Agriculture Department’s acclaimed in-house scientists.

The studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment — a potentially serious health concern for the 600 million people world-wide whose diet consists mostly of rice — to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle.

Story Continued Below

All of these studies were peer-reviewed by scientists and cleared through the non-partisan Agricultural Research Service, one of the world’s leading sources of scientific information for farmers and consumers.

None of the studies were focused on the causes of global warming – an often politically charged issue. Rather, the research examined the wide-ranging effects of rising carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures and volatile weather.

The administration, researchers said, appears to be trying to limit the circulation of evidence of climate change and avoid press coverage that may raise questions about the administration’s stance on the issue.

“The intent is to try to suppress a message — in this case, the increasing danger of human-caused climate change,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “Who loses out? The people, who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise and unprecedented super storms, droughts, wildfires and heat waves.”

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who has expressed skepticism about climate science in the past and allegedly retaliated against in-house economists whose findings contradicted administration policies, declined to comment. A spokesperson for USDA said there have been no directives within the department that discouraged the dissemination of climate-related science.

“Research continues on these subjects and we promote the research once researchers are ready to announce the findings, after going through the appropriate reviews and clearances,” the spokesperson said in an email.

“USDA has several thousand scientists and over 100,000 employees who work on myriad topics and issues; not every single finding or piece of work solicits a government press release,” the spokesperson added.

However, a POLITICO investigation revealed a persistent pattern in which the Trump administration refused to draw attention to findings that show the potential dangers and consequences of climate change, covering dozens of separate studies. The administration’s moves flout decades of department practice of promoting its research in the spirit of educating farmers and consumers around the world, according to an analysis of USDA communications under previous administrations.

The lack of promotion means research from scores of government scientists receives less public attention. Climate-related studies are still being published without fanfare in scientific journals, but they can be very difficult to find. The USDA doesn’t post all its studies in one place.

Since Trump took office in January 2017, the Agricultural Research Service has issued releases for just two climate-related studies, both of which had findings that were favorable to the politically powerful meat industry. One found that beef production makes a relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and another that removing animal products from the diet for environmental reasons would likely cause widespread nutritional problems. The agency issued a third press release about soy processing that briefly mentioned greenhouse gas emissions, noting that reducing fossil fuel use or emissions was “a personal consideration” for farmers.

By contrast, POLITICO found that in the case of the groundbreaking rice study USDA officials not only withheld their own prepared release, but actively sought to prevent dissemination of the findings by the agency’s research partners.

Researchers at the University of Washington had collaborated with scientists at USDA, as well as others in Japan, China and Australia, for more than two years to study how rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could affect rice — humanity’s most important crop. They found that it not only loses protein and minerals, but is also likely to lose key vitamins as plants adapt to a changing environment.

The study had undergone intensive review, addressing questions from academic peers and within USDA itself. But after having prepared an announcement of the findings, the department abruptly decided not to publicize the study and urged the University of Washington to hold back its own release on the findings, which two of their researchers had co-authored.

In an email to staffers dated May 7, 2018, an incredulous Jeff Hodson, a UW communications director, advised his colleagues that the USDA communications office was “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science.”

""It was so unusual to have an agency basically say: ‘Don't do a press release,’ "" Hodson recalled in an interview. ""We stand for spreading the word about the science we do, especially when it has a potential impact on millions and millions of people.""

Researchers say the failure to publicize their work damages the credibility of the Agriculture Department and represents an unwarranted political intrusion into science.

“Why the hell is the U.S., which is ostensibly the leader in science research, ignoring this?” said one USDA scientist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the possibility of retaliation. “It’s not like we’re working on something that’s esoteric … we’re working on something that has dire consequences for the entire planet.”

“You can only postpone reality for so long,” the researcher added.

With a budget of just over $1 billion, the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service — known as ARS — is often referred to as “one of the best kept secrets” in the sprawling department because of its outsize impact on society. The agency has pioneered a variety of major breakthroughs, from figuring out how to mass produce penicillin so it could be widely used during World War II to coming up with creative ways to keep sliced apples from browning, and has for decades been at the forefront of understanding how a changing climate will affect agriculture.

The agency has stringent guidelines to prevent political meddling in research projects themselves. The Trump administration, researchers say, is not directly censoring scientific findings or black-balling research on climate change. Instead, they say, officials are essentially choosing to ignore or downplay findings that don’t line up with the administration’s agenda.

Some scientists see the fact that the administration has targeted another research arm of USDA, the Economic Research Service, as a warning shot. Perdue is moving ERS out of Washington, which some economists see as retribution for issuing reports that countered the administration’s agenda, as POLITICO recently reported.

“There’s a sense that you should watch what you say,” said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s going to result in some pretty big gaps in practical knowledge. … it will take years to undo the damage.”

Among the ARS studies that did not receive publicity from the Agriculture Department are:



A 2017 finding that climate change was likely to increase agricultural pollution and nutrient runoff in the Lower Mississippi River Delta, but that certain conservation practices, including not tilling soil and planting cover crops, would help farmers more than compensate and bring down pollutant loads regardless of the impacts of climate change.

A January 2018 finding that the Southern Plains — the agriculture-rich region that stretches from Kansas to Texas — is increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, from the crops that rely on the waning Ogallala aquifer to the cattle that graze the grasslands.

An April 2018 finding that elevated CO2 levels lead to “substantial and persistent” declines in the quality of certain prairie grasses that are important for raising cattle. The protein content in the grass drops as photosynthesis kicks into high gear due to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — a trend that could pose health problems for the animals and cost ranchers money.

A July 2018 finding that coffee, which is already being affected by climate change, can potentially help scientists figure out how to evaluate and respond to the complex interactions between plants, pests and a changing environment. Rising CO2 in the atmosphere is projected to alter pest biology, such as by making weeds proliferate or temperatures more hospitable to damaging insects.

An October 2018 finding, in conjunction with the USDA Forest Service, that climate change would likely lead to more runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed during certain seasons.

A March 2019 finding that increased temperature swings might already be boosting pollen to the point that it’s contributing to longer and more intense allergy seasons across the northern hemisphere. “This study, done across multiple continents, highlights an important link between ongoing global warming and public health—one that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase,” the researchers wrote.

Those were among at least 45 ARS studies related to climate change since the beginning of the Trump administration that did not receive any promotion, according to POLITICO’s review. The total number of studies that have published on climate-related issues is likely to be larger, because ARS studies appear across a broad range of narrowly focused journals and can be difficult to locate.

Five days after POLITICO presented its findings to the department and asked for a response, ARS issued a press release on wheat genetics that used the term “climate change.” It marked the third time the agency had used the term in a press release touting scientific findings in two and a half years.

While spokespeople say Perdue, the former Georgia governor who has been agriculture secretary since April 2017, has not interfered with ARS or the dissemination of its studies, the secretary has recently suggested that he’s at times been frustrated with USDA research.

“We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers,” he said in April, responding to a question from POLITICO. “That relies on sound, replicable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

President Donald Trump, for his part, has been clear about his views on climate science and agricultural research generally: He doesn’t think much of either.

In each of his budgets, Trump has proposed deep cuts to agricultural research, requests that ignore a broad, bipartisan coalition urging more funding for such science as China and other competitors accelerate their spending. Congress has so far kept funding mostly flat.

The president has also repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus on climate change. After the government released its latest national climate assessment in November, a sweeping document based on science, Trump bluntly told reporters: ""I don't believe it.""

Officials at USDA apparently took the hint and the department did not promote the report, despite the fact that it was drafted in part by its own scientists and included serious warnings about how a changing climate poses a threat to farmers and ranchers across the country.

The USDA’s failure to publicize climate-related research does more than just quell media coverage: It can also prompt universities, fearful of antagonizing a potential source of funding, to reconsider their own plans to publicize studies.

The saga of the rice study last spring shows how a snub from USDA can create spillover effects throughout the academic world.

Emails obtained by POLITICO from one of the study’s co-authors show that ARS communications staff actually wrote a release on the study, but then decided not to send it out. The Agriculture Department and UW in Seattle had initially planned to coordinate their releases, which would both be included in a press packet prepared by the journal Science Advances, which published the study in May.

The journal had anticipated there would be significant media interest in the paper. Several earlier studies had already shown that rice loses protein, zinc and iron under the elevated CO2 levels that scientists predict for later this century, raising potentially serious concerns for hundreds of millions of people who are highly dependent on rice and already at risk of food insecurity. This latest study by ARS and its academic partners around the world had confirmed those previous findings and — for the first time — found that vitamins can also drop out of rice in these conditions.

Several days before the paper was slated to be published, Hodson, the UW communications official, sent ARS communications staff a draft of the press release the university was planning to send out. ARS officials returned the favor, sending UW their own draft press release. The headline on USDA’s draft was clear: “Rising Carbon Dioxide Levels Can Reduce Vitamin Content in Rice,” though the body of the release did not mention the word “climate.”

All seemed to be on track for the rollout. A few days later, however, Hodson got a phone call from an ARS communications staffer. She told him that the agency had decided not to issue a press release after all and suggested UW reconsider its plans, noting that senior leaders at ARS now had serious concerns about the paper, according to the emails.

The staffer explained that officials were “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science,” Hodson wrote in his email to his colleagues shortly after the call.

Having the Agriculture Department question the data just days before its publication struck many of the co-authors as inappropriate. The paper had already gone through a technical and policy review within ARS, both of which are standard procedure, and it had gone through a stringent peer-review process.

Kristie Ebi, one of the co-authors from UW, replied to Hodson: “Interesting — USDA is really trying to keep the press release from coming out.”

Nonetheless, senior leaders at UW took USDA’s concerns about the paper seriously, Hodson said. (It also wasn’t lost on anyone, he said, that other parts of the university receive substantial grant funding from the Agriculture Department.) The university conducted an internal review and determined that the science was sound. It went ahead with its press release.

The USDA’s attempt to quash the release had ripple effects as far as Nebraska. After catching wind of USDA’s call to the University of Washington, Bryan College of Health Sciences, in Lincoln, Neb., delayed and ultimately shortened its own release to avoid potentially offending the Agriculture Department.

“I’m disappointed,” said Irakli Loladze, a mathematical biologist at Bryan who co-authored the rice paper. “I do not even work at the USDA, but a potential call from the government agency was enough of a threat for my school to skip participating in the press-package arranged by the journal. Instead, our college issued a local and abbreviated release.""

A spokesperson for Bryan College said that the institution supports Loladze’s work and noted that the college ultimately issued its own press release and covered the study in its own publications.

“There was no omission or intentional delay based on what others were saying or doing,” the spokesperson said.

Despite the efforts of the Agriculture Department, the rice paper attracted substantial international press coverage, largely because many of the outside institutions that collaborated on the study, including the University of Tokyo, promoted it.

Kazuhiko Kobayashi, an agricultural scientist at the University of Tokyo and co-author on the paper, said he couldn’t understand why the U.S. government wouldn’t publicize such findings.

“It’s not necessarily bad for USDA,” he said in an interview. “Actually, it’s kind of neutral.”

“In Japan we have an expression: sontaku,” he said, offering his own speculation about the political dynamic in the United States. “It means that you don’t want to stimulate your boss … you feel you cannot predict your boss’s reaction.”

A USDA spokesperson said the decision to spike the press release on the rice study was driven by a scientific disagreement, not by the fact that it was climate-related.

“The concern was about nutritional claims, not anything relating to climate change or C02 levels,” the spokesperson said in an email. “The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency. They felt that the data do not support this.”

The spokesperson said no political appointees were involved in the decision.

Authors of the rice study strongly disagreed with the concerns USDA raised about their paper. In an email leading up to publication, Loladze, the Bryan College researcher, accused the department of essentially “cherry picking” data to raise issues that weren’t scientifically valid, according to the emails.

When the Agriculture Department chooses to promote a study, the impact can be significant, particularly for the agriculture-focused news outlets that are widely read by farmers and ranchers.

Earlier this year, when the agency decided to issue its release about the study finding that producing beef — often criticized for having an outsize carbon and water footprint — actually makes up a very small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions, the agricultural trade press cranked out several stories, much to the delight of the beef industry. The study had also been supported by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

The USDA’s efforts to hide climate work aren’t limited to ARS. A review of department press releases, blog posts and social media shows a clear pattern of avoiding the topic. These platforms largely eschew the term “climate change” and also steer clear of climate-related terms. Even the word “climate” itself appears to have now fallen out of favor, along with phrases like carbon, greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation and sequestration.

In April, for example, USDA sent out a press release noting that USDA officials had signed on to a communique on the sidelines of a G-20 agricultural scientists' meeting that reaffirmed their commitment to “science-based decision making.” The release made no mention of the fact that most of the principles USDA had agreed to were actually related to “climate-smart” agriculture.

Scott Hutchins, USDA’s deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, told POLITICO at the time that he emphasized science-based decision-making in the release — not climate — because that was the strength the participants brought to these international dialogues. He added that there was “no intent whatsoever” to avoid including the words “climate smart” in the release.

A spokesperson for USDA said that department leadership “has not discouraged ARS or any USDA agency from using terms such as climate change, climate, or carbon sequestration, or from highlighting work on these topics.”

But David Festa, senior vice president of ecosystems at the Environmental Defense Fund, which works with farmers and ranchers on climate mitigation, said tensions within the USDA over climate issues are preventing a more robust discussion of the effects of climate change on American agriculture.

“USDA really could and should be leading … and they’re not,” Festa said.

Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer whose operation is roughly half conventional, half organic grain, said farmers are simply not getting much information from USDA related to how to adapt to or mitigate climate change.

“My farmers tell me this is frustrating,” said Lehman, who serves as Iowa Farmers Union President.

The gap in the conversation is particularly pronounced right now, he said, as an unprecedented percentage of growers across the Midwest have had difficulty planting their crops because fields are either too wet or flooded — an extreme weather scenario that’s been disastrous for agriculture this year.

“Farmers have a sense that the volatility is getting worse,” he said.

“You get the sense that it’s very sensitive,” Lehman said of the current dynamic around climate science at USDA. “But if you can’t have an open conversation about it, if you feel like you’re being shunned, how are we going to make progress?”

Even during the George W. Bush administration, when climate change was first deemed a “sensitive” topic within ARS — a designation that means science and other documents related to it require an extra layer of managerial clearance — the department still routinely highlighted climate-related research for the public.

In the first three years of Bush’s second term, for example, USDA promoted research on how farmers can change their tilling practices to reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere, a look at how various farm practices help capture carbon into soil, and a forecast on how rising CO2 levels would likely affect key crops. The communications office highlighted work showing that using switchgrass as a biofuel in lieu of ethanol could store more carbon in soil, which would not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also boost soil health. There was also a release on a study simulating how climate change would pose challenges to groundwater.

Under Bush, the department publicly launched a five-year project on “Climate Friendly Farming” and touted a sweeping initiative aimed at better understanding and reducing agriculture’s greenhouse emissions.

“Even a small increase in the amount of carbon stored per acre of farmland would have a large effect on offsetting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions,” an ARS release noted in 2005.

Jim Connaughton, who served as chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy during the Bush administration, said he was encouraged that USDA and other agencies have so far been able to continue conducting climate science even as the issue has become more politically sensitive within the current administration. However, he noted it was “really unusual” for research agencies to systematically hold back scientific communication.

During the Bush era, he said, “The agencies were unfettered in their own decisions about publicizing their own science.”

“The tone from the top matters,” he added. “The political appointees are taking signals about their own communication products.”

During the Obama years, USDA became increasingly outspoken about climate change and the need to involve agriculture, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation.

The department came up with sweeping action plans on climate change and climate science and highlighted its work on a number of different platforms, including press releases, blog posts and social media blasts. In 2014, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also launched Climate Hubs in 10 regions across the country aimed at helping farmers and ranchers cope with an increasingly unpredictable climate.

“We were trying to take science and make it real and actionable for farmers,” said Robert Bonnie, who served as undersecretary for natural resources and the environment at USDA during the Obama administration. “If you’re taking a certain block of research and not communicating it, it defeats the purpose of why USDA does the research in the first place.”"
