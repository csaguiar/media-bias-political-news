(NBC)

Donald Trump was coming off a bruising few years: His casino and real estate business had teetered on the edge of collapse, awash in debt. His marriage to Ivana Trump had disintegrated, and his relationship with model Marla Maples had fallen apart.

In November 1992, eager for a comeback, Trump threw a raucous party with NFL cheerleaders at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and invited NBC to tape the event.

Footage of that party, unearthed and aired by NBC News on Wednesday, shows Trump grabbing dancing cheerleaders and socializing with financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last week and charged with sex trafficking.

Trump has repeatedly said he is “not a fan” of Epstein’s and that the two had a falling out about 15 years ago. Epstein, who owns a home in Palm Beach near Mar-a-Lago, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.

“I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him,” the president said of Epstein this month. “He was a fixture in Palm Beach.”

In the video from the 1992 party, the two men appear chummy, chuckling as Trump appears to point out women on the dance floor. At one point, Trump can be seen whispering in Epstein’s ear, causing the financier to double over in laughter.

The footage was taken for a feature on Trump that aired on the NBC talk show “A Closer Look” that month. On the segment, host Faith Daniels described Trump’s agreeing to come on the show after he kissed the news anchor on the lips in front of photographers at a charity dinner in New York while her husband’s back was turned.

Trump’s interactions with women at the Mar-a-Lago party — welcome or not — provide visual evidence of the kind of behavior he would later brag about on a 2005 “Access Hollywood” recording that surfaced at the end of the presidential campaign: that he could grab and kiss women because he was a celebrity.

Sixteen women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct over the past several decades, including a former magazine columnist who went public last month with her claim that Trump assaulted her in a department store dressing room around 1995. He has denied all the allegations and said the women are lying.

In the footage of the November 1992 party, Trump can be seen putting his arm around the waist of one of the women, yanking her toward him and patting her on the backside as she laughs.

The White House declined to comment. An attorney for the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment. Martin Weinberg, a lawyer for Epstein, declined to comment.

The party was part of about 36 hours of footage taken of Trump for a half-hour piece about him that aired on “A Closer Look” in late November 1992, according to the then-NBC producer for the shoot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her privacy.

During the wide-ranging interview, Trump told Daniels that he didn’t think he would ever run for president, saying his relationship with women was a likely obstacle.

“I mean, I’m so controversial, I love beautiful women, I love going out with beautiful women, and I love women in general, and people would say, ‘Oh, that’s a horrible thing,’ ” Trump told Daniels, according to a transcript of the show that Daniels provided to The Washington Post.

People who attended the Mar-a-Lago party recalled that the cheerleaders were from the Miami Dolphins and the Buffalo Bills, which were playing that weekend in Miami. Trump has long been interested in the NFL and, in 2014, made a failed bid to buy the Bills.

The former NBC producer said the 1992 party was “odd” — strange enough that she recalled telling her husband about it.

“Who says, ‘This is going to be good for my rehabilitation,’ and then invites a bunch of NFL cheerleaders over?” she said. “It was classic Donald Trump.”

One former Bills cheerleader who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her privacy recalled that Trump invited the cheerleaders to spend the night at Mar-a-Lago and that about 15 or 20 did so, sharing bedrooms all over the house.

“By the end of the night, Donald Trump was throwing people in the pool, but I think it was all in good fun,” said the former cheerleader, who said she steered clear of the host. “It looks crazier in the video than it was. We were young, we were in our 20s, we were having fun. We didn’t know he was going to be president of the United States.”

Other women pictured in the video could not be reached or declined to comment.

In 1991, Trump had finalized his divorce from his first wife, Ivana, amid a tumultuous, highly public dalliance with Maples, who appeared on the “Oprah Winfrey Show” in October 1992 to discuss their relationship.

Maples and Trump would later reconcile and were married in 1993, but Trump was single at the time of the party.

Tom McMillen, a former NBA player who served as a Democratic member of Congress from Maryland from 1987 to 1993 and attended the gathering, said the cheerleaders were present because the party was “NFL-themed,” but he added that it was a large and diverse crowd.

In the footage of the party, McMillen can be seen entering the gathering just behind Epstein.

McMillen recalled that Trump greeted all of the guests on a receiving line. “He was being a very social host, that’s all,” McMillen said. “I recall it being a very mixed crowd — lots of couples, lots of dates.”

In the television segment on NBC, Daniels and Trump discussed his agreeing to appear on her show after he publicly kissed Daniels at a New York charity event.

“And what a kiss,” Trump said.

“You kissed me on the lips in front of the paparazzi, and I said, ‘That’ll cost you. I’m booking you on the show,’ ” Daniels said to Trump.

“Uh-huh. I know. That’s great,” Trump responded, adding: “It was so open and nice.”

“So open and nice?” interjected Daniels. “Wait a minute.”

“Her husband is a handsome devil, I’ll tell you. He’s a good guy. But I think he had his back turned at the time,” Trump continued.

“Yes,” she said.

Daniels declined to comment on the encounter, which was first reported by NBC before the 2016 election.

During the “Closer Look” segment, Trump also disparaged the appearance of the singers Madonna (“Physically unattractive and I just don’t know how she sells”) and LaToya Jackson (“Grotesque, I have to tell you”) and praised Bill Clinton, who had been elected president a few weeks before the party (“He’s got energy”).

Daniels asked Trump what kind of women he did like.

“I think my choice might be you,” he responded. “Look at the legs on her. Boy, oh, boy. Could be you.”

Daniels also pushed Trump about the Mar-a-Lago party, asking him how he would explain to his son that he was partying with NFL cheerleaders.

“That my son could really understand,” said Trump, in an apparent reference to his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. “He’s 14, and, uh, he could really understand that one.”

“No,” Trump continued, “that one’s alright.”

Trump told Daniels that he thought he would eventually get married again.

“I mean, this is good for a while, and, you know, everything’s fine for a while, but you get tired of it,” he said.

“Yeah, but you’re gonna have another party just next week and make sure, right?” Daniels responded.

“Keep going,” Trump said. “Keep it going.”

Trump slams progressive congresswomen at fiery 'MAGA' rally in North Carolina,https://www.foxnews.com,['Vandana Rambaran'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-holds-maga-rally-in-north-carolina-after-feuds-with-house-dem-squad-pelosi,"President Trump, at a fiery ""Make America Great Again"" campaign rally Wednesday night in Greenville, North Carolina, blasted four progressive congresswomen, Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, with whom he continues to spar after an ongoing feud over comments he made against them that critics deemed ""racist.""

""Let 'em leave... they're always telling us how to run it, how to do this, how to do that. You know what? If they don't love it, tell 'em to leave it,"" Trump said of the congresswomen, doubling down on similar comments he made on Twitter earlier in the week.

Trump slammed Omar on Wednesday saying she ""smeared U.S. service members in 'Black Hawk Down.' She slandered the brave Americans trying to keep peace in Somalia,"" a dig at her Somali-American heritage.

Trump also said Omar blamed America for the economic crisis in Venezuela and refused to condemn Al Qaeda.

Meantime, many in the crowd shouted, ""send her back."" Omar later responded by quoting Maya Angelou.

OMAR CLAIMS U.S. FORCES KILLED 'THOUSANDS' OF SOMALIS DURING 'BLACK HAWK DOWN' MISSION

Trump moved on to his critique of Tlaib, saying she ""used the F-word to describe the presidency and your president.""

""That's not nice, even for me,"" Trump said. ""That's not somebody who loves our country.""

The president then took aim at Ocasio-Cortez, whom he mocked for her ""three different names,"" saying she inaccurately described the migrant holding facilities at the southern border as concentration camps.

Of Pressley, Trump said the congresswoman ""thinks that people with the same skin color all need to think the same. She said, 'we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be brown voices, we don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice,'"" a reference to remarks she gave at a conference this past weekend. ""Can you imagine if I said that?""

At the top of his remarks Wednesday night, Trump celebrated the House's decision to shelve impeachment proceedings against him.

HOUSE VOTES TO KILL REP. AL GREEN'S RESOLUTION TO IMPEACH TRUMP

""I just heard that the United States House of Representatives has overwhelmingly voted to kill the most ridiculous project I ever worked on,"" Trump said, referring to an impeachment resolution proposed by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, that was widely opposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other top Democrats.

""The resolution-- how stupid is that-- on impeachment.""

Trump called the 332-95 vote to sideline the impeachment resolution Wednesday ""totally lopsided"" and instead touted the strong economy and low unemployment numbers under his administration.

""And, they want to try and impeach,"" he said. ""It's a disgrace.""

This past Sunday, Trump called for the progressive congresswomen to ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.""

The four congresswomen Trump apparently referenced are all American citizens and three of them were born in the United States.

The congresswomen, along with several other lawmakers, condemned the statements as racist and Trump fired back saying ""Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body!""

Ocasio-Cortez rebutted the president Tuesday, saying, ""You have a racist mind in your head, and a racist heart in your chest. That's why you violate the rights of children and tell the Congresswomen who represent your home borough, to 'go back to my country.'""

Trump also lambasted former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's yearslong investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, calling the ""witch hunt"" ""bullsh--.""

""Could you imagine what it could have been if we didn't have the witch hunt,"" he said. ""What happened to me with this witch hunt should never be allowed to happen to another president of the United States, never ever again.""

""Democrats have never been further outside of the mainstream. They're going crazy,"" Trump continued, alluding to the infighting between Democrats in Congress.

He proceeded to slam 2020 hopeful Bernie Sanders I-Vt., calling him ""desperate"" for promising voters universal healthcare and free tuition for college students.

""I think they're all sad when you get right down to it,"" Trump said of the 24 Democrats running for president in 2020.

The president revived criticism of Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., referring to her as ""Pocahontas,"" and making fun of her claimed ancestry as a Native American, which she later retracted.

""The Indians got together and they said, 'We don't want her,'"" he mocked."

A federal judge in Manhattan disclosed on Wednesday that prosecutors have concluded their investigation into campaign finance violations involving President Trump and ordered that they publicly release some of their files, a new twist in a case that had threatened to upend the Trump presidency.

The judge’s order did not answer one of the lingering questions of the investigation: whether prosecutors in the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan still plan to file additional charges in connection with the case.

The investigation, which centered on hush money payments arranged during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, already resulted in the conviction of the president’s former fixer, Michael D. Cohen.

Mr. Cohen, who is now serving a three-year prison sentence, has said he helped arrange the hush money at the direction of Mr. Trump, an accusation that the federal prosecutors in Manhattan ultimately repeated in court papers."

House Democrats on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas related to President Donald Trump's push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The resolution passed by a vote of 230-198. It marks the latest escalation in the fight between Democrats, who say their oversight duties require launching a slew of subpoenas and requests for information from the Trump administration, and Trump, who has vowed to fight ""all the subpoenas"" from the House.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last month voted to recommend that the entire House hold Barr and Ross in contempt for ""refusing to comply"" with their subpoenas for information about the census controversy.

""It begs the question: What else is being hidden from the American people?"" Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said in a press release at the time.

Ross responded in a statement Wednesday, saying, ""House Democrats never sought to have a productive relationship with the Trump Administration, and today's PR stunt further demonstrates their unending quest to generate headlines instead of operating in good faith with our Department.""

""It is an unfortunate fact that there are some who would like nothing more than to see this Administration fail whatever the cost to the country may be,"" Ross said. ""Preferring to play political games rather than help lead the country, they have made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.""

The White House also responded after the decision, calling it a ""ridiculous and yet another lawless attempt to harass the President and his Administration.""

Trump had asserted executive privilege over the documents requested by the committee. A Commerce Department official told Cummings in a letter at the time that Trump's hand was forced because Oversight had set an ""unnecessary"" and ""premature"" contempt vote ""rather than allowing the Department to complete its document production.""

Trump abandoned his bid to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census last Thursday, just a few weeks after the Supreme Court blocked the question. Chief Justice John Roberts said Ross' reasoning for adding the citizenship question was ""contrived"" and not ""genuine."" Trump himself said the reasoning for the question on the census was for redistricting purposes.

Instead of gathering the data through the census, Trump said he would order federal agencies to give the Commerce Department all records related to information regarding how many citizens and noncitizens live in the United States.

The census question would have led to fewer responses, especially in households with noncitizens, according to Census Bureau research. Democrats say adding the question would result in an undercount in areas with a large Hispanic population and other minority communities, which would reduce Democratic representation in such areas."
Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area,https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742519999/future-of-key-farming-research-uncertain-as-2-3-of-usda-staff-say-they-wont-move,"Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."

Do Service Dogs Help Treat PTSD? V.A. Still Doesn’t Know,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jasper Craven'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/magazine/service-dogs-veterans-ptsd.html,"[Sign up for the At War newsletter for more stories about veterans and V.A. policy.]

The V.A. is currently conducting research into the effectiveness of service dogs, but the process has been slow. Research started in 2011 was supposed to wrap up in 2015 but has repeatedly been stalled by problems with the study’s design and execution. In May, the V.A. said the findings of the study, which has cost $16 million to date, would be released to the public in 2020.

Meanwhile, some lawmakers are growing impatient with what they perceive as a lack of initiative at a time when there is a growing mental-health crisis in America’s veterans community. In June, Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, reintroduced the PAWS Act, to establish a $10 million grant program through the V.A., which would give qualified nonprofit organizations up to $25,000 for each veteran they pair with a service dog. The stipend would cover the canine’s training, and the training of the recipient with his or her service dog. The bill is sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, pitting lawmakers against the V.A., which is refusing to endorse any new stopgap service-dog program before its internal research is completed.

Stuck in the middle are the veterans themselves. Among those receiving disability benefits from the V.A., more than one in five suffers from PTSD. Veterans who have responded poorly to conventional treatments have had to improvise, sometimes by paying thousands of dollars up front to acquire service dogs, then covering the significant costs of feeding and caring for them. To make matters worse, veterans seeking service dogs without any support from the V.A. are forced to wade into a largely unregulated industry: Some end up with a dog that provides few benefits because it isn’t properly trained. Veterans advocates say access to a psychiatric service dog without the associated financial burden can’t come soon enough.

In January 2009, Al Franken, fresh off his winning campaign for a Senate seat, met Luis Montalván, a medically retired Army captain who had served two tours as an intelligence officer in Iraq, and his golden retriever named Tuesday. Montalván had returned home with a shattered leg, spinal damage, a brain injury and PTSD symptoms that included vivid nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks and a fear of public spaces. The only therapy that eased Montalván’s symptoms was Tuesday, whom he received from a group called Educated Canines Assisting With Disabilities. Tuesday sensed if Montalván’s breathing sharpened or he began to perspire, and then intervened with a nuzzle. If Tuesday noticed Montalván thrashing while asleep in bed, he would wake the former soldier from his nightmare with a series of sloppy face-licks. Tuesday was even trained to direct the Army veteran from his bed to his pill bottles each morning."
USDA: More than half of eligible workers refuse assignment to Kansas City,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/usda-researchers-kansas-city-relocate/index.html,"Washington (CNN) More than half of the employees from two research agencies at the Department of Agriculture slated to relocate from the Washington area have refused reassignment to Kansas City, the department said Wednesday.

Such losses among the research employees affected by the reassignment could result in a drain of institutional knowledge and talent at two agencies that either fund agricultural research across the nation or produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets,10-year projections for the farm sector and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and the department have argued that the move will lower living costs, save taxpayer dollars and move the agencies closer to ""stakeholders."" But many employees at the two affected agencies -- the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) -- view the change as politically driven and a way to disrupt climate research and other work with which their bosses disagree by pushing out experienced personnel

At ERS, 72 researchers accepted relocation while 99 either declined or did not provide a response. At NIFA, 73 workers accepted reassignment while 151 declined or did not provide a response, according to a USDA spokesperson. These numbers, which could fluctuate, are also in line with a survey released last week by the union representing NIFA and ERS employees. Staff must report to work in Kansas City by September 30.

Employees from both agencies turned their backs to Perdue in protest at an all-hands meeting last month when he announced the final location for the move.

Mark Esper headed for quick confirmation after acing largely bipartisan Senate hearing,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/mark-esper-headed-for-quick-confirmation-after-acing-largely-bipartisan-senate-hearing,"ON THE GLIDE SLOPE: Mark Esper, President Trump’s fallback nominee to head the Defense Department, did everything he needed to do yesterday to win quick and easy confirmation. With one notable exception (more on that below), he cruised effortlessly through his 2 hour, 45 minute hearing before the Armed Services Committee, telling the senators just what they wanted to hear, reassuring them he would work on their concerns, and generally showing a deep understanding of the issues facing the U.S. military.

For the most part the hearing was a bipartisan lovefest, beginning with the introduction of the nominee by Democratic former vice presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine, who compared Esper to Jim Mattis, the widely-respected previous defense secretary, who resigned last December over policy differences with the president.

“Most of us were very discouraged by the resignation of Secretary Mattis. And what we've hoped for is a successor who could show the same level of candor and principle and a willingness to remain independent even in the most challenging circumstances,” Kaine said at the start of the hearing. “I believe that Dr. Esper has those traits.”

IN THE MOLD OF MATTIS: Though lacking Mattis’ résumé as a decorated general and legendary commander, Esper does have a solid military background, having spent 10 years on active duty and another 11 years in the Guard. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, he served as an infantry officer with the Army’s 101st Airborne Division.

And while Esper was not exactly a protégé of Mattis, he has adopted his positions , including Mattis’s three “lines of effort” to move the Pentagon into the 21st century, namely to build a more lethal force, strengthen alliances, and reform the Pentagon to free up resources.

Michigan Democrat Gary Peters asked Esper point-blank, “Would you be a secretary of defense with views more aligned with Secretary Mattis or more aligned with President Trump?”

“I don't know where to pick between the two,” Esper said, “but clearly I shared Secretary Mattis’ views and I've expressed that publicly.” Pressed by Peters about whether he might also consider resigning on principle if asked to support a policy counter to his values, Esper said, “Absolutely,” adding “In the Army, I grew up with this view that you're asked to do anything that is illegal, or immoral, or unethical, then that would be the point at which you have to consider resignation and you'd be willing to do that.”

WARREN’S CRUSADE: The one tense part of the hearing came when Massachusetts Democrat and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren began aggressively grilling Esper on one of her pet issues. Warren has proposed legislation to tighten the rules designed to avoid conflict of interests when members of the administration come from, or move to, private industry.

Warren pressed Esper repeatedly to agree to voluntarily extend the period in which he is required to recuse himself from matters affecting his prior employer, Raytheon, from two years to the rest of his term. And she wanted a promise he would never ask for a waiver that is provided for under law in extreme circumstances. Both go beyond current ethics requirements.

But it was Warren’s prosecutorial tone, demanding yes-or-no answers and refusing to let Esper give nuanced answers, that rubbed a lot of her colleagues the wrong way.

Committee chairman Jim Inhofe had to intervene to allow Esper to answer Warren’s question, and he later apologized for the exchange, which he called “unfair.” Democrat Joe Manchin also expressed consternation, telling Esper: “I hope you realize that this is part of this process.”

“I’m very disappointed that Sen. Warren would demonize you after you decades of service simply because you served in the private sector,” said Rick Scott, a Florida Republican. “There’s a lot of us who have been in the private sector and that doesn’t take anything away from our ability to do our job. I guess she just needed a moment for her presidential campaign,” Scott said.

WILL TRUMP SANCTION TURKEY? The Pentagon, the State Department, and the Congress have repeatedly said over the last year that Turkey cannot have both the U.S. F-35 fighter and the Russian S-400 missile system designed to shoot it down.

Now that Turkey has begun accepting delivery of the sophisticated Russian air defenses, we’ve been waiting for a formal announcement about whether the U.S. will make good on its threat, as well as whether it will impose additional economic sanctions against Ankara as mandated in the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).

While there is still no formal announcement, yesterday President Trump reluctantly conceded that the U.S. can’t give Turkey the 100 F-35s it’s ordered, or allow them to build parts for them, even though he says Turkey is the victim here.

“We have a situation where Turkey is very good with us, very good, and we are now telling Turkey that because you have really been forced to buy another missile system, we're not going to sell you the F-35 fighter jets. It's a very tough situation that they're in, and it's a very tough situation that we've been placed in, the United States,” Trump said. “With all of that being said, we're working through it. We'll see what happens, but it's not really fair.”

IT’S ALL OBAMA’S FAULT: Trump blames the Obama administration for allegedly refusing to sell U.S. Patriot missiles to Turkey, and thereby “forcing” the NATO ally to go with Russia. But one reason Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a deal with Moscow is that it includes a co-production agreement that would eventually allow Turkey to produce its own surface-to-air missile defenses, based on Russian technology.

The U.S. was willing to sell Turkey Patriot missiles, but not to give up the technology behind them. In the end it was that, along with Erdogan’s increasing tilt away from NATO and toward Russia, that killed the Patriot sale.

ARE SANCTIONS COMING? Congress has called on Trump to follow the law and punish Turkey beyond just booting it out of the F-35 program. “The Secretary and the President are examining all of the options that are in the CAATSA legislation,” said State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, adding they “will make a decision based off what they're required to do according to U.S. law.”

IRAN SUSPECTED IN SHIP SEIZURE: A Panamanian-flagged oil tanker last seen near the Strait of Hormuz may have been seized by Iranian naval forces.

The MT Riah went missing after entering Iranian waters over the weekend, according to ship tracking data. U.S. intelligence officials believe it may have been forced into Iranian territory by members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, according to CNN’s Barbara Starr. Some reports claim the Riah belonged to the United Arab Emirates, but a UAE official denied that claim on Monday.

McKENZIE IN GULF REGION: This latest incident comes as U.S. Central Commander Gen. Frank McKenzie is traveling in the region, reviewing the U.S. plans to deter Iran from threatening international shipping.

“Obviously we would take that very seriously,” McKenzie told CBS’s David Martin, who is traveling with him.

McKenzie is reviewing plans for the U.S. to conduct what Defense Secretary-nominee Esper told Congress yesterday would be “passive patrols,” under a mission dubbed “Operation Sentinel.”

“I think our ability to bring forces into the theater has acted to deter them. And I think we're in a period right now frankly where they're sort of recalculating and they're trying to sort of gauge our intent,” McKenzie told CBS.

MORE DIPLOMACY NEEDED: ""We do not want war with Iran. We are not seeking war with Iran. We need to get back on the diplomatic channel ,” Esper testified at his confirmation hearing yesterday.

He also said a future nuclear agreement with Iran should include a more permanent end to Iran’s nuclear activities and address its ballistic missile program. ""I do think we need to get back to a negotiated path with them,"" Esper said. ""Preferably an updated version of the [2015 nuclear deal] if you will, that addresses, with finality, a verifiable, irreversible, and permanent prohibition on their nuclear work and efforts.""

""So that would be number one, and then, we also need to address the means to deliver them, ICBMs,"" he added.

THEY’RE AT IT AGAIN: It was just over three weeks ago that President Trump and North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un were all smiles at their historic meeting at the DMZ, but now North Korea media is ramping up the rhetoric again, complaining about the latest round of U.S. and South Korean military exercises.

“This is clearly a breach of the main spirit of June 12 DPRK-U.S. Joint Statement and an undisguised pressure upon us,” said a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.

“The suspension of joint military exercises is what President Trump, commander-in-chief of the U.S., personally committed to at the DPRK-U.S. summit talks in Singapore under the eyes of the whole world,” the statement said, according to an English translation.

The complaint came with a threat to resume tests of missiles and possibly nuclear weapons. “With the U.S. unilaterally reneging on its commitments, we are gradually losing our justifications to follow through on the commitments we made with the U.S. as well.”

A MOMENT MEMORIALIZED: In other Korea-related news, a photograph of Trump and Kim is one of four new photos hanging in the White House. The photos were added to the West Wing on Monday, according to Bloomberg White House correspondent Jennifer Jacobs.

The photo is of Trump and Kim at the DMZ last month. Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to visit North Korea when he stepped across the DMZ into the country for a few moments.

Other photos show Trump with soldiers at the DMZ, the president with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, and Trump with French President Emmanuel Macron in Normandy.

DANGEROUS LIAISONS: The Center for Strategic and International Studies has released a new brief: “ Dangerous Liaisons: Russian Cooperation with Iran in Syria .”

The key takeaway: “As tensions escalate between the United States and Iran in the Middle East, Russia is engaged in covert and overt cooperation with Iran in ways that undermine U.S. national security interests. This analysis of commercial satellite imagery at Tiyas Airbase in Syria indicates the scope and proximity of Russian and Iranian military ties. If Washington wants to contain Tehran and prevent further Iranian expansion, U.S. policymakers will need to increase pressure on Moscow to curb Tehran’s activities in countries like Syria.”

"3 blue states file suit against Treasury, IRS over state and local taxes workaround",https://www.cnn.com,['Donna Borak'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/blue-states-treasury-irs-salt-lawsuit/index.html,"Washington (CNN) New York, New Jersey and Connecticut aren't backing off from a legal fight with the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.

The three blue states filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York challenging the constitutionality of the Trump administration's decision to block a workaround that would have helped high-tax areas to bypass a $10,000 limit on federal deductions for state and local taxes.

""The final IRS rule flies in the face of a century of federal tax law that says state choices to provide tax incentives for charitable donations do not affect the federal deductibility of those gifts,"" according to a joint statement released by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.

In June, the Treasury Department finalized regulations that would bar individuals in high-tax states from creating charitable funds in exchange for state tax credits -- a maneuver developed as a workaround for changes to the treatment of state and local taxes under the 2017 tax reform

""The regulation is based on a longstanding principle of tax law: When a taxpayer receives a valuable benefit in return for a donation to charity, the taxpayer can deduct only the net value of the donation as a charitable contribution,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement.

Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly issued dire warnings about the limit, saying the measure primarily hurts Democratic-leaning states that tend to have taxpayers with higher incomes and higher home prices.

The controversial limit was a key revenue raiser in the $1.5 trillion tax code overhaul, which slashed tax rates for corporations and individuals.

This is not the first time these three states, along with Maryland, have challenged the deduction cap. In their latest lawsuit, the states argue that the rules violate the Administrative Procedure Act because they are inconsistent with federal tax law regulations about deducting charitable contributions.

""This is entirely unacceptable and as I've said before, the IRS should not be used as a political weapon,"" Cuomo said in the joint statement. ""The IRS regulations lack any basis in the law, upend decades of precedent without authorization from Congress, and target programs established by New York and other states to incentivize charitable contributions."""

Senior Trump administration officials confirmed Tuesday that the vast majority of Bureau of Land Management headquarters staffers must leave Washington by the end of next year under the Interior Department’s reorganization plan.

In a 17-page letter to lawmakers, Joe Balash, Interior’s assistant secretary for land and minerals, detailed how the administration plans to move 84 percent of the agency’s headquarters staff west of the Rockies by the end of 2020. The relocation, which The Washington Post first outlined Monday, will move all but 60 Washington-based staffers, a sweeping change to the agency that manages more than 10 percent of America’s land.

“This implementation plan will delegate more responsibility and authority down to the field, optimize services available to the American people, is demonstrably cost-effective, and will provide an increased presence closer to the resources the BLM staff manages,” Balash wrote to Sen. Tom Udall (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and environment.

A total of 27 leadership jobs will be relocated to Grand Junction, Colo., about 60 miles south of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s childhood home of Rifle, “as part of an initiative to establish the Headquarters,” Balash said. Colorado will receive more reassigned positions than any state — 85.

Seventy-four of the reassigned employees will report to BLM state directors instead of headquarters staff, he said, and staffers will be reassigned to states including Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.

Although Balash provided an estimated cost benefit of the reassignments — at least $50 million over 20 years — there was no analysis of the price of the actual move beyond $5.6 million for the first 27 employees who volunteer.

[Interior to move most of Bureau of Land Management’s D.C. staff out west as part of larger reorganization push]

Hours before Interior formally notified Capitol Hill of the move, Balash and Casey Hammond, the principal deputy assistant secretary of land and minerals management — who has been running the bureau on an acting basis since May — provided employees with details about the reorganization.

According to a participant in the employee briefing at the agency’s office in Southeast Washington, the tension in the room was palpable as employees questioned what the move would mean for those with two-career families or other obligations that might tie them to Washington. The staffer spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation.

When Hammond declared “There is no need to panic,” the participant said, several people in the audience laughed.

“This announcement is deeply unsettling, and has created a lot of uncertainty for us,” the participant said. “The best part of my job is my co-workers, and they are working to tear us apart for purely political reasons. I’m sick to my stomach.”

Hammond and Balash emphasized the relocation would save the government money because the cost of living was cheaper out West and the lease on the BLM’s main building, in Southeast Washington, was set to expire. But one employee suggested in the meeting that staffers’ pay will also decline once they relocate and urged colleagues to write their member of Congress, prompting applause.

Other employees embraced the reorganization, according to the meeting participant, asking how early they can leave Washington.

Balash also said that officials are looking to relocate staffers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, but the department has not done as comprehensive an analysis of those moves.

Several lawmakers have already embraced the reorganization plan, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Republican Reps. Rob Bishop (Utah) and Scott R. Tipton (Colo.). In a statement Monday, Bishop said that he would work with Bernhardt to place the staffers moving to Utah in the right place.

“The BLM personnel will be moved where they will have a greater impact on, and input by, the people who live in the regions where their influence is greatest,” Bishop said. “Not by bureaucrats from thousands of miles away.”

But critics of the plan such as Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), who chairs the House Subcommittee on Interior, environment, and related agencies, said in a statement that it made no sense for the administration to unilaterally reorganize an agency when the president has yet to nominate a permanent director for the BLM after more than 2 1/2 years in office.

“After my discussion with Secretary Bernhardt this morning, serious questions remain: What are the benefits to the Interior Department and to the American public? What problem will this move solve? Why is BLM singled out for this move? How much will the move cost?” McCollum asked.

“Assuming the goal is to improve efficiency, streamline operations, and improve lines of communication,"" McCollum added, ""perhaps Mr. Bernhardt should prioritize securing a permanent director — which BLM has lacked for the duration of this administration — before the Department spends millions of taxpayer dollars playing musical chairs with employees’ lives.”

Kate Kelly, public lands director for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, questioned in an email why the administration would reassign nearly all of the bureau’s D.C. staff when 95 percent of them already work out in the field.

“The true impact of this move is to make the agency and its leadership invisible in a city where — like it or not — the decisions about budgets and policies are made,” she said. “The constant shuffling, shrinking and disassembling of BLM’s workforce will have long-term implications for the health of the agency.”

In a telephone conference with reporters later in the afternoon, led by Balash and Susan Combs, the assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, another reason for the move was offered: eliminating travel costs to the District for westerners who meet with BLM officials.

“The American public interested in BLM can talk to a decision-maker without having to travel to the east coast,” Combs said. “I think it’s a disservice to the American public if we’re not there to give an answer on the spot.”

But the officials offered no analysis of how often westerners travel to Washington to meet with decision-makers, and at what cost. Similarly, they offered no cost analysis of flights by decision-makers to the West.

It is unclear what sort of congressional authorization is required to carry out the administration’s plan. When a BLM staffer raised the issue on Tuesday, Hammond replied that the department had already received the $5 million needed to carry out the initial stage of the move in May.

According to a Senate Appropriations aide, longstanding spending law guidelines — including ones included in Interior’s current funding bill — require the department “to notify and seek congressional approval of reorganization efforts . . . for certain actions, and do apply to this relocation effort."""
Pompeo layers over top State Dept. negotiator ahead of talks with Russia,https://www.politico.com,['Eliana Johnson'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/state-russia-pompeo-andrea-thompson-1417602,"State Department official Andrea Thompson’s planned presence at a meeting with Russia’s foreign minister raised concerns after it was revealed she had failed to disclose ties to Maria Butina. | Thomas Peter/AP Photo foreign policy Pompeo layers over top State Dept. negotiator ahead of talks with Russia The official, Andrea Thompson, stands accused of failing to disclose ties to a GOP operative caught up in the Maria Butina affair.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed concern about sending one of his top arms control negotiators, Andrea Thompson, to head a U.S. delegation meeting with Russia’s deputy foreign minister this week after it was revealed that she had failed to disclose her ties to the boyfriend of Russian foreign agent Maria Butina.

So Pompeo dispatched his deputy, John Sullivan, to lead the delegation instead. The delegation, which now includes Sullivan, Thompson and other senior U.S. officials, is attending the strategic security dialogue in Geneva, where American officials are set to talk with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov about arms control, including what sort of arrangement might replace the International Nuclear Forces treaty that the Trump administration scuttled earlier this year.

Story Continued Below

Thompson’s presence at the meeting raised concern in some quarters of the administration after the Washington Post reported last month that she had not disclosed her personal and financial ties to Paul Erickson, the veteran GOP operative who worked with Butina to establish a Kremlin backchannel to the Trump campaign in 2016.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a private letter to the State Department in recent days regarding Thompson’s “apparent failures to disclose required and material information to the SFRC during her nomination process,” according to Juan Pachon, Menendez’s communications director on the committee.

A State Department spokesman confirmed receipt of the letter, but declined to comment on Pompeo’s last-minute decision to send Sullivan to Geneva, or on whether the department was satisfied with Thompson’s disclosures during her confirmation process.

Thompson failed to alert her superiors that Erickson officiated her 2017 wedding, according to two U.S. officials, and did not disclose during her Senate confirmation that her husband, David Gillian, a retired Australian Army officer, had wired Erickson $100,000 for an allegedly fraudulent investment scheme in which Gillian and others were allegedly defrauded by Erickson -- a transaction laid out by the FBI in court filings.

The failure to disclose could have serious repercussions for Thompson, former officials said, though it is not necessarily fatal to her career.

“All senior officers have to report on their finances and any connections to overseas interests. Diplomatic Security should review her clearance,” said John Sipher, who spent nearly three decades working in the CIA’s clandestine service, including a stint in Moscow. “When Erickson and Butina were all over the news, she should have reported her connection. At the very least it now puts the administration in a bind where critics can question her competence, professionalism and judgment.”

At the time of her wedding and her then-fiance’s investment in Erickson’s business four months prior, Thompson was working as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. A year later, in April of 2018, she was confirmed by the Senate as undersecretary for arms control and international security.

At the time, Gillian was complaining to Erickson that he hadn’t seen the promised return on his investment, the FBI said, and received what agents described as a “lulling payment” of $5,000 -- intended to allay Gillian’s concerns -- on March 29, 2018, the month after Thompson’s Senate Committee hearing and the month before her confirmation vote.

Thompson’s alleged failure to disclose her relationship with Erickson, who was by then the subject of national news stories detailing his relationship with Butina, during her Senate confirmation has raised anxiety among Russia hawks in the Trump orbit who fear that Thompson, one of the last remaining acolytes of the president’s first national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, is insufficiently hard-headed and enters this week’s talks in a compromised position.

One of these officials said that Thompson’s failure to disclose her connection to Erickson indicates that her “judgment is in question.”

“She either didn’t understand what she was doing … or she did and she tried to conceal it,” this person said.

Flynn was pushed out of the administration in February of 2017 after news reports indicated he had misled senior White House officials about the substance of his conversations with Russian officials during the transition period. He stands accused of lying to the FBI about the nature of those interactions, though he has suggested that investigators tricked him into making false statements.

In March of 2017, Thompson filed a public financial disclosure report after joining the vice president’s office. Prosecutors in the Erickson case note that her then fiancé, Gillian, had wired $100,000 to Erickson on February 28, 2017. That was just days before her paperwork was submitted, but neither Erickson’s nor Butina’s role in the presidential campaign had yet been reported.

A subsequent financial disclosure would have been due in May 2018, according to a source in the vice president’s office, but by then, Thompson was at the State Department.

In the interim, Erickson became the subject of national headlines when reports surfaced that he had made overtures to the Trump campaign offering to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin. Erickson was engaged in a romantic relationship with Maria Butina, who has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, prosecutors argued, Butina, a 30-year-old graduate student, worked to forge relationships with influential Republican political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, in an attempt to create backchannels to the Russian government. She worked both to organize trips for influential GOP operatives to visit Moscow and to get access to government officials for Russian delegations visiting the U.S.

A former GOP operative and fundraiser, Erickson was indicted in February on fraud charges in February and pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that he swindled upwards of $2 million from investors for three business propositions, including one to invest in a chain of elder care facilities, and did not spend the money on any of them.

Though the charges were not directly related to Erickson’s relationship with Butina, the FBI alleged that “some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina."""
Why the Justice Department Waved Through the CVS-Aetna Merger,https://prospect.org,[],,,,https://prospect.org/article/why-justice-department-waved-through-cvs-aetna-merger,"Gene J. Puskar/AP Image A CVS Pharmacy in Pittsburgh

This week, Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is holding a Tunney Act hearing, which allows courts to scrutinize merger approvals by the Department of Justice (DoJ), on the CVS-Aetna merger. Judge Leon’s evidentiary hearing with testimony from concerned parties is a first of its kind.

In sharp contrast to the AT&T/Time Warner deal, another vertical merger that the DoJ sought to block, the antitrust agency waved through CVS-Aetna, with a modest requirement to spin off Aetna’s Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Now, the DoJ is being forced to defend itself in court. Why did the antitrust division engage in a seeming double standard, when the cases share particular similarities?

By happenstance, Judge Leon also adjudicated—and eventually rejected—the DoJ’s attempt to block the AT&T/Time Warner merger. In that case, the vertical stacking involved two layers: the distribution unit that delivers cable programming to subscribers (AT&T); and the content division that produces cable programming (Time Warner). By comparison, the vertical stacking in CVS-Aetna involves three layers: the health plan takes premium dollars from the member and provides insurance in return (Aetna); the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) negotiates with pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies, administers the pharmacy network, and designs the formulary for the health plan (Caremark); and the pharmacies serve as the physical interface between patient and pharmacist (CVS).

The pharmacy was already integrated into PBM services via the CVS/Caremark merger; the fresh integration here is the pharmacy/PBM into a health plan, yielding control of the entire stack. It would form the only vertically integrated pharmacy/PBM/health plan currently in the U.S. marketplace.

As the D.C. Circuit explained in its decision in AT&T/Time Warner, “Vertical mergers can create harms beyond higher prices for consumers, including decreased product quality and reduced innovation.” However, most plaintiffs aim to show concrete and measurable harms such as higher prices, using what are called “foreclosure” theories. For example, a vertically integrated firm may foreclose rivals from access to its content (“input foreclosure”) or from access to customers (“customer foreclosure”). As I have shown in prior research, along with Kevin Caves and Chris Holt, regional sports networks affiliated with cable companies can credibly threaten to withhold content from a rival distributor, because lack of local sports would mean defection to cable provider with access.

This is the theory of harm that the DoJ pursued (unsuccessfully) in its attempt to block the AT&T/Time Warner merger. The DoJ believed that the newly merged entity would withhold Time Warner content from distribution rivals, or extract a higher price for said content. Judge Leon concluded that Time Warner content was not must-have; he found no compelling evidence to suggest that customers of rival cable operators would leave to follow Time Warner content like CNN or TNT or TBS. So the threat to withhold content from rivals wouldn’t be as powerful as withholding sports or some other must-have input.

ALTHOUGH FORECLOSURE is most frequently studied and litigated in cable television, healthcare economists are starting to focus on the same phenomenon. For example, Professor Neeraj Sood of the University of Southern California estimates that for a vertically integrated healthcare provider, each insurance customer is worth $300 in margins, each PBM customer is worth $23 in margins, and each retail pharmacy customer is worth $40. It follows that a vertically integrated insurer/PBM/pharmacy such as CVS/Aetna might be willing to engage in certain tradeoffs in order to advantage its affiliated (high margin) insurer at the expense of its (low margin) PBM or retail pharmacy division.

Vertical foreclosure strategies in concentrated markets with high barriers to entry are more likely to generate anti-competitive effects than the same strategies employed by firms that lack market power. And the supply of health insurance in the United States is highly concentrated. Data from Kaiser indicate that in most states the market share of the three largest insurance companies—UnitedHealth, Anthem, and Aetna—is more than 50 percent, and in some states the market share of the three largest insurance companies is around 90 percent. Local geographic markets are similarly highly concentrated. There are high barriers to entry in health insurance, including market expertise: how to build networks, knowing how to file products, and meeting compliance burdens.

The supply of PBM services in the United States is also highly concentrated. The three large PBMs—Express Scripts, CVS Health Caremark, and Optum Rx—account for almost 70 percent of the entire market. Pharmacies habitually complain that they have no alternative but to contract with specific PBMs. Again, there are natural barriers to entry in PBM services, including economies of scale in negotiating favorable discounts from manufacturers, operational expertise, and regulatory barriers, as well as artificial barriers, such as vertical integration with a health plan or a pharmacy network or both, which makes competition by a standalone health insurer more daunting.

Finally, the supply of pharmacy services in the United States is highly concentrated. The largest three pharmacies account for more than 50 percent of prescription revenues. Local markets are similarly highly concentrated; according to Business Insider, CVS and Walgreens together control between 50 and 75 percent of the drugstore market in each of the country’s 14 largest metro areas. Barriers to entry also prevent new pharmacy firms. For example,CVS chief executive officer Larry Merlo is not afraid of Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business because “there’s a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance. It’s highly regulated, so the barriers to entry are high.”

What would input foreclosure mean in this setting? The vertically integrated firm could deny an input—here, CVS pharmacy services—to a rival health plan such as UnitedHealth. The DoJ’s vertical theory fell apart in its challenge of AT&T/Time Warner because the merging parties lacked a must-have input. In this case, would CVS’s network of pharmacies be considered must-have for rival health plans?

CVS is uniquely positioned in the pharmacy marketplace due to its ubiquitous coverage of the U.S. population. According to comments filed by the AMA, “CVS pharmacy chains may be considered ‘must have’ pharmacies. They are ‘must have’ because health plan sponsors prefer geographically comprehensive networks—pharmacies located in close proximity to their patient population.” Indeed, CVS claims to cover 76 percent of the population in the United States within a five-mile drive.

If a rival health plan lost access to CVS’s network of pharmacies, it could find itself unable to patch together other pharmacies to serve customers, and could even lose its license to serve certain areas as a health provider. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will not contract with a Medicare plan unless it can meet certain time-and-distance requirements. For non-Medicare plans, local state agencies such as California’s Department of Health Care Services and Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration review a plan’s network adequacy using their own time-and-distance requirements.

Using mapping data of all U.S. pharmacy locations from Healthcare Ready, Augustus Urschel, Omer Gold and I identified several areas of the country in which a rival plan would not be able to meet CMS’s coverage requirement without access to CVS’s network of pharmacies. CMS’s Medicare Part D Manual, states: “In urban areas, at least 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in the Part D sponsor’s service area, on average, live within 2 miles of a retail pharmacy participating in the sponsor’s network. In suburban areas, at least 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in the Part D sponsor’s service areas, on average, live within 5 miles of a retail pharmacy participating in the sponsor’s network.” Using those constraints, we conservatively identified localities where CVS was the only pharmacy within a ten-mile radius.

The first figure shows the area immediately south of Chicago, spanning parts of Illinois and Indiana. Ten localities appear beholden to CVS for pharmacy services.

The second figure shows the area outside of Tallahassee, spanning parts of Florida and Tennessee. Two localities appear beholden to CVS.

For rival health plans seeking to serve those areas, CVS would easily qualify as a must-have input. Without access to CVS’s pharmacy in that area, the rival health plan likely could not contract with CMS (for a Medicare plan); similarly, the rival plan likely would not meet the coverage requirements of state licensing agencies (for non-Medicare plans).

In addition to the ten-mile radii used in the two figures, a radius of five miles was drawn around each CVS location nationwide to identify must-have inputs; in 93 locations, CVS is the only pharmacy within a five-mile radius. CVS could simply refuse rival plans access to these (or any) CVS pharmacies, impairing the reach of those health plans and forcing patients to sign up with CVS/Aetna. Less extreme forms of input foreclosure would include CVS Caremark developing formularies for health plan rivals that do not include important drugs that are in demand by their subscribers; offering pharmacy networks that do not provide important options (for example, independent specialty pharmacies) or forcing rival insurers into CVS mail-order pharmacy services; or charging rival plans higher administrative fees to provide services like formulary maintenance or claims processing. For example, CVS currently charges PBMs to fill prescriptions; CVS could demand, post-merger, a higher dispensing fee for performing the same task.

OF THE FOUR POTENTIAL input-foreclosure strategies outlined above, the DoJ failed to address anyin its complaint. In its Questions and Answers for the General Public, the DoJ stated it “thoroughly considered whether the merger would raise the costof (i) CVS/Caremark’s PBM services or (ii) retail pharmacy services to Aetna’s health insurance rivals.” So it appears most foreclosure strategies were ignored completely, or considered and dismissed.

If the merged firm found it profitable to engage in input foreclosure against rival health plans, the anti-competitive effects would be straightforward under antitrust law. This could diminish competition in the market for health plans, as rival plans lose access to CVS pharmacies or incur a higher cost for such access, which could lead to higher premiums or higher deductibles or less coverage.

The DoJ could have assured prevention of the harms from input foreclosure. In particular, the merging parties could have been subject to a non-discrimination regime, as Georgia and New York imposed in their merger reviews. That would mean that no health plan could be prevented from accessing CVS’s pharmacy network, or forced to pay an exorbitant fee for access. This kind of non-discrimination regime actually appears in the 2011 DoJ Policy Guide to Merger Remedies.

The DoJ and Federal Trade Commission have a history of using behavioral remedies to address potential harms in vertical mergers: the Anheuser-Busch InBev-SABMiller and AOL-Time Warner mergers, for example, or Ticketmaster-Live Nation, which bans Ticketmaster from using the threat of withholding shows from venues in retaliation for their signing with a competing ticketing service. The DoJ also employed a non-discrimination remedy in Comcast-NBCUniversal.

Yet in October 2018, Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Makan Delrahim announced that DoJ would withdraw its 2011 Policy Guide. The guidelines prescribed behavioral remedies in vertical mergers to police discriminatory conduct. Delrahim announced his lack of faith in behavioral remedies, calling them “regulatory” in nature, and embracing structural approaches.

As an expert for an online video distributor (OVD) that brought one of the first challenges under the NBCU Order, I am professionally familiar with the efficacy of behavioral remedies in the context of vertical merger enforcement. Bloomberg was the first to sue Comcast under the NBCU protections, and it secured better placement on Comcast’s dial. Per the DoJ’s annual reports monitoring the merger conditions, an unnamed OVD also sued and settled with Comcast. Finally, my OVD client sued and we prevailed before an independent arbitrator, who ruled that our estimate of fair market value was closer than Comcast’s (that case is pending appeal). Based on these three cases, it is fair to say that the behavioral remedies under the NBCU were largely effective in constraining Comcast’s worst impulses.

The DoJ was attempting to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger at the time it retracted the Policy Guide to Merger Remedies. By disavowing behavioral remedies in general, the DoJ must now choose between approving the merger without behavioral conditions (as it did in CVS/Aetna) or blocking it outright (as it tried and failed in AT&T/Time Warner). Even if waving through the merger is slightly preferred to blocking the merger outright, losing the flexibility to deal directly with input foreclosure was a loss from a public policy perspective. Instead of preventing discrimination against rival health plans in CVS-Aetna, the DoJ did basically nothing to address the potential harm. Judge Leon could right this wrong and fix the DoJ’s error."
"Sanders, Omar call for Labor Department investigation of all US Amazon warehouses",https://www.cnet.com,['Ben Fox Rubin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/sanders-omar-call-for-labor-department-investigation-of-all-amazon-warehouses/#ftag=CAD0610abe0f,"Ben Fox Rubin/CNET

A group of 13 members of Congress on Tuesday asked the Department of Labor to investigate all of Amazon's US warehouses, citing a long list of concerns about working conditions, labor violations, injuries and mistreatment.

The group is led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic candidate for president, and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The members are all Democrats except Sanders, who's an independent, and include prominent Democrats including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

In a statement Tuesday, Sanders called on the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to open an investigation immediately and ""prosecute those responsible to the fullest extent of the law.""

""People who work for a company owned by the wealthiest person in America should not have to risk their lives, health or well-being on the job,"" he said, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. ""They must be treated with dignity and respect.""

Amazon shot back Tuesday, saying Sanders has an open invitation to visit its warehouses ""but to date has never stepped foot in one of our buildings."" The company said if Sanders had seen the facilities, he'd have learned that the company already implemented multiple layers of safety protocols at its warehouses. That work includes monthly employee surveys of safety, more than 1 million hours of safety training last year, and $55 million in safety improvement investments in the past year.

""The allegations outlined in this letter are not an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings,"" Amazon said, adding that people as young as 6 can tour the buildings to see for themselves.

Sanders rejected Amazon's suggestion, saying in a tweet Tuesday afternoon he preferred surprise inspections be conducted by the Labor Department.

""I am not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse,"" Sanders' tweet said. ""I am calling for Labor Department inspectors to come in, unannounced, and do thorough investigations of the facilities where hundreds of workers have told me about horrendous conditions and abuse.""

The congressional request continues long-running criticisms of how Amazon operates its warehouses, with years of news reports detailing employees being overworked, closely monitored and forced to move faster. While Amazon has faced heavy criticism in the press and from several members of Congress, a comprehensive government report on its warehouse conditions hasn't happened.

Now playing: Watch this: For these women, working at Amazon while pregnant ends...

Sanders' criticisms follow his repeated attacks against Amazon last year, when he called on the company to raise its minimum wage. When it did in October, he congratulated it for making that change.

The congressional group sent a letter requesting an investigation during Prime Day, Amazon's annual summer sale. In its fifth year, Prime Day has started to garner plenty of negative attention, with protests going on across the US and Europe on Monday.

On Wednesday, a Department of Labor spokesperson said: ""OSHA has confirmed receipt of the letter. The agency is still reviewing the letter at this time.""



I stand in solidarity with the courageous Amazon workers engaging in a work stoppage against unconscionable working conditions in their warehouses. It is not too much to ask that a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world treat its workers with dignity and respect. https://t.co/GxagHx70pb — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) July 15, 2019

Amazon said Monday that Prime Day has ""become an opportunity for our critics, including unions, to raise awareness for their cause, in this case, increased membership dues."" The company has often mentioned that it raised its minimum wage to $15 last year and offers a comprehensive benefits package that includes paid education, parental leave and opportunities for promotion.

Amazon's roughly 300,000 US employees aren't represented by unions.

In Tuesday's letter to OSHA, the members of Congress outlined several workplace problems they want investigated, including a report from Mother Jones that highlighted hazardous warehouse floor conditions that can cause long-term injuries. The group said they've heard hundreds of stories directly from people who worked for Amazon that present extremely poor conditions for employees, including high temperatures, closely monitored productivity that causes workers to avoid bathroom breaks for fear of falling behind, mental health issues, and calls for a faster pace that ultimately lead to injuries.

One former worker, a Navy veteran, said, according to the letter: ""There was a point where I would find myself crying on my shift ... I really felt like I just didn't wanna be alive anymore.""

""This work environment creates a high risk of physical injuries, a risk increased by Amazon's intentional disregard for the health and safety of their employees,"" the letter said.

In addition to Omar, Sanders, Gabbard and Ocasio-Cortez, Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Deb Haaland, Ayanna Pressley, Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky, Ro Khanna, Al Green, Debbie Dingell and Andy Levin joined the call for an investigation and signed the letter to OSHA.

U.S. Sanctions Senior Myanmar Generals Over Rohingya 'Ethnic Cleansing',https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742538509/u-s-sanctions-senior-myanmar-generals-over-rohingya-ethnic-cleansing,"U.S. Sanctions Senior Myanmar Generals Over Rohingya 'Ethnic Cleansing'

Enlarge this image toggle caption Lynn Bo Bo/AP Lynn Bo Bo/AP

The State Department said it has issued sanctions to four top military leaders in Myanmar over what it called ""gross human rights violations"" during the ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

Targets of the sanctions include the military's commander in chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy Soe Win, Brig. Gen. Than Oo and Brig. Gen. Aung Aung. The sanctions, which were announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, mean the leaders and their immediate families are barred from entry into the United States.

""With this announcement, the United States is the first government to publicly take action with respect to the most senior leadership of the Burmese military,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We designated these individuals based on credible information of these commanders' involvement in gross violations of human rights.""

A U.N. fact-finding mission said last year that the military ""took the lead in killing thousands of Rohingya civilians, as well as forced disappearances, mass gang rape and the burning of hundreds of villages."" It recommended that Min Aung Hlaing and other top leaders be tried for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

A spokesperson for the Myanmar military, Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, told The New York Times that the new travel ban won't have much effect on the leaders.

""It doesn't matter that they banned travel to the United States for the generals,"" said the spokesperson. ""But it does insult the Myanmar military's dignity.""

Pompeo's statement said that Min Aung Hlaing ordered the release of his men convicted of killing a group of Rohingya men in Inn Din, which was the subject of a Reuters investigation that won the Pulitzer Prize. ""The Commander-in-Chief released these criminals after only months in prison, while the journalists who told the world about the killings in Inn Din were jailed for more than 500 days,"" Pompeo said. He called it an ""egregious example of the continued and severe lack of accountability for the military and its senior leadership.""

Fortify Rights, a human rights organization based in Southeast Asia, said the sanctions alone are ""not sufficient but a step toward more justice and accountability.""

""It is the military as an institution which needs to be targeted,"" Mark Farmaner, director of the advocacy group Burma Campaign UK, said in a tweet. ""The military will not change its behavior because a small number of its members have reduced holiday options."""
DOJ calls Qualcomm antitrust ruling a threat to national security,https://9to5mac.com,['Apple Watch Series'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/17/threat-to-national-security/,"The Department of Justice is arguing that the Qualcomm antitrust ruling back in May poses a threat to national security. It is calling for the remedies issued by the court to be put on hold pending an appeal.

Although Apple settled its civil lawsuit against Qualcomm, the exact same evidence put forward for that case was earlier used by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take the radio chipmaker to court — with judgement awarded against Qualcomm …

NordVPN

Background

Apple’s evidence in the case was key to the FTC victory. The court ruled that Qualcomm’s contracts with the iPhone maker and other smartphone companies were unfair, and evidence that the chipmaker held an effective monopoly on essential wireless technologies.

Judge Koh ordered three remedies. First, Qualcomm must renegotiate existing licensing terms, ensuring that customers can choose to license patents without being forced to buy their chips from the company. Second, it must license those essential patents on FRAND terms – Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory. Third, it cannot enter into any exclusivity agreements: all its chips must be available for sale to any company that wishes to buy them.

Qualcomm appealed the case, arguing that the judge misapplied a rather obscure legal precedent involving a ski company.

The DOJ intervention

We learned back in May that the DOJ might seek to intervene in the case, expressing concern about the impact of the remedies on Qualcomm’s future. In particular, it was concerned that Qualcomm is the US leader in the development of 5G technology, and anything which damaged the company’s business model could leave it with less incentive to invest in research and development. That could leave the US dependent on Chinese 5G tech.

CNET reports that it has now done so.

The Justice Department on Tuesday filed an amicus brief with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking the judges to grant Qualcomm a reprieve. The filing followed a request by Qualcomm last week that the appeals court grant a stay in remedies ordered by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh in May after she declared the wireless chip provider to be a monopoly.

An amicus brief — literally a submission from ‘a friend of the court’ — is an argument put forward by a third-party, not directly involved in the case, but which has a point it wishes the judge to consider in reaching a decision.

The DOJ makes two arguments. First, it agrees with Qualcomm that the precedent was misapplied and that the chipmaker is likely to win its appeal. Qualcomm says the remedies would do irreversible damage to the company, and it is therefore right that they should be put on hold until the appeal is heard.

“Unless stayed, the injunction will significantly impair an American company that is the worldwide leader in the development of cellular technologies, at a critical moment in the development of the worldwide standards for next-generation 5G cellular systems, thereby forfeiting the lead to foreign interests,” Qualcomm’s filing said.

Second, says the Justice Department, the ruling poses a threat to national security.

The threat to national security arguments

If Qualcomm is able to make less money from licensing its patents, and selling chips, it may well decide that expensive investment in 5G R&D no longer makes financial sense. Since Chinese companies currently dominate the production of 5G tech, that would leave both US companies and the government forced to use Chinese technology for crucial infrastructure.

Additionally, says the DOJ, Qualcomm is a key supplier to the Defense Department, and it is in the national interest that the company remains motivated to invest in R&D.

The risks to national security include the disruption of DOD’s supply chain and unsure US leadership in 5G, said Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. She added that the Defense Department believes Qualcomm is the market leader in wireless chips because of its expertise and R&D expenditure and that Qualcomm holds important Defense Department security clearance and contracts. “A hobbled Qualcomm, without the ability to make significant investments in R&D, presents a serious threat to DOD’s extensive networks, advanced telecommunications systems, and ultimately its ability to control the battlespace,” Lord said.

EPA hails Trump's work on reducing air pollution,https://thehill.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453601-epa-hails-trumps-work-on-reducing-air-pollution,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pointed to a new study released Wednesday to emphasize what it characterized as the Trump administration’s achievements in decreasing air pollution.

The report showed that emissions from all six measured criteria air pollutants decreased between 2016 and 2018, the years Trump has been in office.

It hailed this as part of decades-long trend of falling pollution rates that began in 1970, when the Clean Air Act was implemented. The results of the annual national air quality report showed that the emissions of six key pollutants dropped by 74 percent in that time period. The pollutants measured do not include carbon dioxide or methane, known greenhouse gases.

A statement from EPA added that the U.S. economy has grown 275 percent since 1970.

The arguments echo President Trump Donald John TrumpPompeo changes staff for Russia meeting after concerns raised about top negotiator's ties: report House unravels with rise of 'Les Enfants Terrible' Ben Carson: Trump is not a racist and his comments were not racist MORE’s remarks last week from the White House that drew criticism from environmental groups for taking credit for long-term improvements in air quality that had little to do with his own administration’s actions.

“They are taking credit for long term improvements in air quality that are results of regulations we’ve had in place for many years,” said Gretchen Goldman, research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The way they frame it is we’ve mostly seen improvements of air toxics emissions, but at the same time they are doing that, they are changing policies that will actually make it worsen air toxics emissions.”

Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate deal since entering the White House.

The administration in the last year also replaced former President Obama’s Clean Power Plan for regulating emissions from power plants and revoked the “once in, always in policy,” which loosened regulatory compliance standards for certain sources of air pollution previously considered “major.”

“Despite EPA’s press release spin, reductions in air pollution during the Trump administration have stalled, while the Department of Energy estimates C02 emissions alone actually spiked in 2018, something Administrator Wheeler and his agency conveniently failed to mention, of course,” said Alex Formuzis, a spokesperson for the Environmental Working Group.

Critics say the damage from Trump’s policies are unlikely to be measured for some time.

“This is a long-term thing, you don’t see improvements and declines with a quick turn around, the way the process is, it’s a science based policy, often when you change a policy it’s years till you see the outcome, Goldman said.

Goldman pointed to the Obama administration’s 2015 ozone rule. Industry compliance results for that rule weren’t measured and released until this year.

“It’s going to be a while until we see the public impact of that but it’s 100 percent coming,” she said.

U.S. State Department official suspected of DUII in Bend,https://www.oregonlive.com,['Bend Bulletin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/07/us-state-department-official-suspected-of-duii-in-bend.html,"A senior official with the U.S. State Department was arrested this month on suspicion of drunken driving after crashing her vehicle while returning from a wedding.

Susan A. Phalen was arrested July 6 on suspicion of DUII and reckless driving near Central Oregon Community College. As of Tuesday, she had not been charged with a crime, according to the Oregon Judicial Information Network.

At 10:39 p.m., dispatch received a report of a single-vehicle rollover crash on Mt. Washington Drive. Bend police Officer Matthew Baldwin arrived to find a 2019 Land Rover Discovery on its side in the middle of the northbound lane and Phalen sitting on the curb with a COCC campus security officer standing near her, according to court documents.

Baldwin said he “immediately” noticed numerous signs of impairment in Phalen, such as watery and bloodshot eyes, slurred and slow speech.

She allegedly needed help standing, according to court records.

Phalen reportedly told the officer she had been returning to her Airbnb after a wedding in Tumalo. Unfamiliar with the area, she attempted to follow her navigation by making a left turn when she rolled her vehicle.

The nearest road was Regency Drive, about one-eighth of a mile up the road, Baldwin said.

Phalen reportedly admitted to drinking margaritas at the wedding, but refused to perform roadside sobriety tests or take a breath test for alcohol, according to court records.

“I have no comment,” Phalen told The Bulletin when reached.

Phalen, 49, of Alexandria, Virginia, is listed as a senior adviser for external affairs for the State Department, according the department’s current directory. Her career in government stretches to the 1990s and has included stints as communication director for the House Homeland Security Committee and before that, the House Intelligence Committee. More recently, she was director of external affairs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to her LinkedIn page.

Phalen made headlines last year when a fellow press secretary left FEMA, citing in his resignation letter a “boys club” mentality that excluded Phalen.

Phalen resigned from FEMA in early 2018.

"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

"Justice Department ends inquiry of hush-money payments in final months of Donald Trump's campaign, judge says",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kristine Phillips', 'Kevin Johnson', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/17/doj-ends-investigation-hush-payments-involving-donald-trump-michael-cohen/1755046001/,"CLOSE President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid money to women to be quiet about alleged affairs with Trump during his 2016 campaign. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors in New York concluded their investigation of hush-money payments Donald Trump's former personal lawyer orchestrated to quiet potential sex scandals in the final months of his presidential campaign, a judge said Wednesday.

The notice, contained in a brief order issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge William Pauley, was an unceremonious end to an inquiry that implicated the president.

Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he engineered payments to two women who claimed to have had extramarital affairs with Trump to silence them before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors in New York said those payments violated federal campaign finance laws, and they and Cohen said Trump directed his lawyer to arrange the payments.

Pauley revealed the end of the investigation as part of an order in which he instructed the government to make public some of the search warrants it used when investigating Cohen, who pleaded guilty to two campaign finance violations for the payments, as well as a set of other felonies. He is serving a three-year prison sentence.

“We are pleased that the investigations surrounding these ridiculous campaign finance allegations is now closed,” Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said Wednesday. “We have maintained from the outset that the president never engaged in any campaign finance violation.”

Between the New York inquiry and the special counsel investigation of Russian election interference, which concluded in March, Trump has spent nearly all of his presidency under scrutiny from federal prosecutors. Now that the campaign finance inquiry is closed, Sekulow said he knew of no other federal investigations in which Trump is a subject.

Pauley's announcement signals the end of a criminal investigation in which authorities examined Trump and his private business, the Trump Organization. Typically, prosecutors do not announce the end of an investigation or agree to provide details about their work if they intend to pursue additional charges.

One of Cohen's lawyers, Lanny Davis, reacted with dismay. ""Why is Michael Cohen ... the only member of the Trump company to be prosecuted and imprisoned?"" he said. ""Especially since prosecutors found that virtually all of Michael’s admitted crimes were done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald Trump? Why?”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Prosecutors had asked to keep documents under seal, indicating that the investigation into the campaign finance violations was ongoing. Pauley said they changed that position in a sealed filing Monday, and as a result, the search warrant materials should become public.

“The campaign finance violations discussed in the Materials are a matter of national importance. Now that the Government’s investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the Materials,” Pauley wrote.

Pauley ordered the government to make the information public Thursday morning.

Cohen and federal prosecutors said he arranged payments to two women in the final months of Trump's 2016 campaign: Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal and pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.

Trump denied the affairs and said he did not know about the payments.

Prosecutors said in a court filing Cohen participated in an agreement involving a tabloid to “suppress” McDougal’s story and “prevent it from influencing the election.” The agreement involved “Corporation-1,” which agreed in August 2016 to buy McDougal’s story for $150,000. The description of ""Corporation-1"" matches public description of the National Enquirer

The Enquirer's parent company acknowledged in an agreement with prosecutors that it made the payment because McDougal's story could have jeopardized Trump's campaign.

Cohen arranged a separate payment – spending $130,000 out of his own pocket – to Daniels, who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Trump in 2006. Prosecutors said Trump’s business reimbursed Cohen for his payment to Daniels, added $130,000 to pay for Cohen’s taxes and $60,000 as a bonus. Prosecutors said the payments were disguised as legal bills.

Cohen said during congressional testimony in February that his former boss masterminded the “cover-up” of the payments to Daniels and directed him to lie about them, including to first lady Melania Trump. He presented the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee with a copy of a personal check that he said Trump signed during the first year of his presidency to reimburse him for the payments. Cohen said the check, which was for $35,000, was one of 11 installments.

Cohen said the other checks were signed by Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's finance chief.

During an FBI raid in April 2018, investigators sought bank records and other information on payments to Daniels and McDougal. Court records revealed that the investigation went far beyond the hush-money payments and that the FBI had been looking broadly into financial crimes by Cohen.

Cohen's statements to Congress led to a congressional investigation of Trump's finances. The oversight committee sought to obtain copies of Trump's financial records in its investigation on whether Trump incorrectly reported his finances in government disclosure forms, whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest and whether he complied with the emoluments clause, which prohibits a president from receiving payments from foreign governments.

Cohen, who had vowed to ""take a bullet"" for Trump, called his former boss a ""racist,"" a ""con man"" and a ""cheat.""

""I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your fixer, Mr. Trump,"" Cohen said.

The president castigated Cohen, saying he was lying to reduce his prison time.

"US Treasury yields lower amid weaker housing data, trade concerns",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/17/us-treasury-yields-tick-lower-amid-renewed-trade-concerns.html,"U.S. government debt yields fell on Wednesday amid weaker-than-expected housing data and following President Donald Trump's Tuesday comments that there is still a ""long way to go"" on trade talks with China.

At around 4:00 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note , which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 2.052%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury note yielded 1.82%.

The Commerce Department said in a report on Wednesday that U.S. homebuilding fell for a second straight month in June and permits slumped to a two-year low, hinting at a softer housing market despite lower mortgage rates.

The government said that housing starts decreased 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million units last month as a plunge in multi-family homebuilding dragged on the data. The sector has hit a soft patch in recent quarters and likely subtracted from GDP in the second quarter.

Builder confidence, meanwhile, ticked up just one point in July to 65, according to a Tuesday report from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI).

""Builders report solid demand for single-family homes. However, they continue to grapple with labor shortages, a dearth of buildable lots and rising construction costs that are making it increasingly challenging to build homes at affordable price points relative to buyer incomes,"" said NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde, a homebuilder and developer from Torrington, Connecticut.

Trade worries have also kept Treasurys in demand after President Donald Trump raised doubts on the trade progress between China and the U.S. and renewed threats to slap tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods."
State Department looking at redirecting Central American aid to Guaido,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/state-department-northern-triangle-funding-guaido/index.html,"(CNN) A State Department spokesperson confirmed to CNN Wednesday that the State Department is looking to redirect some funding originally designated for the Northern Triangle -- Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- to embattled Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido.

""Working with Congress, we are exploring reprogramming some of the funding towards promoting democracy in Venezuela, including supporting the interim Guaido government and National Assembly,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

The United States and dozens of other nations have backed Guaido in his bid to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. However, almost six months after the US recognized the opposition leader, Maduro remains in power.

""Our programming, existing and planned, is targeted to address the Venezuela crisis. We are investing in good governance, human rights, technical assistance for the Guaido government, independent media, and civil society,"" they said. ""The principle objective of our funding for Venezuela aligns with our principle policy objective: to restore democracy to Venezuela.""

The spokesperson said that none of the funding being reprogrammed is humanitarian assistance; it all falls under development assistance. They noted that the State Department ""regularly adjusts funding as priorities evolve"" and that it is ""technical process tied to our strategic planning so that we spend taxpayer dollars responsibly and in line with Administration priorities.""

"A Revere veteran’s legal marijuana job cost him a VA loan. Now, Congress is stepping in",https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/07/16/fought-good-fight-revere-veteran-shocked-congress-cared-about-his-home-loan-rejection-over-legal-marijuana-job/kPnw9QCisvNtgvUshzwXeJ/story.html,"It was validation for the 35-year-old disabled Army veteran from Revere. He never imagined that anyone would care that the Veterans Administration had rejected his home loan application in January, just as his family was set to move, because the VA disapproved of his job managing a marijuana store.

The US House of Representatives passed your amendment, said the caller from Representative Katherine Clark’s office. Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

But now, the House had shown it agreed that the veteran should have received his earned benefit. On Friday, it passed a measure banning the VA from considering veterans’ income from state-approved cannabis industries as a reason to deny them their benefit of a low-rate home loan guarantee with no money down.

“I’m blown away — I can’t believe it,” said the veteran, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his military relationship. “It’s cool because we fought the good fight and something really went the way it should go.”

In January, after the veteran’s house purchase fell through at the last moment because of the VA’s rejection, he contacted his congresswoman, Clark. She filed the amendment to ban the VA’s practice as part of the larger defense budget. Separately, she sent a letter, signed by 20 lawmakers, to the VA requesting more policy details in light of the veteran’s case. The letter noted that more than 211,000 people work in the legal cannabis trade nationwide, which generates $11 billion in sales per year.

“The cannabis industry is a growing part of our economy and no one, let alone our veterans, should be penalized for being part of it,” Clark said in a statement Friday after the House vote. “The passage of this amendment ensures that our service members receive the benefits they deserve while modernizing the policies of the VA.”

The VA did not respond to a request for comment, but previously said it would reply directly to the lawmakers.

Because the Senate had already passed its version of the defense budget, a joint committee will determine whether the measure will be included in the bill that lands on President Trump’s desk.

The Revere veteran’s experience highlights one of the many ways that veterans and others can get caught between federal marijuana prohibition and states that have legalized pot.

Some veterans have reported a loss of benefits or being labeled unemployable as a result of consuming marijuana or working in the legal marijuana industry. Many veterans who find medical relief from pot say they’re financially overburdened and medically underserved because the VA doesn’t discuss or cover the drug as it does with other medications, including opioids.

The Revere veteran started working in the cannabis industry after finding that medical marijuana helped ease his chronic pain resulting from tearing both shoulders in a military training exercise. The cannabis also allowed him to get off opioids, he said, which made him “a shell of myself.”

Last year, he became the assistant manager of a marijuana retailer, now one of the state’s 22 pot shops. He loves helping patients find relief. The job gives him fulfillment that he’d missed since the Army.

In January, when he learned why the VA rejected his home loan, the veteran vented to his coworkers. One of his colleagues connected him to a mortgage company that helped him secure a reduced-rate home loan that he could afford.

The veteran and his family are no longer crammed into a tiny apartment or his parents’ home. Last week, they moved into their new house: a yellow four-bedroom in Dracut with a sunroom, white countertops, and a huge backyard perfect for his three children.

“It’s a dream come true,” the veteran said. “It’s a bigger, better, beautiful house. Maybe everything happens for a reason.”

"EPA pushed for tighter, more enforceable PolyMet water permit",https://www.duluthnewstribune.com,['Jimmy Lovrien'],,,,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/3976773-EPA-pushed-for-tighter-more-enforceable-PolyMet-water-permit,"A newly released Environmental Protection Agency memo shows the federal agency continued to urge the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to set stiffer standards on its water permit later given to PolyMet, the company looking to build the first copper-nickel mine in Minnesota, up until two days before the water permit was issued to the company.

The memo, first given to the Minneapolis Star Tribune by the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, which represents EPA employees in the midwest, was written by Kevin Pierard, chief of the NPDES Programs Branch and dated Dec. 18, 2018. The MPCA issued its water and air permits to PolyMet on Dec. 20.

Pierard outlines concerns and comments made by EPA staffers reviewing a draft of PolyMet’s national pollutant discharge elimination system, or NPDES, permit, which regulates water discharged from industrial activities.

In the memo, Pierard explains the EPA urged the MPCA to require water quality based effluent limits, or WQBELs, in its permit to PolyMet, instead of operating limits, which the federal agency said are less enforceable.

Opponents of PolyMet argue the project could send tainted runoff into the St. Louis River watershed and Lake Superior.

WQBELs set standards on pollutants discharged into the environment and are enforceable under the Clean Water Act and apply at the discharge point where dilution may occur.

But instead of requiring PolyMet to follow those standards, the MPCA plans to regulate contaminants such as arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury with operating limits, which the state agency said is “more conservative and protective” than WQBELs because operating limits are measured prior to discharge and don’t require dilution, MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton said in an email to the News Tribune Wednesday.

But the EPA memo maintains operating limits are more difficult to enforce.

“Unlike WQBELs and (technology-based effluent limitations), internal ‘operating’ limits may lack a clear regulatory connection to controlling surface water discharges,” Pierard wrote, acknowledging that EPA lawyers determined PolyMet’s operating limits set by the MPCA are still “arguably federally enforceable.”

But he added, “We note that federal enforceability of these operating limits is less certain and more complex than if these limits were established as WQBELs.”

Broton said the MPCA did not find “reasonable potential” for discharge to exceed water quality standards in the receiving water, which would have required a WQBELs.

“PolyMet’s proposed reverse osmosis treatment is extremely effective in removing pollutants,” Broton said. “Using this data, staff did not find that the discharge had reasonable potential to result in an exceedance in the water quality standards and therefore needed WQBEL.”

Paula Maccabee, counsel and advocacy director of WaterLegacy, an environmental group opposed to PolyMet, has long argued WQBELs for PolyMet are required by law.

“With operating limits, it’s uncertain whether it can be enforced at all,” Maccabee said Wednesday. “It’s uncertain what kind of action could be required, even if there’s a violation. So in every possible way, it’s a second best or maybe third best alternative. Water quality based limitations are what the law requires and should require.”

The EPA memo echoes concerns made by the EPA in an April 2018 document released last month on an earlier draft and a leaked email that critics of the project say shows the MPCA tried to suppress those comments from reaching the public record.

The handling of those comments is being investigated both by the EPA’s Office of Inspector General and Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor. Similarly, the Minnesota Court of Appeal’s cited the permitting processes “procedural irregularities” and sent the case to a district court for a hearing.

Through a rights offering last month, Swiss mining giant Glencore now owns almost 72% of PolyMet shares. PolyMet must still raise almost $1 billion to finance the project."
DOJ: Antitrust ruling against Qualcomm could ‘put our nation’s security at risk’,https://www.cnet.com,['Shara Tibken'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/doj-says-antitrust-ruling-against-qualcomm-could-put-our-nations-security-at-risk/,"Stephen Shankland/CNET

The US Justice Department is weighing in on Qualcomm's appeal of a ruling that declared the chip giant to be a monopoly. And the government's citing national security and 5G leadership as reasons for an appeals court to let Qualcomm delay renegotiating its licensing contracts.

The Justice Department on Tuesday filed an amicus brief with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking the judges to grant Qualcomm a reprieve. The filing followed a request by Qualcomm last week that the appeals court grant a stay in remedies ordered by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh in May after she declared the wireless chip provider to be a monopoly.

At the time, Qualcomm said carrying out the remedies -- before the case went through the appeals process -- would be irreversible and would change its business model. The reforms included renegotiating licensing agreements previously reached with handset makers like LG, licensing wireless patents to rival chip makers and submitting to monitoring by the Federal Trade Commission. Qualcomm wanted the injunctions to be put on hold while the case made its way through the appeals process.

Now playing: Watch this: Powerful chipmaker Qualcomm is just too powerful, judge...

The Justice Department on Tuesday sided with Qualcomm, as did the US Department of Energy CIO Max Everett and Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. They cited 5G and national security as reasons for granting Qualcomm's reprieve. The Justice Department also said Qualcomm will likely win an appeal that will overturn the May ruling. The group said Judge Koh ""misapplied Supreme Court precedent,"" and the ordered remedy is ""unprecedented.""

""The district court's ruling threatens competition, innovation and national security,"" the Justice Department said. ""Immediate implementation of the remedy could put our nation's security at risk, potentially undermining US leadership in 5G technology and standard-setting, which is vital to military readiness and other critical national interests.""

Everett said the Department of Energy ""believes that any remedy that causes undue financial strain on Qualcomm may result in undermining Qualcomm's position in the growing 5G market (among other telecommunications markets) and ceding to foreign entities, in particular China, a dominant position in the development and expansion of 5G technology."" He noted that Qualcomm plays a key role in US telecom infrastructure and supply chain, and its competitive position ""is critically important to the Department of Energy.""

And Lord of the Defense Department said that the department ""firmly believes that any measure that inappropriately limits Qualcomm's technological leadership, ability to invest in research and development (R&D), and market competitiveness, even in the short-term, could harm national security. The risks to national security include the disruption of DOD's supply chain and unsure US leadership in 5G.""

She added that the Defense Department believes Qualcomm is the market leader in wireless chips because of its expertise and R&D expenditure and that Qualcomm holds important Defense Department security clearance and contracts.

""A hobbled Qualcomm, without the ability to make significant investments in R&D, presents a serious threat to DOD's extensive networks, advanced telecommunications systems, and ultimately its ability to control the battlespace,"" Lord said.

This isn't the first time parts of the US government have jumped to Qualcomm's defense, even though it was a US government agency -- the FTC -- that brought the antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm two years ago.

President Donald Trump a year ago blocked Broadcom's proposed $117 billion acquisition of Qualcomm, saying the deal threatened to ""impair the national security"" of the US. Then in May, before Koh issued her ruling, the Justice Department asked for a hearing on Qualcomm's possible punishment if a California judge agreed with the FTC. The Justice Department said the court should carefully consider what remedy to carry out because it's worried about the US' position in the race to 5G.

Qualcomm and the FTC declined to comment.

Monopoly battle

Two years ago, the FTC accused Qualcomm of operating a monopoly in wireless chips. The FTC said Qualcomm forced customers like Apple to work exclusively with it and charged ""excessive"" licensing fees for its technology, in part by wielding a ""no license, no chips"" policy. Qualcomm's practices prevented rivals from entering the market, drove up the cost of phones and in turn hurt consumers, who faced higher handset prices, the FTC said.

Qualcomm argued the FTC's lawsuit was based on ""flawed legal theory"" and that customers choose its chips because they're the best. It also argued that competition is fierce in the mobile chip market and that Qualcomm never stopped providing processors to customers, even when they'd been arguing over licenses.

The parties faced off in an 11-day trial in January. In May, Koh ruled in the FTC's favor, saying Qualcomm was a monopoly that illegally hurt competitors in the wireless chip market. The ruling, which came four months after the trial ended, said Qualcomm must change how it does business and renegotiate license deals with its customers. To hold the company accountable, the court said Qualcomm must also submit compliance and monitoring reports for the next seven years and report to the FTC on an annual basis.

""Qualcomm's licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets for years, and harmed rivals, OEMs, and end consumers in the process,"" Koh wrote in her ruling in May.

The ruling came as a surprise to Qualcomm and others in the mobile market. For Qualcomm, the verdict called into question the company's entire business model. While it sells processors that connect devices to mobile networks, it also generates a significant percentage of its revenue from licensing. If it can't collect royalties based on the value of a handset -- which it had done in the past -- it will generate less money and may have to rethink its model entirely. Even though it's appealing the ruling, Qualcomm's licensees likely will try to alter their contracts.

Koh, in her ruling, said Qualcomm can't force a customer to sign a license before it'll supply that company with chips. It ""must negotiate or renegotiate license terms with customers in good faith under conditions free from the threat of lack of access to or discriminatory provision of modem chip supply or associated technical support or access to software.""

Though Qualcomm likely won't have to renegotiate its new agreement with Apple -- the two settled their long-running licensing and patent disputes during opening arguments in a May trial -- it'll have to offer other customers the chance to change their terms.

Qualcomm's appeal

Qualcomm filed a motion last week with the US Appeals Court for the Ninth Circuit, asking the court to grant a stay because carrying out the actions would ""fundamentally change the way it has done business for decades."" If the appeals court ultimately finds in Qualcomm's favor, the chip giant said, the company won't be able to undo the changes it's made. Qualcomm also filed a request for an expedited briefing and hearing for the appeal.

""This court has repeatedly found that a stay is warranted when -- as here -- an injunction imposes changes on a party's business practices and commercial arrangements that cannot be undone by this court's later reversal of the district court's judgment,"" Qualcomm said in its filing requesting the stay. ""There is no basis to depart from that settled, sound practice.""

Qualcomm also invoked the global race to 5G and the US' priority to lead when it comes to the super fast, next-generation technology.

""Unless stayed, the injunction will significantly impair an American company that is the worldwide leader in the development of cellular technologies, at a critical moment in the development of the worldwide standards for next-generation 5G cellular systems, thereby forfeiting the lead to foreign interests,"" Qualcomm's filing said.

The company said firms are already are trying to renegotiate their contracts with Qualcomm and noted it ""will be forced to negotiate under the cloud of an injunction requiring it to accept terms to which it would not otherwise agree.""

Wireless networking gear giant Ericsson -- one of the companies that testified in the January trial -- also filed an amicus brief in Qualcomm's favor on Monday. The wireless networking gear giant argued that the district court's order requiring Qualcomm to license its standard essential patents to other chipmakers, as well as the requirement it renegotiate its current licenses, ""threatens to disrupt the stability and predictability necessary to permit 5G investments to go forward.""

""The district court's injunction substantially alters the status quo governing Qualcomm's relationship with other players in the cellular phone industry,"" Ericsson said. ""Requiring Qualcomm to negotiate new licenses and to re-negotiate existing licenses -- with the expectation (realistic or not) that it could seek to re-negotiate those agreements if it wins its appeal -- creates an unacceptable level of uncertainty in the industry and threatens significant disruption that should be avoided by maintaining the status quo pending appeal.""

Fewer than half of USDA workers will follow agency to KC,https://www.kansascity.com,"['Elliot Spagat', 'Nomaan Merchant', 'Associated Press']",,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article232730352.html,"Employees protest plan to move USDA jobs to Kansas City The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City.

Fewer than half of the USDA researchers offered transfers from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City will follow their jobs here, the agency announced Tuesday.

But those who did decide to make the 1,000-mile journey still don’t know exactly where they’ll be working.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on June 13 that the ag department would ship more than 500 jobs from Washington to Kansas City. Local leaders in Kansas and Missouri cheered the bi-state recruitment effort, though it sparked an immediate backlash from employees in D.C.

A USDA spokesperson told The Star that 72 employees in the ag department’s Economic Research Service accepted their transfer to Kansas City. Another 99 turned down the offer — a number that included employees who did not respond by a Monday deadline. In USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 73 employees signed on to the transfer while another 151 turned it down.

In total, the agency reports 145 workers will follow their jobs to Kansas City, while 250 will leave the agency, meaning 36.7% accepted their transfer assignments. As USDA announced earlier, the two agencies will keep a combined 97 positions in the Washington area.

Some of USDA’s positions were already vacant, as workers began leaving the two agencies in the fall, when news of the relocation first emerged. In June, the agency announced 547 jobs would move to Kansas City. With only 145 signing up to move, that means it may have to hire as many as 400 workers.

Those numbers confirmed earlier predictions that many workers would flee USDA’s ranks rather than move to Kansas City.

USDA says the figures may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the last date employees can report to Kansas City. Employees can change their decision up until that date.

“With employee decisions made, the Department will work to promptly implement an aggressive hiring strategy to ensure continuity of work during the transition,” USDA said in a statement Tuesday.

The USDA spokesperson told The Star that human resources was working with both agencies to begin bringing on employees July 22 — the first date new and relocating employees may begin work in Kansas City.

Economic development officials from Kansas and Missouri joined forces to lure the two agencies to the region. But now, cities on both sides of the state line are working to land the final site of USDA’s offices. While all property owners can place bids, sources previously told The Star that six sites across the metro got USDA’s attention.

Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council, said his organization has been working with affected USDA employees over the last month. He said an acceptance rate below 40 percent is in line with that of a typical headquarters relocation.

“We are committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC. In fact, we have a team dedicated to them,” Cowden said in an email. “We expect there will be others who may elect to relocate to KC and our community is ready to welcome them.“

On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and more than a dozen other Democratic lawmakers wrote to the agriculture secretary urging him to slow down the relocation process.

While those members of Congress pledged to continue efforts to halt the move, in the meantime they asked the ag secretary to allow researchers to work remotely or from existing offices in the D.C. area until the feds have secured a permanent home in Kansas City.

USDA is looking for about 115,000 square feet of office space on either side of the state line.

The General Services Administration, the federal government’s real estate arm, will consider sites in a city center or suburban office park setting. GSA recently extended the deadline for developers to propose sites for the new USDA offices by one month. Those proposals are now due Aug. 7, though employees will begin working at temporary offices this fall in Kansas City.

“This predicament makes it nearly impossible for your employees to determine where they will be living, where to send their children to school, and other important decisions until they know where the final office space will be located in Kansas City,” Van Hollen’s letter said.

Experts believe the USDA’s move may portend a “new frontier of economic development” in which cities and states vie to lure federal offices away from Washington, D.C. On Monday, Republican senators announced that the federal Bureau of Land Management would ship jobs to three western states as it seeks to relocate its headquarters from the nation’s capital.

The agriculture department has argued that moving to Kansas City will put researchers closer to farmers and drastically reduce expenses given the Midwest’s relatively lower cost of living.

But many scientists — including the Union of Concerned Scientists — suspect that USDA’s relocation is meant to diminish USDA research.

The Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economic Association predicted the move could cost U.S. taxpayers upward of $182 million in lost productivity and research capacity.

And Tuesday’s letter from Democrats claims that it could take as long as two years to build out new office space in Kansas City.

“We remain concerned that this restructuring will gut the ability of these agencies to successfully carry out their important missions,” the Democrats said. “We also remain concerned that the quality of work being done at ERS and NIFA has already been undermined and will continue to degrade.”

US Treasury has 'serious concerns' Libra could be used for terrorism,https://www.engadget.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/15/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-us-treasury-department-concerns/,"According to Mnuchin, the US has been at the forefront of regulating entities that provide cryptocurrencies. It has also seen cryptocurrencies exploited to support illicit activities including cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, human trafficking and more. Still, Mnuchin said the US ""welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services.""

""With respect to Facebook's Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse,"" Mnuchin said. He noted that Facebook (and any other cryptocurrency providers) will have to meet the same safeguards as traditional financial institutions, including those put in place by the Anti-Money Laundering Council, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Bank Secrecy Act.

That should come as no surprise to Facebook. While it's likely prepared to meet those standards, it will have to navigate pushback like this from the Treasury Department and the President himself, who claims cryptocurrencies are ""highly volatile and based on thin air."" Some lawmakers have called for Facebook to halt Libra's development, and others want to block all big tech companies from providing cryptocurrencies. Facebook is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing tomorrow, and it has said it won't launch Libra until all of the regulatory issues are addressed."
State Dept. urges Sweden to treat arrested rapper ASAP Rocky fairly,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/14/asap-rocky-arrested-sweden-state-department-1415839,"Swedish prosecutors must decide by Friday whether to charge A$AP Rocky with any crimes. | Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP File Photo foreign policy State Dept. urges Sweden to treat arrested rapper ASAP Rocky fairly

The State Department is raising concerns about the arrest and detention of an American rapper in Sweden and is urging the Swedish government to treat him fairly, according to a statement shared exclusively with POLITICO.

ASAP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested July 2 after voluntarily going to the police in Stockholm for questioning about a street fight he was involved in.

Story Continued Below

A State Department spokesperson said that the department is aware of the case and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been briefed. Top officials at the department, including Robert O’Brien, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, are also closely monitoring the situation and working to make sure the rapper is treated fairly.

“There are certainly some facts about the arrest and detention that raise concerns,” the spokesperson said. “We expect all governments, including Sweden, to treat American citizens fairly and with respect. … We hope to see ASAP Rocky and his colleagues back on tour and reunited with friends and family soon.”

Swedish prosecutors must decide by Friday whether to charge Rocky, who is being held in solitary confinement, or ask a court to let them hold him longer.

Rocky and his entourage, who were in Stockholm for the Smash music festival, were walking around the city “minding their own business” on June 30 when they were verbally harassed by two men who had started following them, according to a person close to the rapper.

Eventually, after one of them took “a fighting stance and then threw a punch” at Rocky’s bodyguard and hit him, the two sides soon started fighting.

“They were obviously spoiling for a fight,” said the person close to Rocky. The person added that the rapper and his crew “had no choice but to defend themselves” and that the two men who had been accosting Rocky and his colleagues got physical first. The person also said Rocky is “eager to defend himself and his name” in court if charges are filed.

A TMZ video shows Rocky throwing across the street one of the men who had been following him and his entourage. The video also shows some members of Rocky’s group kicking and hitting the person.

Rocky posted a video on Instagram with his side of the story, which showed his bodyguard telling the men to quit following them.

“So a few drug addicts are not my fans, we dont know these guys and we didnt want trouble, they followed us for 4 blocks, and they were slapping girls butts who passed, give me a break,” he wrote. Another video Rocky posted shows one of the men fighting with his bodyguard and throwing his headphones at him.

Alan Jackson, a lawyer for Rocky, told POLITICO: “President Trump has made bringing home unjustly held Americans a top priority for his administration. The State Department’s interest in the case gives us great hope for Rocky’s situation.

“Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador O’Brien have been relentless in their diplomatic efforts on behalf of American citizens being held all over the world. Rocky’s millions of fans worldwide are putting their trust in the State Department to get Rocky home.”

Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations requires signatory countries to immediately notify consular officials upon arresting a foreign citizen, but that didn’t happen for hours in Rocky’s case, according to the person close to Rocky.

A State Department official was also initially denied access to Rocky but upon being granted access, the official couldn’t have a private conversation with the rapper because two Swedish security guards were within earshot.

The Swedish Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.

Rocky was initially held for four days in a facility that had “relatively fetid conditions” with a “terrible stench” that was “dirty, filthy and disgusting,” according to the person close to the rapper. He was later moved to a detention facility where the conditions are “markedly better.”

Celebrities, including Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes, sent out social media posts in support of Rocky, and more than 580,000 people have signed a ""#JusticeForRocky"" petition on Change.org to urge Sweden to release him.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), whose district includes Harlem, where Rocky is from, said he’d “seen the tape of what occurred, and clearly, he was provoked, and harassed, and followed, and accosted, and I think he acted in self-defense.” Espaillat also raised concerns about the conditions of Rocky’s jail and told Complex.com that he would “fight until he’s brought back home.” The lawmaker has sent letters on the case to the State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Sweden and the Swedish ambassador to the U.S., Karin Olofsdotter."

"BLM moving headquarters to Colorado from D.C., dashing Utah’s hopes",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Bmaffly Sltrib.Com', 'Brian Maffly']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2019/07/15/federal-bureau-land/,"Following through on one of his predecessor’s key initiatives, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is expected to announce Tuesday that he will move the Bureau of Land Management’s headquarters from Washington, D.C., out West.

While Salt Lake City and Ogden would have been centrally located cities for the agency’s national office, Utah was not selected, although some BLM staffers could be transferred to offices here.

The headquarters will be established in Grand Junction, Colo., an oil and gas industry hub, according to Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, who praised the move because it will bring the agency closer to the lands it administers.

“The problem with Washington is too many policymakers are far removed from the people they are there to serve. Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is west of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters,"" Gardner said in a prepared statement. ""This is a victory for local communities, advocates for public lands, and proponents for a more responsible and accountable federal government.”

Ryan Zinke, a onetime Montana congressman, had proposed moving the BLM headquarters from his first day as President Donald Trump’s interior secretary, as part of a larger effort to reorganize Interior’s various agencies. Zinke left office under a cloud of ethics investigations early this year and was succeeded by his No. 2, Bernhardt, a native Coloradoan who had previously worked for the BLM and later as an oil and gas industry lobbyist.

According to reporting by The Washington Post, Bernhardt plans to relocate 77 staffers, or one-fifth of the BLM’s 350-member Washington workforce, to Western cities, mostly to Grand Junction, at a cost of about $4 million. E&E News broke the story Monday, identifying Grand Junction as the likely headquarters site.

The BLM administers 42 percent of the land in Utah, or 23 million acres, plus the minerals under 8 million acres of national forest. Nationally it oversees 245 million acres, nearly all of it in Western states, and many more acres of offshore oil and gas reserves. After 2½ years of the Trump administration, the BLM has yet to have a permanent director. Casey Hammond is the latest in a string of acting directors to head the agency.

Already the vast majority of the BLM’s 9,260 employees work in state headquarters and field offices, such as those in Salt Lake City, Vernal, Moab and Richfield.

Where Western politicians see greater efficiency and responsiveness in pushing even more BLM staff into the West, environmental activists see political theater and waste.

“This move is a solution in search of a problem,"" said Athan Manuel, director of public lands protection for Sierra Club. “Spending millions to relocate when there are existing regional offices, billions in park maintenance backlog on the books, and costs still rolling in from Trump’s Independence Day extravagance is just foolhardy.”

Like Gardner, Utah’s political leaders had viewed the BLM’s proposed move favorably, especially if the new headquarters wound up in Salt Lake City or Ogden.

“Moving the BLM [from Washington] to Utah will be far more than a symbolic gesture. It will actually generate better policy,” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said last year at a forum on Interior reorganization hosted by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah. “It will alleviate the anger and anxiety we have out here. It will change the nature of the discourses and relations the Intermountain West has with the rest of the country.”

A spokeswoman for Herbert declined comment until Interior makes an official announcement. The Interior Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Bishop on Monday praised Bernhardt’s “thoughtful, methodical approach,” calling it “a true win for the West.”

“I’m pleased that a significant number of personnel will be coming to Utah and other Western states,"" he said. ""The BLM personnel will be moved where they will have a greater impact on, and input by, the people who live in the regions where their influence is greatest. Not by bureaucrats from thousands of miles away.”

Critics, however, were quick to denounce BLM’s relocation.

Rep. Raul Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who heads the House Natural Resources Committee, linked the move to the Trump administration’s American energy dominance agenda, which he argues is geared more toward pandering to industry and cutting staff, rather than serving the public.

""Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s home town [of Rifle, Colo.] just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,"" he said in a prepared statement Monday. ""The BLM officials based in Washington are here to work directly with Congress and their federal colleagues, and that function is going to take a permanent hit if this move goes forward.""

Grijalva is also concerned that the BLM will lose many valued employees who might not want to leave Washington. “I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here,” he said.

Environmental activists also eye the move with skepticism.

“Bringing jobs to a Western community like Grand Junction is a laudable goal, but this announcement is nothing but a P.R. stunt,"" said Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.

“More than 90 percent of BLM staff already work outside of Washington, D.C., and the agency has dozens of offices across the West,” she said. “Moving senior BLM leadership would only turn the agency into an afterthought, rather than a core piece of the Interior Department.”"
New inspector general report details management issues at Norwood VA,https://www.augustachronicle.com,['Susan Mccord'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20190716/new-inspector-general-report-details-management-issues-at-norwood-va,"Nurse training and staffing, leadership and hiring problems plague Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in a new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Inspector General.

A new report from the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs points to more mismanagement at the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center.

Among the 97-page document’s findings included the VA downplaying the death of a critical care unit patient in late 2018 when a nurse improperly inserted a feeding tube into the patient's lung. By assigning the death a lower safety score, the VA wasn't required to analyze its root cause, the report said.

The death led investigators to discover that only two of 42 critical care registered nurses had adequate documentation of their competencies – such as knowing how to properly insert a feeding tube – in their personnel files. Neither of the two nurses involved in the incident had such documentation.

In his response to the report, VA Medical Center Director Robin Jackson said the nurse manager overseeing the nurses and one of the RNs had abruptly resigned and that the competency issues would be addressed. During a March 14 visit, however, the facility was unable to provide the inspector general's office with evidence that all CCU nurses had completed training in proper insertion of the tube, the report said.

The report, based largely on anonymous complaints, the report is the latest mark against the Augusta center. It came under fire in 2013 for being part of a nationwide VA backlog of patient consults, with some veterans dying while they waited for an appointment. In 2016, Augusta VA supervisor Cathedral Henderson was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for falsely reporting that veteran requests for care had been fulfilled to address the backlog.

A statement from Jackson's office said the center is implementing the inspector general's recommendations and is pleased that many of the anonymous allegations ""were largely unfounded.""

Several of the unfounded allegations led to other findings by the inspector general's office, such as a claim that a patient died while waiting for an intensive care bed. Though the death was not substantiated, investigators determined the hospital had no ""crash bed"" policy ensuring the availability of a bed in an emergency, the report said.

Substantiated allegations included leadership problems, significant staffing shortages and security issues, the report said.

Underlying the VA problems are a “facility culture” short on communication, the report said. Investigators “heard or read multiple accounts of the facility director publicly humiliating employees,” it said, including use of a “sarcastic, negative tone.”

Jackson joined the facility as interim director in April 2017, promising better access to care and more accountability, and was made permanent director in April 2018. He replaced Maria Andrews, who retired from the system after two years at the Augusta VA. She replaced Robert Hamilton, who managed the center for two years after Rebecca Wiley's tenure from 2007 to 2013. Wiley accepted $18,000 in performance bonuses while three patients died waiting for a consultation, according to prior Augusta Chronicle reports.

In the new report, investigators said they were repeatedly told hiring at the Augusta VA is inefficient and takes months. Those interviewed called it “awful,” “extremely difficult” and “exquisitely problematic.” with an average hiring action held up by one of several procedural step for nearly 58 days.

Though an early 2018 VA report found staffing levels to be adequate, in February both CCU and RN staffing was “substantially below” authorized levels, with 11 of 53 CCU nursing positions vacant and six of 36 ER nurse slots open.

Unexcused absenteeism is a related problem. On four days last year, more than 30 percent of nursing staff called out of work. On Aug. 30, half the staff didn’t come in. From Oct. 1 to Feb. 28, 30 emergency room RNs called in absent for 97 of their shifts.

“Staff absences frequently impacted the facility’s ability to maintain safe CCU staffing levels and that unit managers failed to consistently use the available administrative actions to address unexcused staff absences,” the report said.

Nearly 25,000 patients in the 2018 fiscal year were treated at the VA's emergency room, which is in service to the area's veteran population that exceeds 40,000. The two Augusta VA hospitals and clinics in Aiken, Athens and Statesboro employ 2,450 people and have a budget of around $400, according to a 2018 news release.

Other issues in the report included a lack of security in the emergency room that saw an emotionally distraught patient – whose written suicide threat was overlooked by staff – left the ER through an open door and killed himself the next morning.

Despite planned enhancements, investigators on Jan. 29 observed emergency room doors unsecured and propped open, with a security contract awaiting a signature, the report said.

It also raised concerns about critically ill patients being wheeled through a pedestrian bridge at the downtown campus to nearby AU Medical Center and the lack of clear policy about it. Employees attributed the measure in part to slow or inconsistent response by the local government EMS providers.

Jackson's office said several hires had been made to prevent future issues, including a permanent director, associate director, chief of staff, assistant director, human resources chief and chief of employee and labor relations."
USDA Identifies Two Monsanto Strains in Rogue GMO Wheat in Washington State,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-identifies-two-monsanto-strains-in-rogue-gmo-wheat-in-washington-state,"The GMO wheat discovered growing wild in a Washington State field this spring actually sprouted from two different strains developed by Monsanto, the USDA announced over the weekend. Genetically engineered wheat is not approved for cultivation anywhere in the world, yet volunteer herbicide-resistant plants have been confirmed four times in the U.S. Northwest more than a decade after field trials ended.

In the latest case, USDA said “thorough testing” identified the wheat as Monsanto strains MON 71300 and MON 71800. The MON 71800 strain also was identified in the first U.S. case of rogue GMO wheat, in eastern Oregon in 2013. The same strain was found growing wild in 2014 at a Montana State University research farm in Huntley, Montana. A different strain, MON 71700, was found in 22 wheat plants in a field in Washington State in 2016.

“There is no evidence that any GE wheat has entered commerce or is in the food supply,” said USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in an update of the new case. It has issued similar conclusions on the past incidents. And, as in the past, it cited the FDA position that there would be no safety concerns if low levels of the wheat varieties were present in the food supply.

A test kit will be offered to U.S. trading partners to identify MON 71300, said the APHIS. Previously, the USDA has provided test kits for the two other strains. Japan and South Korea, two major importers of wheat from the U.S. Northwest, have tested wheat shipments for GMO content since 2013 and have not found issues with the U.S. grain.

Unlike previous incidents, neither Japan nor South Korea interrupted purchases of U.S. wheat following the announcement of rogue wheat in Washington State. Last year, the two countries halted purchases of Canadian wheat for a month due to confirmation of GE wheat along an access road in southern Alberta.

Washington State often is the fourth-largest wheat-growing state in the nation. The Washington Grain Commission says 85% to 90% of the state’s wheat is exported, mainly to Pacific Rim nations.

In the three other U.S. incidents, the USDA did not identify the source of the wheat seeds or how a GMO variety survived in the wild. In all of the incidents, the plants attracted attention because they did not die when sprayed with a weedkiller. Monsanto genetically modified wheat to tolerate doses of Roundup herbicide.

The Trump administration is a supporter of U.S. agricultural biotechnology. President Trump signed an executive order in mid-June to modernize ag biotech and, referring to gene-edited crops and livestock, told the USDA, FDA, and EPA to use their existing powers “to exempt low-risk products of agricultural biotechnology for undue regulation.”

Trump administration denies possible ouster of Commerce Secretary Ross,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-census-ross/trump-weighs-ousting-commerce-secretary-ross-nbc-idUSKCN1UA0VD,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a media report nbcnews.to/2XPQJ4B that President Donald Trump is considering removing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after a Supreme Court defeat on adding a citizenship question to the census.

Trump retreated on Thursday from adding a contentious question on citizenship to the 2020 census, but insisted he was not giving up his fight to count how many non-citizens are in the country and ordered government agencies to mine their databases.

Although Trump has previously been frustrated with Ross, in particular over some failed trade negotiations, the 81-year-old commerce secretary has so far kept his job.

Since late last year other media outlets have reported at different times that Trump, whose administration has been characterized by high turnover in top posts, was considering replacing Ross.

Mnuchin told reporters that Trump remained satisfied with Ross in his role. “I have every reason to think Secretary Ross is doing a good job. I’ve never heard anything otherwise,” Mnuchin said.

The Commerce Department said in a statement Monday that Ross was currently overseeing the department’s response to Hurricane Barry and noted that he had joined Trump on his trip to Wisconsin and Ohio on Friday.

Ross “will continue to work on behalf of the American people and the President’s America First agenda,” the department said.

However, NBC reported early Monday that Trump has been making calls to “allies outside the White House about replacing Ross.”

The White House declined to comment on Monday. Trump is set to have a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

On Friday, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigned amid fresh scrutiny of his handling of a sex abuse case when he was a federal prosecutor in Florida more than a decade ago. Trump, who had supported the labor secretary amid calls for him to resign, said it was Acosta’s decision to step down.

Late on Friday, Trump said he disagreed with the findings of a Commerce Department investigation that found uranium imports threaten to impair U.S. national security and instead ordered a 90-day review by federal agencies, saying “a fuller analysis of national security considerations with respect to the entire nuclear fuel supply chain is necessary.”"

Tfue earns more playing Fortnite than Trump does as president,https://www.pcgamesn.com,['Ali Jones'],,,,https://www.pcgamesn.com/fortnite/tfue-earnings?amp,"For the vast majority of us, pursuing a career in politics is likely to be a little more lucrative than trying to make money through videogames. For a select few, however, it turns out that esports are an avenue to making more money than presidents and prime ministers.

Earlier this week, Techguided released a study comparing the competitive income of the 500 most successful esports players to the salary of their respective heads of state. And while plenty of presidents seem to be pretty well-off, their salaries can sometimes pale in comparison to the winnings of their country’s most lucrative esports stars.

In fact, in 70% of countries studied, players took home more than their presidents. Finnish Dota 2 player Jerax’s total career earnings came to $2.3 million in 2018, while his President, Sauli Niinistö, earns just $141,367. It would seem that getting a good performance at a Dota 2 International helps a lot. Dota players dominate the list, with China’s Somnus丶M earning nearly 500 times more than president Xi Jinping.

In fact, of the 20 countries featured in Techguided’s infographic, 80% of the top-earning players are veterans of Valve’s MOBA. That’s a trend that’s likely to continue into 2019, as the prize pool for the 2019 competition is already nearing $30 million, far more than the total achieved last year, which catapulted many of these players onto the list.

The only thing likely to disrupt proceedings in 2019 is the Fortnite World Cup. The winner of that competition will take home $3 million by themselves, which would see them far ahead of Jerax’s career total.

Fortnite has already made its way onto the list, however, as the USA’s Turner ‘Tfue’ Tenney’s 2018 winnings of $478,000 are just a little more than Donald Trump’s $400,000 presidential salary. Given that Tfue has already announced his retirement from competitive Fortnite and US presidents earn their salary (and then some) for life, however, I don’t imagine that particular feat will be repeated next year. I’d also imagine that several of these heads of state aren’t wholly reliant on their salaries – looking at you, Putin…"
DHS inspector general confirms investigation into leaked ICE raids,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-confirms-investigation-into-leaked-ice-raids,"The Department of Homeland Security's independent Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement to call off a nationwide operation, according to the federal agency.

“Last month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) became aware of an apparent leak related to a planned enforcement operation. Leaks of law enforcement sensitive information jeopardize the safety of ICE officers and agents who have sworn an oath to uphold the law. ICE referred the incident to its Office of Professional Responsibility, which, in accordance with its normal procedures, referred it to the DHS Office of Inspector General,"" ICE said in a statement issued Monday morning.

The Washington Examiner was first to report on Friday that then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team had reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak.

""Everyone knows who they are investigating. Why didn't the acting secretary call for an investigation?"" a senior official told the Washington Examiner on Monday.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak. These sources charged he wanted to sabotage ICE’s months-long plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham two weeks ago, but last Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which Border Patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE carried out raids nationwide this past weekend, though reports suggested they were not of the magnitude anticipated."

"Huawei, Still on Commerce Department Blacklist, Reportedly Planning U.S. Layoffs",https://gizmodo.com,"['Tom Mckay', 'About The Author', '... An Upperclassman Who Had Been Researching Terrorist Groups Online.', '- Washington Post']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/huawei-still-on-commerce-department-blacklist-reporte-1836359551,"Photo: Andy Wong (AP)

Chinese tech firm Huawei is planning on laying off hundreds of U.S. workers after landing on a Commerce Department blacklist that has savaged its ability to do business stateside, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.



The layoffs are expected to hit Futurewei Technologies, a Huawei research and development unit with divisions in California, Texas, and Washington state that employs roughly 850 people, per the Journal. Sources told the paper that hundreds of jobs are expected to be lost, although some Chinese nationals are “being given the option of returning home and staying with the company”:

Futurewei employees have faced restrictions communicating with colleagues in Huawei’s home offices in China following the May 16 Commerce Department decision to put Huawei on its so-called entity list, which blocked companies from supplying U.S.-sourced technology to Huawei without a license, according to these people. Several employees have already been notified of their dismissal, while additional planned cuts could be announced soon, these people said.

In May, the Trump administration added Huawei and 68 affiliates to an “entity list” that restricted transfers of U.S. technology to the company without government approval amid warnings from the intelligence community that the company, the world’s largest telecommunications gear supplier, could be acting as a proxy for Chinese espionage agencies. Other U.S. moves against Huawei have included allegations of trade theft, fraud, and violations of sanctions on Iran—all of this occurring alongside a brewing U.S.-China trade war that has resulted in economic damage to both sides. Huawei obviously denies the allegations and claims that the U.S. is resorting to unfair trade practices because it is outcompeting American firms.

While Donald Trump recently said after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, that he would relax sanctions on Huawei, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has clarified that the department would only issue licenses where “there is no threat to U.S. national security.” Huawei chairman Liang Hua recently told reporters in Shenzen, China that there has not been “any tangible change” to the situation. According to the Journal, the U.S. layoffs are in part because Futurewei’s R&D efforts “could amount to U.S.-sourced technology under Huawei’s entity listing,” and its ability to coordinate with its ownership in China has been seriously damaged.

Huawei Chairman Ren Zhengfei has also said that the company stands to lose $30 billion in revenue in 2019 and 2020 due to the restrictions, which have caused many American suppliers to sever ties and damaged the viability of its product lineup (including the cancellation of a new model of laptop and forcing it to quickly develop an alternative to Google’s official Android mobile OS). According to the Journal, Ren told a French newspaper that its own mobile OS, dubbed Hongmeng, was originally designed for use in telecom networks and “we don’t have a clear plan yet” for populating it with apps.
