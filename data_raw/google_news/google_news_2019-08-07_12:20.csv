Joaquin Castro doubles down amid backlash over tweeting names of Trump donors,https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/joaquin-castro-trump-donors-1450672,"Rep. Joaquin Castro had tweeted out a graphic revealing financial supporters of President Donald Trump, to the consternation of his Republican colleagues. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images 2020 elections Joaquin Castro doubles down amid backlash over tweeting names of Trump donors

Joaquin Castro, a Democratic congressman from Texas and chairman of the presidential campaign of his twin brother, Julián, fired back on Tuesday after being castigated on social media for tweeting the names and occupations of his constituents who’d maxed out their donations to President Donald Trump.

His tweet contained a graphic titled “Who’s funding Trump?” and listed the names of 44 people who purportedly contributed the maximum amount allowed by campaign finance laws. Their occupations, which, like donor names, are public record, were also listed. Close to a dozen of the donors shown are retirees.

“Sad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump,” Castro wrote, naming local businesses whose owners were on the list. “Their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as ‘invaders.’”

The graphic, which Castro indicated had originated with a Democratic activist group, was blasted out to the more than 27,000 followers of his congressional campaign account on Tuesday afternoon. It came as politicians’ loaded rhetoric has come under closer scrutiny after a mass shooting over the weekend in El Paso that killed 22 and wounded dozens of others. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, which mirrored language used by the suspected shooter in a racist manifesto, has loomed over the tragedy in the days since.

Several GOP congressional leaders rebuked their colleague on Tuesday.

“Targeting and harassing Americans because of their political beliefs is shameful and dangerous. What happened to ‘when they go low, we go high?’” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted, referring to former first lady Michelle Obama’s viral mantra. “Or does that no longer matter when your brother is polling at 1%? Americans deserve better.”

Steve Scalise, the House minority whip, who was gravely wounded two years ago when a gunman targeting Republicans opened fire on GOP lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game, said he knows personally how dangerous such moves could be.

“People should not be personally targeted for their political views. Period,” he tweeted. “This isn’t a game. It’s dangerous, and lives are at stake.”

He added: “I know this firsthand.”

Castro was pummeled by some on social media, like the Trump 2020 campaign's communications director, Tim Murtaugh, who said there is a double standard and Castro’s naming and shaming would invite harassment or, worse, violence against private citizens. Murtaugh accused Castro of blasting out a “target list.”

Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, whom Castro had once been rumored to challenge for his seat, called the tweet “grossly inappropriate” and assailed what he called a dangerous “win-at-all-costs mentality.” The move is “not what Texans have a right to expect from their members of Congress,” he wrote.

Castro responded with a flurry of defensive tweets to Murtaugh and journalists who had criticized him.

The graphic didn’t contain “private or personal info — no addresses or phone #, etc,"" he wrote. ""It’s publicly reported info printed in newspapers routinely from the @nyt to the @dcexaminer. You know that.”

He also doubled down on the initial sentiment, saying the Trump campaign “has stoked fear of brown-skinned immigrants.” Castro also pointed out that the campaign had used donor money to pay for more than 2,000 ads on Facebook echoing the anti-immigrant language used by the El Paso suspect.

“That is truly dangerous for millions,” Castro added. “Will you commit not to run another ad like that?”"
NBC News contributor raises suspicions over Trump's order to fly US flags half-staff until Aug. 8,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Lukas Mikelionis', 'Lukas Mikelionis Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nbc-news-trump-order-flags-halfstaff-homage-adolf-hitler,"NBC News contributor Frank Figliuzzi said Tuesday that President Trump’s decision to fly American flags half-staff until Aug. 8-- in response to the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings-- could be seen by white supremacists as a nod to Adolf Hitler.

Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, made the claim during an MSNBC broadcast with Brian Williams. Trump issued the order on Sunday “as a mark of solemn respect” for the victims of the shootings.

TRUMP TO VISIT EL PASO MASS SHOOTING SITE, IN SPITE OF DEMS' WARNING TO STAY AWAY

“The president’s either getting really good advice and rejecting it, or he’s getting really bad advice,"" he said. ""We have to understand the adversary and the threat we’re dealing with, and if we don’t understand how they think we’ll never understand how to counter them, so it’s the little things and the language and messaging that matters.

“The president says that we will fly our flags at half-mast until August 8, that’s 8/8. Now I’m not going to imply that he did this deliberately, but I am using it as an example of the ignorance of the adversary that’s being demonstrated by the White House,” Figliuzzi continued. “The numbers 8/8 are very significant in the neo-Nazi and the white supremacy movement. Why? Because the letter ‘H’ is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and to them, the numbers 8/8 stand for ‘Heil Hitler.""

“So we’re going to be raising the flag back up at dusk on 8/8. No one’s thinking about this. No one’s giving the advice, or he’s rejecting the advice,” he added.

TRUMP CONDEMNS ‘WHITE SUPREMACY,’ CALLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND GUN REFORMS AFTER DOUBLE MASS SHOOTINGS

Trump made remarks Monday condemning white supremacy and called for reforms at the intersection of mental health and gun laws, including so-called ""red flag laws"" to take guns from those deemed a public risk.

“Our nation is overcome with shock, horror and sorrow,” Trump said, in solemn remarks from the White House. “We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil.”

The president also condemned white supremacy, responding to reports that the shooter in El Paso wrote a racist manifesto.

Trump Campaign Ad Features QAnon Signs,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Will Sommer'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-campaign-ad-features-qanon-signs,"Two signs promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory are visible in a video from Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, marking the latest link between the president and followers of the fringe movement that the FBI recently described as a potential source of domestic terror.

The signs, which were first noticed by Vox reporter Aaron Rupar, appear in a close-up shot in a “Women for Trump” video posted by Trump’s campaign late in July. Around halfway into the video, the first sign appears, with Trump’s “Keep America Great” slogan and a “Q” taped onto it. Another shows “Q”’s replacing the O’s on a “Women for Trump” sign.

The inclusion of the signs in the campaign video could be entirely accidental, as Trump rallies have become prominent gathering spots for believers in the QAnon conspiracy, making it harder to grab footage from the rallies that do not include such images. At a Trump rally last week, for example, a warm-up speaker recited a QAnon slogan during his speech. But the campaign video will, nevertheless, be likely interpreted by the Q community as a cryptic acknowledgement by Trump that their beliefs are real.

The Trump campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear if the ad is being broadcast on TV or is merely an online spot. Total viewership for it on YouTube was just above 7,000 at the time of publication, suggesting it has not been widely seen.

QAnon believers follow ludicrous clues posted online by an anonymous figure named “Q,” who they claim offers proof that Trump is engaged in a secret war against an evil cabal of high-ranking pedophiles and cannibals. QAnon supporters claim to be nonviolent, even though a core part of the conspiracy theory is based around the idea of Trump sending top Democrats to face military tribunals and executions in Guantanamo Bay. QAnon believers have been charged in two murders, and an FBI document published last week described QAnon and other conspiracy theories as a possible source of domestic terrorism.

QAnon believers have been eager in the past to jump on anything they perceive as a potential nod of support from Trump’s campaign. In July, Trump praised a baby wearing an improvised QAnon onesie during a speech. Conspiracy theorists soon identified the baby, dubbed “QBaby,” as QAnon’s new mascot, and saw Trump mentioning the baby as proof that their conspiracy theory is real."

Exclusive: Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State Department,https://www.politico.com,['Ted Hesson'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/visa-denials-poor-mexicans-trump-1637094,"Data from Mike Pompeo’s State Department data suggests Mexican immigrants could be one of the groups most affected by the Trump administration’s public charge regulation. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo employment & immigration Exclusive: Visa denials to poor Mexicans skyrocket under Trump’s State Department The numbers offer a window into how the Homeland Security Department's forthcoming public charge regulation could reshape the legal immigration system.

The number of Mexicans refused immigrant visas to the U.S. because they might become dependent on government benefits skyrocketed under President Donald Trump, according to State Department data obtained by POLITICO.

Between Oct. 1 and July 29, the State Department denied 5,343 immigrant visa applications for Mexican nationals on the grounds that the applicants were so poor or infirm that they risked becoming a “public charge,” according to the statistics. That’s up from just seven denials for Mexican applicants in fiscal year 2016, the last full year under former President Barack Obama.

Story Continued Below

The number of public charge denials for applicants from all nations also rose during the past year. Preliminary data obtained by POLITICO shows 12,179 visa rejections on public charge grounds through July 29 — which puts the department on pace to surpass last year’s total. The State Department disqualified only 1,033 people on public charge grounds in fiscal 2016.

Public charge denials have increased in recent years as the State Department has issued fewer immigrant visas overall. Immigrant visas are the first step toward permanent residence in the U.S.

Consular officers approved roughly 534,000 immigrant visas in fiscal year 2018, down from 618,000 two years earlier.

Refused visa applicants are permitted to submit additional evidence to prove their economic self-sufficiency, but the statistics show that only 1,330 Mexican immigrants who applied in previous years reversed a public charge ruling during that period.

Applicants from various other countries — including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti and the Dominican Republic — also saw dramatic increases in denials attributed to the risk that they would consume government benefits.

The State Department statistics offer a window into how the Homeland Security Department's forthcoming public charge regulation could reshape the legal immigration system. Under the regulation, which is expected to be finalized in the coming days, DHS will adopt a more aggressive public charge analysis to evaluate applications for green cards and visa renewals.

Under the DHS rule, consideration would be given not only to whether an applicant was so poor that they were likely to receive certain U.S. government benefits, but also to whether the applicant received these benefits already.

“It is imposing a tougher standard for working-class people,” said Charles Wheeler, a director with the pro-migrant Catholic Legal Immigration Network.

Wheeler added that the regulation mirrors Trump’s efforts to pass legislation that would reduce legal immigration and favor skilled workers over immigrants with family connections. A Trump-backed Senate bill along those lines drew few supporters in 2017.

The State Department data suggests that Mexican immigrants could be one of the groups most affected by the public charge regulation. Trump has faced Democratic criticism in recent days over his anti-immigrant and anti-Mexican rhetoric following a mass shooting in El Paso that killed 22 people, including eight Mexican citizens. Authorities have investigated whether the suspect posted a racist manifesto online that warned of a “Hispanic invasion of Texas.” The language echoed Trump’s own repeated comments about an immigrant “invasion” at the southwest border.

poster=""https://static.politico.com/a8/31/34cb22964e9a9e8e68ceb0de44ae/dems-guncontrol.png"" true

The State Department visa denials were based on statutory language dating to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act (later reaffirmed in 1952 in the Red Scare-inspired McCarren-Walter Act) that says immigrants and visitors to the United States can be turned away if they’re likely to become a public charge after admission. The phrase ""public charge"" isn’t defined in the relevant statutes, but guidance issued in 1999 said it applied to people who were primarily dependent — or likely to become primarily dependent — on cash assistance or long-term, institutionalized care.

The Trump administration is expected to finalize a regulation in the coming days that would expand that definition.

Based on a proposed version released in October, the new standard would consider the use of food stamps, welfare, Medicaid, prescription drug subsidies or Section 8 housing vouchers to make a public charge determination. Immigrants could be denied green cards based on the use of those benefits, or if they were deemed likely to use them in the future.

DHS calculated at the time that roughly 382,000 people seeking to become lawful permanent residents could be subjected to a public charge review each year. The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute estimated that an additional 559,000 people annually could be scrutinized on public charge grounds when applying for immigrant visas from consulates abroad.

People with temporary visas could also be denied for possible benefit use. DHS said in its draft regulation that roughly 518,000 foreigners with non-immigrant visas seeking to extend their stay each year would be required to demonstrate that they haven’t received benefits.

Pro-migrant advocates argue the measure’s reach will be broader, partly because of a chilling effect on immigrant families.

Even while the DHS public charge regulation remained under development, the State Department forged ahead last year with related changes to its public charge standard.

In January 2018, the department revised its Foreign Affairs Manual — which is known to consular officers as the “FAM” — to toughen the guidelines around what triggers a public charge determination for immigrant visa applicants overseas.

Immigration: DACA Illegal Entry The Wall

Specifically, the department reduced the weight of an affidavit of support that many U.S. sponsors must provide to demonstrate that an applicant will not become a taxpayer burden. The new guidance stated that the affidavit should be considered only one factor in a broader test to determine whether a person might use cash assistance or require long-term, institutionalized care.

An affidavit of support previously would have been sufficient to override most public charge determinations, according to immigration lawyers and advocates. But the changes gave a “green light” to State Department officials with more restrictionist views, according to David Strashnoy, a former State Department consular officer.

“It basically opens the door for all sorts of egregious decision-making,” he said.

Following the revision, the number of visa denials based on public charge grounds spiked.

The State Department rejected 12,973 immigrant visa applications over public charge concerns in fiscal 2018, according to the latest statistics. The department turned down just 3,209 applications on those grounds in fiscal 2017 and a mere 1,033 in fiscal 2016.

The 2018 changes to the Foreign Affairs Manual also provided more detailed instructions for how consular officers should consider an applicant’s age, health, family status, financial resources, education and skills when making a public charge determination. Immigration lawyers and advocates contend that changes increased the burden on the applicant.

In addition, the department added new language to the manual tightening standards for applicants to the diversity visa lottery program. The program — a frequent Trump target — offers 50,000 visas annually to immigrants from countries with low levels of immigration to the U.S.

The new provision said consular officers “should review the totality of the [diversity visa] applicant’s circumstances … to determine his ability to become or remain self-sufficient in the United States.”

The statistics obtained by POLITICO include per-country breakdowns of denials that previously were not available to the public. The dataset varies slightly from public charge denials posted in the State Department’s annual visa report. The discrepancy is due to a new department methodology that subtracts any immigrants who overcame a public charge determination in that fiscal year from the annual total.

Several immigration lawyers told POLITICO that they had dealt with Mexican clients — some of them long-term U.S. residents but undocumented immigrants — stranded in Mexico because they were denied immigrant visas on public charge grounds.

While Mexico saw the steepest rise in public charge rejections, the number of public charge denials also shot up for visa applications from several other countries.

The State Department denied 1,254 Indian immigrant visa applications in fiscal 2018, a sharp increase over the 268 denials the year before. No Indian applicants were denied on public charge grounds in fiscal 2016, according to the data obtained by POLITICO.

The trend appeared to cool in the first 10 months of fiscal 2019, with only 129 public charge refusals to Indian applicants.

Applicants from Bangladesh and Pakistan experienced a similar increase in denials.

The State Department refused 1,502 Bangladeshi immigrant visa applicants in fiscal 2018. Consular statistics show no Bangladeshi denials in fiscal 2016. The department turned away 1,246 Pakistani immigrant visa applicants that year, an increase over just two denials in fiscal 2016.

Applicants from Haiti and the Dominic Republic, countries that sit side-by-side on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, also saw public charge rejections shoot up.

The State Department turned away 1,109 Haitian immigrant visa applicants in fiscal 2018, after no denials two years earlier.

Applicants from the Dominic Republic saw 1,012 immigrant visa denials through the first 10 months of fiscal 2019, up from a single rejection in fiscal 2016.

Some countries experienced little change. Only three Canadian immigrant visa applicants were refused on public charge grounds in fiscal 2018. A single applicant from that country was denied in fiscal 2016."
DOJ takes Trump's side in House subpoena fight,https://www.cnn.com,"['Katelyn Polantz', 'Jeremy Herb']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/mazars-justice-department-house-subpoena-trump-financial-records/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department took President Donald Trump's side in an ongoing subpoena fight between the President's private legal team and House Democrats.

The Justice Department is wading into one of the ongoing court battles between Trump as a private citizen and lawmakers, which Trump has so far lost, in an attempt to stop a congressional subpoena for his financial records.

""The House's lack of responsibility is sufficient reason for this Court to declare this subpoena invalid,"" the Justice Department wrote on Tuesday.

In this case, Trump had sued to stop the House Oversight Committee from subpoenaing the accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of his personal and business financial records and other documents. He is not represented by the Justice Department in the case.

A federal district judge ruled against the President , rejecting his attempt to block the committee's subpoena and asserting that Congress is well within its authority to investigate the President.

China responds to US after Treasury designates Beijing a 'currency manipulator',https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/trade-war-china-responds-to-us-after-claim-of-being-a-currency-manipulator.html,"China's central bank has firmly rejected the U.S. Treasury's designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator, saying the accusation has ""seriously"" undermined the international financial order and risked further market turmoil.

The response from the People's Bank of China comes at a time of rapidly intensifying trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

On Monday, the U.S. Treasury accused Beijing of deliberately influencing the exchange rate between the yuan and the U.S. dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade.""

The move fulfills President Donald Trump's promise to recognize China as a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.

The announcement followed a sharp drop in the yuan against the dollar, with the Chinese currency breaching the 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008. A drop in a currency's value makes that country's products cheaper on the international market.

""The United States disregards the facts and unreasonably affixes China with the label of 'currency manipulators,' which is a behavior that harms others and oneself,"" the PBOC said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Chinese side firmly opposes this.""

The PBOC said it would not only ""seriously undermine the international financial order, but also trigger financial market turmoil. It will also greatly hinder international trade and the global economic recovery, and ultimately will suffer from it.""

China's central bank set the yuan's official reference point at stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-the-dollar point on Tuesday.

The move appeared to calm financial markets, initially rocked by fears the U.S.-China trade war was devolving into a currency war.

Late last week, China promised to fight back after Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had not been hit with U.S. duties."
Trump administration freezes foreign aid funds pending review,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Nicole Gaouette']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/omb-state-department-usaid-letter/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration has put a temporary hold on the majority of congressionally approved foreign aid funds, pending a review by the State Department and the US Agency for International Development.

The Office of Management and Budget informed the two agencies in a letter Saturday that unobligated funds would be frozen until ""three business days after"" State and USAID provide an accounting of how much remains in specific accounts and how the funds are being spent. Those funds expire on September 30, the end of the fiscal year.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was out of the country when the letter, addressed to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, was sent. Congress was on recess.

A USAID official told CNN the funding amounts to between $2 billion and $4 billion.

The accounts specified in the letter include funding for international organizations, international peacekeeping, international narcotics control and law enforcement, global health, development assistance, foreign military and assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia.

The Washington Post was the first to report on the letter.

A senior administration official told CNN that ""if an agency can't even tell us how much money is in the account, I have no confidence in their ability to tell me where the money is going to go to.""

Based on the responses from the agencies, OMB may propose to Congress canceling the appropriated funds, which is known as rescission, or reprogramming them.

The USAID official told CNN that ""it is pretty clear they will try to rescind the money."" That official noted that OMB made a similar attempt last year but Congress rejected the move.

The review will take several days, the official said, and it is expected that the tally will be sent to OMB by early next week at the latest. However, the official noted that if OMB decides to maintain the freeze in an effort to cancel any of the foreign aid, it could take a while to get the funding streams open because it would require action from Congress.

""It'll be a long process,"" said the official.

A senior administration official told CNN that ""the accounts that are being looked at include programs that many over the years have considered wasteful like ones that would pay for solar panels in the Caribbean, a space program in Pakistan, soccer camps in Guatemala, and foreign aid to countries that aren't in the best interest of US foreign policy.""

Liz Schrayer, the president of the US Global Leadership Council, condemned OMB's action as ""reckless and irresponsible.""

""These are programs that are in our interest,"" she told CNN. ""If we take ourselves off the playing field, we do it at our own peril. These are programs that we are using to advance our economic and our security interests and I think it is really surprising that the administration is pulling back on what is less than 1% of our entire budget when there are such great threats in the world.""

The State Department and USAID referred CNN to OMB for comment.

""It is incumbent on all Federal agencies to properly use funds provided by Congress. In an effort to ensure accountability, OMB has requested the current status of several foreign assistance accounts to identify the amount of funding that is unobligated. On behalf of American taxpayers, OMB has an obligation to ensure their money is being used wisely,"" OMB spokesperson Rachel Semmel said in a statement."
Justice Department files amicus brief in Mazars case shielding Trump from House subpoena.,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/justice-department-mazars-subpoena-trump-barr.html,"Attorney General William Barr speaks at the International Conference on Cyber Security at Fordham University School of Law on July 23 in New York City. Drew Angerer/Getty Images

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice filed a disgraceful amicus brief urging a federal appeals court to block the House of Representatives’ subpoena of the president’s financial records. There is no clear purpose for the brief other than a blatantly partisan effort to shield Trump from congressional oversight. It is a startling departure from the DOJ’s traditional independence and another sign that Attorney General William Barr views his job as running interference for the president.

Donald Trump’s lawyers—his personal attorneys, not the DOJ—have been fighting this subpoena since the House Oversight Committee issued it in April. The committee sought eight years of financial records from Mazars USA, which provided accounting services to Trump. Congress has broad constitutional authority to investigate the president, and the Supreme Court has held that the judiciary must honor any subpoena with a “legitimate legislative purpose.” Trump’s lawyers argue that the committee’s subpoena lacks such a purpose, and was merely intended to “harass” the president. In its amicus brief, the Justice Department parrots this argument, framing the House’s subpoena as an effort to torment Trump by inspecting his finances for political gain.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected that argument in May. Mehta noted that the committee chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, had provided a memorandum detailing a number of legitimate reasons for the subpoena. Cummings wrote that the committee sought to learn whether Trump “accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics” so it could determine “whether reforms are necessary to address deficiencies with current laws.” The committee also wished to discover whether Trump “has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions.”

The House has already passed an ethics bill, H.R. 1, this year with provisions aimed directly at the executive. Lawmakers plainly have a “legitimate legislative purpose,” Mehta wrote, in probing the president’s ethics to decide whether these reforms are necessary and sufficient. Moreover, the committee wished to know “whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office.” It “is simply not fathomable,” Mehta wrote, “that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct—past or present—even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.”

Finally, the committee sought to learn whether Trump had complied with the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars the president from accepting any gift from a foreign government without Congress’ consent. “Surely,” Mehta wrote, “incident to Congress’s authority to consent to the President’s receipt of Emoluments is the power to investigate the President’s compliance with the Clause.”

Trump’s lawyers promptly appealed Mehta’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A panel of judges for the D.C. Circuit is currently mulling whether Mehta got it right.

The Justice Department had no reason to step in; Trump is amply represented by his own attorneys, and this matter does not require the defense of some federal law. To the contrary, the DOJ typically sits out such interbranch disputes, and it has no obvious interest in siding with the president against Congress here.

But the DOJ filed an amicus brief anyway—weeks after oral arguments at the D.C. Circuit—and it is flabbergasting. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that courts may not search for some covert illicit motive among committee members; if the committee states a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the judiciary must respect it. The DOJ ignores this rule. It argues that the House’s actions raise “the specter that members of the Legislative Branch are impermissibly attempting to interfere with or harass the Head of the Executive Branch.” And it calls for a “searching evaluation” of committee members’ motives.

The DOJ argues that Cummings’ memorandum justifying the subpoena is “insufficient” because it was “not ratified by the full House.” It cites no authority for this proposition because it is made-up; the Supreme Court has never held that a committee’s subpoena is invalid until ratified by the full chamber. But even if that were the law, the DOJ has a problem: The full House already ratified the Mazars subpoena. In response to this fact, the DOJ claims that the House’s vote doesn’t count because “it did so only as part of a general authorization for pending and future investigations.” There is no precedent to support the argument that the House must ratify a subpoena with some unknown level of specificity; it is a blatant exercise in moving the goalposts. The DOJ is attempting to throw new roadblocks in front of the committee on the basis of its own pseudo-constitutional beliefs.

But that’s not even the strangest part of the brief. The DOJ insists that the House cannot investigate Trump pursuant to its impeachment authority. Why? Because it hasn’t asserted “jurisdiction over” impeachment. In other words, the House’s constitutional power of impeachment lies dormant until someone declares an intent to impeach. Who, exactly, holds this mystical authority? A committee chair? The speaker? A majority of lawmakers, shouting in unison? Who knows? The DOJ does not say when the impeachment power officially kicks in, because it has concocted this rule out of thin air. Maybe Mehta was on to something when he wrote that it “is simply not fathomable” that the Constitution could (silently) limit the impeachment power so arbitrarily.

Ironically, the DOJ ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to.

The DOJ brief fares no better in its dismissal of Congress’ authority over emoluments. Again, the Constitution explicitly bars the president from accepting gifts from foreign states without Congress’ consent. But the DOJ argues that this power does not justify the subpoena because there’s no proof the House “is investigating the President with a view toward consenting to any undisclosed emoluments.”

That is a lie. Cummings’ memorandum expressly stated that the House sought “to assess whether [Trump] is complying with the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution.” If that weren’t enough—and it is—Cummings is also investigating Trump International Hotel to determine whether it grants Trump unconstitutional emoluments. Recognizing, perhaps, that the courts cannot rigorously scrutinize a committee’s stated intentions, the DOJ has chosen to pretend the committee never stated those intentions in the first place.

Most gallingly, the DOJ urges the court to reject the legitimacy of the House’s legislative purpose by preemptively declaring its legislation unconstitutional. The DOJ writes that H.R. 1 and similar proposals do not deserve any “presumption of legitimacy” because they are probably illegal. It claims that the Constitution bars Congress from forcing the president to divest from his conflicts of interest. Thus, the House cannot investigate Trump to help it craft ethics reforms, since those reforms are unconstitutional.

This argument is astonishing. Federal courts are forbidden from issuing advisory opinions on the constitutionality of pending legislation. A bill cannot be challenged in federal court if it is just a bill; this is Schoolhouse Rock stuff. Yet the DOJ is essentially asking the judiciary to declare a provision of H.R. 1 unconstitutional before it becomes law. This vast expansion of judicial power would constitute an advisory opinion on steroids. The courts would be obligated to gauge the legality of bills under consideration in Congress every time they are asked to quash a congressional subpoena. That is not and cannot be the law.

Ironically, the DOJ’s amicus brief winds up making the opposite argument it intends to. The Supreme Court curtails the judiciary’s ability to quash congressional subpoenas for a reason. Once courts start inspecting lawmakers’ motives, they become entangled in the legislative process. It is not the job of judges to decide whether the House really needed to issue a subpoena; once a committee stated a “legitimate legislative purpose,” the courts must butt out. Otherwise, judges will wind up curbing Congress’ constitutional powers and effectively killing legislation before it passes. The judiciary is ill-equipped to determine just how much information lawmakers require to govern effectively.

Still, counterproductive as the DOJ’s brief may be, it reveals the full extent of the department’s distortion under Barr. The Justice Department represents the United States, not the president himself, and it has no business putting its thumb on the scale of Trump in his fight against Congress. Barr may see the office of the attorney general as an outpost of the White House. He may see himself as a loyal foot soldier for Trump in his squabble with Democrats. But the Justice Department was never intended to be a weapon for presidents to wield against their political opponents. Tuesday’s brief degrades the institution, eroding its legitimacy for purely partisan goals."
The Real Cost of Trump’s Trade Wars by Daniel Gros,https://www.project-syndicate.org,"['Daniel Gros', 'Ian Buruma', 'Kenneth Rogoff', 'Kevin Rudd', 'Ramesh Thakur', 'Raghuram G. Rajan', 'Robert J. Barro', 'Zhang Jun', 'Amin Saikal', 'Ana Palacio']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-by-daniel-gros-2019-08,"Economic analysis suggests that bilateral trade wars are unwinnable in an interconnected world. By firing his latest tariff salvo against China, US President Donald Trump has further raised the stakes in an increasingly damaging dispute – and America is likely to emerge as the bigger loser.

BRUSSELS – For a while at least, trade tensions between the United States and China seemed to have settled into a “new normal.” After both countries imposed high tariffs on a substantial proportion of each other’s goods, US President Donald Trump refrained from further escalation. But, following another inconclusive round of bilateral trade talks in Shanghai last week, Trump announced that the US will impose 10% tariffs on a further $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, effective September 1.

Should this new measure take effect, almost all US imports from China will be subject to tariffs. (The US already levies 25% tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports.) Although the US has also imposed non-tariff barriers in its trade war with China, reciprocal tariffs are the most visible component of the dispute – and are likely to hurt America more than China.

One way to compare the restrictiveness of countries’ trade policies is to look at their average tariff rates. For the US, this seems to paint a fairly reassuring picture. Before Trump took office, the average US tariff rate on industrial imports was about 2%, somewhat lower than that of China.

Even under Trump, this figure has (so far) not increased that much. Imports from China account for about one-quarter of all US imports, and the 25% tariff affects about one-half of imported Chinese goods. This implies that the average US import tariff has increased by about three percentage points, to 5% or so, which does not appear excessive.

But the average tariff is a misleading indicator. Economic theory suggests that tariffs have disproportionately negative effects on the welfare of consumers and producers. A doubling of a tariff, for example, will lead to more than double the welfare loss. A 25% tariff on a limited share of trade is thus much more serious than an average tariff of 3%.

Many countries have high import tariffs on a certain number of specific products, with a rate above 15% usually considered to be a “tariff peak.” But whereas these peaks apply to less than 1% of total imports for most industrialized countries, they cover a far larger share of US imports.

Moreover, Trump’s tariffs discriminate against China: the 25% tariff is paid only by Chinese producers, not by their European, Latin American, or Asian competitors. Such a country-specific tariff is equivalent to levying a general tariff on all imports while providing a production subsidy for competing producers outside China – with this subsidy paid by US consumers in the form of higher prices.

Because non-Chinese producers can raise their prices by up to 25% and still remain competitive in the US, prices for American consumers are likely to increase on a wide range of goods. The indirect effect of Trump’s China tariffs on consumer prices is therefore likely to be much greater than the recent estimate of a direct impact of only 0.1%. These indirect harmful consequences of country-specific tariffs are the main reason why the “most favored nation” principle has long been a cornerstone of the global trading system.

Moreover, preliminary studies suggest that Chinese producers have not significantly lowered their prices as a result of Trump’s tariffs. And even if they did, the small gain to US consumers from lower Chinese prices would likely be far outweighed by higher prices on competing imports diverted to the US market by Trump’s country-specific tariffs.

Although China previously imposed a reciprocal 25% tariff on many of its imports from the US, the negative impact on the Chinese economy is likely to be limited because US goods account for less than one-tenth of China’s overall imports. Chinese retaliatory tariffs thus have a small impact on the Chinese economy. And China has actually lowered tariffs on its imports from the rest of the world.

Moreover, a large share of China’s imports from the US consists of agricultural commodities such as soybeans, which the country could easily import at a similar price from Brazil if necessary. The US would then presumably export more soybeans to markets formerly served by Brazilian producers, including in Europe. (This would reduce America’s trade deficit with Europe and might ease US pressure on the European Union in that regard.)

The US has also ratcheted up non-tariff barriers as part of its aggressive trade policy toward China. Most notably, Trump has put Chinese tech giant Huawei on the list of entities to which US firms are forbidden to sell American products. True, Trump has also said that for the time being, US suppliers should obtain the necessary licenses to continue to supply Huawei. But from now on, US technology companies will clearly think twice before entering long-term contracts with Huawei or other prominent Chinese firms that might be at risk of being included on the “entities list.”

In parallel, China’s government and businesses will redouble their efforts to become independent from the US in sourcing key technological components. The mere threat of the entities list will henceforth act as a significant hidden barrier to US-China trade. And because this barrier is also discriminatory (directed only at China), it will have the same high costs as country-specific tariffs.

Economic analysis suggests that bilateral trade wars are unwinnable in an interconnected world. By firing his latest tariff salvo against China, Trump has further raised the stakes in an increasingly damaging dispute. And America is likely to emerge as the bigger loser."
Agent fired over anti-Trump text messages sues FBI,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Eric Tucker']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/08/06/agent-fired-over-anti-trump-text-messages-sues-fbi/23789343/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A veteran FBI agent who wrote derogatory text messages about Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday charging that the bureau caved to ""unrelenting pressure"" from the president when it fired him.

The suit from Peter Strzok also alleges he was unfairly punished for expressing his political opinions, and that the Justice Department violated his privacy when it shared hundreds of his text messages with reporters.

""The campaign to publicly vilify Special Agent Strzok contributed to the FBI's ultimate decision to unlawfully terminate him,"" the lawsuit says, ""as well as to frequent incidents of public and online harassment and threats of violence to Strzok and his family that began when the texts were first disclosed to the media and continue to this day.""

The complaint, which names as defendants Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Chris Wray, revisits a political drama that was seized on by conservative critics of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump. Multiple investigations are underway examining whether the FBI acted properly during the Russia investigation, and Strzok remains a frequent target of Trump's scornful tweets.

Representatives of the FBI and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The suit provides new details about the circumstances of Strzok's firing and amounts to the latest defense of his reputation, coming months after a fiery congressional hearing in which he insisted that his personal views never influenced his work.

Strzok, a veteran counterintelligence agent who helped lead FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, was removed from Mueller's team after the texts with FBI lawyer Lisa Page came to light. He was fired from the FBI last August.

Many of the texts, on FBI cell phones, were bitingly critical of Trump during his 2016 run for office. They were found by the Justice Department's inspector general during its investigation of the FBI's Clinton email probe.

The watchdog office criticized both Strzok and Page, with whom he was having an affair, for their judgment in sending the messages but did not find that the Clinton email investigation was compromised by political bias.

In the lawsuit, Strzok attorney Aitan Goelman says the FBI deputy director who fired him was responding to ""unrelenting pressure from President Trump and his political allies in Congress and the media.""

That deputy, David Bowdich, overruled the recommendation of a disciplinary official that he be merely demoted and suspended without pay and denied him the chance to appeal.

Bowdich said at the time that Strzok's ""sustained pattern of bad judgment in the use of an FBI device"" for texting called into question decisions made during the Clinton email investigation and the early stages of the Russia probe. And the FBI has said that Bowdich, as the FBI's No. 2 official, had the authority to overrule disciplinary findings.

The complaint says the campaign to fire Strzok included ""constant tweets and other disparaging statements"" from Trump, as well as the president's direct appeals to Wray and Barr's predecessor as attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to fire Strzok.

The lawsuit says the administration discriminated against his viewpoint by firing him even though other government officials who have supported Trump in the workplace have kept their job. It notes that the White House has not fired counselor Kellyanne Conway despite the determination that she violated the Hatch Act — a law that limits political activity by government workers — by disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity.

""The Trump administration has consistently tolerated and even encouraged partisan political speech by federal employees, as long as this speech praises President Trump and attacks his political adversaries,"" the complaint contends.

The lawsuit also says the Justice Department set out to smear Strzok's reputation and humiliate him when it disclosed nearly 400 text messages he had sent or received.

In the complaint, Strzok also aims to explain some of the texts that have attracted the most negative attention, including one in which he told Page ""we'll stop"" a Trump presidency.

Conservatives interpreted the text as Strzok saying that he would work to prevent Trump from being elected, but the suit says the message was actually meant to reassure Page that the American people would not support a Trump candidacy.

Trump mistakes Toledo for Dayton, and the mayors take notice"
DHS Official: Trump Can’t Admit ‘This Is Terrorism’,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-official-on-el-paso-and-dayton-trump-cant-admit-this-is-terrorism,"After a weekend of carnage, President Trump said some things that sounded heartening. But current and former law enforcement officials say the president’s words aren’t enough—and they fear it’s all he has to offer.

Thirty-one people were killed between attacks on public places in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in the span of 12 hours this past weekend. While authorities say they have no motive yet for the Dayton attack, officials said the accused El Paso attacker wrote a manifesto justifying the mass murder of Hispanic people to stop their “invasion” of the U.S. Federal prosecutors said they’re considering domestic terrorism charges for the attacker. (Days earlier, a gunman expressing similar racist views killed three people at a food festival in California.)

“This is a clear manifestation of the political discourse that has taken place in the country over the past two years or so,” one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told The Daily Beast. “It cannot be blamed on mental health. This is an ideology-driven hate crime. This is terrorism and the White House has trouble labeling it as such. It is very frustrating.”

In remarks Monday from the White House, the president blamed violent video games and mental health problems for the carnage. He called for the implementation of red flag laws, also known as risk protection orders, that let people petition a judge to have the guns of their friends and family taken away if they worry that person will harm others. He even went so far to say “ our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” —something he has shied away from in the past.

The DHS official called the remarks “demoralizing,” noting the president’s effort to spread the blame around.

Despite the president’s call for reforms, current and former law enforcement officials say they aren’t satisfied. Sources say white supremacy is a significant threat to U.S. national security, and one mention in a 10-minute presidential speech won’t cut it.

“It is a good step to recognize the threat of white supremacy, but words alone cannot solve the problem,” said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who specialized in counterterrorism cases. “Action speaks louder than words. What kind of policy, legislations, designation, and funding is the administration willing to propose, support, and authorize in order to counter this emerging threat? This is where the rubber meets the road.”

Some officials said they put little stock in Trump’s words, worrying that the president would, as in the past, backtrack on his statements on white supremacy.

Others said Trump’s brief condemnation of the ideology meant little following his statements earlier in the day that linked the weekend’s shootings to the need for new immigration legislation—the accused El Paso shooter said immigration was destroying the country.

“I am concerned that white supremacist thought leaders will view his tweet linking immigration reform with background checks as a tacit signal that he still supports their agenda,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “It is mind-boggling he would blend the two issues. I don’t think there is a thorough understanding of the issues at the White House.”

Despite the concern surrounding Trump’s rhetoric on white supremacy, the intelligence community appears to be taking a new, active step in addressing the threat. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is hosting a conference on domestic terrorism with the FBI and DHS next month, according to a person familiar with the plans. An invitation to the event said the conference will scrutinize the federal government’s response to the threat in light of the recent deadly attacks by white supremacists on synagogues in Pennsylvania and California and mosques in New Zealand.

If Trump’s speech was any indication of where the White House plans to focus its efforts following the fatal shootings over the weekend, it seems white supremacy is an afterthought.

The president focused his speech on tracking individuals with mental illnesses.

“Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,” Trump said. “We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement.”

Authorities have not offered evidence that the accused gunmen in El Paso and Dayton were mentally ill. The American Psychological Association said in response to Trump’s remarks: “Blaming mental illness for the gun violence in our country is simplistic and inaccurate and goes against the scientific evidence currently available.”

Trump went on to say that he directed the Department of Justice to work with other law enforcement agencies and social media companies to better detect people he said were mentally ill and liable to kill.

“We must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs,” Trump said.

Federal law enforcement agencies have in the past worked with DHS as well as state and local law enforcement to track people who may endanger others, including veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with criminal pasts. National Security Agency software company Beware at one point let local police departments calculate individuals’ threat levels by collecting things like arrest reports, property records, and social media postings. Meanwhile, the FBI tracks potential terrorist attacks by opening official investigations. Many of those probes have focused on Muslim terrorist suspects following 9/11 and the rise of ISIS.

The only question now, law enforcement officials say, is whether the president will order a crackdown on white supremacist violence.

“The president did what presidents should do, which is condemn bigotry and hatred,” said George Selim, a former DHS official who now works at the Anti-Defamation League. “But what’s needed is resources, strategy, and policy. And the real measure of these horrible atrocities is if the resources, strategy, and policy of the federal government matches the president’s comments today.

“How many lives need to be lost before action is accelerated and the administration works with Congress? The time is now.”"

A probe conducted by the Office of Inspector General questioned whether the department has the budgetary authority to use appropriated funds to move the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture to the Kansas City area. But the report also determined USDA has the legal authority to carry out the relocation, another component of the IG’s review.

The review was launched in November after requests from Democratic lawmakers concerned USDA didn’t adequately explain why the relocation was taking place. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has said the move will bring USDA research closer to farming communities, cut costs and improve recruitment and retention of staff.

The relocation has received significant disapproval from Democrats who have said the move is unjustified and will result in agricultural research getting overlooked and underfunded. Some employees have already begun working in temporary office space in the Kansas City area until USDA secures a permanent, long-term lease. All positions that are being relocated will be transferred by Sept. 30.

The IG‘s report could still help bolster the case of those opposed to the move. The fiscal 2018 omnibus requires USDA to notify the House and Senate appropriations committees at least 30 days before using funds to relocate an office or its employees. The USDA on Aug. 9, 2018 informed Congress of Perdue’s relocation proposal.

In letters to the committees, “the Department mentioned that it would engage private sector assistance in its search for a new location and would be using funds appropriated in the Omnibus Act for its search,” the IG report says.

A section in the spending law also requires USDA to receive approval from Congress before spending money for the relocation, according to the IG report. USDA never received permission from Congress to carry out its plan.

On Oct. 22, 2018, USDA allocated about $169,655 in ERS funds and $169,655 of $6 million in appropriations provided to NIFA for relocation expenses to hire Ernst & Young to review bids from cities vying to host the agencies, according to the report.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the lawmakers who requested the review, said in a joint statement that USDA must halt the relocation until Congress approves the use of funds.

""USDA must follow the law, period,"" the members said. ""It ought not change interpretations when it is convenient for the Administration or the Secretary at any given moment.""

Investigators also said that USDA blew past a 60-day deadline set by Congress to submit a report on how the department intends to use the $6 million in appropriations given to NIFA that were earmarked for relocation expenses. The omnibus was enacted on March 23, 2018, and USDA didn’t notify the committees until August — 139 days later.

As a result, the report concludes that USDA may have also violated the Antideficiency Act, “which prohibits government employees from involving the federal government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made.”

In response to the IG’s report, USDA’s Office of the General Counsel said the department followed the law.

In a memo dated July 19, USDA General Counsel Stephen Vaden said the department is not required to receive permission from Congress for the relocation because it believes the committee approval provisions of the spending law are unconstitutional. Vaden said the department has declined the IG’s recommendation to now seek congressional committee approval of the relocation.

“Thus, the department has complied with applicable law by providing Congress with the notice it called for in appropriations legislation,” the memo states. “USDA is not required to abide by unconstitutional laws.”

A USDA spokesperson said in a statement that the IG's conclusion that the department ""was out of step with budgetary requirements disregards the authority given to the Executive Branch by the U.S. Constitution.""

""Since the Inspector General affirms the Department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is opinion based on policy decisions that have no basis in fact.”

But the IG responded to USDA’s argument that those committee approval provisions have been included in appropriations laws since 2015 and the department has previously considered them binding. The IG said USDA’s “current and prior positions” on the committee approval provisions “are not consistent,” and recommended that the department needs to explain in writing why officials changed their interpretation.

The IG also examined whether USDA has the ability to move ERS under the Office of the Chief Economist. But that consideration is no longer relevant, as Perdue backed off the plan to reshuffle the office.

Additionally, the IG looked into whether USDA abided by procedures for making organizational changes, but found that no established procedures relating to the relocation exist when the change is proposed by the secretary, rather than when agencies request a reorganization.

The report recommended that USDA clarify its established regulation that outlines policies for structural changes within the department."
Interior took notes from FBI while developing controversial FOIA policy,https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456377-interior-took-notes-from-fbi-while-developing-controversial-foia,"The Interior Department took notes from the FBI, which handles reams of classified material and is known as a slower responder to public records requests, while developing its controversial policy for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, according to emails reviewed by The Hill.

Internal emails obtained through a FOIA request by Earthjustice and shared with The Hill show that Interior employees were eager to talk to FBI staff who oversaw FOIA requests as it sought to deal with its own mounting public records requests.

“I understand from my discussions with the US Attorney’s Office in D.C. that the FBI’s FOIA program and strategy in FOIA litigation is pretty much the 'gold standard,’ ” Rachel Spector, an official with Interior’s Office of the Solicitor, wrote to an unnamed FBI official on April 14, 2018.

“Sorry to be so persistent, but we are scrambling to get our arms around a significant surge in FOIA requests and accompanying litigation,” she wrote to another FBI official seeking information on their procedures.

The emails show Interior was particularly interested in the FBI’s “500-page per month policy,” under which the FBI only releases 500 pages of requested material to each requester per month. That rule has routinely been challenged in courts with mixed success by advocacy groups who argue it skirts FOIA law.

The “500-page per month policy” did not become a part of Interior’s new FOIA process, but critics say the discussions show the lengths to which the department went to try to find ways to not have to respond quickly to requests.

“I can’t imagine any reason for adopting the FBI’s approach other than it seems like a slow enough rate for them to be happy with processing records,” said Jeffrey Light, a FOIA specialist attorney.

The emails also show Interior reached out to officials at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) while it was working on its policy.

Both the EPA and Interior in 2018 were actively working to draft new FOIA policies under President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer White Supremacist calls on Trump to stop using fear to motivate people Walmart employee urges workers to strike until the company's stores stop selling guns Biden: Violent video games 'not healthy' but aren't 'in and of itself why we have this carnage' MORE. Interior ultimately submitted its draft policy in December 2018. EPA submitted its finalized policy without a public comment period at the end of June.

An Interior Department official said the policies were drafted in a way to “increase the value of the services we provide to the American people.”

“As part of the Department’s efforts to improve its FOIA program, we consulted other federal agencies to better understand their practices including training, technology, and processing. We are committed to increasing transparency and improving our ability to meet our statutory obligations with an ever-increasing volume of FOIA requests,” Interior spokeswoman Molly Block told The Hill in a statement.

The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its interactions with the Interior Department.

Thomas Cmar, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said Interior’s use of the FBI as a potential model for handling FOIA requests was troubling because “the FBI has a long and storied history of lack of transparency.”

“I think it says a lot about Interior’s point of view on transparency that they are looking for examples on efforts trying to clamp down on transparency as models for how the agency should adopt its procedures,” he said.

The FBI provided Interior with full texts of one of the court cases connected to the 500-page rule’s proceedings, writing: “The Appeal Court concluded the FBI’s policy was not in violation of the FOIA; the policy is a non-obstructionist; the policy serves to promote efficient responses to a larger number of requesters.”

Light, who has represented clients challenging the FBI’s FOIA rule, said he understood Interior’s interest in the FBI policy even though it was a bit like comparing “apples and oranges” given the often classified nature of FBI information.

“I can certainly understand from an agency’s perspective why they would want to have a cap on how many pages they want to do,” he said. “Because then, if there is a request that is large, you can forward the requester to be in a position to give up documents they really want or having to wait an inordinate amount of time to get them. It gives them a lot of leverage.”

The emails show Interior officials were interested in learning more about the EPA’s recent reorganization of FOIA request handling to a central office in Washington, D.C.

EPA in April 2018 quietly moved its national FOIA office to its Office of General Counsel, a big change that meant requests went to a general office rather than specific EPA bureaus.

Critics say the shift made EPA political appointees — and not career officials — the first gatekeepers for FOIA requests.

The EPA’s new policy has been challenged in the courts by a number of environmental groups over its lack of transparency and also spurred a bipartisan group of senators at the end of July to introduce a FOIA reform bill.

Interior set up meetings with EPA officials to discuss the rules after they learned of them.

“FYI,” wrote Cindy Cafaro, an officer in Interior’s FOIA policy office, as she forwarded an internal EPA press release about the National Freedom of Information Act office. The April 25, 2018, email was sent to Juliette Lillie, director of Interior’s Office of the Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, and Robert Howarth, the director of congressional affairs.

Four months later, Interior’s acting solicitor Edward Keable and EPA's acting FOIA director Timothy Epp held a meeting.

“Thank you again for taking the time this afternoon to meet with us,” Keable wrote Epp on Aug. 24. In the email, Keable suggested further discussing topics at a second meeting, scheduled for Aug. 28.

“What is your experience with and how do you minimize false positives? How do you manage quality control?” Keable asked Epp in the Aug. 24 email, referring to ways the agency could minimize the chances of releasing incorrectly identified documents from FOIA request match search results.

Cmar said the interactions were troubling because “we’ve seen serious abuses of the process at both agencies under this administration.”

Another internal email suggested that Interior Secretary David Bernhardt personally requested learning more details about EPA’s FOIA process. Bernhardt was deputy secretary at the time.

In August, an email sent from Lillie to acting Interior Solicitor Daniel Jorjani and Hubbel Relat, a senior counselor at Interior, said a “David” had asked staff to reach out to EPA.

“This morning we met with David on FOIA. He asked us to reach out to EPA to learn about their management processes, including clearing out backlog, accountability, management, staffing, tools, etc. and how they made the changes. Would it be possible for you to reach out within the next week?” Lillie wrote. “We are on a tight time frame to provide some additional guidance back to David. I am happy to discuss further with you, when you are available.”

Interior did not respond to a specific question about Bernhardt’s involvement.

The EPA told The Hill that it will “continue to work with all federal partners to share best practices for FOIA responses.” The agency did not comment on its communications with the Interior Department regarding FOIA policies.

Interior’s final draft FOIA policy submitted in December did not include EPA’s centralization plan.

Interior did not respond to questions about why the two policies were not included and whether it is looking to incorporate them.

Interior's draft FOIA policy has been criticized for including what’s known as an “awareness review,” which allows senior political appointees to review public documents referencing them before release. Critics warn the practice can slow the dissemination of public information and gives officials undue authority to potentially influence the withholding of documents.

"AT&T workers took $1 million in bribes to unlock 2 million phones, DOJ says",https://arstechnica.com,['Jon Brodkin'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/att-employees-took-bribes-to-unlock-phones-and-plant-malware-doj-says/,"A Pakistani man bribed AT&T call-center employees to install malware and unauthorized hardware as part of a scheme to fraudulently unlock cell phones, according to the US Department of Justice. Muhammad Fahd, 34, was extradited from Hong Kong to the US on Friday and is being detained pending trial.

An indictment alleges that ""Fahd recruited and paid AT&T insiders to use their computer credentials and access to disable AT&T's proprietary locking software that prevented ineligible phones from being removed from AT&T's network,"" a DOJ announcement yesterday said. ""The scheme resulted in millions of phones being removed from AT&T service and/or payment plans, costing the company millions of dollars. Fahd allegedly paid the insiders hundreds of thousands of dollars—paying one co-conspirator $428,500 over the five-year scheme.""

In all, AT&T insiders received more than $1 million in bribes from Fahd and his co-conspirators, who fraudulently unlocked more than 2 million cell phones, the government alleged. Three former AT&T customer service reps from a call center in Bothell, Washington, already pleaded guilty and agreed to pay the money back to AT&T.

The first indictment against Fahd was filed in November 2017, and he was arrested in Hong Kong at the request of the United States in February 2018, but the case was just unsealed yesterday. Fahd is facing 14 charges in US District Court for the Western District of Washington. The charges are conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to violate the Travel Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, four counts of wire fraud, two counts of accessing a protected computer in furtherance of fraud, two counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, and four counts of violating the Travel Act.

AT&T generally locks phones to its network, preventing them from being used with other carriers. AT&T grants customers' unlock requests after they've paid off their contracts or device installment plans.

If a phone is unlocked before it has been paid off, resulting in a customer switching to another carrier, AT&T might not be able to collect the rest of the payments, a DOJ indictment of Fahd noted.

""Unlocked phones were a valuable commodity because they could be resold and used on any other compatible network around the world... When phones were unlocked fraudulently without AT&T's authorization and customers switched service to other carriers, the fraudulent transactions deprived AT&T of the stream of payments that were due under the service contracts and installment plans,"" the indictment said.

The alleged conspiracy involved ""the installation of malware and unauthorized hardware on AT&T's internal network,"" which Fahd and co-conspirators used to sell fraudulent phone-unlocking services to the general public, the indictment said.

Former AT&T workers pleaded guilty

Three now-former AT&T employees cooperated with the government and pleaded guilty to charges related to the conspiracy, and they are expected to testify at trial against Fahd, a court document said. Their names are Kyra Evans, DeVaughn Woods, and Marc Sapatin. All three agreed to pay financial penalties that will be transferred to AT&T, but they could also face prison time after their November 1 sentencing hearings.

Sapatin agreed to pay $441,500 in an October 2018 plea agreement. Evans agreed to pay restitution of $280,200, and Woods agreed to pay $155,032.

""We have been working closely with law enforcement since this scheme was uncovered to bring these criminals to justice and are pleased with these developments,"" AT&T told Ars.

We asked AT&T if it made any security improvements to prevent this from happening again, but we did not receive an answer. An AT&T spokesperson said that the scheme did not result in improper access to customer information.

The DOJ also charged Ghulam Jiwani, one of Fahd's alleged co-conspirators. Jiwani was arrested in Hong Kong, ""but died prior to being transferred to United States custody,"" a court document said. The charges against him were dropped as a result of his death.

Fahd and Jiwani had other co-conspirators ""known and unknown to the Grand Jury,"" the indictment said.

Evans, Woods, and Sapatin apparently were not the only AT&T employees who allegedly were involved in the scheme. The DOJ alleges that ""between 2012 and 2017, Fahd recruited various AT&T employees to the conspiracy. Some early recruits were paid to identify other employees who could be bribed and convinced to join the scheme. So far, three of those co-conspirators have pleaded guilty admitting they were paid thousands of dollars for facilitating Fahd's fraudulent scheme.""

Fahd and his co-conspirators instructed AT&T employees ""to create shell companies and open business banking accounts in the names of the shell companies"" in order to receive their bribes, the indictment said.

More details from the indictment

The scheme began in April 2012 when Fahd and his co-conspirators gave the bribed AT&T employees ""instructions... including lists of cellular telephone international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers for the insiders to submit for fraudulent and unauthorized unlocking,"" the indictment said.

The alleged malware-planting part of the conspiracy began around April 2013. Fahd, Jiwani, and others allegedly ""bribed insiders to plant malware on AT&T's internal protected computers for the purpose of gathering confidential and proprietary information on how AT&T's computer network and software applications functioned.""

Fahd and his co-conspirators used this information to create ""additional malware designed to interact with AT&T's internal protected computers and process fraudulent and unauthorized unlock requests submitted... from remote servers controlled by members of the conspiracy,"" the indictment said.

With this malware, Fahd and his crew were able to ""log into AT&T's internal protected computers under false pretenses and to process fraudulent and unauthorized unlock requests,"" the indictment said.

From November 2014 to September 2017, Fahd and others allegedly bribed AT&T insiders ""to install unauthorized computer hardware devices, including wireless access points designed to provide the conspiracy with unauthorized access to AT&T's internal protected computers."" With these hardware devices, Fahd and others ""facilitate[d] the automated process of submitting fraudulent and unauthorized unlock requests on behalf of the conspiracy."""
Homeland Security chief calls for more resources to fight domestic terrorism after report highlights shift in funding,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/el-paso-shooting-homeland-security-kevin-mcaleenan-resources-domestic-terrorism-report-highlights-funding/,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan responded to a report Tuesday that an initiative focused on targeted violence and terrorism prevention has about a quarter of the staff and an eighth of the budget of a similar program in the Obama administration. ""We need to invest more — no question,"" McAleenan said Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning.""

""I've asked Congress for an out-of-cycle budget request to help bolster it and increase our reach and capability. But it doesn't cover the level and scope of effort across the Department of Homeland Security enterprise,"" McAleenan said, adding the Secret Service reaches out to communities about what threat indicators to look out for and the department provides active shooter training to cities around the country.

There have been more than 250 mass shootings so far this year in the U.S., more than the number of days in the year thus far. At least 31 people were killed and scores were hurt in two mass shootings last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

The DHS chief said ideally he'd like to triple the staff available to better address the rise in attacks and ""coordinate the intelligence side of it at the headquarters level as well as investing in those grants and efforts that are going to help communities prepare for these kind of incidents.""

McAleenan said his agency is acting aggressively to address mass shootings after President Trump gave his agency clear marching orders to locate the root cause of these events.

""I've also directed a surge of all of our training and preparedness assets on a risk basis to communities across the country based on what we know,"" McAleenan said. He said DHS had also established an advisory council and created task forces to develop a better understanding of these attacks across the country.

In El Paso, some members of the Hispanic community suggested Mr. Trump's rhetoric has contributed toward acts of hatred. Asked about the president's rhetoric, McAleenan said, ""I think we've got a responsibility to call out hate in all of its forms, and white supremacist extremism is a critical element that we're trying to address. I think the president was very clear on that yesterday.""

In a nationally televised address Monday on the shootings, the president said the gunman was consumed by racist hate, and Mr. Trump condemned white supremacy. He also blamed mental illness and hate for the attacks, not guns.

McAleenan's comments come just after the FBI issued a new warning about domestic terror threats, saying ""violent extremists could become inspired by these and previous high-profile attacks to engage in similar acts of violence.""

The DHS chief agreed with that assessment, saying over the last two years, a ""number of their investigations are racially motivated and within that category the majority are white-supremacist-extremist motivated.""

Meanwhile, the Justice Department said it was treating the El Paso shooting as domestic terrorism after the 21-year old suspect, who is accused of killing at least 22 people, allegedly wrote a racist essay in which he denounced the increasing Hispanic population in Texas.

McAleenan said that the Texas shooting hit home for him because members of the Customs and Border Patrol agency, which is a part of DHS, were in the Walmart where the shooting happened.

""We actually had one of our leaders, a port director ... in the Walmart during the attack. She responded and provided lifesaving assistance to one of the injured victims and just tremendously proud of her and her response,"" McAleenan said."
"USDA office move may have broken law, watchdog says",https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/456348-usda-office-move-may-have-broken-law-watchdog-says,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) may have violated the law with its decision to relocate two offices from Washington, D.C., to the Kansas City area, according to the USDA Office of Inspector General (OIG).

The USDA recently moved its National Institute of Food and Agriculture and Economic Research Service offices, saying the change was financially sound and put its researchers closer geographically to American farmland.

However, the move was met with widespread pushback from employees of the affected offices, who unionized in response to the announced move, with many publicly turning their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueUSDA office move may have broken law, watchdog says Democrats: Trump plan could jeopardize 500,000 children's free school meals Judge cuts Roundup cancer case payout from billion to million MORE.

The USDA has instructed all affected employees to report by Sept. 30 and has rejected a union proposal to let some employees to continue working from Washington.

The USDA’s general counsel, Stephen Vaden, has argued that the department is not bound by laws requiring it to secure congressional approval to spend the money to relocate, claiming the law in question is unconstitutional.

The inspector general’s report counters that Vaden's claim is “not consistent with prior positions taken by the Department.”

“To reach management decision on this recommendation and to ensure consistent treatment going forward, the Department needs to communicate, in writing, this change of interpretation to USDA leaders at the Sub-Cabinet and Agency levels,” the report states.

In a comment to The Hill, the USDA said, ""The Department is not required to abide by provisions that have been deemed unconstitutional, therefore we will not take the OIG’s recommendation to ignore nearly forty years of precedent set by the Supreme Court, Office of Legal Counsel, and the Government Accountability Office – an arm of Congress.""

""Since the Inspector General affirms the Department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed. This is opinion based on policy decisions that have no basis in fact,"" the department added.

California’s climate deal with automakers had been rejected by EPA,https://www.latimes.com,['Ryan Beene'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-06/california-climate-deal-automakers-trump-epa,"A compromise between four major automakers and California’s clean-air regulator on fuel efficiency was rejected by the Trump administration months earlier as not “a productive alternative.”

The deal — which Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW and Volkswagen announced July 25 alongside the California Air Resources Board — eases the pace of annual efficiency improvements required under current Obama-era rules but is tougher than the Trump administration’s proposal to cap mileage requirements at 2020 levels.

Key elements of the pact were contained in a November 2018 summary of California’s proposal that was prepared by Environmental Protection Agency staff for Bill Wehrum, who was assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation at the time, according to excerpts of the presentation viewed by Bloomberg.

Stanley Young, California Air Resources Board spokesman, confirmed Friday that the state had offered the plan to the EPA last November. The previously unreported detail sheds new light on the months-long battle between Washington and Sacramento over the mileage rules that automakers urged President Trump to reevaluate during his first weeks in office.

“Looking back, it seems that they were never interested in negotiations or discussions,” Young said. He added that the four automakers’ support of California’s compromise “highlights the fact that our proposal is both feasible and realistic.”

Relations between EPA and CARB officials have become tense, with each side blaming the other for the breakdown of talks. In a June 20 letter to Republican lawmakers, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said California’s counteroffer hadn’t yet been endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra when it was presented to EPA. He accused CARB Chairman Mary Nichols of being “unable or unwilling to be a good-faith negotiator.”

The Trump administration’s 2018 proposal said capping fuel economy standards at 2020 levels would lead new cars to be less expensive than they would be under the current rules. The agencies argued that more-affordable cars would enable people to replace their older vehicles with newer, safer ones more rapidly and avoid thousands of traffic fatalities — claims that experts and EPA career staffers have disputed.

Wheeler, in a February interview , said the state’s proposal suggested “just taking the Obama numbers and stretching that an additional year. And that doesn’t really get to the lives saved or the reducing the price of the automobiles to where we would like it to be.”

The White House abandoned discussions with California officials a few weeks later, saying, “Despite the administration’s best efforts to reach a common-sense solution, it is time to acknowledge that CARB has failed to put forward a productive alternative” after the federal proposal was released.

The four-company pact with California also highlights a growing chasm between the Trump administration and the auto industry, which after urging the administration to retool Obama-era mileage standards has since pushed back on the resulting plan that recommended capping requirements after 2020.

That plan, put forth last year by the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, also proposed stripping California of its authority to regulate automobile greenhouse gas emissions. The state and others have vowed to fight in court to retain that power, and automakers fear that prolonged litigation will roil business plans that depend on predictable fuel economy standards.

In June, a group of 17 major carmakers unsuccessfully asked Trump to resume talks with California, saying a pact for unified California-U.S. standards will “enhance our ability to invest and innovate by avoiding an extended period of litigation and instability.”

California’s deal with the four carmakers — and the one pitched to the EPA last fall — pushes the 2025 efficiency target back to 2026, lowering the pace of gains each year compared to the current rules starting in 2022. Automakers would get more help to reach those targets from additional compliance credits earned by selling electric vehicles, and wouldn’t have to account for carbon emissions by the power plants that generate electricity used by battery-powered cars.

“For over a year and a half, the administration expended a serious amount of resources to achieve a workable deal with California,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in an email, adding, “not once did California submit a meaningful alternative.”

Dave Cooke, a senior clean-vehicles analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said California’s offer contained meaningful concessions.

“The fact that this was the deal that EPA called not serious is incredible to me,” he said. “This is a substantial reduction in stringency from the federal program.”"
"FBI employees disciplined for unauthorized disclosures received lighter punishments after internal review, docs show",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/14-fbi-employees-referred-for-discipline-over-unauthorized-disclosures-docs-show,"At least 14 FBI employees were referred to the agency's internal ethics office for unauthorized disclosures of classified or sensitive information in the last three years, according to FBI Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) documents obtained by the conservative transparency group Judicial Watch.

The documents, released Tuesday, offered a window into what the Department of Justice Inspector General (IG) has characterized as a culture of leaking at the FBI, which allegedly permeated the bureau's highest levels, and how the agency polices itself. In several instances, the documents show that OPR's proposed punishments for FBI employees were reduced dramatically.

IG and DOJ reviews of the FBI's handling of the counterintelligence probe into President Trump's team, and related matters, are ongoing.

""We have profound concerns about the volume and extent of unauthorized media contacts by FBI personnel that we have uncovered during our review,” the IG wrote in a bombshell report last year, noting that some of the FBI's improper press communications came from phones at the agency's Washington, D.C. headquarters.

The IG added: “FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

COMEY MEMOS CONTAINED 'CODE NAME AND TRUE IDENTITY' OF CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE

Punishments for the alleged violations outlined in the new OPR files ranged from letters of censure and week-long suspensions without pay, to several summary dismissals.

According to the documents, in June 2017, OPR found that a senior FBI employee “misused an FBI database, and provided sensitive information to a former FBI employee."" That employee thought he “had the support of his Division to use his discretion,"" and ultimately received a letter of censure from the bureau's top brass, instead of OPR's recommended 15-day suspension.

In October 2017, an unidentified FBI employee was recommended for termination by OPR, but received a 45-day unpaid suspension instead.

In January 2019, another employee received a 60-day unpaid suspension, instead of the termination recommended by OPR.

One employee was accused of “Investigative deficiency – improper handling of documents or property in the care, custody or control of the government; unauthorized disclosure – classified/law enforcement sensitive/grand jury information” and “failure to report – administrative.” He received only a 10-calendar day suspension wtihout pay in February 2018, instead of a proposed 30-calendar day suspension.

One file closed on March 20, 2018 which apparently refers to former FBI Director Andrew McCabe, states in mitigation the employee had a ""remarkable performance record"" and was ""facing unprecedented challenges and pressures"" when he ""released the FBI Sensitive information to a reporter and lacked candor not under oath and under oath when questioned about it.""

CLINTON-APPOINTED JUDGE DISMISSES DNC LAWSUIT ON TRUMP-RUSSIA CONSPIRACY AS 'ENTIRELY DIVORCED' FROM FACTS

Nevertheless, a factor in ""aggravation"" was that the employee ""held an extremely high position and was expected to comport himself with the utmost integrity"" and that ""lack of candor is incompatible with the FBI’s Core Values.""

""OPR PROPOSED DECISION: Proposed DISMISSAL,"" the document stated, noting that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions would need to issue final approval.

""OPR FINAL DECISION: DISMISSAL,"" the file concluded.

McCabe's violations stemmed from his response to an October 2016 Wall Street Journal report about sizeable campaign donations from Democrats to McCabe's wife, Jill, during her campaign for the Virginia State Senate. An IG investigation found that McCabe instructed FBI lawyer Lisa Page and FBI public affairs chief Michael Kortan to work with the Journal's reporter to set the record straight.

McCabe later sued the DOJ to obtain documents related to this termination, while another former high-ranking anti-Trump FBI official, Peter Strzok, announced Tuesday he was outright suing the bureau over his termination.

An investigative source told Fox News that Page’s statements to investigators were “critical” because they directly contradicted her boss, McCabe. According to the source, McCabe's lack of candor about the contact with the Journal reporter led to his firing. The source added that Page's testimony about the matter contradicted McCabe's. Then-FBI Director James Comey claimed he never authorized the leak to the Journal.

Comey himself has faced scrutiny in recent days. Last week, bureau documents also obtained by Judicial Watch revealed that FBI agents went to Comey's house and retrieved as ""evidence"" a secret, previously unreported memo he wrote, well after he was fired as FBI Director.

STRZOK FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST FBI, SAYING TERMINATION WAS POLITICAL

Additionally, Comey told agents ""spontaneously"" that, to ""the best of his recollection, two [memos] were missing,"" according to the documents.

The day after agents visited his home, Comey admitted in congressional testimony that he had leaked memos purportedly documenting his contemporaneous recollections of his conversations with President Trump, through a friend, so that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would be appointed. Comey wrote, for instance, that Trump allegedly demanded his loyalty, and said he hoped the FBI would let the Michael Flynn matter ""go.""

After the fact, the FBI classified two of those memos as “confidential.”

However, the DOJ decided last week against prosecuting Comey for classified information following a criminal referral from the IG, sources familiar with the deliberations told Fox News.

“Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn’t a close call,” one official said. “They all thought this could not be prosecuted.”

In April, a court-ordered filing by the DOJ revealed Comey included a slew of sensitive and classified information in a series of comprehensive personal memos -- including not only the details of his conversations with Trump, but also the ""code name and true identity"" of a confidential source.

The filing acknowledged that Comey maintained a far more detailed and lengthy private paper trail than was previously known, and that federal investigators apparently hoped to use Comey's contemporaneous, secretive writings to test the truthfulness of Trump's comments as part of a then-ongoing obstruction-of-justice inquiry.

Comey meticulously outlined ""foreign intelligence information obtained from and through"" the key human source, ""information about whether the FBI initiated coverage through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) on a particular individual,"" relevant ""sources and methods"" used in the FBI's investigation and ""information concerning the President's foreign policy decisionmaking,"" according to the DOJ.

All of that information was ""currently and properly classified,"" the DOJ noted.

"USDA may have violated law in controversial office relocation decision, inspector general says",https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/usda-relocation-inspector-general/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The US Agriculture Department's inspector general has concluded the department may have violated the law when deciding to relocate two offices from the Washington, DC, area.

USDA has justified its decision to relocate the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture offices to the Kansas City area for both financial reasons and to put the researchers closer to the agricultural heartland.

But it is seen by critics as a swipe at the agency's scientific expertise and was largely unwelcome with agency employees . Those offices unionized, and around 70% told union organizers they would not make the move. Some physically turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at a public meeting where he addressed the move.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Friday that the move is part of the administration's approach to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington.

""More than half the people quit. Now, it's nearly impossible to fire a federal worker,"" he said. ""What a wonderful way to sort of streamline government and do what we haven't been able to do for a long time.""

Trump judges face scrutiny over president's cases,https://thehill.com,[],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/456013-trump-judges-face-scrutiny-over-presidents-cases,"Federal judges nominated by President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer White Supremacist calls on Trump to stop using fear to motivate people Walmart employee urges workers to strike until the company's stores stop selling guns Biden: Violent video games 'not healthy' but aren't 'in and of itself why we have this carnage' MORE are facing a major public test as they handle cases that involve Trump personally or some of his most controversial policies.

New judges are already under pressure to carefully issue rulings as they learn the ropes of the federal judiciary. But three recently appointed district judges in D.C. — Trevor McFadden, Timothy Kelly and Carl Nichols — have found themselves and their rulings under a magnifying glass as they deal with cases involving Trump.

All three of the Trump-tapped judges have acted as their colleagues on the bench typically do, proceeding cautiously in the recent cases. And while legal experts disagreed over whether the judges are facing additional pressure over their rulings, they agreed that there is more attention on the cases, at least in the media.

“These judges realize that everybody's looking at them, and they're kind of behind the eight ball either way you look at it,” Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program, told The Hill.

“A decision for the administration could look like favoritism, or a decision against the administration can be taken as perhaps bending over backwards not to appear supportive of them,” he added.

In the last two weeks, McFadden and Nichols have both taken careful approaches to a lawsuit over a New York law that allows Congress to obtain the president’s state tax returns.

McFadden, who was confirmed by the Senate in October 2017, was initially assigned to the lawsuit over Trump’s New York tax returns because he was also assigned to a lawsuit over the president’s federal tax returns.

But McFadden disagreed with Trump’s personal lawyers who sought to have him also oversee the new case, ordering last week that the state tax return case be randomly reassigned to a new judge.

In his order, he highlighted the importance of adhering to rules about when cases can be considered related to avoid the appearance of judge shopping and to ensure to the public that judges are assigned to cases in an impartial manner.

Nichols, who was just confirmed by the Senate in May and is so new that his name hasn’t been added to the list of D.C. district judges on the court’s website, is now taking on the New York tax returns case in what appears to be his first-ever assignment.

He has been deliberate in his handling of an emergency motion from Trump to block Democratic lawmakers from requesting the president’s New York tax returns. After initially hearing arguments in the case, he asked the parties to try to reach an agreement themselves.

When they failed to do so, Nichols held a teleconference to get more information from those involved. And one day later, he issued an order that temporarily stops New York from handing over the returns to the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, after indicating to the parties that is how he would rule. The panel has not yet requested the returns.

Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa, said that in the legal fights over Trump's tax returns, “it seems like both judges have been pretty cautious.”

But he said the judges’ cautious approach may have more to do with the nature of the issues before them, such as court shopping, than the fact that they are new to the bench.

Mike Stern, who served in the House Office of General Counsel from 1996 to 2004, said that the judges appear to be trying to handle lawsuits in as apolitical a manner as possible.

He said that McFadden’s actions in the tax returns case as well as one over border wall funding have been reasonable and that Nichols’s actions in the state tax return case are consistent with courts’ desire to try to not make a decision when there are disputes between different branches of government.

“If they can avoid having to make a decision, they will do that,” Stern said.

McFadden’s ruling on the tax returns case wasn’t his first high-profile case involving the president. Earlier this year, he presided over House Democrats’ lawsuit challenging the administration’s use of military funds for a border wall.

Before getting to the claims made in the lawsuit, the judge dedicated the first half of a three-hour hearing on the matter to whether he should even be allowed to oversee the proceeding. McFadden ultimately ruled that Democrats did not have standing to bring the case forward.

Kelly was first thrown into the spotlight when the White House revoked CNN correspondent Jim Acosta James (Jim) AcostaTrump judges face scrutiny over president's cases Playboy plans to appeal after reporter says his White House credentials were suspended Trump calls out Cincinnati's 'Democrat mayor' as protesters escorted out MORE's press credentials. The judge ruled against the administration in that case, ordering that the credentials be reinstated.

He also recently oversaw a lengthy hearing on a Trump policy. Kelly heard arguments for more than three hours last month on whether he should issue a temporary restraining order on a policy that would block migrants who pass through a third country from claiming asylum in the United States, with few exceptions.

Kelly, who was confirmed by the Senate in September 2017, was methodical in his line of questioning, pressing attorneys for both sides on the details of their arguments and frequently referring to documents laid out before him during the hearing.

As he wrapped up the proceeding, he noted the importance of both getting the case right and issuing a ruling quickly.

Kelly ultimately decided to not grant the temporary restraining order, in a win for the Trump administration. But that ruling was overshadowed just hours later, after San Francisco-based Judge Jon Tigar, an Obama appointee, issued a preliminary injunction against the asylum rule.

Some legal experts say that the Trump-appointed judges have been trying to be careful and are acting in ways that are consistent with common court practices.

But others who are following the legal cases closely are worried that Trump-appointed judges will go out of their way to act in ways that benefit the president.

Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who backs efforts to obtain Trump’s tax returns, said many Trump-appointed judges were nominated because of their conservative ideology. And he suggested they could feel pressure to show their loyalty to Republicans if they want to eventually be appointed to an appellate court or the Supreme Court.

“Their careers are tied in large measure to them continuing to be loyal,” he said.

But legal experts generally maintained that the judges are acting impartially and with the goal of reaching the best outcome possible.

“Speaking generally, we know that the party of the appointing president is a predictor of how judges will rule in cases, but it's not a very good predictor,” Wheeler said. “But most of the cases, it can be judged fairly cut and dry. The law is clear. The precedents are clear. There's really not much discretion to exercise.

“It's when you get to the cases in which the law is unclear, with new cases that lack a lot of precedents — that's when notions of public policy come into play,” he added.

Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, pushed back on how much pressure the judges are under.

He argued that judges in certain circuits, such as D.C., may be more likely than those in other parts of the country to face high-profile cases during their first years. And he said that judges will rule impartially, regardless of which president appointed them to the bench.

“They’re considered judge material because they’re neutral and detached,” Blackman told The Hill."
EIS process launched for US fast neutron reactor,http://www.world-nuclear-news.org,[],,,,http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/EIS-process-launched-for-US-fast-neutron-reactor,"EIS process launched for US fast neutron reactor

06 August 2019

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has formally announced the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the construction of a Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) to test fuels and materials for use in advanced civilian nuclear power reactors.

DOE's vision of the VTR (Image: DOE)

A Notice of Intent was published yesterday in the US Federal Register, in which the DOE invites public comment on what should be included in the scope of the EIS in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its implementing regulations. The EIS will evaluate alternatives for a versatile reactor-based fast-neutron source facility and associated facilities for the preparation, irradiation and post-irradiation examination of fuels and materials.

US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the testing capability offered by the VTR would be ""essential"" for the USA to modernise its nuclear energy infrastructure and for developing ""transformational nuclear energy technologies"" to reduce waste generation and enhance nuclear security. ""Lack of a domestic reactor with versatile fast-neutron-spectrum testing capability is a significant national strategic risk affecting the ability of DOE to fulfil its mission to advance the energy, environmental, and nuclear security of the United States and promote scientific and technological innovation,"" he said.

Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Rita Baranwal said the capability must be developed on an ""accelerated schedule"" to avoid delays in the country's ability to develop and deploy advanced nuclear energy technologies. ""If this capability is not available to US innovators as soon as possible, the ongoing shift of nuclear technology dominance to other international states such as China and the Russian Federation will accelerate, to the detriment of the US nuclear industrial sector,"" she said.

The VTR will be used to provide a source of fast neutrons to support the development of advanced reactor technologies. Such facilities are currently available in only a few locations worldwide and the USA has not operated one in over 20 years. The DOE was directed to develop the facility under the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which became law in September 2018.

The reactor is to be a smaller (about 300 MWt) version of the GE Hitachi PRISM power reactor, which builds on the EBR-II, an integral sodium-cooled fast reactor prototype that operated at Argonne National Laboratory from 1963 to 1994. VTR, like PRISM, would use metallic alloy fuels. DOE has previously said the facility could be in operation by the end of 2026.

DOE is required by NEPA to evaluate ""a range of reasonable alternatives"" for the construction and operation of a VTR and its associated facilities, including a ""No Action Alternative"" to serve as a basis for comparison with the action alternatives. The ""action alternatives"" are described in the Federal Register announcement as the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) VTR Alternative and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) VTR Alternative.

The INL VTR Alternative would see the VTR sited at INL's Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC), using existing hot-cell and other facilities at the MFC for post-irradiation examination. The site's current infrastructure ""should be largely adequate"" to support the facility, according to the DOE. Under this alternative, fuel for the VTR would be manufactured either at MFC or at the Savanah River Site in South Carolina.

Under the ORNL VTR Alternative, the reactor would be sited at a yet-to-be-identified location at ORNL, which is in eastern Tennessee. Several existing facilities would be used and/or modified to provide operational support and post-irradiation examination capabilities. Driver fuel for the VTR would ""likely be manufactured elsewhere,"" according to the Federal Register notice.

The public has until 4 September to submit comments on the scope of the draft version of the EIS. The draft EIS itself will then be completed over the next several months and will itself be opened to public comment before being made final.

In a statement, the Treasury Department said Secretary Steve Mnuchin, “under the auspices of President Trump,” has determined that China is a currency manipulator.

“As a result of this determination, Secretary Mnuchin will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions,” the Treasury department said, explaining: “In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past. The context of these actions and the implausibility of China’s market stability rationale confirm that the purpose of China’s currency devaluation is to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade.”

The statement added that the People’s Bank of China “has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis.”

It’s the first time the U.S. has labeled China as a currency manipulator since 1994, and could open the door to new sanctions.

It’s also a reversal for the Treasury Department, which in May declined to give China that label. But President Donald Trump has pressed for that designation.

“China has always used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories, hurt our jobs, depress our workers’ wages and harm our farmers’ prices. Not anymore!” Trump tweeted Monday before Treasury’s announcement.

China’s currency CNYUSD, -0.3137% weakened early Monday, trading at more than 7 yuan per U.S. dollar for the first time in more than a decade.

The perceived willingness by China to use the yuan as a trade weapon led to a huge selloff on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.21% and S&P 500 SPX, +1.30% falling almost 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% slid 3.5%."

Don't Expect Every Question Answered by USDA's August Report,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/dont-expect-every-question-answered-usdas-august-report,"Grain markets settling down Tuesday following turbulence to start the week after what seems like an escalation in the trade war with China. Corn futures at the CME Group in Chicago have seen a steady march lower since last month.

In an interview on AgDay TV with Clinton Griffiths, Mark Gold of Top Third Ag Marketing says the issue is that the weather just hasn't been that bad since the rains slowed down in late June.

""We know that the pollination is way late,"" says Gold. ""We haven't had a whole lot of rain these last seven days, we're not going to get a whole lot in the next seven days but it's been enough.""

While there are spotty issues with dryness and heat, Gold says temperatures haven't been overly hot.

""There's not a whole lot of stress out there,"" says Gold. ""The big question is on the supply side and what are the acres?""

Gold thinks ultimately both yields and acres will trend lower in USDA's subsequent reports.

""I don't think the USDA is going to see a huge reduction in the acres from the last report, mainly because they're going to be including all those acres for silage,"" says Gold. ""One of the secretaries came out and said corn planted is corn planted and that means they're just going to lump it all together.""

Gold doesn't think the industry will get every answer they want in the August report. Regardless, he's expecting the market to react to the updated information.

""If the report is friendly, then obviously we can move a lot higher,"" says Gold. ""If they don't really make any changes in the numbers, the yield is still 165 or 166, we're going lower and maybe significantly lower.""

Gold says the biggest issue he sees on the horizon is softening demand given the trade issues facing the industry.

""We've got to offset that,"" says Gold. ""Even if we offset a 10% reduction in production, we're seeing a 10% reduction in demand.""​

Judge questions Barr's handling of Mueller findings,https://thehill.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/456236-judge-questions-barrs-handling-of-mueller-findings,"A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Monday pressed Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers on why the public shouldn’t be allowed to see redacted portions of former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerTrump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony Kellyanne Conway: 'I'd like to know' if Mueller read his own report MORE’s report, suggesting that he may be willing to consider releasing at least some of the restricted document.

Judge Reggie Walton, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, posed the questions during a hearing on a pair of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits seeking the redacted portions of the report.

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and BuzzFeed News reporter Jason Leopold filed the lawsuits earlier this year. The cases have since been consolidated, and attorneys for each party split the arguments during Monday’s hearing.

Walton in particular raised concerns about Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrThe Humanist case for abolishing the death penalty Senators renew request for domestic threats documents from FBI, DOJ after shootings Judge questions Barr's handling of Mueller findings MORE’s initial handling of Mueller’s report, indicating that he believed there were discrepancies in how Barr characterized the report and the former special counsel’s actual findings.

“I do have some concerns because it seems to me difficult to reconcile the contents of the Mueller report and statements made by the attorney general” about the report, Walton said.

The judge pointed to a letter authored by Barr weeks ahead of the report's release that said Mueller determined there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election and Barr’s suggestion that the president was cleared by the report.

Mueller has since stated that his office did not investigate collusion but instead whether any Trump campaign officials conspired with Russians in 2016. And the former special counsel has repeatedly stated that his report does not exonerate President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer White Supremacist calls on Trump to stop using fear to motivate people Walmart employee urges workers to strike until the company's stores stop selling guns Biden: Violent video games 'not healthy' but aren't 'in and of itself why we have this carnage' MORE.

DOJ lawyer Courtney Enlow pushed back, saying that Barr was not required to release the report at all under the special counsel regulations but did so anyway. She said the attorney general's actions were in “good faith.”

But EPIC attorney Alan Butler raised concerns over the timeline of the redactions. The DOJ released a second redacted version of the Mueller report in response to the FOIA lawsuits weeks after the initial report. But Butler noted that the exemptions in the FOIA version of the report were effectively the same as the redactions made in the originally released version of Mueller's report.

Judge Walton raised that prospect to Enlow, suggesting that the DOJ officials tasked with making the FOIA exemptions could have been following directions from higher-ups. He cited his own time working in the DOJ, saying that sometimes “the body does what the head wants.”

Enlow said that Barr worked with members of the special counsel’s office to make the redactions and that the information withheld under FOIA in that version of the report was in line with FOIA exemptions.

Attorneys for those seeking the unredacted portions of the report pressed Walton to request that the disputed redactions be given to him privately so that he could review them and determine if any of the information was already publicly available and no longer needed to redacted.

Enlow argued that rulings in previous FOIA cases mean that the administration doesn’t necessarily have to make that information publicly available.

However, Walton appeared skeptical. At several times throughout the hearing, he noted the high level of public interest in the redacted versions of the documents.

Mathew Topic, who was arguing on behalf of Leopold in court, also noted that releasing more details of the report could help resolve disputes about the origins of the Mueller investigation.

Topic pointed to Trump repeatedly referring to the probe as a politically motivated “witch hunt” and said that making the investigators’ findings fully available could help affirm or disprove those claims.

And the lawyer said that providing a fuller reasoning for why certain figures such as Donald Trump Jr. Donald (Don) John TrumpJudge questions Barr's handling of Mueller findings Hey, Democrats: Stop attacking our most beloved president in recent history Comedy Central shoots down Trump Jr. after he joked network should host Democratic debates MORE were not charged or even brought before a grand jury would further clarify the intent and actions of prosecutors working under Mueller.

“That information has strong public interest in multiple ways,” Topic said of the details redacted because of privacy interests.

Enlow countered by saying Americans contacted by Russians during the 2016 election could be thrust into the public spotlight if that information was released and that being publicly tied to the investigation “places stigma on that person.”

Among the redacted information in the report being sought in these cases is grand jury information.

But Enlow, in arguing that Walton should not make the information public, cited an opinion from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals handed down earlier this year that found a court doesn’t have the inherent authority to release grand jury materials.

And she said that a suggestion from Tropic that an FOIA exemption made in relation to grand jury materials appeared related to Trump’s questioning in the probe as “baseless” speculation.

Topic had questioned why information appearing to relate to Trump’s questioning was redacted under the grand jury provision, when the president never appeared before a grand jury.

Walton did not provide a timeline as to when he might issue a decision, saying that he is facing a “heavy” caseload at the moment.

But he noted the high level of public interest in the case — and the inevitable prospect that whatever ruling he issues will be appealed — in saying he will work to make a decision soon."
New Mexico governor slaps EPA for staying out of court fight with Air Force,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-mexico-governor-slaps-epa-for-staying-out-of-court-fight-with-air-force,"Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham accused the Environmental Protection Agency of violating federal law by refusing to aid the state in a lawsuit with the Air Force.

The Democratic governor sent a letter to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Friday saying the agency’s lack of involvement ""is a demonstrative example of EPA's failure to uphold compliance with federal environmental laws,"" according to Politico.

The EPA stood by its decision on Tuesday, calling Lujan Grisham's demands that the agency get involved a form of ""short-term litigation posturing."" Two top EPA officials argued in July that the EPA is prohibited from taking or joining legal action against another executive department or agency.

New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney disagreed with the EPA argument in an Aug. 2 letter, saying that the EPA has issued compliance orders to other federal agencies in the past.

New Mexico sued the Air Force on March 5 over a toxic chemical compound called PFAS that appeared in groundwater around Cannon and Holloman air bases. The compound is known as a ""forever chemical"" for its resistance to breaking down in the environment.

PFAS contamination has been found in and around dozens of military installations across the U.S. New Mexico has sued the Air Force to make the military clean up the toxic compound from the environment and is pressuring the EPA to help in the cleanup, as well.

Wall Street Overview

Stocks rebounded Tuesday, one day after posting their worst session of the year, and finished up after China pegged its yuan inside the 7 mark following the Treasury Department's decision to label the country a currency manipulator.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended down 767 points in the previous session, snapped a five-day losing streak and finished up 311 points, or 1.21%, to 26,029. The S&P 500 rose 1.30%, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.39%.

Nike (NKE - Get Report) , Cisco (CSCO - Get Report) ,and United Technologies (UTX - Get Report) were leading the Dow advance at the market close.

The move from the People's Bank of China was seen as an attempt to ease tensions between the world's two biggest economies as their ongoing trade dispute threatens global-growth prospects.

The PBoC set the midpoint of its daily yuan pricing at 6.9683, one of the lowest levels since 2008 but under the 7 threshold that triggered global-market turmoil and the biggest selloff of the year for U.S. stocks on Monday.

The Treasury's move to label China a manipulator, alongside President Donald Trump's renewed plea to the U.S. Federal Reserve to respond to China's yuan devaluation, has boosted bets for near-term rate cuts.

The CME Group's FedWatch tool, which assigns rate-change probability, is pricing in a 83.5% chance of a 25-basis-point September cut, up from 54.8% last week, and a 16.5% chance of a 50-basis-point move, up from 2% last week.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday called on the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by another three-quarters of a point to a full point by year-end to bring U.S. rates into line to with rates elsewhere.

""The Federal Reserve before the end of the year has to lower interest rates by at least another 75 basis points or 100 basis points to bring interest rates here in America in line with the rest of the world,"" Navarro told Fox News. ""We have just too big a spread between our rates and that costs us jobs.""

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, said on CNBC Tuesday morning that Trump is ""very open to negotiations"" with China and suggested the president might be flexible regarding tariffs. He added that the U.S. is still expecting to resume trade talks with the Chinese in September.

Trump, Kudlow said, would ""like to continue negotiations.""

""He'd like to make a deal,"" Kudlow said, ""but it has to be the right deal for the United States.""

Kudlow said China is being hurt by tariffs ""much more significantly than we are.""

Joseph Cuffari, a one-time adviser to Gov. Doug Ducey and former Gov. Jan Brewer, is President Donald Trump’s new inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security.

Cuffari, who has lived in Phoenix and Tucson with his family and is relocating to the Washington, D.C.-area, has served more than four decades in the U.S. Air Force, on active duty in the Reserves and in the Arizona Air Guard.

“It was a great honor to have been considered by the president for nomination, and confirmed by the full Senate to be able to continue to serve the American people,” Cuffari, 59, said Tuesday.

Trump announced his intent to nominate Cuffari in October 2018. The Senate confirmed him on a voice vote on July 25.

Over the years, Cuffari worked in leadership positions with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, the Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General and other investigative and government roles in the United States and abroad.

Now, he will oversee independent analysis of the programs and operations of Homeland Security.

He told the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee in March he is committed to “seek the truth” while judiciously exercising his role.

“It is in that spirit that I will be fair and objective in my undertakings to investigate, audit, and inspect departmental employees and operations,” his statement read.

Brewer, a Republican who tapped Cuffari to advise her on public safety policies, said she was thrilled with his confirmation.

“He is going to serve POTUS very, very well,” she said. “He’s got an extremely impressive background and we were all very pleased when he served in my administration. I recommended him and was just really thrilled that it got done.”

Cuffari advised Ducey on military and veterans-affairs issues.

""Joe has been a valuable member of our team for the last four years,"" Ducey spokesman Patrick Ptak said in an email. ""We were sad to see him go but excited for his confirmation and glad he'll be continuing his career of service at the Department of Homeland Security.""

Energy Department wants to build nuclear test reactor,https://www.latimes.com,"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-05/energy-department-wants-to-build-nuclear-test-reactor,"A new nuclear test reactor is needed as part of an effort to revamp the nation’s fading nuclear power industry by developing safer fuel and power plants, the U.S. Department of Energy said Monday.

The federal agency said it would prepare an environmental impact statement as part of the process to build the test reactor in Idaho or Tennessee by the end of 2025. Public comments on the environmental review are being taken through Sept. 4.

The Versatile Test Reactor would be the first new test reactor built in the United States in decades and give the nation a dedicated “fast-neutron-spectrum” testing capability. Such reactors are called fast reactors.

“This testing capability is essential for the United States to modernize its nuclear energy infrastructure and for developing transformational nuclear energy technologies that reduce waste generation and enhance nuclear security,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in a statement.

Americans have been wary of nuclear power since the core from Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island underwent a partial meltdown in 1979 — one of the nation’s worst nuclear accidents. That was followed by a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploding and burning in 1986. In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan where the cores of three reactors suffered meltdowns after cooling systems failed.

Federal officials say the proposed test reactor would help create new and safer fuels, materials and reactors being developed by civilian companies in the United States.

“If this capability is not available to U.S. innovators as soon as possible, the ongoing shift of nuclear technology dominance to other international states such as China and the Russian Federation will accelerate, to the detriment of the U.S. nuclear industrial sector,” said Rita Baranwal, the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for nuclear energy.

The Energy Department had a fast reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor II, operating in eastern Idaho until it was shut down in 1994 as the nation turned away from nuclear power.

Edwin Lyman, senior scientist and acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said fast reactors such as the proposed Versatile Test Reactor are less safe than current reactors.

Most nuclear reactors in use now are “light-water” reactors fueled by uranium and cooled with water. Lyman said the test reactor would be cooled with harder-to-control liquid sodium and likely fueled by plutonium, increasing potential nuclear terrorism risks because plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons.

“There is nothing good about these reactors,” he said. “I think there is a love of plutonium in the [Energy] Department that is irrational.”

Revamping the nation’s nuclear power is part of a strategy to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by generating carbon-free electricity with nuclear power. The strategy was initiated under the Obama administration and continuing under the Trump administration, despite Trump’s downplaying of global warming.

Reducing spent nuclear fuel, federal officials say, is also an objective of the new test reactor. The United States has no permanent repository for about 77,000 tons of radioactive spent fuel, stored mainly at the commercial nuclear power plants where they were used to produce electricity.

But Lyman said fast reactors would produce waste even more hazardous and difficult to dispose.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, at the end of December there were 98 nuclear reactors at 59 power plants producing about 20% of the nation’s energy. Most of the reactors are decades old, and many are having a tough time competing economically with other forms of energy production.

The Energy Department is considering building the test reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho or the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee.

On a related front, late last year the Energy Department restarted the Transient Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory to test new nuclear fuels. That facility had been on standby since 1994."
"From contamination to commercial hubs, how EPA Superfund sites are being transformed",https://www.ksl.com,"[""Amy Joi O'Donoghue"", 'Ksl', 'Posted - Aug']",,,,https://www.ksl.com/article/46612091/from-contamination-to-commercial-hubs-how-epa-superfund-sites-are-being-transformed,"MIDVALE — A 700-acre site in Midvale was once home to five smelters processing lead and copper ore, covered with blast furnaces, baghouses and smokestacks.

Decades of industrial activity infused the land and groundwater with heavy metal contamination, rendering it full of toxins dangerous to human health.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund initiative, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, transformed the landscape to a useable piece of property after cleanup, with remediation and monitoring that went on for more than a decade.

Bingham Junction is now home to a park, 1,000 residences, and retail and commercial development that supports 600 jobs, $1.5 million in annual property tax revenues and a $131 million increase in the value of the property site.

The Midvale site was one of four highlighted in a release by the EPA, which works in conjunction with state agencies like the Utah Department of Environmental Quality and community partners like cities and redevelopment agencies.

Overall, approximately 1,000 Superfund sites are in reuse today — more than half the number of sites on the Superfund’s National Priorities List.

EPA has data on over 8,600 businesses at 529 of these sites, according to its release.

In fiscal year 2018 alone, these businesses generated $52.4 billion in sales, which is more than four times the amount EPA has spent at these sites. These businesses employed more than 195,000 people who earned a combined income of $13 billion. Over the last seven years, these businesses generated at least $263 billion in sales.

Much work remains to be done, however.

Hundreds of sites across the United States remain in the remediation stage and others have yet to make the list.

In Utah alone, there are 26 sites that were designated for the Superfund list since the program started in 1999. Among those still on the list are a 450-acre contaminated groundwater plume in Woods Cross and Bountiful, the Davenport and Flagstaff smelters site in Sandy and until recently, the Eureka Mills site in Juab County.

In 2018, that site was removed from the Superfund list.

"As climate reckoning arrives over agriculture, USDA’s scientists face censorship",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/climate-ipcc-usda-agriculture-emissions-science-relocation-fallout-trump-845a61311bd3/,"A government climate scientist who says the Trump administration buried a groundbreaking report he authored has left the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in protest over the “political views” top officials allegedly imposed on his work.

Politico reported Monday that Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist who worked at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) for more than 20 years, quit due to an increasingly political atmosphere at the agency. Ziska had worked on a major rice study last year, one that found rising levels of carbon dioxide could imperil the critical source of sustenance for some 600 million people globally. According to Ziska’s work, the mineral and protein content in rice, along with key vitamins, is expected to drop as greenhouse gas levels rise.

Agency scientists have accused department officials of seeking to bury that report, among others, in keeping with President Donald Trump’s stance denying and downplaying climate change. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue has similarly dismissed global warming as “weather patterns.”

USDA claims the study wasn’t publicized because of disagreement among career officials. But Ziska told Politico that the reason the study was buried is down to political ideology and the administration’s unwillingness to embrace established climate science.

“There was a sense [at USDA] that if the science agreed with the politics, then the policymakers would consider it to be ‘good science,’ and if it didn’t agree with the politics, then it was something that was flawed and needed to be done again,” he said.

The scientist’s departure coincides with a summary copy of a highly-anticipated U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on land use being leaked this week. The report emphasizes that global food production must become more sustainable in order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

His resignation also comes as the agency is still reeling from a controversial relocation effort connected to disputes over scientific integrity.

The department is set to lose a staggering number of career officials over a deeply contested relocation plan. Perdue announced in June that staffers with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would be asked to relocate to Kansas City, which straddles Kansas and Missouri. Over 500 staffers were given until July 15 to decide whether to relocate by September 30.

More than half of those staffers reportedly declined to move and have effectively chosen to resign — a dramatic loss of institutional knowledge and career staff who have worked with the department for decades.

USDA has argued that the move is a cost-saving effort to bring the department closer to farm country. But former USDA officials and the union representing employees have rejected that narrative. Many say it is an attempt to force out knowledgeable researchers and scientists, as well as a retaliation for the climate science work produced by some staffers at USDA.

Conversations about the link between agriculture and climate change, however, are only set to escalate. Last year, an IPCC report warned that the world had only 12 years left before crossing a dangerous threshold of global warming — one that would yield climate impacts on a scale not seen before. A leaked copy of this year’s report focuses on land use and the role of agriculture in mitigating climate change.

According to the draft, which is currently being debated in Geneva before its release later this week, cutting carbon emissions from sources like cars and power plants will only go so far. Agriculture, forestry, and other land-use practices are producing roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, the report says, with cattle and rice fields in particular generating around 50% of methane emissions. That has contributed heavily to climate impacts, the draft finds, with the situation only set to worsen.

“Climate change exacerbates land degradation through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, wind, sea-level rise and wave action,” the document states.

In addition to changing how people use land, the IPCC draft underscores that switching to vegetarian and vegan diets may be a critical part of staving off the worst climate impacts.

That refrain may sound familiar to some. Critics of the proposed Green New Deal — a blueprint for radically shifting the United States to net-zero emissions — have argued the climate plan will “ban cows” and deprive Americans of hamburgers. The proposal itself does not move to bar bovines from the country but it does single out agriculture as a major source of greenhouse gases and a sector in need of overhauling if the United States is to zero-out emissions. The IPCC’s findings are therefore likely to draw more attention to the climate science realities dogging agriculture.

High profile exits at USDA are also likely to fuel scrutiny of the Trump administration’s attitudes towards the sector’s relationship with climate science. And other major exits over climate change are also driving headlines. Rod Schoonover, a former senior analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department, wrote in an op-ed last week that the White House had blocked the release of his report on climate change and national security.

“The stated reason,” Schoonover said, “was that the scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.”"

"U.S. laws fall short in confronting domestic terrorism, former DOJ official says",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Brian Pascus'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/domestic-terrorism-definition-department-of-justice-official-el-paso-mass-shooting-white-supremacy/,"Following the deadly shooting in El Paso, Texas on Saturday that left 22 dead and two dozen people injured, United States Attorney John Bash said it will be treated as a domestic terrorism case. But Mary McCord, a former Department of Justice official who served as acting assistant attorney general for national security from 2016 to 2017, says U.S. laws currently fall short when it comes to dealing with domestic terrorism.

""I'm very encouraged by U.S. Attorney John Bash to say this meets the definition of domestic terrorism, because it clearly does,"" McCord said Monday in an interview with CBSN's Alex Denis. ""But that is just a definition and not a statute. Our code lacks a statute that allows this to be prosecuted as domestic terrorism.""

McCord elaborated on what goes into determining whether violent acts committed in the United States are given the legal designation of terrorism. She said that label ultimately comes down to the intent and weapons used by the suspect — and because there isn't a specific domestic terrorism law on the books, some attacks won't qualify.

""There is not an offense in the U.S. code that applies to acts of terrorism on U.S. soil that are committed with firearms instead of weapons of mass destruction, unless they are committed in some limited circumstances such as on behalf or in furtherance goals of a foreign terrorist organization, like we've seen with all of the terrorists acts on behalf of ISIS, or Al Qaeda, or if they're directed toward a U.S. government official or U.S. government property,"" she explained.

McCord touched on the specific difference between prosecuting a case as murder rather than terrorism. El Paso suspect Patrick Crusius, 21, had capital murder charges filed against him by the El Paso District Attorney, and is also expected to face federal terrorism charges.

""First of all, murder is a different crime than domestic terrorism. Murder is an inherently local crime,"" McCord said. ""Hate crimes might be very personal between a small group. Terrorism is done to intimidate or coerce the population or influence a policy of government through intimidation or coercion. So there are different federal interests at stake when it comes to terrorism. And a different reason to prosecute it as terrorism.""

McCord also touched on the ""moral equivalency"" of treating the crime committed in El Paso as terrorism, the same way we would if the attack had been committed in the name of ISIS.

FBI warns of ""threat"" of rising hate crimes

While the El Paso gunman allegedly wrote a manifesto filled with white supremacist and anti-immigrant rhetoric that gave a clear racist motive for the killings of 22 people, the FBI did not characterize it as a white nationalist or white supremacist crime in a statement Sunday.

""The attack in El Paso, Texas, underscores the continued threat posed by domestic violent extremists and perpetrators of hate crimes,"" the FBI said, adding that the El Paso investigation is being supported by the FBI's Domestic Terrorism-Hate Crimes Fusion Cell, which was established earlier this year. It also warned, ""Violent extremists could become inspired by these and previous high-profile attacks to engage in similar acts of violence.""

CBS News has reported the FBI says it has 850 open domestic terrorism investigations, 40% of which were motivated by racial extremism. Even so, the FBI is careful not to focus on a specific political viewpoint.

In congressional testimony last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, ""We, the FBI, don't investigate ideology, no matter how repugnant. When it turns to violence, we're all over it.""

White nationalism a growing danger in America, report says

On Tuesday, the FBI Agents Association called on Congress to take action to make domestic terrorism a federal crime.

""Domestic terrorism is a threat to the American people and our democracy. Acts of violence intended to intimidate civilian populations or to influence or affect government policy should be prosecuted as domestic terrorism regardless of the ideology behind them,"" Brian O'Hare, the president of the FBI Agents Association, said in a statement. Making domestic terrorism a federal crime ""would ensure that FBI Agents and prosecutors have the best tools to fight domestic terrorism,"" he said.

McCord voiced her support for empowering the Department of Justice and FBI to focus on preventing acts of white supremacist terrorism before they occur.

""I'm in agreement that the DOJ should be aggressively pursuing investigations that would help to prevent acts of terrorism, and working with state and local partners to do so,"" she said. ""I think they should also work more collaboratively internationally, with foreign countries and their counterparts internationally, because we know after Christchurch and Sri Lanka, we know that this idea of white supremacist violence is not unique to the United States, it's occurring all over the country and white supremacists are gathering steam from it and they're following each other and they're referencing each other when they commit their acts of terrorism."""
US-China trade war could be a 'generational struggle': former US Department of Commerce official,https://finance.yahoo.com,"['Kenneth Underwood', 'Senior Producer']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-china-trade-war-could-be-a-generational-struggle-former-us-department-of-commerce-official-210135805.html,"U.S. stocks recovered Tuesday following the worst trading day this year.

The seesaw market action highlights what could be the beginning of a wild ride for investors as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a never-ending trade battle.

“I think what we, the market should expect is continuing volatility for the foreseeable future,” Stefan Selig, former under secretary of commerce for international trade at the U.S. Department of Commerce, told Yahoo Finance’s On the Move. “This is going to be a continuing pattern, where you're going to have increased tensions between the two sides, no easy resolution to what is a highly complex issue. I think the president and the administration losing patience, then they weigh in with some other initiative, whether it's labeling China a currency manipulator or adding Huawei and other companies to the entity list or raising tariffs or increasing the breadth of tariffs.”

On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it does not expect a trade truce to come before the 2020 election, leading many to wonder what the White House hopes to achieve.

“The question is, what are we waiting for?,” said Selig. “If we're waiting for some grand bargain that addresses all of the commercial and economic issues we have with China, that is not going to happen anytime soon… Are we going to fundamentally get them to reform their economy with that large state-owned enterprise sector? I think that is not going to happen anytime soon. And this could be, frankly, a generational struggle.”

For the time being, there Is no end in sight. The next round of trade talks are scheduled to take place next month when Chinese representatives are expected to visit the U.S.

“The ability for the United States and the Western economies to accommodate a large, non-market economy like China, we've never done this before, so we have no experience,” Selig said. “And as a result of that, we really don't have any sort of blueprint to really go forward with.”

Councilors vow to replace funds with non-federal money

LAS CRUCES - The city council voted Monday to reject $48,391 in funding from the Department of Homeland Security's controversial Operation Stonegarden program.

Nominally the grant is to support cooperation between U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Border Patrol and local law enforcement agencies along the U.S.-Mexico border. It has funded overtime pay and the purchase of vehicles and other equipment.

Las Cruces Police Chief Patrick Gallagher presented on behalf of accepting the grant, assuring councilors, ""the Las Cruces Police Department is not in the business of enforcing of immigration law,"" per department policy as well as a city resolution the council passed in 2017.

Local reporting on local governance: subscribe to the Las Cruces Sun-News today.

Gallagher said the funds are used primarily for narcotics enforcement and to intercept human traffickers. The majority of the money, a small portion of a grant received by the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Office, is used to defray costs of overtime and mileage. Gallagher said three patrol vehicles have also been purchased with Stonegarden funds.

Gallagher credited Stonegarden funds with making possible 33 drug seizures since 2015 and said the police department had made three referrals to Border Patrol in that time, related to criminal activity but not, he said, pertaining to individuals.

""I cannot tell you for sure what will happen to crime"" without Stonegarden funds, Gallagher said, and he raised the possibility that the government could request the return of the patrol vehicles.

The Sheriff’s Office has received funding from Operation Stonegarden since 2007. In 2018, during the administration of former Sheriff Enrique “Kiki” Vigil, DASO was accused of referring more than 500 cases to the Border Patrol over a one-year period as part of Operation Stonegarden.

The current sheriff, Kim Stewart, was elected in 2018. Gallagher has been chief of the Las Cruces Police Department since January of 2018.

'Did we purchase those vehicles unlawfully?'

On Monday, councilors repeatedly expressed their trust and confidence in the current city police and county sheriff's department. However, they questioned the federal program, both for its present connection to federal immigration policy under the Trump Administration and over lax accountability standards of the program itself.

Digging into the grant's contractual terms, Councilor Yvonne Flores said, ""It does not designate at all what the functions and what the purpose of the monies are. ... Throughout the language of these agreements it states, 'projects, projects, projects.' There is nothing in there about what the nature of the projects are, it says nothing in there about how the delegation and work is going to be between the state, the county, and the city.""

Flores said the program lacked safeguards against abuse or corruption.

Gallagher said he keeps a close watch on overtime claims and manages grant funds ethically. ""When it comes to overtime abuse, if I saw it, I deal with it; and it would be dealt with severely,"" he said.

Doña Ana County Undersheriff Jaime Quezada said the vagueness of the contractual obligations was a strength. ""Stonegarden is a grant that's used nationwide. It all depends on what the criminal intel that they have, how it fits for some areas … It can be applied however it's necessary for that area.""

Councilor Gabriel Vasquez focused his criticism on the federal government, citing a 2017 Inspector General finding that DHS was not properly monitoring the use of Stonegarden funds.

Vasquez praised LCPD after Gallagher confirmed that the city's fingerprint system and interface with federal database is separate from, and independent of, the Border Patrol's system.

The councilor then questioned whether the purchase of patrol vehicles was a proper expenditure of funds under the current terms of the grant, which prohibit general-use vehicles such as patrol units. ""Did we purchase those vehicles unlawfully?"" he asked.

Councilors support replacing grant with local funds

""I don't want to be tied to this federal grant,"" Vasquez said. ""I think we have enough money in our operational budget to support a $48,000 increase that pays for the same thing: overtime and mileage that allows you to continue these operations.""

In the ensuing discussion, other councilors expressed support for approving equivalent funding, independently of the funding program.

Before voting, Vasquez and other councilors pledged to act on a resolution restoring money provided by Operation Stonegarden, without participating in the federal program.

The vote was 5-2 to defeat the resolution, with Councilor Jack Eakman and Mayor Ken Miyagishima voting in favor of the grant.

"At the US Education Department, applications for loan forgiveness languish",https://www.cnbc.com,['Annie Nova'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/under-betsy-devos-defrauded-students-find-it-hard-to-get-rid-of-debt.html,"When Morgan Marler's 5-year-old daughter, Lilian, asks her why she doesn't work anymore, Marler doesn't know what to say.

""I can't explain debt to her,"" Marler, 29, said. ""And how I went to school and it was all for nothing.""

Marler attended ITT Technical Institute, a now-shuttered for-profit school, between 2013 and 2016. The school has since been found to have misled students with false advertisements. Marler, for her part, was told students typically went on to make $70,000 a year. After she graduated, the best jobs she could find were at call centers that paid $10 an hour — less than she'd been making before she enrolled at the school.

Her associates degree at ITT left her with $30,000 in student loans, and she's asked the Department of Education to cancel her debt, but has yet to hear back. That was nearly three years ago.

A federal judge ruled last year that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' delays of an Obama-era regulation aimed at forgiving the student debt of defrauded students were illegal. Still, advocates say, the department continues to neglect the applications of those like Marler."

New Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals',https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456361-new-mexico-says-epa-abandoned-state-in-fight-against-toxic-forever,"New Mexico’s Democratic governor is pushing back against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to help the state fight contamination from “forever chemicals” spread by a military base.

The EPA responded Tuesday that it cannot let ""short-term litigation posturing"" interfere with its mission to protect human and environmental health.

Lujan Grisham’s letter is in reference to a class of chemicals abbreviated as PFAS, cancer-linked substances used in a variety of nonstick products and firefighting foam relied on by the military and airports.

PFAS are often referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment.

The letter, first reported by Politico, is the latest example of frustrations from states in getting the military to work with local leaders in cleaning up contamination.

Some of the blame has been levied against the EPA after suspicions the agency weakened its own PFAS regulations to help the military avoid what could be a $2 billion cleanup bill.

Lawmakers, however, have worked to strengthen the military’s PFAS culpability, including measures in the National Defense Authorization Act to force the military to work with states to clean up contamination.

A measure from Sen. Tom Udall Thomas (Tom) Stewart UdallDemocrats introduce constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United House passes bill requiring CBP to enact safety, hygiene standards Al Franken says he 'absolutely' regrets resigning MORE (D-N.M.) included in the House bill would require the military to provide clean water to farms contaminated by PFAS.

Udall was motivated by the plight of a New Mexico dairy farmer who euthanized 4,000 of his cows after the milk they produced tested positive for high levels of PFAS. That farm, located near a military base, caught the attention of Food and Drug Administration researchers in documenting the spread of PFAS from water to food.

New Mexico sued the Air Force for PFAS contamination in March, and Lujan Grisham’s letter criticizes EPA for reneging on a promise from Wheeler to help the state “with legal and technical assistance in a confidential manner.”

“Providing fact sheets and offering webinars are not meaningful,” she wrote.

In responding to request for comment from The Hill, the EPA pointed to a July letter from the agency’s top lawyer and assistant administrator that said EPA is not permitted to bring judicial action against another executive branch agency.

It goes on to list actions EPA has taken to assist New Mexico, including providing fact sheets and webinars along with attending meetings and calls.

But a separate Friday letter from New Mexico Environment Department head James Kenney to another EPA office disputes that reasoning, arguing that “EPA is unrestricted from taking administrative enforcement actions against federal agencies under its controlling acts.”

The EPA responded to that letter Tuesday, saying its work with New Mexico should not be disparaged.

""If the state has not found our assistance useful, that has not been communicated as we have worked jointly on this issue,"" the agency wrote to the governor, adding that the state's letter ""has the potential to miscommunicate to the public the truth of the federal-state collaboration.""

New Mexico pushed back against the Tuesday letter after it was first reported by The Hill.

""EPA suggests the concerns public officials have for the health and safety of New Mexicans and their environment amount to ‘litigation posturing,’"" Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. ""EPA’s disconnect between what has been offered and what New Mexico needs demonstrates a lack of understanding of what our rural New Mexico communities are facing. The Attorney General and the Environment Department will continue to push on behalf of our communities until PFAS is no longer a threat.""

The Department of Defense did not respond to request for comment.

New Mexico is not alone in its frustration with the EPA or the military. Last month 22 attorneys general wrote a letter to Congress asking lawmakers to compel action from the two agencies.
