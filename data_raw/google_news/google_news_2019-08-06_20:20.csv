Trump attacks Obama for statement on shootings,https://www.politico.com,['Quint Forgey'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/06/trump-attacks-obama-shootings-statement-1448922,"President Donald Trump’s message was a distillation of a sentiment “Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade expressed on air Tuesday morning. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images white house Trump attacks Obama for statement on shootings

President Donald Trump on Tuesday attacked former President Barack Obama over the latter's statement on the weekend’s mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, tweeting edited quotes from Fox News hosts to make his point and again claiming he is “the least racist person” in the world.

“‘Did George Bush ever condemn President Obama after Sandy Hook. President Obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign. Not many people said Obama is out of Control,'” Trump tweeted. “'Mass shootings were happening before the President even thought about running for Pres.' @kilmeade @foxandfriends”

Trump’s message was a distillation of a sentiment “Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade expressed on-air shortly after 6 a.m. The president followed up that tweet with another post paraphrasing a comment from Kilmeade’s morning show colleague, Ainsley Earhardt.

“‘It’s political season and the election is around the corner. They want to continue to push that racist narrative.’ @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends,” Trump continued. “And I am the least racist person. Black, Hispanic and Asian Unemployment is the lowest (BEST) in the history of the United States!”

Obama on Monday afternoon lamented the violence that transpired Saturday morning in El Paso, Texas, and early Sunday morning in Dayton, Ohio, which left at least 31 people dead and dozens more injured.

In his statement, Obama called on Americans to “soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments.” The former president did not mention Trump or any other politician by name.

The 21-year-old white man accused of carrying out the El Paso shooting is suspected of authoring a racist, anti-Hispanic manifesto before the rampage, and many high-profile Democrats have partly blamed the president’s history of incendiary immigration rhetoric for the attack.

Trump on Monday morning condemned “racism, bigotry and white supremacy” during a televised address from the White House. “Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart and devours the soul,” he said.

For years, Trump has referred to himself as the ""least racist"" person on Earth, touting that self-designation as recently as last week after he was widely rebuked for his racially charged criticisms of Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the city of Baltimore and four progressive congresswomen of color."
Trump slams Google over alleged political bias: We're watching 'very closely’,https://www.foxnews.com,['James Rogers'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/trump-google-political-bias-allegations,"President Trump has slammed Google and its CEO Sundar Pichai in the wake of recent allegations of anti-conservative bias at the tech giant.

In a series of tweets early Tuesday, Trump attacked the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm, citing former Google engineer Kevin Cernekee’s recent allegations of bias within the company.

The president mentioned his recent meeting with Pichai in the Oval Office, adding that the Google chief ""was working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing"" and ""that they didn’t help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election.""

REPUBLICAN ENGINEER FIRED BY GOOGLE SLAMS TECH GIANT OVER ALLEGED 'BULLYING' OF CONSERVATIVES: REPORT

Trump said that Pichai told him that Google is ""NOT planning to illegally subvert the 2020 election despite all that has been said to the contrary.""

“It all sounded good until I watched Kevin Cernekee, a Google engineer, say terrible things about what they did in 2016,"" Trump added. He also referenced Cernekee's comments that the tech giant wants to make sure that Trump loses the 2020 election.

Additionally, Trump mentioned Lou Dobbs’ interview on Fox Business with Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and Breitbart senior editor at large.

GOOGLE'S HISTORY OF CLASHING WITH CONSERVATIVES

“We are watching Google very closely!” the president added.

Fox News has reached out to Google with a request for comment on this story.

Cernekee was fired in June 2018 after Google told him that he was terminated for misuse of the company’s equipment, including its software system for remote access. However, Cernekee, who describes himself as a whistleblower, maintains that he was terminated for his outspoken conservative views.

Google told Fox News that Cernekee was fired for multiple violations of company policies.

Cernekee’s story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The former Google engineer has also reportedly filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board. Some of the complaints were denied, but the original is pending, according to The Journal.

JAMES DAMORE SUES GOOGLE, CLAIMS TECH GIANT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST WHITE CONSERVATIVE MEN

The National Labor Relations Board declined to comment when contacted by Fox News.

Cernekee’s alleged posts on a Google internal listserv about white supremacist Richard Spencer and the Golden State Skinheads have also come under scrutiny recently. In an interview with the Daily Caller, the former Google engineer said he is the target of “false and baseless smears from a jealous and vindictive ex-colleague.”

In an op-ed posted on the Human Events website, Cernekee described himself as “an active participant in the nascent Free Speech movement at Google.” He said that “every American, from Communists to Nazis to everybody in between, deserves free speech so long as they are not advocating violence or breaking the law.”

GOOGLE EMPLOYEES DONATE HEAVILY TO WARREN, SANDERS DESPITE CALLS FOR TECH GIANT'S BREAKUP

“To that end, I occasionally defended the free speech of extremists, and I frequently spoke out against Antifa mobs who supported shutting down political expression through force,” he wrote. “When the infamous white nationalist leader Richard Spencer was sucker punched in the face during an interview, several Googlers openly defended the violent act and took to internal company forums to promote the idea that ‘Nazis deserve to be punched’.”

“While I strongly disagree with Spencer’s views, I found this precedent absolutely horrifying, and I spoke out,” he added. “I also spoke out against a masked gang of Antifa thugs who violently attacked a skinhead group. I would have unabashedly defended far-left activists if violent right wingers had attacked them.”

Fox News has reached out to Cernekee with a request for comment on this story.

GOOGLE EMPLOYEE'S VIRAL MEMO ALLEGES DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PREGNANT WOMEN: REPORT

Allegations of anti-conservative bias continue to swirl around Google. Republican lawmakers recently criticized Google during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into allegations of bias against conservatives and censorship of conservative groups on the company’s platforms.

Last year, James Damore, a onetime Google employee who was fired after he wrote a memo criticizing the firm for pushing diversity, filed a class-action lawsuit against the tech giant. Damore is now in arbitration with Google.

Damore was fired in 2017 after he wrote a memo criticizing Google for pushing mentoring and diversity programs and for “alienating conservatives.” He also blamed biological differences for the relative lack of women in tech.

Data from the Federal Election Commission compiled and analyzed by Recode, recently found that Google employees are donating heavily to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. This is despite the fact both Democratic presidential candidates are calling for the breakup of Google's parent company, Alphabet.

"New York Times’ Dean Baquet on Trump Front-Page Controversy: ‘It Was a Bad Headline, and We Changed It’",https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Lloyd Grove', 'Editor At Large']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-times-dean-baquet-on-trump-front-page-controversy-it-was-a-bad-headline-and-we-changed-it,"New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet acknowledged Tuesday that his newspaper messed up with a front-page headline over its lead story on President Donald Trump’s Monday televised address.

Trump, who spent the weekend offering “thoughts and prayers” and tweeting attacks on “fake news” among other perceived enemies from his New Jersey golf club, gave his stiffly delivered speech on TelePrompTer in the aftermath of two mass shootings that have left 31 dead in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio—to which the 45th president mistakenly referred as “Toledo” at one point in his remarks.

“TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM,” blazoned the four-column headline at the top-right of the front page of the Times’ first edition—a strangely credulous framing of an appropriately skeptical story by Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman.

It was a mistake that immediately prompted widespread criticism from high-profile Trump detractors once images of the paper’s front page surfaced online Monday night; it also provoked attacks on the Times’ political coverage generally, and even vows to cancel subscriptions.

“It was written on deadline and when it was passed along for approval we all saw it was a bad headline and changed it pretty quickly,” Baquet texted The Daily Beast on Tuesday morning as critics continued to vent their outrage on social media.

Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Washington think tank the Center for American Progress, was typical of the Times’ army of critics, implying that the paper had caved to Trump’s constant attacks on the news media.

“What makes Trump happy is the ability to attack the press in the morning, and then precisely because of his bullying, they accept his narrative that he’s fighting racism,” she tweeted. “Nothing makes him happier. Indeed, he wants media that kowtow to him to flourish.”

Tanden added: “There are really amazing reporters at this newspaper who are let down by this bullshit.”

Joan Walsh, a CNN contributor and a columnist for the left-leaning Nation magazine, announced to her Twitter followers late Monday night: “I canceled my subscription. I know a lot of folks will tell me I’m wrong. I will miss it. But I can’t keep rewarding such awful news judgment. ‘Trump Urges Unity Against Racism’ is almost as bad as their full-page Comey letter coverage just before 2016 election. Nobody learns.”

That was a reference to the Times’ flood-the-zone coverage of then-FBI Director James Comey’s late-October announcement that his agency was re-opening their investigation of then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of her State Department emails.

In a subsequent tweet, Walsh added: “A lot of people love the paper but are deeply disappointed in much of its political coverage for the last four years. I hope somebody in charge pays attention, but I probably stayed up too late in vain.”

Baquet, for his part, texted: “I understand the concern people have. Headlines matter. But I hope they read the coverage, which I will argue was strong.”

Baquet declined to respond on the record to questions concerning how this error specifically occurred, how the Times will avoid such mistakes in the future, and various critics’ claims that this is only the latest in a series of missteps in the paper’s political and Trump-world coverage.

A Times spokesperson emailed: “The original print headline was clearly flawed and was changed for all editions after the first”—the earliest edition of the ink-on-paper Times that is distributed out of state and nationally.

Syndicated columnist Connie Schultz, a Pulitzer Prize winner and wife of Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, tweeted: “The New York Times changed its headline for the second edition, but this [the original headline] is the one that landed on our doorstep & is displayed in storefronts throughout our majority-black zip code. What a betrayal, pretending this president is not the racist we know him to be.”

The revised print headline, which better captured the newspaper’s reporting, was “ASSAILING HATE, BUT NOT GUNS”—but that seemed to do little to mollify the Times’ critics.

The paper was not without its defenders, however—among them, former Executive Editor Jill Abramson, who was fired from that job in 2014 and hasn’t been shy since then about second-guessing the journalistic judgments of her successor, Baquet.

“That’s part of this culture now—overreactions to everything,” Abramson told The Daily Beast about the social-media eruptions over the first-edition headline. “What provokes the ‘going nuts’ is understandable. But it’s an overreaction. What’s wrong is the people who see some conspiracy inside the Times to be nice to Trump. That’s absurd. Or ‘Let’s be really hard on Hillary.’ That just doesn’t happen. And when it happens, it’s a genuine mistake—and they fess up to it. ‘I’m going to cancel my subscription’ is silly.”

Abramson added: “The coverage over the past couple of days has been excellent in showing the racist roots” of Trump’s attacks on immigrants via Twitter and at his campaign rallies. “I thought their coverage of [Trump’s] ‘Send them back’ [attacks] was tough and interesting, and about the Squad [the four congresswomen of color whom the president trashed]—they examined all of the racist roots of that type of language. They’ve been all over the issue of how Trump uses racist memes.”"
"Trump Left A Lot Unsaid About Mass Shootings, Domestic Terrorism — And His Own Words",https://www.npr.org,['Domenico Montanaro'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/06/748396590/trump-left-a-lot-unsaid-about-mass-shootings-domestic-terrorism-and-his-own-word,"Trump Left A Lot Unsaid About Mass Shootings, Domestic Terrorism — And His Own Words

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images

President Trump went before cameras on Monday in highly anticipated remarks following the mass shootings in Ohio and Texas over the weekend. In his remarks at the White House, Trump used the words ""domestic terrorism"" and ""white supremacy."" He did not acknowledge his own rhetoric.

The president targeted violent video games and drew a connection between mass shootings and mental health, though the research does not back up his assertions.

Trump touted what he has already done on trying to limit gun violence and called for the passage of red flag laws, intended to temporarily take guns from those who pose a threat to themselves or others.

But he stopped short of calling for new gun restrictions such as a ban on assault-style weapons, high-capacity magazines or even stricter background checks.

""Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger,"" Trump said, ""not the gun.""

Here is some of what the president left out, and the context to what he said.

""Words do matter"": Trump acknowledged ""white supremacy,"" but ignored his own rhetoric

In his remarks at the White House, Trump denounced racism, calling out an anti-Hispanic screed apparently written by the suspect in the El Paso, Texas, shooting.

""The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online, consumed by racist hate,"" Trump said. ""In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America.""

Yet Trump has faced sharp criticism for his own comments, particularly about immigrants, from the inception of his political rise.

In just the past year, Trump has used the word ""invasion"" or ""invade"" in tweets 10 times to refer to immigrants.

In a tweet in October of last year, for example, he wrote of people migrating from Central America: ""This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!""

""When you're people in power, words do matter,"" said Daryl Johnson, the former lead analyst at the Department of Homeland Security for domestic terrorism. ""When you dehumanize your opponents, whether Democrats, the news, immigrants, people of faith, of different faiths, you're running the risk of someone taking your words and acting upon it.""

Johnson wrote a report on right-wing domestic violent extremism in 2009 that became embroiled in controversy. That report concluded that right-wing extremist groups, spurred by a downward trending economy and the first black president, were recruiting and were on the rise.

The NPR Politics Podcast 'Hate Has No Place' In America, Trump Says After Deadly Shootings 'Hate Has No Place' In America, Trump Says After Deadly Shootings Listen · 22:16 22:16

Conservatives pushed back hard against the report, which also concluded that veterans coming home from war could be susceptible to recruitment efforts. Johnson wrote in an opinion column in 2017 that the Obama administration essentially ""caved to the political pressure""; his unit was disbanded and by 2010, he noted, there were zero intelligence analysts working on domestic terrorism at the Department of Homeland Security.

Johnson said that with Trump in office the recruitment, prevalence of the groups and hate crimes have spiked. He said rhetoric referring to people as ""invaders, rodents, from craphole countries — this is the type of talk I see in racial chat rooms.""

After multiple Mexican nationals died or were injured in the El Paso shooting, Mexico threatened legal action against the United States to protect its citizens.

Trump cut funding to an agency dealing with domestic terrorism partnerships

The Trump administration actually cut funding for programs that targeted white supremacy and white nationalism.

Soon after Trump took office, his administration canceled a pair of grants. One was aimed at helping people leave neo-Nazi groups, and another ""would have been used to create media campaigns to undermine violent radicalism on U.S. soil,"" NPR member station WUNC reported in 2017.

The Trump administration slashed the budget of the agency that administered the grants, as The Atlantic reported, from $21 million to $3 million.

The Office of Community Partnerships was renamed the Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships.

Researchers have never found a link between video games and mass shootings

For 20 years, since the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, politicians — Republican and Democrat — have called for restrictions on violent video games to curtail mass shootings. The shooters at Columbine played the game Doom.

Trump did it again Monday in his remarks. ""We must stop the glorification of violence in our society,"" he said. ""This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately.""

National Video Games Are Still Blamed For Gun Violence Despite Studies Showing No Connection Video Games Are Still Blamed For Gun Violence Despite Studies Showing No Connection Listen · 3:36 3:36

And yet, researchers have never found a direct link between violent video games and mass shootings.

Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist and director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, has studied the potential link between video games and aggressive behavior in teens.

""Mainly, we found a whole bunch of nothing,"" he told NPR's Andrew Limbong. ""So we found pretty convincing evidence that it didn't really matter what kinds of games teenagers played. Boys and girls, violent games, nonviolent games — that wasn't really a useful piece of information about whether or not a parent saw aggressive behaviors in their young person.""

There's also no evidence that either the El Paso or Dayton shooter was a fan of video games.

Trump ties shootings to mental health treatment, intervention

Trump said there's a need to ""reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment but when necessary involuntary confinement.""

Most mental health professionals would dispute the notion of a direct link between gun violence and mental health, NPR's Alison Kodjak reported in 2017. In fact, the majority of people with mental health problems are not more likely to be violent.

""Blaming mental illness for the gun violence in our country is simplistic and inaccurate and goes against the scientific evidence currently available,"" Arthur C. Evans, CEO of the American Psychological Association, said in a statement.

He pointed out that the United States is a ""global outlier"" in mass shootings.

""This difference is not explained by the rate of mental illness in the U.S,"" Evans said. ""The one stark difference? Access to guns.""

And, he said: ""The president clearly said that it is time to stop the hateful rhetoric that is infecting the public discourse. We ask that he use his powerful position to model that behavior.""

Pushing for red flag laws

Trump also called for adoption of extreme risk laws, or red flag laws, which allow police to temporarily seize guns from people who are determined to be a risk to themselves or others.

""We must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms, and that, if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process,"" Trump said. ""That is why I have called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders.""

While the details vary from state to state, more than a dozen states have adopted red flag laws. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is also pushing for a federal red flag law.

The laws are so far seen to be effective in reducing gun-related suicides, though a federal school safety commission noted in December, ""We do not know whether they impact gun violence more generally.""

The administration's past actions — and inaction

Trump touted what his administration has already done on the issue of gun violence, but said ""there is so much more that we have to do.""

He noted that the Justice Department has banned bump stocks, devices that can increase the rate of fire. He pointed to the 2018 STOP School Violence Act and the Fix NICS Act.

Congress passed the STOP School Violence Act after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018. It provided $50 million a year to the Justice Department for state-based grants that would help with school training and security infrastructure, as well as creating ""anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence, including mobile telephone applications, hotlines, and internet websites.""

The Fix NICS bill was intended to strengthen the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. It encourages agencies to fully participate in the reporting system and upload data.

After Parkland, Trump said he would be ""strongly pushing"" for ""comprehensive background checks,"" raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21 and for ending the sale of bump stocks.

Of those commitments, the administration only acted on ending the sale of bump stocks.

Trump did tweet again about background checks on Monday, but left out that call in his televised remarks."
China responds to US after Treasury designates Beijing a 'currency manipulator',https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/trade-war-china-responds-to-us-after-claim-of-being-a-currency-manipulator.html,"China's central bank has firmly rejected the U.S. Treasury's designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator, saying the accusation has ""seriously"" undermined the international financial order and risked further market turmoil.

The response from the People's Bank of China comes at a time of rapidly intensifying trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

On Monday, the U.S. Treasury accused Beijing of deliberately influencing the exchange rate between the yuan and the U.S. dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade.""

The move fulfills President Donald Trump's promise to recognize China as a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.

The announcement followed a sharp drop in the yuan against the dollar, with the Chinese currency breaching the 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008. A drop in a currency's value makes that country's products cheaper on the international market.

""The United States disregards the facts and unreasonably affixes China with the label of 'currency manipulators,' which is a behavior that harms others and oneself,"" the PBOC said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Chinese side firmly opposes this.""

The PBOC said it would not only ""seriously undermine the international financial order, but also trigger financial market turmoil. It will also greatly hinder international trade and the global economic recovery, and ultimately will suffer from it.""

China's central bank set the yuan's official reference point at stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-the-dollar point on Tuesday.

The move appeared to calm financial markets, initially rocked by fears the U.S.-China trade war was devolving into a currency war.

Late last week, China promised to fight back after Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had not been hit with U.S. duties."
DHS Official: Trump Can’t Admit ‘This Is Terrorism’,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-official-on-el-paso-and-dayton-trump-cant-admit-this-is-terrorism,"After a weekend of carnage, President Trump said some things that sounded heartening. But current and former law enforcement officials say the president’s words aren’t enough—and they fear it’s all he has to offer.

Thirty-one people were killed between attacks on public places in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in the span of 12 hours this past weekend. While authorities say they have no motive yet for the Dayton attack, officials said the accused El Paso attacker wrote a manifesto justifying the mass murder of Hispanic people to stop their “invasion” of the U.S. Federal prosecutors said they’re considering domestic terrorism charges for the attacker. (Days earlier, a gunman expressing similar racist views killed three people at a food festival in California.)

“This is a clear manifestation of the political discourse that has taken place in the country over the past two years or so,” one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told The Daily Beast. “It cannot be blamed on mental health. This is an ideology-driven hate crime. This is terrorism and the White House has trouble labeling it as such. It is very frustrating.”

In remarks Monday from the White House, the president blamed violent video games and mental health problems for the carnage. He called for the implementation of red flag laws, also known as risk protection orders, that let people petition a judge to have the guns of their friends and family taken away if they worry that person will harm others. He even went so far to say “ our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” —something he has shied away from in the past.

The DHS official called the remarks “demoralizing,” noting the president’s effort to spread the blame around.

Despite the president’s call for reforms, current and former law enforcement officials say they aren’t satisfied. Sources say white supremacy is a significant threat to U.S. national security, and one mention in a 10-minute presidential speech won’t cut it.

“It is a good step to recognize the threat of white supremacy, but words alone cannot solve the problem,” said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who specialized in counterterrorism cases. “Action speaks louder than words. What kind of policy, legislations, designation, and funding is the administration willing to propose, support, and authorize in order to counter this emerging threat? This is where the rubber meets the road.”

Some officials said they put little stock in Trump’s words, worrying that the president would, as in the past, backtrack on his statements on white supremacy.

Others said Trump’s brief condemnation of the ideology meant little following his statements earlier in the day that linked the weekend’s shootings to the need for new immigration legislation—the accused El Paso shooter said immigration was destroying the country.

“I am concerned that white supremacist thought leaders will view his tweet linking immigration reform with background checks as a tacit signal that he still supports their agenda,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “It is mind-boggling he would blend the two issues. I don’t think there is a thorough understanding of the issues at the White House.”

Despite the concern surrounding Trump’s rhetoric on white supremacy, the intelligence community appears to be taking a new, active step in addressing the threat. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is hosting a conference on domestic terrorism with the FBI and DHS next month, according to a person familiar with the plans. An invitation to the event said the conference will scrutinize the federal government’s response to the threat in light of the recent deadly attacks by white supremacists on synagogues in Pennsylvania and California and mosques in New Zealand.

If Trump’s speech was any indication of where the White House plans to focus its efforts following the fatal shootings over the weekend, it seems white supremacy is an afterthought.

The president focused his speech on tracking individuals with mental illnesses.

“Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,” Trump said. “We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement.”

Authorities have not offered evidence that the accused gunmen in El Paso and Dayton were mentally ill. The American Psychological Association said in response to Trump’s remarks: “Blaming mental illness for the gun violence in our country is simplistic and inaccurate and goes against the scientific evidence currently available.”

Trump went on to say that he directed the Department of Justice to work with other law enforcement agencies and social media companies to better detect people he said were mentally ill and liable to kill.

“We must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs,” Trump said.

Federal law enforcement agencies have in the past worked with DHS as well as state and local law enforcement to track people who may endanger others, including veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with criminal pasts. National Security Agency software company Beware at one point let local police departments calculate individuals’ threat levels by collecting things like arrest reports, property records, and social media postings. Meanwhile, the FBI tracks potential terrorist attacks by opening official investigations. Many of those probes have focused on Muslim terrorist suspects following 9/11 and the rise of ISIS.

The only question now, law enforcement officials say, is whether the president will order a crackdown on white supremacist violence.

“The president did what presidents should do, which is condemn bigotry and hatred,” said George Selim, a former DHS official who now works at the Anti-Defamation League. “But what’s needed is resources, strategy, and policy. And the real measure of these horrible atrocities is if the resources, strategy, and policy of the federal government matches the president’s comments today.

“How many lives need to be lost before action is accelerated and the administration works with Congress? The time is now.”"

The USDA recently moved its National Institute of Food and Agriculture and Economic Research Service offices, saying the change was financially sound and put its researchers closer geographically to American farmland.

The USDA has instructed all affected employees to report by Sept. 30 and has rejected a union proposal to let some employees to continue working from Washington.

The USDA’s general counsel, Stephen Vaden, has argued that the department is not bound by laws requiring it to secure congressional approval to spend the money to relocate, claiming the law in question is unconstitutional.

The inspector general’s report counters that Vaden's claim is “not consistent with prior positions taken by the Department.”

“To reach management decision on this recommendation and to ensure consistent treatment going forward, the Department needs to communicate, in writing, this change of interpretation to USDA leaders at the Sub-Cabinet and Agency levels,” the report states.

In a comment to The Hill, the USDA said, ""The Department is not required to abide by provisions that have been deemed unconstitutional, therefore we will not take the OIG’s recommendation to ignore nearly forty years of precedent set by the Supreme Court, Office of Legal Counsel, and the Government Accountability Office – an arm of Congress.""

""Since the Inspector General affirms the Department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed. This is opinion based on policy decisions that have no basis in fact,"" the department added.

But the judge, an appointee of President George W. Bush, sounded increasingly skeptical of the government's arguments pressing him to leave the redactions untouched.

“That’s what open government is about,” Walton said during one exchange, citing the resolution of a 2008 sex crimes case against financier Jeffrey Epstein as an example of how obfuscating the reasons behind not prosecuting high-profile people generates public distrust in the country’s criminal justice system.

Indeed, EPIC and BuzzFeed filed their lawsuit in order to uncover such information — the redacted explanation of why the special counsel didn’t bring charges against the likes of Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner. And in court Monday, their attorneys argued that disclosing these details would help resolve whether the president is right to claim the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was a “witch hunt.”

“It’s something that frankly ripped this country apart,” argued Matt Topic, an attorney for BuzzFeed, regarding the competing and often bitter partisan claims surrounding the credibility of Mueller’s investigation. “The people deserve to know as much as they possibly can.”

Monday’s court arguments represent one of the many ways the Mueller investigation continues to linger even though the special counsel’s office shuttered earlier this spring. House Judiciary Committee Democrats last month asked the chief judge of the D.C. District Court to issue an order to let them see the underlying materials the special counsel used. The Democrats said they need the information to make a decision about whether to impeach the president.

While Walton has the power to issue an opinion that goes directly to the BuzzFeed and EPIC lawsuit, he’s also weighing another incremental step the two organizations have requested. Essentially, they asked Walton to review the unredacted Mueller report to see if the exemptions the Justice Department is citing to block release of the full document actually line up with what’s allowed under the law.

Several of the judge’s questions appeared designed to understand what he’d get out of doing that kind of analysis himself. But he also made several comments over the course of the hearing suggesting where he may fall.

For example, Walton said he had “some concerns” about trying to reconcile public statements Trump and Attorney General William Barr have made about the report with the content of the report itself.

The judge pointed to Trump’s claims that Mueller found “no collusion” between his campaign and Russia and the president’s insistence that he had been exonerated from a possible obstruction of justice charge. These comments, Walton said, appeared bolstered by Barr’s description of Mueller’s findings during a DOJ news conference — before the public and media could read the document for themselves.

“It’d seem to be inconsistent with what the report itself said,” Walton said. The judge also cited a letter Mueller’s office sent to Barr questioning the attorney general’s decision to release a four-page summary of the investigation’s conclusions that “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance” of the report.

Separately on Monday, Walton raised questions about a DOJ submission defending the agency’s decision to black out large portions of the Mueller report.

“I also worked for the department,” Walton said. “Sometimes the body does what the head wants.”

Courtney Enlow, a DOJ trial attorney, defended the Mueller report redactions and insisted they all fall inside the exemptions allowed under FOIA, such as the need to keep grand jury information private and protect the government’s investigative methods. The government can also withhold information for national security purposes or to maintain people’s privacy.

Enlow argued that additional disclosures would harm several ongoing investigations Mueller handed off to other federal prosecutors. And she warned that releasing redacted information in the special counsel report could undercut longtime Trump aide Roger Stone’s ability to get a fair trial in his case that centers on lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing justice. He is set to stand trial in November.

“Nothing more is required here, your honor,” Enlow said.

Enlow also said Buzzfeed and EPIC lawyers are “speculating” as they seek to highlight potential disclosures that would come should the redactions be removed from the report, which she noted were made with help from Mueller’s team.

“This is not a singular person who was making decisions with redactions,” she said.

At the conclusion of the hearing, Walton acknowledged the likelihood that whatever he does will generate an appeal. “I’ll try to get this done as quickly as I can, so we can have this matter resolved one way or another,” he said."
"Trump to visit El Paso mass shooting site, in spite of Dems' warning to stay away",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-visit-el-paso-mass-shooting-site-as-2020-dems-warn-him-to-stay-away,"El Paso, Texas, Mayor Dee Margo told reporters on Monday that President Trump will visit the city on Wednesday, even as several prominent Democrats indirectly blamed the president for Saturday's mass shooting there -- with some warning him, in frank terms, to stay away.

News of Trump's planned appearance teed up a potentially bitter national political moment just four days after suspected gunman Patrick Crusius, 21, allegedly opened fire at a Walmart and killed 22 people while injuring more than two dozen others.

""He is president of the United States,"" Margo, a Republican, told reporters. ""So in that capacity, I will fulfill my obligations as mayor of El Paso, and hope that if we are expressing specifics that we can get him to come through for us.""

MCCONNELL SIGNALS WILLINGNESS TO BACK 'BIPARTISAN' GUN VIOLENCE SOLUTIONS

The mayor said he anticipated ""political spin"" and was “already getting the emails and the phone calls” from individuals ""with lots of time on their hands,"" but that his focus remains on his community, not politics. He added that Trump had called and was ""very gracious"" and offered any support necessary.

“We’re dealing with a tragedy of 22 people who have perished by the hateful, evil act of a white supremacist,” Margo said. “I don’t know how we deal with evil. I don’t have a textbook for dealing with it other than the Bible.

""I’m sorry. We are going to go through this,"" he continued. ""The president is coming out. I will meet with the president. I guess for people who have lots of time on their hands, I will deal with the emails and phone calls.”

The White House has not confirmed Trump's schedule, or whether he will also visit Dayton, Ohio -- where a gunman who reportedly supported the violent left-wing group Antifa, as well as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, killed nine people over the weekend. But the Federal Aviation Administration has advised pilots of a presidential visit Wednesday to both El Paso and Dayton.

Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat, told reporters that she had ""not gotten a call"" about a presidential visit as of late Monday, and didn't have more details.

VICTIMS OF EL PASO SHOOTING INCLUDED MOTHER SHIELDING SON FROM BULLETS, TEEN ABOUT TO START SOPHOMORE YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL

But both before and after Margo's announcement, several Democrats forcefully urged Trump not to visit El Paso. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, who represents the district that is home to the Walmart where Saturday’s shooting took place, lashed out at the president on Monday morning -- placing some of the blame for the weekend’s tragedy at his feet.

“The president has made my community and my people the enemy,” she told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“He has told the country that we are people to be feared, people to be hated,"" Escobar continued. ""From my perspective, he is not welcome here. He should not come here while we are in mourning.”

And Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, urged Margo in a televised interview to ""quietly"" tell Trump that he is not ""welcome"" in the city, because of his rhetoric on immigration.

Ryan has escalated his language in the last 24 hours, as he struggles to raise his political profile. He tweeted “Fck me” after Trump mistakenly, at one point in his televised remarks earlier in the day, said the Ohio shooting took place in Toledo and not Dayton.

For Ryan, the language appeared to be part of a deliberate approach: Earlier Monday, the longshot candidate went on CNN and tore into Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, saying, ""Mitch McConnell needs to get off his a-- and do something.” On Sunday, he tweeted: “Republicans need to get their s--- together and stop pandering to the NRA. Period.”

2020 DEMS UNLEASH PROFANE ATTACKS ON TRUMP, REPUBLICANS OVER MASS SHOOTINGS

Sanders also called out the president, saying ""I say to President Trump, please stop the racist anti-immigrant rhetoric. Stop the hatred in this country which is creating the kind of violence that we see.""

In 2017, a far-left Sanders supporter fired upon a Republican congressional baseball practice, critically wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and injuring three others before U.S. Capitol Police took him down. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said the gunman was screaming, ""This is for healthcare."" Sanders did not take responsibility for that episode.

Trump, for his part, on Monday called for reforms at the intersection of mental health and gun laws -- including so-called ""red flag laws"" to take guns from those deemed a public risk -- in the wake of the back-to-back mass shootings over the weekend, which left at least 31 people dead in total.

The Trump administration previously enacted an unprecedented ban on firearm bump stocks that enable weapons to fire with greater rapidity, like machine guns -- and the ban was recently upheld by the Supreme Court. The move came after a 2017 massacre in Las Vegas, Nevada killed 58 people.

In unequivocal terms, the president on Monday also condemned white supremacy, responding to reports that the shooter in El Paso wrote a racist manifesto ahead of the violence. The manifesto specifically said that Trump's rhetoric was not to blame for the shooting, and said the shooter's views ""predate"" Trump's presidential campaign.

However, some observers cautioned that mass shooters are increasingly using disingenuous manifestos primarily as a means to cause division and sow political discord, rather than to advance a particular agenda. Crusius became the third mass shooter this year believed to have posted to the website 8Chan, which is a haven for both ironic trolls and racists, prior to going on a shooting rampage.

""The first mistake people are making is to assume the creep meant anything he said in his manifesto,"" wrote columnist Brian Cates. ""Something new has been added into the mix in the last year and we have to recognize it: Mass shootings done for **fun** as the ultimate troll where these [shooters] write confusing manifestos and then sit back & watch the fun as both sides claim he belongs to the other.""

Cates pointed out that the Christchurch, New Zealand mass shooter's manifesto contained a mixture of left-wing and right-wing rhetoric, and by its own explicit terms, was intended to cause international political division. The purported El Paso manifesto, like the New Zealand shooter's manifesto, also espoused eco-fascist principles and lamented the destruction of the environment.

Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden falsely suggested after Trump's remarks that Monday was the first time the president had condemned white supremacy.

Later, McConnell – a Republican who has been lambasted by Democrats for refusing to allow votes on gun control legislation – said Monday he is willing to consider “bipartisan” solutions in the wake of the mass shootings, though he emphasized that he opposes gun control policies that infringe “on Americans’ constitutional rights.”

Democrats have been demanding McConnell recall Congress from its current recess, which is slated to run to the second week of September, to address the matter.

The political fight over Trump's visit came amid a series of rapid-fire developments in the investigations in both El Paso and Dayton. Crusius was booked on capital murder charges, and authorities said Sunday that he is under investigation for alleged domestic terrorism. Officials were also looking into whether hate crime charges are appropriate.

El Paso District Attorney Jaime Esparza said his office will seek the death penalty against the suspect.

""The loss of life is so great, we certainly have never seen this in our community. We are a very safe community,"" he told reporters at a news conference on Sunday. ""We pride ourselves on the fact that we're so safe, and certainly this community is rocked, shocked and saddened by what has happened here yesterday.""

DEMS DEMAND RECALL OF CONGRESS TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE

El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said Monday that the gunman got lost in a neighborhood before ending up at Walmart ""because, we understand, he was hungry."" Allen didn't elaborate. Crusius' hometown is the affluent Dallas suburb of Allen.

The police chief said the gun used in the shooting was legally purchased near the suspect's hometown.

In his application for a public defender on Monday, Crusius said he has been unemployed for five months, and has no income, assets or expenses. He claimed he has been living with his grandparents.

In Ohio, authorities revealed that the gunman in the Dayton rampage, 24-year-old Connor Betts, opened fire outside a bar around 1 a.m. Sunday, killing his adult sister and eight others. Police say he was fatally shot by officers within 30 seconds, and was wearing a mask, bulletproof vest, earplugs and had at least 100 rounds.

Authorities provided a dramatic video of officers rushing onto the scene and taking Betts out before he could enter another packed bar.

Police had not determined a motive for the attack as of Monday evening. Reports linked him to Antifa, and showed that he supported Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Betts was armed with an AR-15-style rifle, police said. If all of the magazines he had with him were full, which hasn't been confirmed, he would have had a maximum of 250 rounds, said Police Chief Richard Biehl.

""It is fundamentally problematic. To have that level of weaponry in a civilian environment is problematic,"" Biehl added.

Of the more than 30 people injured in Ohio, at least 14 had gunshot wounds; others were hurt as people fled, city officials said. Eleven remained hospitalized Monday, Fire Chief Jeffrey Payne said.

Still unknown is whether Betts targeted any of the victims, including his 22-year-old sister, Megan, the youngest of the dead.

""It seems to just defy believability he would shoot his own sister, but it's also hard to believe that he didn't recognize it was his sister, so we just don't know,"" Biehl said.

While the gunman was white and six of the nine killed were black, police said the speed of the rampage made any discrimination in the shooting seem unlikely.

Judge questions Barr's handling of Mueller findings,https://thehill.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/456236-judge-questions-barrs-handling-of-mueller-findings,"A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Monday pressed Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers on why the public shouldn’t be allowed to see redacted portions of former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerTrump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony Kellyanne Conway: 'I'd like to know' if Mueller read his own report MORE’s report, suggesting that he may be willing to consider releasing at least some of the restricted document.

Judge Reggie Walton, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, posed the questions during a hearing on a pair of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits seeking the redacted portions of the report.

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and BuzzFeed News reporter Jason Leopold filed the lawsuits earlier this year. The cases have since been consolidated, and attorneys for each party split the arguments during Monday’s hearing.

Walton in particular raised concerns about Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrThe Humanist case for abolishing the death penalty Senators renew request for domestic threats documents from FBI, DOJ after shootings Judge questions Barr's handling of Mueller findings MORE’s initial handling of Mueller’s report, indicating that he believed there were discrepancies in how Barr characterized the report and the former special counsel’s actual findings.

“I do have some concerns because it seems to me difficult to reconcile the contents of the Mueller report and statements made by the attorney general” about the report, Walton said.

The judge pointed to a letter authored by Barr weeks ahead of the report's release that said Mueller determined there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election and Barr’s suggestion that the president was cleared by the report.

Mueller has since stated that his office did not investigate collusion but instead whether any Trump campaign officials conspired with Russians in 2016. And the former special counsel has repeatedly stated that his report does not exonerate President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer White Supremacist calls on Trump to stop using fear to motivate people Walmart employee urges workers to strike until the company's stores stop selling guns Biden: Violent video games 'not healthy' but aren't 'in and of itself why we have this carnage' MORE.

DOJ lawyer Courtney Enlow pushed back, saying that Barr was not required to release the report at all under the special counsel regulations but did so anyway. She said the attorney general's actions were in “good faith.”

But EPIC attorney Alan Butler raised concerns over the timeline of the redactions. The DOJ released a second redacted version of the Mueller report in response to the FOIA lawsuits weeks after the initial report. But Butler noted that the exemptions in the FOIA version of the report were effectively the same as the redactions made in the originally released version of Mueller's report.

Judge Walton raised that prospect to Enlow, suggesting that the DOJ officials tasked with making the FOIA exemptions could have been following directions from higher-ups. He cited his own time working in the DOJ, saying that sometimes “the body does what the head wants.”

Enlow said that Barr worked with members of the special counsel’s office to make the redactions and that the information withheld under FOIA in that version of the report was in line with FOIA exemptions.

Attorneys for those seeking the unredacted portions of the report pressed Walton to request that the disputed redactions be given to him privately so that he could review them and determine if any of the information was already publicly available and no longer needed to redacted.

Enlow argued that rulings in previous FOIA cases mean that the administration doesn’t necessarily have to make that information publicly available.

However, Walton appeared skeptical. At several times throughout the hearing, he noted the high level of public interest in the redacted versions of the documents.

Mathew Topic, who was arguing on behalf of Leopold in court, also noted that releasing more details of the report could help resolve disputes about the origins of the Mueller investigation.

Topic pointed to Trump repeatedly referring to the probe as a politically motivated “witch hunt” and said that making the investigators’ findings fully available could help affirm or disprove those claims.

And the lawyer said that providing a fuller reasoning for why certain figures such as Donald Trump Jr. Donald (Don) John TrumpJudge questions Barr's handling of Mueller findings Hey, Democrats: Stop attacking our most beloved president in recent history Comedy Central shoots down Trump Jr. after he joked network should host Democratic debates MORE were not charged or even brought before a grand jury would further clarify the intent and actions of prosecutors working under Mueller.

“That information has strong public interest in multiple ways,” Topic said of the details redacted because of privacy interests.

Enlow countered by saying Americans contacted by Russians during the 2016 election could be thrust into the public spotlight if that information was released and that being publicly tied to the investigation “places stigma on that person.”

Among the redacted information in the report being sought in these cases is grand jury information.

But Enlow, in arguing that Walton should not make the information public, cited an opinion from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals handed down earlier this year that found a court doesn’t have the inherent authority to release grand jury materials.

And she said that a suggestion from Tropic that an FOIA exemption made in relation to grand jury materials appeared related to Trump’s questioning in the probe as “baseless” speculation.

Topic had questioned why information appearing to relate to Trump’s questioning was redacted under the grand jury provision, when the president never appeared before a grand jury.

Walton did not provide a timeline as to when he might issue a decision, saying that he is facing a “heavy” caseload at the moment.

But he noted the high level of public interest in the case — and the inevitable prospect that whatever ruling he issues will be appealed — in saying he will work to make a decision soon."
McAleenan says DHS doesn't have resources to fight rising white supremacy,https://thehill.com,[],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/456345-mcaleenan-says-dhs-doesnt-have-resources-to-fight-rising-white,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacks the necessary resources to fight rising white supremacy across the U.S., acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Tuesday.

McAleenan said on CBS “This Morning” that “we need [to] invest more, no question.”

“We do need a better effort to coordinate that at the headquarters level. And that's what I've directed. I'd like to triple the staff we have available to address this and coordinate the intelligence side of it at the headquarters level, as well as investing in those grants and efforts that are going to help communities prepare for these kind of incidents,” he said.

McAleenan on Tuesday also pushed back on accusations that the Trump administration is not responding aggressively to the threat of white supremacist attacks.

“I think we are responding aggressively. The president gave us a very clear call to action, tasked the Department of Justice with a number of different steps,” he said.

McAleenan pointed to active shooter training and cybersecurity training as steps the department is taking to prevent the attacks.

The department’s Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Protection, however, reportedly has about the quarter of the staff and an eighth of the budget of a similar Obama administration program.

The comments come after at least 22 people were killed in a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday. The accused shooter is alleged to have written a white nationalist manifesto ahead of the attack.

“I think we've got a responsibility to call out hate in all of its forms, and white supremacist extremism is a critical element that we’re trying to address. I think the president was very clear on that yesterday,” he responded."
"USDA science agencies’ relocation may have violated law, inspector general report says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'August At Pm', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/08/05/usda-science-agencies-relocation-may-have-violated-law-inspector-general-report-says/,"

A federal watchdog challenged the Trump administration’s authority to move two USDA science agencies out of Washington, in a report issued a few days after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, praised the move for encouraging federal scientists to quit their jobs.

The plan to relocate the two agencies from D.C. to Kansas City may have run afoul of the 2018 appropriations act, according to a report released Monday from the USDA’s Office of Inspector General.

In August 2018, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a plan to relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees $1.7 billion in scientific grants and funding, and the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency that publishes influential reports on agricultural trade and rural America. Both agencies lease office space in the District.

USDA selected the Kansas City region as the new home for these agencies in June 2019, in what Perdue has billed as a cost-saving decision. About two-thirds of nearly 400 employees refused the reassignment and will lose their jobs.

“This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, told The Washington Post last month.

In his keynote speech at the Republican Party’s black-tie-optional Silver Elephant Gala in South Carolina on Friday, Mulvaney seemed to celebrate the attrition at the agencies. “You’ve heard about ‘drain the swamp.’ What you probably haven’t heard is what we are actually doing. I don’t know if you saw the news the other day, but the USDA just tried to move, or did move, two offices out of Washington, D.C.,"" he said.

As the crowd clapped, Mulvaney continued: “Yes, you can applaud that one. That’s what we’ve been talking about doing. Guess what happened? Guess what happened? More than half the people quit.""

“It’s nearly impossible to fire a federal worker,” Mulvaney said. “I know that because a lot of them work for me, and I’ve tried . . . By simply saying to people, ‘You know what, we’re going to take you outside the bubble, outside the Beltway, outside this liberal haven of Washington, D.C., and move you out in the real part of the country,' and they quit — what a wonderful way to sort of streamline government, and do what we haven’t been able to do for a long time.”

Trump officials are planning additional shake-ups and exoduses from Washington. By 2020, more than 80 percent of the headquarters staff at the Bureau of Land Management will be moved west of the Rocky Mountains, the Interior Department told lawmakers in July. The Trump administration also wants to break up the Office of Personnel Management and split 5,500 workers among three other departments.

J. David Cox Sr., president of American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the two USDA agencies, said Mulvaney’s comments confirmed the union’s concerns. “The administration’s decision to transfer hundreds of USDA jobs from D.C. isn’t about helping federal employees do their jobs better or delivering better services to the American taxpayer,” Cox said in a statement. “Their goal is to drive out hard-working and dedicated civil servants and silence the parts of the agencies’ research that the administration views as inconvenient.” A study from ERS, for instance, one of the agencies targeted for the move, showed that a $1.5 trillion tax bill signed by Trump offered few, if any, benefits to low-income farmers.

Congress questioned whether USDA has the legal authority to move the agencies. The department has this power, according to the inspector general’s investigation. But USDA also needs budgetary approval from Congress to fund the moves, the watchdog group said, which the department did not obtain.

In the fall, USDA awarded a $340,000 contract to the accounting firm Ernst & Young to assist with the relocation. The 2018 omnibus spending bill required USDA to receive congressional approval before spending this money. “That prior approval did not appear to have been granted,” the inspector general report says.

This expense may have also violated the Antideficiency Act, the report said, which prevents federal employees from involving the government “in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made.”

Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.), who requested the inspector general’s investigation in September 2018, exhorted USDA to follow the law. “The Secretary must follow the will of Congress and refrain from moving forward with the relocation,” they said in a joint statement Monday, “until Congress approves the use of funds for those purposes as directed by the fiscal year 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) called the inspector general report “very troubling” said it confirms “suspicions that the Secretary does not have the authority to proceed with this relocation.”

G. William Hoagland, a vice president at the D.C.-based think tank the Bipartisan Policy Center, predicted that the failure to get congressional approval “will certainly set in motion legal challenges” from the union to halt the move “until either the courts or Congress act.”

In a list of recommendations in the report, the inspector general’s office advised USDA to seek approval from a congressional committee.

USDA management refused to do so. “To say the department was out of step with budgetary requirements disregards the authority given to the executive branch by the U.S. Constitution,” according to a statement provided by USDA. It continued: “Since the inspector general affirms the department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed.”

This report has been updated.

"AT&T employees bribed more than $1M to unlock phones, install malware, DOJ says",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/att-employees-bribed-1m-unlock-phones-install-malware/story?id=64802367,"The Department of Justice has unsealed charges against a man who allegedly paid AT&T ""insiders"" more than a million dollars over five years to unlock more than two million cell phones ""fraudulently,"" allowing buyers to avoid using the company as a provider.

""The object ... was to sell members of the public the resulting ability fraudulently to unlock phones, so that members of the public could stop using AT&T wireless services and therefore deprive AT&T of the stream of payments it was owed under customers' service contracts and installment plans,"" an indictment unsealed Monday in the Western District of Washington state, said.

Between 2013 and 2017, Muhamad Fahd a 34-year-old from Pakistan allegedly bribed AT&T employees at a call center in Bothell, Washington, to ""use their network credentials and exceed their authorized access to AT&T's computers to submit large numbers of fraudulent and unauthorized unlock requests on behalf of the conspiracy and to install malware and unauthorized hardware on AT&T's systems,"" according to the indictment.

One employee was allegedly paid $428,500 over the five-year scheme,

Fahd, who was extradited through Hong Kong, is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to violate the Travel Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, four counts of wire fraud, two counts of accessing a protected computer in furtherance of fraud, two counts of intentional damage to a protected computer, and four counts of violating the Travel Act.

DOJ says the scheme cost the company millions and resulted in millions of phones being removed from AT&T service. A phone is usually locked to a carrier, like AT&T, according to Apple, and unlocking a phone means disconnecting or ""unlocking"" from one carrier, and then the phone can be used by anyone.

It is not the same as merely using a passcode to unlock a cellphone.

""We have been working closely with law enforcement since this scheme was uncovered to bring these criminals to justice and are pleased with these developments,"" AT&T said in a statement to ABC News, and a spokesperson added that this incident did not compromise customer information or affect any customers.

The AT&T insiders, allegedly planted malware on computers that allowed Fahd to log into AT&T's ""internal protected computers under false pretenses and to process fraudulent and authorized unlock request,"" from a remote location, the indictment says.

DOJ alleges that in addition to a malware, the AT&T employees were bribed to also use their physical access points to install hardwired devices to give Fahid remote access to internal ""protected computers,"" so he could study the company's processes.

Much like the malware, the credentials used to unlock phones belonged to actual AT&T employees, DOJ says.

""This arrest illustrates what can be achieved when the victim of a cyber attack partners quickly and closely with law enforcement,” Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said in a statement. “When companies that fall prey to malware work with the Department of Justice, no cybercriminal—no matter how sophisticated their scheme—is beyond our reach.”

The indictment shows a pattern over the course of those five years, after getting caught by AT&T investigators in 2013, the employees that were helping Fahd left the company, but he still recruited more people to conspire with him, DOJ says.

""Fahd ... began programming hardware devices designed to facilitate unauthorized access to AT&T's internal protected network for the purpose of processing authorized unlock requests,"" the indictment reads.

Once ""perfecting"" the devices, Fahd gave them to the AT&T employees he was bribing and they plugged them in to the internal network ""without authorization to facilitate the unlocking of phones.""

Fahd instructed employees to get burner phones and emails to communicate with him and to create shell companies to receive payments, the Department of Justice said.

At the same time, DOJ alleges Fahd was working a list of people ""who operated businesses that offered unlocking services to customers for a fee.""

Fahd would help people who were trying to get out of their AT&T contract, he would get a phone's IMEI, what are like serial numbers and have the AT&T employees unlock it .

Another man, who is now deceased, responsible for paying the bribes and gathering IMEI numbers, was also charged."

"China is manipulating its currency, U.S. Treasury Department declares",https://www.marketwatch.com,['Mike Murphy'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-is-manipulating-its-currency-us-treasury-department-declares-2019-08-05,"The U.S. Treasury Department designated China as a currency manipulator on Monday afternoon, after the yuan’s value against the dollar fell below a “line in the sand” and intensified trade tensions.

In a statement, the Treasury Department said Secretary Steve Mnuchin, “under the auspices of President Trump,” has determined that China is a currency manipulator.

“As a result of this determination, Secretary Mnuchin will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions,” the Treasury department said, explaining: “In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past. The context of these actions and the implausibility of China’s market stability rationale confirm that the purpose of China’s currency devaluation is to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade.”

The statement added that the People’s Bank of China “has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis.”

It’s the first time the U.S. has labeled China as a currency manipulator since 1994, and could open the door to new sanctions.

It’s also a reversal for the Treasury Department, which in May declined to give China that label. But President Donald Trump has pressed for that designation.

“China has always used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories, hurt our jobs, depress our workers’ wages and harm our farmers’ prices. Not anymore!” Trump tweeted Monday before Treasury’s announcement.

China’s currency CNYUSD, +0.3458% weakened early Monday, trading at more than 7 yuan per U.S. dollar for the first time in more than a decade.

The perceived willingness by China to use the yuan as a trade weapon led to a huge selloff on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.21% and S&P 500 SPX, +1.30% falling almost 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% slid 3.5%."

The Trump administration has temporarily frozen and ordered a review of several key foreign aid funds that Congress has already approved, in a move that critics fear could lead to another attempted rollback of foreign aid.

The Office of Management and Budget sent a letter to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development on Saturday, notifying them of the action, which took effect one minute before midnight that day.

The OMB asked the agencies for a balance sheet of foreign aid projects that have not yet been funded. Michael P. Duffey, the associate director for national security programs at OMB, wrote that no more money can be obligated from those funds until three days after OMB receives the numbers, a process that could take days if not weeks.

The letter, viewed by The Washington Post, lists eight areas that cover a variety of assistance: international organizations; peacekeeping operations and activities; international narcotics control and law enforcement; development aid; assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia; economic support funding; foreign military financing programs; and global health programs.

An administration official said the funds targeted for review are above budgetary limits proposed by President Trump. They include big-ticket items like contributions to the United Nations and smaller items like solar panels in the Caribbean, schools in Uzbekistan and soccer programs in Central America.

Traditionally, a significant portion of foreign aid funding is obligated toward the end of a fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30. But this year the pot is bigger, in part because the administration has cut aid to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and for the Palestinians.

According to people familiar with the process, the named funds could be as little as $2 billion and as much as $4 billion.

The State Department and USAID declined to comment, referring questions to OMB.

“It is incumbent on all federal agencies to properly use funds provided by Congress,” said Rachel Semmel, the OMB spokeswoman. “In an effort to ensure accountability, OMB has requested the current status of several foreign assistance accounts to identify the amount of funding that is unobligated. On behalf of American taxpayers, OMB has an obligation to ensure their money is being used wisely.”

Trump has proposed steep cuts in foreign aid in all of his budget requests, but Congress has restored the funding.

Last year, OMB asked the State Department and USAID to provide a similar balance sheet of unobligated projects just six weeks before the end of the budget year. It said money for projects considered “unnecessary” — potentially as much as $3 billion — could be returned to the Treasury, a process known as rescission

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued against the rescission championed by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, and Congress pushed against what it viewed as a backdoor attempt to get around its spending authority, so the administration dropped the proposal. The Government Accountability Office, in a decision last December, rebuked the idea of an attempted rescission so late in the budget year, saying there must be enough time for a “prudent obligation” that could take weeks or even months. This year, Pompeo was in Australia when the letter was sent and Congress was near the beginning of a recess.

No decisions have been made, and the information requested from the agencies is purely for the purpose of review. But the memory of the failed attempt to slash foreign aid last year has led some in the broader foreign aid community to be concerned that Mulvaney, who remains head of OMB and is the acting White House chief of staff, will try again.

“He’s tried again and again to take a sledgehammer to the most minuscule yet high impact part of the budget,” said Liz Schrayer, president of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a network of businesses and organizations that advocate for international development. “He keeps losing, because Congress has seen in a bipartisan fashion these cuts are reckless, and these funds are in America’s security interest. I think we’ll see that again.”

A senior Democratic aide said that it appears the administration is preparing to circumvent Congress with a rescission package and that it can expect a fight.

“Irrelevant of what the Trump administration may wish, Congress still has the power of the purse and we appropriated these funds because they are necessary to protect our interests and national security,” said the aide, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans under consideration. “We are in touch with the State Department and are demanding answers. This scheme would set the precedent for this and all future administrations to ignore spending bills and eliminate spending obligations by jamming Congress with end-of-fiscal year rescission packages.”"
EPA submits final controversial car emissions rule to the White House,https://thehill.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456206-epa-submits-final-controversial-car-emissions-rule-to-the-white,"The White House is reviewing the final policy that would roll back Obama-era standards for vehicle emissions.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Transportation submitted the finalized Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule to the White House for review on Saturday, the second-to-last step before the controversial rule is implemented.

“Today, after reviewing hundreds of thousands of public comments and undertaking extensive scientific and economic analyses, EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) together have initiated formal interagency review for the draft SAFE Vehicles Final Rule,” the agencies said in a joint statement.

“EPA and NHTSA firmly believe that this rule will benefit all Americans by improving the U.S. fleet’s fuel economy, reducing air pollution, helping make new vehicles more affordable for all Americans and, because new vehicles are safer than ever, ultimately saving thousands of lives and reducing the number of Americans seriously injured in car crashes.” ADVERTISEMENT

The final draft of the rule submitted to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will not become public until the rule is complete.

The agencies first submitted their drafts of the vehicle emissions rules for model years 2021-2026 passenger cars and light trucks in August 2018, to immediate backlash.

Environmental groups and lawmakers across the country have criticized the rule for weakening air pollution standards for cars.

The finalization of the rule is expected to be heavily litigated, including through lawsuits threatened by a number of state attorneys general.

News of the rule’s near-imminent implementation comes shortly after California struck a deal with a handful of automakers to keep their emissions cuts in line with the regulations laid out in the Obama-era rule. California had worked hand in hand with the Obama administration to determine stringent air pollution standards for cars.

The state maintains it has the right to establish its own strong air quality standards under the Clean Air Act, and auto manufactuers have long sought one national standard for vehicles across the country.

EPA and the Department of Transportation said when the rule is finalized it will be a “win for all Americans.”"
"As climate reckoning arrives over agriculture, USDA’s scientists face censorship",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/climate-ipcc-usda-agriculture-emissions-science-relocation-fallout-trump-845a61311bd3/,"A government climate scientist who says the Trump administration buried a groundbreaking report he authored has left the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in protest over the “political views” top officials allegedly imposed on his work.

Politico reported Monday that Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist who worked at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) for more than 20 years, quit due to an increasingly political atmosphere at the agency. Ziska had worked on a major rice study last year, one that found rising levels of carbon dioxide could imperil the critical source of sustenance for some 600 million people globally. According to Ziska’s work, the mineral and protein content in rice, along with key vitamins, is expected to drop as greenhouse gas levels rise.

Agency scientists have accused department officials of seeking to bury that report, among others, in keeping with President Donald Trump’s stance denying and downplaying climate change. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue has similarly dismissed global warming as “weather patterns.”

USDA claims the study wasn’t publicized because of disagreement among career officials. But Ziska told Politico that the reason the study was buried is down to political ideology and the administration’s unwillingness to embrace established climate science.

“There was a sense [at USDA] that if the science agreed with the politics, then the policymakers would consider it to be ‘good science,’ and if it didn’t agree with the politics, then it was something that was flawed and needed to be done again,” he said.

The scientist’s departure coincides with a summary copy of a highly-anticipated U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on land use being leaked this week. The report emphasizes that global food production must become more sustainable in order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

His resignation also comes as the agency is still reeling from a controversial relocation effort connected to disputes over scientific integrity.

The department is set to lose a staggering number of career officials over a deeply contested relocation plan. Perdue announced in June that staffers with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would be asked to relocate to Kansas City, which straddles Kansas and Missouri. Over 500 staffers were given until July 15 to decide whether to relocate by September 30.

More than half of those staffers reportedly declined to move and have effectively chosen to resign — a dramatic loss of institutional knowledge and career staff who have worked with the department for decades.

USDA has argued that the move is a cost-saving effort to bring the department closer to farm country. But former USDA officials and the union representing employees have rejected that narrative. Many say it is an attempt to force out knowledgeable researchers and scientists, as well as a retaliation for the climate science work produced by some staffers at USDA.

Conversations about the link between agriculture and climate change, however, are only set to escalate. Last year, an IPCC report warned that the world had only 12 years left before crossing a dangerous threshold of global warming — one that would yield climate impacts on a scale not seen before. A leaked copy of this year’s report focuses on land use and the role of agriculture in mitigating climate change.

According to the draft, which is currently being debated in Geneva before its release later this week, cutting carbon emissions from sources like cars and power plants will only go so far. Agriculture, forestry, and other land-use practices are producing roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, the report says, with cattle and rice fields in particular generating around 50% of methane emissions. That has contributed heavily to climate impacts, the draft finds, with the situation only set to worsen.

“Climate change exacerbates land degradation through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, wind, sea-level rise and wave action,” the document states.

In addition to changing how people use land, the IPCC draft underscores that switching to vegetarian and vegan diets may be a critical part of staving off the worst climate impacts.

That refrain may sound familiar to some. Critics of the proposed Green New Deal — a blueprint for radically shifting the United States to net-zero emissions — have argued the climate plan will “ban cows” and deprive Americans of hamburgers. The proposal itself does not move to bar bovines from the country but it does single out agriculture as a major source of greenhouse gases and a sector in need of overhauling if the United States is to zero-out emissions. The IPCC’s findings are therefore likely to draw more attention to the climate science realities dogging agriculture.

High profile exits at USDA are also likely to fuel scrutiny of the Trump administration’s attitudes towards the sector’s relationship with climate science. And other major exits over climate change are also driving headlines. Rod Schoonover, a former senior analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department, wrote in an op-ed last week that the White House had blocked the release of his report on climate change and national security.

“The stated reason,” Schoonover said, “was that the scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.”"
Energy Department wants to build nuclear test reactor,https://www.latimes.com,"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-05/energy-department-wants-to-build-nuclear-test-reactor,"A new nuclear test reactor is needed as part of an effort to revamp the nation’s fading nuclear power industry by developing safer fuel and power plants, the U.S. Department of Energy said Monday.

The federal agency said it would prepare an environmental impact statement as part of the process to build the test reactor in Idaho or Tennessee by the end of 2025. Public comments on the environmental review are being taken through Sept. 4.

The Versatile Test Reactor would be the first new test reactor built in the United States in decades and give the nation a dedicated “fast-neutron-spectrum” testing capability. Such reactors are called fast reactors.

“This testing capability is essential for the United States to modernize its nuclear energy infrastructure and for developing transformational nuclear energy technologies that reduce waste generation and enhance nuclear security,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in a statement.

Americans have been wary of nuclear power since the core from Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island underwent a partial meltdown in 1979 — one of the nation’s worst nuclear accidents. That was followed by a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploding and burning in 1986. In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan where the cores of three reactors suffered meltdowns after cooling systems failed.

Federal officials say the proposed test reactor would help create new and safer fuels, materials and reactors being developed by civilian companies in the United States.

“If this capability is not available to U.S. innovators as soon as possible, the ongoing shift of nuclear technology dominance to other international states such as China and the Russian Federation will accelerate, to the detriment of the U.S. nuclear industrial sector,” said Rita Baranwal, the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for nuclear energy.

The Energy Department had a fast reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor II, operating in eastern Idaho until it was shut down in 1994 as the nation turned away from nuclear power.

Edwin Lyman, senior scientist and acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said fast reactors such as the proposed Versatile Test Reactor are less safe than current reactors.

Most nuclear reactors in use now are “light-water” reactors fueled by uranium and cooled with water. Lyman said the test reactor would be cooled with harder-to-control liquid sodium and likely fueled by plutonium, increasing potential nuclear terrorism risks because plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons.

“There is nothing good about these reactors,” he said. “I think there is a love of plutonium in the [Energy] Department that is irrational.”

Revamping the nation’s nuclear power is part of a strategy to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by generating carbon-free electricity with nuclear power. The strategy was initiated under the Obama administration and continuing under the Trump administration, despite Trump’s downplaying of global warming.

Reducing spent nuclear fuel, federal officials say, is also an objective of the new test reactor. The United States has no permanent repository for about 77,000 tons of radioactive spent fuel, stored mainly at the commercial nuclear power plants where they were used to produce electricity.

But Lyman said fast reactors would produce waste even more hazardous and difficult to dispose.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, at the end of December there were 98 nuclear reactors at 59 power plants producing about 20% of the nation’s energy. Most of the reactors are decades old, and many are having a tough time competing economically with other forms of energy production.

The Energy Department is considering building the test reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho or the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee.

On a related front, late last year the Energy Department restarted the Transient Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory to test new nuclear fuels. That facility had been on standby since 1994."
10-year Treasury yield steady after breaking under 1.7% in overnight trading,https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-in-focus-amid-us-china-trade-war.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note held steady Tuesday morning after breaking under 1.7% earlier in the session for the first time since the fall of 2016.

At around 3:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was slightly lower at 1.716%, off a low of 1.672% hit in overnight trading. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also slightly lower at 2.246%.

The uptick in yields came after China's central bank indicated that it wants the country's currency to strengthen against the U.S. dollar. Overnight, the People's Bank of China set the midpoint for the yuan at a level stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-dollar rate. The yuan breached that level for the first time since 2008 on Monday.

Investors took the announcement from the PBOC as welcome relief from the prior session's fears that China wouldn't support the yuan against the greenback in a burgeoning currency war. Many thought the yuan's depreciation could be an attempt by Beijing to juice its exports and aggravate the trade war between the globe's two largest economies.

Those anxieties sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling more than 750 points on Monday as all three of Wall Street's notched their worst day of the year. The stock onslaught fostered a bid for less risky assets like U.S. debt as yields on maturities across the board sank to multiyear lows.

The angst showed no signs of slowing late Monday after the U.S. Treasury officially designated China as a ""currency manipulator, "" following a sharp fall in the value of the Chinese yuan against the dollar.

A protracted trade dispute between the U.S. and China has now dragged on for more than a year. Both countries have slapped additional tariffs on each other's goods worth billions of dollars, and the escalating tensions have spooked markets and hurt global economic growth outlook.

Late last week, China vowed to retaliate after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports."

The EPA responded Tuesday that it cannot let ""short-term litigation posturing"" interfere with its mission to protect human and environmental health.

Lujan Grisham’s letter is in reference to a class of chemicals abbreviated as PFAS, cancer-linked substances used in a variety of nonstick products and firefighting foam relied on by the military and airports.

PFAS are often referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment.

The letter, first reported by Politico, is the latest example of frustrations from states in getting the military to work with local leaders in cleaning up contamination.

Some of the blame has been levied against the EPA after suspicions the agency weakened its own PFAS regulations to help the military avoid what could be a $2 billion cleanup bill.

Lawmakers, however, have worked to strengthen the military’s PFAS culpability, including measures in the National Defense Authorization Act to force the military to work with states to clean up contamination.

A measure from Sen. Tom Udall Thomas (Tom) Stewart UdallDemocrats introduce constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United House passes bill requiring CBP to enact safety, hygiene standards Al Franken says he 'absolutely' regrets resigning MORE (D-N.M.) included in the House bill would require the military to provide clean water to farms contaminated by PFAS.

Udall was motivated by the plight of a New Mexico dairy farmer who euthanized 4,000 of his cows after the milk they produced tested positive for high levels of PFAS. That farm, located near a military base, caught the attention of Food and Drug Administration researchers in documenting the spread of PFAS from water to food.

New Mexico sued the Air Force for PFAS contamination in March, and Lujan Grisham’s letter criticizes EPA for reneging on a promise from Wheeler to help the state “with legal and technical assistance in a confidential manner.”

“Providing fact sheets and offering webinars are not meaningful,” she wrote.

In responding to request for comment from The Hill, the EPA pointed to a July letter from the agency’s top lawyer and assistant administrator that said EPA is not permitted to bring judicial action against another executive branch agency.

It goes on to list actions EPA has taken to assist New Mexico, including providing fact sheets and webinars along with attending meetings and calls.

But a separate Friday letter from New Mexico Environment Department head James Kenney to another EPA office disputes that reasoning, arguing that “EPA is unrestricted from taking administrative enforcement actions against federal agencies under its controlling acts.”

The EPA responded to that letter Tuesday, saying its work with New Mexico should not be disparaged.

""If the state has not found our assistance useful, that has not been communicated as we have worked jointly on this issue,"" the agency wrote to the governor, adding that the state's letter ""has the potential to miscommunicate to the public the truth of the federal-state collaboration.""

The Department of Defense did not respond to request for comment.

New Mexico is not alone in its frustration with the EPA or the military. Last month 22 attorneys general wrote a letter to Congress asking lawmakers to compel action from the two agencies.

Justice considering push for new law to make mass shootings a capital crime,https://www.cnn.com,"['Evan Perez', 'Katelyn Polantz']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/05/politics/justice-new-law-mass-shootings-capital-crime/index.html,"(CNN) A new federal law specifically making mass shootings a capital crime is among the proposals being studied as Justice Department officials seek to follow President Donald Trump's order to come up with legislative fixes to tackle the spate of active shooting incidents.

Attorney General William Barr spent the weekend discussing possible legislation with the President and vice president and with other Justice and FBI officials, a source briefed on the matter said. One of the top options for legislative proposals would make mass shooters eligible for the death penalty in the same way federal law treats people who use explosives, a law enforcement official said.

Any changes would have to be passed by Congress.

Existing federal law specifies the use of weapons of mass destruction as a crime that carries the possible death penalty. But if the same suspect uses a gun instead of explosives, there's no specific federal law to address that. Instead, federal prosecutors often turn to other laws, including one addressing hate crimes, to bring charges in mass shooting incidents. Federal prosecutors also can seek charges for gun offenses or crimes against federal officials.

One complication for any new law is how to define mass shootings, in a country where there are routinely dozens of people shot in drug-related and other crimes over the course of a weekend in certain cities.

REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Saturday said it welcomed news of a ceasefire in Northwest Syria - the last rebel bastion in the country - and urged for an end to attacks on civilians.

Last week Syrian media reported that the ceasefire would take place as long as rebel fighters implement the terms of a de-escalation agreement brokered last year by Russia and Turkey.

The wave of violence in northwest Syria since late April has killed more than 400 civilians and forced more than 440,000 to flee toward the Turkish border, according to the United Nations.

“The United States believes there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict, and only a political solution can ensure a stable and secure future for all Syrians,” the State Department said in a statement.

“We further believe the only viable path to a political solution is the U.N.-led political process in Geneva, including constitutional reform and U.N.-supervised elections,” the statement said.

The United States will support the work of U.N. Special Envoy Geir Pedersen and the United Nations to advance a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that would create a permanent, peaceful, and political end to the conflict, the State Department added.

The region - including Idlib province and parts of nearby Hama - was part of the last major stronghold of armed opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, who has vowed to reclaim all of Syria.

The Department also commended efforts by Turkey and Russia to restore the cease fire they agreed in September 2018."

A July 31 audit conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Inspector General (EPA OIG) also confirmed that EPA staff have not been directed to work on a 2017 proposed rule that would have exempted glider trucks from stricter Phase 2 emissions requirements. That means that a 300-truck per manufacturer cap on glider kits remains in place.

Glider kits are a way for truck owners to buy a new truck with a remanufactured engine, often at a significant discount from a new truck and engine combination.

The OIG audit was conducted at the request of Republican lawmakers. Last year they questioned EPA’s testing processes at its National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which were used in a 2017 EPA study on glider truck emissions. Opponents of the study, which found air emissions from gliders to be 43 to 55 times those of trucks with modern emission controls, also argued that Volvo [CXE: VOLVB.S.IX] had influenced the findings. Volvo and other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have supported tighter emissions controls after years of investing in clean-engine technology.

Both EPA and Volvo were cleared in the OIG’s audit. “The EPA complied with standard practices and relevant policies and procedures covering objectivity and integrity in planning and conducting its testing of glider vehicles in 2017,” according to the audit.

The OIG concluded that employees within EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) had received the required testing approvals and followed normal procedures in submitting the glider testing report. “The OIG also did not identify ethics violations within the scope of our audit by a former OTAQ Center Director.”

The audit did find minor issues with how EPA exercised its “donation acceptance authority” when officials there acquired the trucks used for its study. The OIG recommended that EPA officials evaluate whether it needs to develop further guidance or policies on accepting donated property.

The audit marks the latest development in a long-running controversy over how much glider kits pollute. Because the kits can be roughly 25 percent less costly than new truck cabs, they are in high demand by independent fleet operators from manufacturers such as Crossville, Tennessee-based Fitzgerald Glider Kits.

Fitzgerald commissioned a study conducted by Tennessee Technological University (Tennessee Tech) in 2017 that found glider engines do not pollute any more than modern OEM systems. The Tennessee Tech study was then used to lobby on behalf of a measure that allows rebuilt diesel engines to be exempt from the Obama-era emissions rules.

But university faculty questioned the pro-glider kit study, in particular the relationship between Fitzgerald and the university, calling it a conflict of interest. In late 2018, Tennessee Tech acknowledged that the results of its glider kit study were inaccurate.

Trump judges face scrutiny over president's cases,https://thehill.com,[],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/456013-trump-judges-face-scrutiny-over-presidents-cases,"Federal judges nominated by President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer White Supremacist calls on Trump to stop using fear to motivate people Walmart employee urges workers to strike until the company's stores stop selling guns Biden: Violent video games 'not healthy' but aren't 'in and of itself why we have this carnage' MORE are facing a major public test as they handle cases that involve Trump personally or some of his most controversial policies.

New judges are already under pressure to carefully issue rulings as they learn the ropes of the federal judiciary. But three recently appointed district judges in D.C. — Trevor McFadden, Timothy Kelly and Carl Nichols — have found themselves and their rulings under a magnifying glass as they deal with cases involving Trump.

All three of the Trump-tapped judges have acted as their colleagues on the bench typically do, proceeding cautiously in the recent cases. And while legal experts disagreed over whether the judges are facing additional pressure over their rulings, they agreed that there is more attention on the cases, at least in the media.

“These judges realize that everybody's looking at them, and they're kind of behind the eight ball either way you look at it,” Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program, told The Hill.

“A decision for the administration could look like favoritism, or a decision against the administration can be taken as perhaps bending over backwards not to appear supportive of them,” he added.

In the last two weeks, McFadden and Nichols have both taken careful approaches to a lawsuit over a New York law that allows Congress to obtain the president’s state tax returns.

McFadden, who was confirmed by the Senate in October 2017, was initially assigned to the lawsuit over Trump’s New York tax returns because he was also assigned to a lawsuit over the president’s federal tax returns.

But McFadden disagreed with Trump’s personal lawyers who sought to have him also oversee the new case, ordering last week that the state tax return case be randomly reassigned to a new judge.

In his order, he highlighted the importance of adhering to rules about when cases can be considered related to avoid the appearance of judge shopping and to ensure to the public that judges are assigned to cases in an impartial manner.

Nichols, who was just confirmed by the Senate in May and is so new that his name hasn’t been added to the list of D.C. district judges on the court’s website, is now taking on the New York tax returns case in what appears to be his first-ever assignment.

He has been deliberate in his handling of an emergency motion from Trump to block Democratic lawmakers from requesting the president’s New York tax returns. After initially hearing arguments in the case, he asked the parties to try to reach an agreement themselves.

When they failed to do so, Nichols held a teleconference to get more information from those involved. And one day later, he issued an order that temporarily stops New York from handing over the returns to the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, after indicating to the parties that is how he would rule. The panel has not yet requested the returns.

Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa, said that in the legal fights over Trump's tax returns, “it seems like both judges have been pretty cautious.”

But he said the judges’ cautious approach may have more to do with the nature of the issues before them, such as court shopping, than the fact that they are new to the bench.

Mike Stern, who served in the House Office of General Counsel from 1996 to 2004, said that the judges appear to be trying to handle lawsuits in as apolitical a manner as possible.

He said that McFadden’s actions in the tax returns case as well as one over border wall funding have been reasonable and that Nichols’s actions in the state tax return case are consistent with courts’ desire to try to not make a decision when there are disputes between different branches of government.

“If they can avoid having to make a decision, they will do that,” Stern said.

McFadden’s ruling on the tax returns case wasn’t his first high-profile case involving the president. Earlier this year, he presided over House Democrats’ lawsuit challenging the administration’s use of military funds for a border wall.

Before getting to the claims made in the lawsuit, the judge dedicated the first half of a three-hour hearing on the matter to whether he should even be allowed to oversee the proceeding. McFadden ultimately ruled that Democrats did not have standing to bring the case forward.

Kelly was first thrown into the spotlight when the White House revoked CNN correspondent Jim Acosta James (Jim) AcostaTrump judges face scrutiny over president's cases Playboy plans to appeal after reporter says his White House credentials were suspended Trump calls out Cincinnati's 'Democrat mayor' as protesters escorted out MORE's press credentials. The judge ruled against the administration in that case, ordering that the credentials be reinstated.

He also recently oversaw a lengthy hearing on a Trump policy. Kelly heard arguments for more than three hours last month on whether he should issue a temporary restraining order on a policy that would block migrants who pass through a third country from claiming asylum in the United States, with few exceptions.

Kelly, who was confirmed by the Senate in September 2017, was methodical in his line of questioning, pressing attorneys for both sides on the details of their arguments and frequently referring to documents laid out before him during the hearing.

As he wrapped up the proceeding, he noted the importance of both getting the case right and issuing a ruling quickly.

Kelly ultimately decided to not grant the temporary restraining order, in a win for the Trump administration. But that ruling was overshadowed just hours later, after San Francisco-based Judge Jon Tigar, an Obama appointee, issued a preliminary injunction against the asylum rule.

Some legal experts say that the Trump-appointed judges have been trying to be careful and are acting in ways that are consistent with common court practices.

But others who are following the legal cases closely are worried that Trump-appointed judges will go out of their way to act in ways that benefit the president.

Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who backs efforts to obtain Trump’s tax returns, said many Trump-appointed judges were nominated because of their conservative ideology. And he suggested they could feel pressure to show their loyalty to Republicans if they want to eventually be appointed to an appellate court or the Supreme Court.

“Their careers are tied in large measure to them continuing to be loyal,” he said.

But legal experts generally maintained that the judges are acting impartially and with the goal of reaching the best outcome possible.

“Speaking generally, we know that the party of the appointing president is a predictor of how judges will rule in cases, but it's not a very good predictor,” Wheeler said. “But most of the cases, it can be judged fairly cut and dry. The law is clear. The precedents are clear. There's really not much discretion to exercise.

“It's when you get to the cases in which the law is unclear, with new cases that lack a lot of precedents — that's when notions of public policy come into play,” he added.

Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, pushed back on how much pressure the judges are under.

He argued that judges in certain circuits, such as D.C., may be more likely than those in other parts of the country to face high-profile cases during their first years. And he said that judges will rule impartially, regardless of which president appointed them to the bench.

“They’re considered judge material because they’re neutral and detached,” Blackman told The Hill."

Commerce Department names rural development director,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.al.com/business/2019/08/commerce-department-names-rural-development-director.html,"Alabama’s rural communities now have a state position devoted to helping with economic development projects.

Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield announced today that Brenda Tuck has been hired as the department’s first rural development manager.

Tuck will assist rural counties and communities in competing for job-creating projects, providing technical assistance and training.

It’s an area she knows well. She previously served in economic development positions in Marengo, Dallas and Wilcox counties and has been regional workforce council liaison to the Commerce Department’s Workforce Development Division. She also spent seven years as a partner with Selma consulting firm Alford & Associates and five years in economic development at Pioneer Electric Cooperative.

Tuck said she looks forward to working with rural counties and their leaders.

“Rural communities in Alabama can benefit from having a go-to person who can connect them with the resources they need to improve their economic development prospects,” Tuck said.

Alabama in recent years has made a priority of rural economic development through several initiatives. In 2015 the state began offering incentives to qualified projects in targeted counties as a bid to spur rural job creation. The Commerce Department says about 16 projects have qualified, with about $1 billion in investments and 1,400 jobs. This year the Alabama Legislature approved increasing the number of counties eligible for enhanced incentives.

Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said Tuck’s background makes her “the ideal choice to help rural communities navigate the economic development process.”

“Brenda has extensive experience working on the front lines of economic development in rural Alabama counties, so she knows the specific challenges these areas face when it comes to competing for projects,” Canfield said."

Housing Authority's Gene Bell retires: 'I’ve been the luckiest guy in the world’,https://www.citizen-times.com,"['John Boyle', 'Published A.M.

Growing up on a farm in rural Kentucky, Gene Bell learned the value — and the price — of hard physical labor.

""A lot of hogs, a lot of burley (tobacco),” Bell said, adding that tobacco in particular was labor intensive. “When I started it, you had to top it and sucker it, and then you had to cut it and put it in the barn. Then strip it, press it and take it the warehouse. There’s a whole art to it.”

To prevent nicotine poisoning, he had to wear a hat, a long-sleeved shirt and safety glasses, all in Kentucky's oppressive summer heat.

But an incident beyond tobacco harvesting really convinced Bell he needed to find a way out of the fields, most likely through higher education.

Like a lot of older men in those days, Bell's grandfather often wore a truss, a type of padded belt, to hold in hernias. One day when he was out digging post holes, the truss failed and his grandfather’s intestines poured through the hernias. Other men had to work furiously to tuck them back into his abdomen.

Bell threw up.

“I thought, ‘You don’t have to worry about me not going to college, bro,"" he said with a laugh.

Now, six decades later, Bell has retired after a 25-year career with the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville, including the past 14 as CEO. He spent 20 years before that in the business world.

Bell will continue working part-time with the authority, strictly to see through a project he views as his baby: the transformation of the 96-unit Lee Walker Heights public housing development into a 212-unit mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhood.

CLOSE After 25 years with the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville, CEO Gene Bell is retiring. Angeli Wright, awright@citizen-times.com

Bell was honored July 25 with a farewell gathering at the Arthur R. Edington Education & Career Center, a program attended by about 130 friends, family members and coworkers. Asheville Vice Mayor Gwen Wisler read a proclamation declaring the date ""Gene Bell Day,"" and Buncombe County Commissioner Amanda Edwards noted the county plans to offer a similar proclamation at the Aug. 6 Board of Commissioners meeting.

A steady stream of speakers talked about how much Bell, who has served on dozens of boards and committees, has meant to the city, public housing and to them personally. They also described him as a sometimes strict father figure who stressed accountability, a man obsessed with punctuality and efficiency who each day carried a handwritten to-do list in his pocket.

But he also has been a leader always willing to give someone a second chance or a hand up, several people said.

All about relationships

The Rev. Jim Abbott, former pastor of St. Matthias Episcopal Church and a longtime friend, said Bell simply committed himself to the community early on, and he had a knack for connecting the dots between education, poverty and jobs. Bell carved out time for community service, whether it was serving on the Asheville City Schools board or on the board of Muddy Sneakers, a program designed to get kids outdoors.

""I don't think many great things went on in this community over the last 25 years that don't have your fingerprints on them,"" Abbott said.

Shaunda Sandford, coordinator of the Housing Authority's Family Self-Sufficiency Program, talked about Bell's love of the outdoors. He took her hiking for the first time, showing her that ""black people can go hiking and enjoy it,"" she said, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Bell repeatedly said his job, as well as life, really comes down to one simple theme: respecting and caring about people.

(Photo: ANGELI WRIGHT/ASHEVILLE CITIZEN TIMES)

“I believe the most important thing in this world is relationships,” Bell said at his retirement event. ""Now, people have a lot of philosophical definitions of that, but the true meaning for your existence is relationships. You’ve got to help people. If we helped people as much as we deter people, it would be a lot easier.”

Bell said he's particularly proud of his work with the Residents Councils in the various housing developments.

Crystal Reid, president of the Residents Council for Lee Walker Heights and Klondyke Homes, said before the event that those relationships have been mutually beneficial. She lives in Klondyke and previously lived in Lee Walker.

""He’s a very neutral man and he keeps things transparent, and that’s one quality I greatly appreciate in him,"" Reid said. ""He's a very balanced man. He's not one to go toward the negative or the positive. He keeps it in the middle so everyone has a chance to say their piece.""

Relationships have always been precious to Bell, as well as tenuous at times.

Bell’s mother died when he was 11, in hindsight a harbinger of the loss of many of the people closest to Bell. He lost his first wife, Sharon, in 2015; and his daughter, Angela, who died from an aneurysm at age 40 in 2013. Bell also has a son, Shannon, 44, who is partially disabled after suffering a stroke.

While he's a little gruff on the exterior and known for his sometimes colorful language, Bell is also known for his optimism and genuinely caring about others.

At the Edington Center, Bell directly addressed the losses.

""Since I started with the housing authority — I think I can get through this — I’ve lost my daughter, my wife, my father, mother-in-law, six aunts, two uncles, eight first cousins, two mentors,” Bell said. “The reason that I can continue to go on is because when I look out here, it’s about you all. I can’t do anything about my losses, but I can damn sure do something about the people who are living.”

David Nash, who replaces Bell as CEO at HACA, said Bell was well-known for storytelling, regaling people with tales of life on the farm or his grandfather's frugality. Sometimes Bell would talk about his early career as one of the first African American managers at IBM.

""At some point I realized he wasn’t just doing this with staff, that he was doing it with the whole community — and by the whole community, I mean the African American community, the white community, the broader community of Asheville,"" Nash said. ""He didn’t care whether your name was Smith or Cecil, or whether it was Wanda or Shevonda. He could make a connection with people, he can make a connection with people. And he can really make people feel warm and welcome.""

Allison Smith, the property manager for HACA's Pisgah View Apartments, said Bell has always been ""firm and fair,"" balancing safety with livability.

""I think he's just a father figure for anyone who's walked the halls at (the Housing Authority),"" Smith said. ""He was there for everybody.""

Jovan Aiken, a maintenance technician with the Authority for about a year, said Bell helped a lot of people with jobs and ""never left anybody hanging or out to dry.""

Despite the early loss of his mother, Bell said he felt blessed to have grown up with both grandfathers within a mile. “I had a lot of love — as much as I could stand,"" he said. ""I’ve been the luckiest guy in the world.”

A business career came first

Bell graduated from Xavier University in Cincinnati with a degree in business management, then spent 20 years working for IBM, the international computer and management giant. He had upper level management stints in Lexington, Kentucky; Cincinnati;Cleveland, then at IBM headquarters in New Jersey.

Eventually, ""they asked me to move to Charlotte, and at that time it was all about money,” Bell said, noting he was the human relations manager at the time.

“I stayed two years and decided to do something different,” Bell said, adding that he was going to have to relocate once again, and he had a daughter in high school. “So I resigned and bought a construction company. I grew up doing construction work.”

In 1989, bad luck struck much of the Carolinas in the form of Hurricane Hugo, which left a trail of destruction far inland, including extensive damage to homes and other buildings in and around Charlotte.

“After Hugo, we had more business than we could take,” Bell said. “People remember when you treat them right.”

Bell had started coming to Asheville in the early 1970s and was a frequent visitor throughout the ‘70s and 80s with his first wife. In 1994, they moved to Asheville, after Bell met former HACA Director David Jones at an insurance conference. Bell had been working for the Charlotte Housing Authority for two years.

At Bell's retirement party, Jones recounted how heavily he recruited Bell.

""Boy, did I check him out,"" Jones said. ""The harder I checked, the better he looked. Not only was he a good manager and a good person, he reached out into the neighborhoods.""

Looking 'to chill a little bit'

Bell joined Asheville's Housing Authority as director of maintenance and building, but he had no intention of taking the top job.

“I came here to kind of chill a little bit,” Bell said. “I wanted to remodel the house and ride my motorcycle.”

When a boating accident claimed the life of Michael Godwin, who was expected to replaced Jones as CEO, Bell's name rose to the top as the next natural next leader. From childhood, Bell has had a strong sense of service built into his life, and he knew he could do that job — and that he should.

Bell and Jones, having done the same job for so long, truly appreciate each other's service. Bell says Jones was a fine mentor and kept his distance after leaving.

“When Dave left, I think he came to the office one time in a year, maybe two times in a year,” Bell said. “I will do the same thing. If you were ever going to follow in someone’s footsteps, he was the one. He was a gentleman and a scholar.”

Despite the demands of the job, Bell has also felt a calling to serve the community in other ways. Over the years, he has served on the Asheville City Schools board, chaired the Housing Coalition, and he now chairs the Buncombe County Planning Board. He's been on the city’s Civil Service Board, as well as holding several posts with public housing entities in the state and region.

He’s chaired the board of the Young Men’s Institute, and been involved with Buncombe County’s Capital Fund Commission, Read to Succeed and the Isaac Coleman Grant Committee. As a school board member, Bell pushed hard for the new Isaac Dickson Elementary School and Asheville Middle School.

Successes and some lingering problems, including crime

Bell is not one to tout his own accomplishments, but he is “really proud” that the housing authority went to HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration system in which all residents get a housing voucher. That’s allowed a lot of residents to live in other places than public housing units, and it gives them the freedom to move.

The program can pay up to 35 percent of their gross adjusted income. The Housing Authority now has about 3,000 vouchers and about 5,000 residents.

More: New Asheville policy could help some of its poorest residents buy homes

Bell also noted all of the HACA units — Pisgah View, Deaverview, Hillcrest, Klondyke and the Livingston Street apartments, as well as Lee Walker Heights — have been renovated or upgraded during his tenure.

Yet he'll quickly list the “great relationship with resident councils” among his top successes

He also considers surveillance cameras installation in developments to be a major help in curtailing crime, although some residents bristled at what they considered a loss of privacy. “It was tough in the beginning,” Bell allowed.

Bell said is proud the authority's ""banned"" list, typically reserved for residents who've committed serious crimes or threatened physical violence, is the smallest it's been during his tenure.

Crime remains a problem in the city's poorest neighborhoods, which include public housing developments. At a presentation to City Council in late June, Asheville Police Department Deputy Chief Jim Baumstark said gun violence — homicides, robberies and aggravated assaults — has risen 55% in three years.

Baumstark said two public housing complexes in West Asheville and one near downtown account for ""more than half of all calls for gunshot wounds, gun discharges and persons with guns."" Five of the top 10 locations from which calls originated were in and around public housing communities, police said.

Bell acknowledges crime remains a problem, but he also touches on one of his mantras, an opinion shared by other African American leaders in the city: “The problem we’ve experienced is the perpetrators of our crime are (usually) not residents of (public) housing.”

Carl Mumpower, a former Asheville City Councilman who often volunteered in public housing and worked closely with Bell, says Bell ""has carried one of the toughest leadership roles in our community with maturity, balance and courage.""

A conservative who has run for Congress and chaired Buncombe County's Republican Party, Mumpower has been critical of public housing at times, particularly the scourge of drug dealing.

""The drug and criminal culture continues to thrive in public housing,"" Mumpower said. ""That said, it was always my sense that Mr. Bell tried to find solutions and was open to any help he could get. Most of the time there wasn’t much, and that’s not a fight you can win alone.""

Looking for speed, and flat running spots

While he'll stay busy with the Lee Walker project, a $36.5 million transformation, Bell will have a much reduced work schedule. That'll leave time for his other loves, including his family, running and fast vehicles.

An avid runner, Bell has logged scores of races over the years, including a few marathons and 10K’s. Time has taken a toll, though.

“I do maybe 1-3 miles now,” Bell said. “I’m always looking for flat places to run.”

Bell and his wife, Patricia, live in a nice brick rancher in between the Livingston Heights public housing apartments and Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, a home Bell overhauled upon moving in. He’s always gotten a chuckle out of people who suggest he’s out of touch with public housing residents.

“I tell them, ‘I live a block away from public housing,’” Bell said.

While he’s not an extravagant man when it comes to clothes or perks, Bell does have one indulgence: fast vehicles. An avid motorcyclist, his pride and joy is a 790-pound 2013 Harley-Davidson Street Glide dripping with chrome.

When it comes to four wheels, it’s a 2013 Mercedes Benz AMG coupe with an enormous V8 motor and a growl like a Rottweiller on high alert. Bell bought it used, but he knows it still looks like an extravagance.

“You can’t make it logical,” he said.

The Bells have known each other for 27 years, but they just married last December.

Patricia Bell said she’s always been impressed by her husband’s ability to find the good in life.

“He never concentrates on the negatives in life,” she said while sitting in their living room. “It’s all about the good things.”

“And the people that are left,” Bell quickly adds.

At his daughter’s memorial service, Patricia Bell was moved by how Gene Bell concentrated on “nothing but the good times” they had together.

She’s less sanguine about his penchant for speed in the Mercedes.

“The first time I got in there and he stomped the gas, I thought, ‘You’re not 17 or 18 years old,’” Patricia said with a laugh.

Bell said they just completed a 2,450-mile trip up north, so he's pretty sure they're compatible.

He's equally sure he's done right by his community and coworkers over his long career.

""What I've wanted to do is what I've been able to do, and that is to help,"" Bell said.

In fact, Norquist was not even formally the acting deputy; he was “performing the duties of deputy secretary,” a weird formulation intended to comply with the terms of the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

Dave Norquist has admirers beyond Capitol Hill. Equally important are his popularity inside the Pentagon, his successful tenure as Pentagon comptroller, and his broad-based experience. Both his colleagues on the E Ring — whether in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs, and the Service department leaderships — and their staffs respected his judgment, even as he had to make difficult funding allocation decisions.

In addition, as chief financial officer and unlike any of his predecessors, myself included, he successfully oversaw the first-ever, department-wide audit, covering over $2.7 trillion in assets and $2.6 trillion in liabilities. His experience as a partner in the Kearney accounting firm, which focuses on government practice, certainly helped him in this regard. As he was the first to acknowledge, the audit was far from complete. It was by no means what is termed a “clean audit.” Nevertheless, it represented the largest audit of its kind anywhere, and for that he rightly deserved the kudos that he received.

Norquist is no mere accountant, however. He was serving as a key staffer on the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee when I hired him as my deputy. He brought with him not only a fine reputation for diligence and collegiality on the Hill, but also experience in the bowels of the Pentagon as both as a presidential management intern (as the internship program was then called) and then as an Army resource analyst. He also spent time working in the United Kingdom, and his international experience proved exceedingly valuable as he took the lead in managing budget matters arising from the occupation of Iraq.

In that latter capacity, he worked closely with not only key allies, but also the leadership of the State Department’s economics bureau — no small feat at a time when the Department of Defense (DOD) and State were at loggerheads on most issues relating to Iraq.

Norquist’s background and demeanor, therefore, will serve him exceedingly well as the Defense Department’s chief operating officer and as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper Mark EsperChina 'won't stand idly by' if US puts missiles in Asia-Pacific region Esper: US won't 'overreact' to North Korean missile launches Pentagon chief: US would prevent 'unacceptable' Turkish invasion of Syria MORE’s stand-in when Esper is away from Washington. His in-depth knowledge of programs and budgets will ensure that DOD makes the most of the recent budget agreement that will provide the department with stable funding through fiscal year 2021. His international experience as deputy under secretary will serve him in good stead as he interacts with counterparts, both defense ministers and their deputies, worldwide. And his ability to work closely and well with other departments will perhaps provide some comity to an executive branch that often has been chaotic.

Far too many vacancies remain in the Pentagon. This is an exceedingly troublesome circumstance for a department that would have to oversee wartime operations at short notice. Nevertheless, with DOD’s top two positions filled, the civilian leadership that is essential for managing the government’s largest department, both in war and in peace, at last is firmly in place.

The children's lawyer was incensed. Her two tiny clients — one of them blind — had been in a shelter for three months, separated from their mother.

The family had traveled from Mexico to the United States, reaching Nogales, Arizona, on March 1, 2018. Officials at the border found that the mother, Nadia Pulido, had ""credible"" reasons for seeking asylum from an ex-partner who, she says, beat her and stalked her after their relationship ended.

But U.S. Customs and Border Protection still sent Pulido into an adult detention center run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She had an hour to say goodbye and try to assure her blind daughter, 6, and sobbing 3-year-old son that she'd see them in a couple of hours.

""A couple of hours turned into months. Painful months,"" Pulido recalled in an interview.

To help the children, pro bono attorney Maite Garcia turned to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. She filed a complaint with the office on June 7 of last year, explaining that Pulido's daughter was ""completely blind and requires assistance for daily living"" and would be better off with her stepfather, a U.S. citizen.

Nearly two weeks went by before the civil rights office replied.

""The issues you raise are very important to us,"" CRCL finally said in its emailed response. Then came a disclaimer: ""Please be advised that our complaint process does not provide individuals with legal rights or remedies. ... Instead, we use complaints like yours to find and address problems in DHS policy and its implementation.""

That was the last Garcia heard from the nearly 100-person office in Washington, D.C.

The tepid response from the department's civil rights office bolsters objections — not least from former staff — that the DHS watchdog is failing to stop rights abuses as they're happening inside a detention system that's expanding rapidly under the Trump administration.

The ineffectual handling of individual complaints adds to criticism that DHS leaders no longer heed recommendations from the agency's own civil rights experts.

""Put yourself in the shoes of the person who's sitting in the cell or who's separated from their parent or who's wondering where their child is,"" former CRCL staff attorney and adviser Ellen Gallagher said.

A recent whistleblower, Gallagher has accused the civil rights office of failing to investigate multiple individual complaints alleging unjustified solitary confinement of detainees in ICE custody. Gallagher is now with DHS' Office of Inspector General, a separate internal watchdog specializing in issuing reports after lengthy investigations.

""It seems to mislead the public, to invite complaints involving specific information about the individual or the family and the alleged violation, if Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had no intention of specifically investigating or resolving those individual complaints,"" Gallagher said.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has insisted that DHS has ""layers of oversight"" to correct abuses. ""We have good supervisory oversight, and we hold people accountable,"" he said during a July 9 interview on CNN in response to questions about filthy conditions in CBP holding facilities.

Gallagher's impression, however, is that the civil rights office ""was actually fairly intimidated by ICE and CBP and did not want to engage in activity that might offend either. That is an odd and even disturbing posture for an oversight authority.""

Internal CRCL log: a flood of complaints

Some CRCL staff members say that individual employees contact CBP or ICE to try to informally resolve civil rights complaints. But they can only advise agencies, they say, because their office isn't set up to halt abuses as they happen.

Cameron Quinn, chief of the civil rights office and an appointee of President Trump, declined a request for an interview. Another CRCL official responded in writing to questions, asking not to be quoted by name.

""CRCL does not have authority to remedy individual complaints but instead focuses on systemic issues"" at DHS, the official wrote. The office does have authority, however, to seek ""remedies"" for people facing disability discrimination, the official said, declining to elaborate.

""With regard to family separations,"" the official said, ""CRCL investigated the issue from a policy and process standpoint."" The civil rights office then sent its recommendations to ICE and Customs and Border Protection in a memo. CRCL declined to release the memo, calling it a ""deliberative"" document.

CRCL, the official added, still has ""open investigations"" into the separations of children under age 5, the separations of children with disabilities and standards for separating families based on parental criminal history.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was created along with the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The office's mission is to advise the powerful federal department and prevent civil rights violations such as the post-Sept. 11 roundups of Muslims without due process. But some insiders say CRCL has always lacked teeth.

Last year, the civil rights office proved especially weak as complaints about due process concerns and family separations began pouring in — nearly 850 in the first half of 2018 alone, logged into a CRCL database. An independent journalist obtained a copy through a Freedom of Information Act request and then shared it with the Center for Public Integrity and NPR.

The complaints referenced more than 380 separated children 10 years old or younger, of which more than 120 children were age 5 or younger.

More than 140 complaints arrived before the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy on April 6, 2018. More than 160 cases of separation referenced in the log were carried out before that date. The zero-tolerance policy required separating families so that CBP could hold all adults for prosecution, even for a first-time misdemeanor illegal entry.

Former and current staff in the civil rights office say their colleagues were so upset by allegations in the complaints that they openly wept at desks as they reviewed the cases.

By May of last year, senior staff in the office had urged Quinn, in an internal memo, to challenge the separations. ""CRCL should express great concern over our exclusion from these critical decisions,"" which CRCL has the authority to review, the memo said. ""Deliberately harming children to deter parental behavior would require an exceedingly strong justification to pass muster as a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, among other concerns.""

Lawyer and former CRCL senior adviser Scott Shuchart, who resigned from the office last year, said his and other advisers' concerns were ""blown off"" by CBP and other DHS leadership in meetings.

One complaint to CRCL in January 2018 reported that CBP separated a 4-month-old infant from a Mexican father who had prior immigration violations but feared being sent back to Mexico.

Another reported that an 8-year-old said CBP officers ""kicked him and/or hit him with a shoe"" to wake him. Dozens of other complaints described children upset about their parents' uncertain whereabouts and abrupt disappearance — including a 14-year-old in CBP custody who said he was separated after a meal break and was then ""told by officers that his father would be deported.""

About 95% of all complaints logged came from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a unit within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that's responsible for migrant-children shelters.

Former senior staff in this federal resettlement office say the volume of complaints is unprecedented. Robert Carey, ORR director during the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency, said he thinks ORR employees were trying to stop separations by filing complaints.

""You probably have a deeply traumatized, possibly hysterical child that you're trying to care for,"" Carey said. ""I'm guessing some of those cases would require ... the intervention of a therapist, particularly if you're talking about, in some instances, young children.""

HHS officials declined to make leaders in its Office of Refugee Resettlement available for an interview.

Most other complaints came from nonprofit legal aid groups — including 18 filed by the Phoenix-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, where Maite Garcia works.

The complaint about Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son appears on page 276 of CRCL's 366-page document.

Another Florence complaint filed on June 14 of last year appears on page 321. It raises objections to CBP's separation of a Guatemalan mother from her 17-year-old son — who is unable to hear or speak — without regard for his disability. The boy could have qualified to be ""paroled"" into the U.S., a conditional form of humanitarian release. But that never happened — and the case shows how a formal complaint can wither in the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Deaf boy's mom taken away

The story of the mother and her deaf son ""exhibits the cruelty, the chaos"" of how migrants are treated, said Elizabeth Jordan, an attorney with Denver's Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. She represented the mother while the woman was in ICE lockup in Colorado.

On April 25 of last year, the mother and her 17-year-old deaf son approached CBP officers after crossing the Arizona border and asked to apply for asylum.

The boy and his mother now live in Florida, where they are in the process of applying for asylum. In an interview, the mother, who asked that her name not be disclosed, said she'd worked previously in the state, sending money to Guatemala to rent a room for her son and pay his tuition at a school for the deaf there. She eventually returned to Guatemala to care for her son and her own frail mother.

Three months after she got there, her mother died, and her deaf son lost his primary caregiver. He'd long been bullied in Guatemala, and thieves had robbed him at gunpoint. Mother and son both set out for the United States some months later.

""I don't do this for me. I do it for him,"" she said, ""because I'm not going to be alive for all of his life.""

After Customs and Border Protection took her and her son into custody near San Luis, Ariz., the mother said, officers ignored her pleas to keep them together rather than place them in cages segregated by age and gender. Her son, she told the officers, needed her to interpret. When she protested further that her son was mute, she said an officer answered, ""He won't need to do much talking where he's going.""

At some point, while her son was asleep, guards took her out of her cage, the mother said, and transported her to an ICE detention center pending prosecution. She said she was told ""you have to pay for what you did"" because she'd been turned away at the border the year before. She was sentenced to 30 days in an Arizona jail for reentry and then transferred to an ICE detention center in Colorado, pending deportation.

Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had sent her son on a long bus ride to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Arizona, where his only means of communication was drawing pictures.

For more than a month, the mother pleaded in vain with detention guards, first in Arizona and then in Colorado, to arrange a video call so she could at least see and sign with her son. Medical records from the boy's time in the shelter indicate he was distraught: He struck his head against walls and cut himself with a paper clip. In an interview in Florida, interpreted by his mother, he said that to prevent him from getting out of bed one night, he was physically restrained.

""She was profoundly distressed and so worried about him,"" lawyer Jordan said of the mother. ""This is a person who has devoted her life to keeping him safe and getting the best she can for him. And then, for her to be totally unable to check in on him for weeks ...""

A round of emails between the boy's attorneys and DHS' civil rights office ultimately went nowhere.

Initially, a CRCL adviser seemed to be working on the Florence project's June 2018 complaint, arguing that the deaf boy merited humanitarian parole and that for two months the shelter hadn't ""provided him with the appropriate accommodations"" for his disability. The adviser wrote that the civil rights office was ""reviewing your concerns""; he asked for proof the boy was deaf.

In July 2018, one of the boy's lawyers emailed CRCL to write that when CBP held the boy in custody, he ""was able to understand that the agents were mocking him"" because they didn't believe he was deaf.

The lawyer further argued that CBP, ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency in charge of shelters, were all in violation of disability rights because they had failed to arrange a video call between the boy and his mother.

The official from the civil rights office then replied that he was ""unable to look into [the boy's] ongoing concerns"" because the teenager had been transferred by CPB, which is within DHS' jurisdiction, to ORR, which is not.

Instead, he suggested, the civil rights office could investigate the mother's concerns because she was in ICE custody, which, like CBP and CRCL, falls under DHS. The boy's attorneys gave the civil rights official contact information for Jordan, the mother's Colorado lawyer.

By that time, Jordan had already been emailing local ICE officials repeated pleas to set up a video call. The call finally happened — nearly three months after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers had separated the mother and her son. But it wasn't because of action by DHS' civil rights office, Jordan said. It was because DHS was by then under court order to put separated migrant family members in touch with one another by phone and then reunite them.

""In my interactions with individual CRCL officers,"" Jordan said, ""I don't get the sense that they're out to lunch or bad people. I think that they just ultimately can't get much done. I think it comes from being really hamstrung by the fact that they have to work with ICE and get ICE to concur in their recommendations and actually make changes.""

In the children's interest

Although Trump ended his zero-tolerance policy in June 2018 after a public outcry, U.S. border agents have continued to separate families due to parents' criminal records, even for minor offenses, or because of prior deportations.

Immigrant rights groups have long pressed DHS to consider the children's interests, and they've noted that family separation ""causes great harm, disrupting emotional and psychological well-being.""

For failed asylum-seeker Nadia Pulido, the groups' pressure came too late.

Pulido was born in Mexico but is a fluent English-speaker who arrived in California as an undocumented child and was raised by relatives. She could have qualified for a special visa for abandoned children, but no one sought such a visa on her behalf. When she was ""literally just young, stupid and hanging around the wrong crowd,"" she said, she was convicted of robbery and deported.

Because of that history, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE chose to send her children to a shelter and keep her in detention last year while her asylum case went forward.

ICE could have released her on humanitarian parole. Instead, she was held in detention for eight months, until she lost her asylum bid. She could have appealed, but that would have meant more detention — and more time apart from her young children. In the end, Pulido agreed to be deported to Mexico.

After four months in a shelter, Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son were finally released to her husband, a U.S. citizen. Attorneys for the children and Pulido believe a federal lawsuit that led to a court order unifying migrant families was likely a factor. And they doubt their complaint to DHS' civil rights office did anything to hasten the children's release.

In Mexico, where the kids have now joined her, Pulido said she's still scared. To support her need for refuge, she presented Mexican police reports about incidents involving her ex-partner; and in her asylum application, she wrote that he assaulted her while she was pregnant and held a gun to her head.

""We were leaving Mexico to seek help in the United States,"" she said, ""to stay free of danger.""

Three Fermilab scientists receive DOE Early Career Research Awards,https://news.fnal.gov,[],,,,https://news.fnal.gov/2019/08/three-fermilab-scientists-receive-doe-early-career-research-awards-2/,"The Department of Energy’s Office of Science has selected three Fermilab scientists to receive the 2019 DOE Early Career Research Award, a prestigious award designed to bolster the nation’s scientific workforce by providing support to exceptional researchers during the crucial early years, when many scientists do their most formative work. The effort is now in its 10th year.

This year, 73 scientists from across the nation – including 27 from DOE’s national laboratories and 46 from U.S. universities – have been selected to receive funding as part of DOE’s Early Career Research Program.

“Supporting our nation’s most talented and creative researchers in their early career years is crucial to building America’s scientific workforce and sustaining America’s culture of innovation,” said Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. “We congratulate these young researchers on their significant accomplishments to date and look forward to their achievements in the years ahead.”

Profiles on these three individuals and their research will published over the next few weeks. The Fermilab recipients are:

"Russia probe’s price tag nearly $32 million, DOJ says",https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/02/russia-probe-price-tag-32-million-1445269,"Alex Wong/Getty Images legal Russia probe’s price tag nearly $32 million, DOJ says

Spending in the Russia investigation for the duration of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s work hit nearly $32 million, according to a government report released Friday.

That total covers all of Mueller’s receipts through the end of May, soon after he had closed his office and issued his 448-page report, which did not contain enough evidence to prove a criminal conspiracy between Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia but did show evidence suggesting the president tried to thwart the probe.

Story Continued Below

Mueller’s office alone was responsible for about $16.4 million in spending dating to its creation in the spring of 2017. But the Department of Justice has also itemized $15.3 million that accounts for spending on the Russia investigation that would have happened whether or not the special counsel’s office had been established.

By far, Mueller’s largest line-item went toward salaries and benefits: $9.7 million over the course of his nearly two-year investigation. His office also reported spending $3.1 million on rent, communications and utilities; $1.6 million on travel and personal transportation; and $902,000 on contractual services that primarily covered information technology.

Government spending on the Russia probe has been a frequent point of contention for President Trump, who in late May complained the investigation had come with a $40 million price tag.

In fact, Mueller’s spent far less than that. And that also doesn’t count what the government has taken into its coffers from Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman whose convictions and plea deal resulted in the forfeiture to the Treasury of real estate, bank accounts and a life-insurance policy.

“The cost of your investigation to the taxpayers approaches zero,” House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said last month during Mueller’s appearance before the Democratic-led panel, saying the figure recovered by the government was “as much as $42 million.” Others have estimated the figure may be much lower once the amount of money Manafort owed on his mortgages is deducted.

DOJ has released four spending statements connected with the Mueller probe — it put out one every six months — since December 2017. Friday’s report said that a final tally is expected later this year and will cover any additional administrative costs or adjustments tied to closing Mueller’s office, which at its peak employed 19 lawyers. Mueller also relied on about 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants and other professional staff.

CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect uncertainty about how much money the government has recovered after prosecuting the Manafort case."
"At the US Education Department, applications for loan forgiveness languish",https://www.cnbc.com,['Annie Nova'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/under-betsy-devos-defrauded-students-find-it-hard-to-get-rid-of-debt.html,"When Morgan Marler's 5-year-old daughter, Lilian, asks her why she doesn't work anymore, Marler doesn't know what to say.

""I can't explain debt to her,"" Marler, 29, said. ""And how I went to school and it was all for nothing.""

Marler attended ITT Technical Institute, a now-shuttered for-profit school, between 2013 and 2016. The school has since been found to have misled students with false advertisements. Marler, for her part, was told students typically went on to make $70,000 a year. After she graduated, the best jobs she could find were at call centers that paid $10 an hour — less than she'd been making before she enrolled at the school.

Her associates degree at ITT left her with $30,000 in student loans, and she's asked the Department of Education to cancel her debt, but has yet to hear back. That was nearly three years ago.

A federal judge ruled last year that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' delays of an Obama-era regulation aimed at forgiving the student debt of defrauded students were illegal. Still, advocates say, the department continues to neglect the applications of those like Marler."
Interior secretary will be allowed to meet with former fossil fuel clients starting this weekend,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-secretarys-ethics-pledge-is-set-to-expire-this-weekend-729e7e959374/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s ethics recusal will expire on Saturday. The ethics pledge banned Bernhardt from decisions involving his former firm’s clients for two years.

Bernhardt was also not able to meet with these companies, unless five or more other stakeholders were present and nothing relating specifically to the companies was discussed.

But all of this is set to change on August 3.

Prior to joining the Interior Department in 2017, Bernhardt worked as a lobbyist for the oil and gas industry via the Colorado law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Among the firm’s 22 clients that Bernhardt was prohibited from engaging with for two years under his ethics recusal were energy companies Halliburton, Eni, and Statoil (now known as Equinor). Other clients included industry groups such as the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

The end of Bernhardt’s recusal was marked on Friday by a ribbon-cutting ceremony hosted by the Clean Water Fund at a park across from the D.C. Interior headquarters.

During his time in the Trump administration, Bernhardt’s ethical issues have taken center stage. He has so many potential conflicts of interest to avoid that he carries around a card listing all of them so he doesn’t forget. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that Bernhardt has more conflicts of interest than any other Trump Cabinet nominee. (ThinkProgress is an editorially independent news site housed at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.)

In April, Politico revealed that Bernhardt reportedly worked closely on matters he had pledged to recuse himself from. Just weeks after Bernhardt joined the administration, he was working on policies related key water infrastructure policy which he had worked on as a lobbyist. The ethics agreement had barred him from involving himself in “particular matters” with Westlands Water District for just one year, until August 2018.

The California water district is known for having tried to weaken the Endangered Species Act.

And in September 2018, an appearance by Bernhardt at a water industry forum in Colorado was canceled after department ethics officials concluded it could raise conflicts-of-interest concerns.

Public records released by the Western Values Project in February 2018 also that found Bernhardt’s former client, the IPAA, frequently communicated with Interior officials conducting a review of the department’s sage grouse policy. In March 2017, for instance, the IPAA thanked Bernhardt for his action as deputy secretary that benefited the oil and gas industry.

It’s not just Bernhardt though who has faced questions over conflicts of interest.

Just two weeks after Bernhardt was officially confirmed as head of the agency — following the departure of scandal-ridden former Secretary Ryan Zinke — the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) confirmed an investigation into six other senior DOI officials who may have also potentially violated their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

At the same time, this week, a slew of controversial new appointments were welcomed at Interior.

William Perry Pendley, a former senior official from the Reagan administration, was appointed acting director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Pendley, former president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, has long fought to undo the federal government’s control over public lands.

In a 2016 National Review article, Pendley wrote: “The Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold… Westerners know that only getting title to much of the land in the West will bring real change.”

Pendley has in the past sued the Interior Department on behalf of the fossil fuel industry and has tried to undermine endangered species protections along with working to reduce the size of federal lands in favor of development.

Also this week, a climate denier tied to the coal industry was appointed as a senior adviser in the department. Christian Palich previously worked as the president of the pro-Trump Ohio Coal Association until 2017. Palich comes to the Interior this week from lobbying firm Siekman, Siekman & Associates, whose clients include Halliburton and pipeline firm Sunoco Logistics. He was also previously deputy associate administrator for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Palich has made numerous Fox News appearances praising President Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and he has frequently doubted established climate science on Twitter, calling it “junk science.”

After Trump’s election, for example, he tweeted: “Time to push fight [sic] back on all the radical enviro regs that have been illegally been [sic] brought on America over last 8 yrs.”

And finally, after 10 years, the department now has a Senate-confirmed inspector general. Mark Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General — will be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Bernhardt and others at the department.

When pressed by lawmakers earlier this year on his appointment, Greenblatt asserted he had “zero intent” of shutting down any ongoing investigations into the department’s operations."

Breir told lawmakers, ""Mexico has consistently stated it will not pay for a border wall. The president and Congress will ultimately make a decision about funding.""

Getting Mexico to the pay for the border wall was one of Trump's signature campaign promises in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has said after taking office that he fulfilled this promise by renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and securing more favorable terms for the U.S.

Breier's key position in the State Department as head of western hemisphere affairs includes purview over relations of significant U.S. interest, including Venezuela, Mexico and the Northern Triangle. She previously served in the U.S. intelligence community and as director of the U.S.-Mexico Futures Initiative for the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington, D.C.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.

10-year Treasury yield plunges below 1.74% after China counters US trade action,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-falls-to-nearly-3-year-low.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 1.74% on Monday, its lowest level since November 2016, after China countered new U.S. tariffs, escalating the protracted trade war between globe's two biggest economies.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, used as a benchmark for mortgage and auto loan rates, fell 12 basis points to 1.735%, its lowest level since Nov. 9, 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9 basis points to 2.293%, while the rate on the 2-year Treasury dropped 12 basis points to 1.581%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

The 10-year Treasury note yield, down more than 30 basis points in August, returned less than the 3-month Treasury bill at 2.017%.

The bid for Treasurys and pivot away from stocks came after actions by China fueled a new wave of trade anxiety across global markets.

China, which has in the past tinkered with its currency to boost its exports, allowed the yuan to fall to its lowest level in more than a decade, making Chinese exports cheaper. The onshore yuan broke above 7 per U.S. dollar, drawing the online ire of President Donald Trump, who voiced his complaint on Twitter.

""China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It's called 'currency manipulation.' Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!""

Trump's criticism on Monday came less than three months after his Treasury Department decided not to label China a currency manipulator. Despite promises to label Beijing as such during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the administration has passed on five opportunities to do so thus far.

Bloomberg News also reported that Beijing has asked state-owned companies to refrain from buying U.S. agricultural goods.

These moves came four days after Trump announced that the U.S. on Sept. 1 would impose a 10% tariff the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had eluded duties. The news pushed the S&P 500 to its worst weekly performance of the year. The S&P 500 dropped 31% last week. The Dow had its second-biggest weekly drop of 2019 last week, sliding 2.6%."
