Trump Walks Out on Pelosi and Schumer After 3 Minutes,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Peter Baker', 'Katie Rogers', 'Emily Cochrane']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/donald-trump-speech-pelosi-schumer.html,"The blowup at the White House was reminiscent of a meeting in January when Mr. Trump erupted at Ms. Pelosi during the partial government shutdown as he sought money for his promised border wall. After she refused to go along, he snapped “bye-bye” and stormed out.

In this case, Mr. Trump has been in a foul mood since Monday, snapping at aides about his rally in Pennsylvania and complaining about news media coverage of the investigations. In his view, people close to him said, Democrats are seeking to render his presidency illegitimate.

While Democrats assumed he planned to stage a scene at the meeting all along, White House aides said it did not come up at an 8:30 a.m. meeting of the communications team. Instead, they said, Mr. Trump saw Ms. Pelosi’s comments, which she made around 10 a.m., and seethed with anger.

He then met with a small group of aides in the Oval Office about 45 minutes before she was to arrive at 11:15 a.m. and talked through what he planned to do. He did not get pushback from the assembled aides, though others who were not in the room objected, according to an administration official. Another official insisted that was not the case.

When Mr. Trump entered the Cabinet Room for Wednesday’s meeting with the Democrats, he did not take his seat near the center of the table and instead stood at the end of the table and admonished his guests, according to an account from two people in the room, one Republican and one Democrat.

After Mr. Trump walked out, Ms. Pelosi turned to other Democrats there and recounted a story about how Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt had each brought people together to solve infrastructure problems.

“I knew he was looking for a way out,” Ms. Pelosi concluded. “We were expecting this.”

Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, was in the room. “Respectfully, Madam Speaker,” she asked, “do you have a direct response to the president?”"
Mnuchin Says He Has 'Not Yet' Reviewed Memo Mandating IRS Turn Over Trump Tax Returns,https://www.npr.org,['Brian Naylor'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/22/725702479/mnuchin-says-he-has-not-yet-reviewed-memo-mandating-irs-turn-over-trump-tax-retu,"Mnuchin Says He Has 'Not Yet' Reviewed Memo Mandating IRS Turn Over Trump Tax Returns

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he has ""not yet"" reviewed a confidential draft Internal Revenue Service memo, which reportedly says the agency must turn over a president's tax returns to Congress unless the president asserts executive privilege.

Appearing before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Mnuchin said he looked at the memo for the first time ""literally on the way up here.""

According to the memo, obtained by the Washington Post, disclosure of the president's tax forms ""is mandatory, requiring the Secretary to disclose returns, and return information, requested by the tax-writing Chairs.""

Mnuchin has refused to allow the IRS to turn over President Trump's tax returns, saying Congress has no legitimate legislative purpose in seeing them. But the draft memo says the law ""does not allow the Secretary to exercise discretion in disclosing the information provided the statutory conditions are met.""

Mnuchin said he is looking into why the draft memo had not reached his desk.

Breaking with recent precedent, Trump never disclosed his tax returns while a candidate for president, claiming it was because they were under audit. But that would not prevent Trump from releasing them if he so chose. IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig testified last month that there is no rule prohibiting Trump from releasing his tax returns.

Rep. Sanford Bishop of Georgia asked, ""If anybody's tax return is under audit, is there a rule that would prohibit that taxpayer from releasing it?""

Rettig replied, ""I think I've answered that question. No.""

Mnuchin also told the panel on Tuesday that he has ""had no conversations ever with the president or anyone in the White House about delivering the president's tax returns to Congress.""

Echoing Trump, Mnuchin said voters knew the president was not releasing his tax returns and elected him anyway.

Release of his tax returns is one of many inquiries by congressional Democrats that Trump is resisting. On Monday, a federal court ruled that Trump cannot block his accounting firm from turning over his financial records, a decision Trump said he will appeal.

The issue of releasing his tax returns is also likely to be resolved by the courts."

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and the Trump Organization on Wednesday lost their bid to block Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp from providing financial records to Democratic lawmakers investigating Trump’s businesses.

U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos ruled at a court hearing in New York that Congress has the legal authority to demand the records, clearing the way for the banks to comply with subpoenas issued to them by two U.S. House of Representatives committees last month."
"Hope of bipartisanship fades as Trump ends Pelosi, Schumer meeting over ""cover-up"" comment",https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital', 'Kathryn Watson']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-speech-to-reporters-in-the-rose-garden-live-stream-unscheduled-event-today-2019-05-22/,"Any remaining hope of bipartisanship faded quickly Wednesday as President Trump cut short a scheduled meeting with top Democrats on infrastructure and made a surprise appearance in the White House Rose Garden to declare legislative efforts on that front — and possibly others — dead in the water until Democratic leaders ""get these phony investigations over with.""

The president's 12-minute remarks to reporters — reporters who had been hastily gathered to the Rose Garden with no prior warning or indication of what was happening — marked a clear breakdown in talks as the president appeared inflamed by remarks House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made Wednesday morning following a meeting with the Democratic caucus. Earlier that morning, Pelosi told reporters the president engaged in a ""cover-up,"" a claim the president dismissed as absurd.

""We did nothing wrong,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""They would have loved to say we colluded ... they were out to get us."" And he called the Mueller investigation ""a takedown attempt at the president of the United States.""

The infrastructure meeting with the president and top Democrats lasted only a few minutes, according to a person familiar with the meeting and a White House official. According to the person familiar with what happened, the president walked in, without shaking anyone's hand or sitting down. The president, according to the person familiar, said he wanted to work on infrastructure, a trade agreement, a farm bill and more, but insisted Pelosi said something terrible and accused him of a cover-up. Mr. Trump said there wouldn't be two tracks, according to the person familiar, and told the Democrats that once investigations are over, they can discuss other things. He then left the room before anyone could speak, according to the person familiar.

""I walked into the room and I told Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, I want to do infrastructure ... you can't do it under these circumstances,"" the president told reporters in the White House Rose Garden.

As he has said in the past months, Mr. Trump declared that ""no collusion, no obstruction"" had taken place. The special counsel determined that there was insufficient evidence of conspiracy but could not reach a conclusion on obstruction after the nearly two-year long investigation.

The fault, Mr. Trump said, lies with ""the other side.""

""The crime was committed on the other side — we'll see how that turns out,"" the president suggested, knocking Democrats for continuing to carry out investigations of his administration.

""It was a total horrible thing that happened to our country. It hurt us in so many ways,"" added Mr. Trump.

""It turns out I'm the most — and I think most of you would agree to this — I'm the most transparent president probably in the history of this country,"" the president remarked. ""Instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people who just said I did coverups, I don't do coverups.""

The president didn't stop there, firing off a series of tweets blasting Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and saying that legislation and investigations cannot happen at the same time.

""You can't investigate and legislate simultaneously - it just doesn't work that way. You can't go down two tracks at the same time. Let Chuck, Nancy, Jerry, Adam and all of the rest finish playing their games...."" the president tweeted.

Back on Capitol Hill after the impromptu Trump announcement, Pelosi and Schumer said they hoped they could work with the president on bipartisan issues, but that appears impossible.

Schumer suggested the president used congressional investigations as a ""pre-planned excuse"" to avoid figuring out an infrastructure plan.

""We are interested in doing infrastructure. It's clear the president isn't. He is looking for every excuse,"" Schumer told reporters.

Pelosi said Democrats wanted to give the president a change for a ""signature infrastructure initiative,"" but ""for some reason, maybe it was lack of confidence on his part ... He just took a pass.""

""In any event, I pray for the president of the United States,"" she told reporters."

Why North Korea called Joe Biden an “imbecile” and “a fool of low IQ”,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18635370/north-korea-joe-biden-imbecile-trump,"North Korea just signaled its immense disdain for a top American leader. And no, it’s not President Donald Trump.

In a Tuesday statement, the state-run Korean Central News Agency published a scathing article targeting top Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden. While it contains bombastic language, the piece also includes pointed, insulting remarks about the former vice president and references the controversy over how he has interacted with women.

The reason North Korea is lashing out dates back to Biden’s campaign launch last Saturday, where he rhetorically asked a Philadelphia crowd, “Are we a nation that embraces dictators and tyrants like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un?” That comment referred to Trump’s admiration of autocrats and apparent preference for them over democratic leaders.

Pyongyang doesn’t take kindly to criticisms of its leader, especially when it comes from a top American political figure. After a few days, North Korea struck back with a vengeance.

“What he uttered is just sophism of an imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being, let alone a politician,” read the statement. “He has been accused even within the Democratic Party, to say nothing of the American society, for his vulgar acts and words about women and his thoughtless remarks.”

It continued, calling him “a fool of low IQ,” and listed off a series of embarrassing moments in Biden’s life. For example, the piece touches on how Biden fell asleep during a 2011 speech by then-President Barack Obama, or how in 1987 he admitted to plagiarizing in school.

And then, well, there’s this: “[H]e is self-praising himself as being the most popular presidential candidate. This is enough to make a cat laugh.” (My cat, for the record, prefers food and endless pets to laughter.)

And the #DPRK dips into #Election2020, terming @JoeBiden ""bereft of elementary quality as a human being"" for criticizing Kim Jong Un. pic.twitter.com/YDV15hijLe — Steve Herman (@W7VOA) May 22, 2019

Yes, this is all silly — but the statement also reveals something quite interesting.

First, it’s clear that the North Korean regime has a very long memory and a deep understanding of American politics. The commentary cited moments in Biden’s past that most Americans either forgot or didn’t know. It goes to show that operatives in Pyongyang are very aware of what key US figures are doing and have done — or they’re excellent at searching for information online.

And second, it shows that Pyongyang simply isn’t that into Biden. North Korea’s “animosity toward him is deep and guaranteed,” Van Jackson, an expert at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, tweeted Tuesday night. “It’s under appreciated how ‘hostile’ Obama’s sanctions and military posturing toward Pyongyang were in 2016. Biden 2020 is to Kim Jong Un as Clinton 2016 was to Putin.”

Biden’s campaign seems fine with that. “Given Vice President Biden’s record of standing up for American values and interests, it’s no surprise that North Korea would prefer that Donald Trump remain in the White House,” Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesperson, told me.

That means Pyongyang won’t rejoice if Biden defeats Trump next year — which is why it may be trying to make its preference known now.

“I think if Trump reads the commentary, he’ll be happy about it”

While North Korea’s Tuesday statement came in reaction to Biden’s Kim comment, it’s also worth looking at Pyongyang’s acerbic words as a clear message to Trump.

“North Korea knows that it will benefit from a good relationship with Trump, so the commentary was probably made to support and please him,” Rüdiger Frank, a North Korea expert at Austria’s University of Vienna, told me. “I think if Trump reads the commentary, he’ll be happy about it.”

That makes sense. While Kim and Trump threatened to go to war in 2017, the years since have featured two dramatic summits and a general pause in North Korea’s weapons tests. Whether Kim genuinely likes Trump or believes he can extract concessions from the president, it’s clear he still wants him in the Oval Office after the next election.

“North Korea has not been shy in the past about seeming to publicly favor one side or another in US and Korean elections,” Mintaro Oba, who worked on North Korea at the State Department, told NK News on Wednesday. “They’re probably calculating there’s more to gain from creating a perception they favor President Trump than any cost from criticizing a potential future president so early in the race.”

It’s therefore likely that North Korea may say harsh things about any Democratic candidate who goes against Trump, whether or not Biden is the nominee. So it’s (kind of) official: North Korea endorses Donald Trump for president."
Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost to leave before year's end: Sources,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-chief-carla-provost-to-leave-before-years-end-sources,"U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost is expected to leave her post by December, according to several high-ranking former Department of Homeland Security and union officials with first-hand knowledge of the plan.

Provost, the first woman to lead the 95-year-old federal law enforcement agency, will retire by the year’s end, wrapping up her 24-year career, the Washington Examiner has learned.

The 48-year-old lifetime Border Patrol employee has served as permanent chief for less than a year. She was acting chief from April 2017 through August 2018 and officially took over late last summer after Robert Perez was confirmed by the Senate as deputy commissioner of Border Patrol’s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection.

Provost has led the agency’s 20,000 employees during a turbulent time as the organization struggles to handle the more than half a million people apprehended while illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in the first six-and-a-half months of fiscal 2019. It will also leave another hole in DHS, which has more than a dozen vacancies at the senior level.

“It’s not going well over there. The pressure’s outrageous,” said a former Customs and Border Protection leader who was aware of her forthcoming departure, who added she may leave earlier than December.

Two officials said Manuel ""Manny"" Padilla was most likely to take over when Provost leaves. Padilla is director of the Department of Homeland Security Joint Task Force West and served 30 years with Border Patrol. He was tapped in April to head the department's interagency emergency border cell.

Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.

Provost joined the Border Patrol in her early 20s after working a short period as a police officer in her home state of Kansas. She worked in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. She went on to take over its Washington-based internal affairs office in 2015.

Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan credited her last August for her work in internal affairs and the lowering of firearm-related incidents even as assaults against agents jumped to a record high. However, an Intercept report last year showed assaults were being counted in a new way where each rock thrown at an agent counted as an assault.

Provost was endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, the primary union for agents, at the time of her promotion to chief in early 2017.

“Carla is an agent's agent,” McAleenan said at the promotion announcement last August. “She's come up through the ranks.”

Since taking over Border Patrol as acting and permanent chief in early 2017, Provost has been on the receiving end of the Trump administration's attempts to go after unauthorized immigrants and thwart illegal immigration, including the family separations that took place during the ""zero tolerance"" policy.

Provost sat down with the Examiner last May and said one of her greatest frustrations was the amount of coverage on “anything that’s in a negative fashion.""

“I would tell you it doesn’t make it into the media generally because it’s not sexy,” Provost said. “I have seen and I’ve done it myself. Border Patrol agents — they apprehend people. They’re hungry and they’re thirsty. They go through a drive-thru on their way to take them in and they use their own money to buy them food and something to drink. I, many a time back in the day, ran through — whether it was McDonald's usually in Douglas because there wasn’t a lot of options — but agents do those things.""

On Monday, a 16-year-old unaccompanied Guatemalan boy died while in Border Patrol custody. The death marked the fourth minor to die in Customs and Border Protection custody this fiscal year and brought criticism from immigrant groups and Democratic lawmakers concerned about overcrowded conditions at government facilities on the southern border.

Mnuchin Presses Companies for Trade War Contingency Plans,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/irs-trump-tax-returns.html,"Walmart has said that it is working on strategies to mitigate the pain of the tariffs to keep prices low. A Walmart spokesman said that it was not unusual for the company to be in touch with White House officials.

“We’re viewed by Republican and Democratic administrations as an important bellwether of the economy and the health of the American consumer,” he said, “so it’s not uncommon that current and past administrations would reach out reach out to us on important issues like this.”

Retail analysts suggested that despite such efforts, companies cannot necessarily adjust their business plans as quickly as the trade winds blow.

“It is not something that can be changed overnight,” said Christopher Mandeville, an analyst at Jefferies. “Having said that, management has been aware of tariff risk for some time now, where, in circumstances that allow for it, they could shift sourcing to nearby countries in Southeast Asia.”

Mr. Mnuchin said that his “expectation is a lot of this business will be moved from China” and that there will be only a small number of items where tariffs are passed on to consumers.

While Mr. Mnuchin has privately cautioned against tariffs, on Wednesday he argued that depreciation of China’s currency could blunt some of the effects of the tariffs by making Chinese products cheaper to buy. He also said that it was yet not certain that the next round of tariffs would be imposed, noting that Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will most likely meet at the G-20 summit meeting next month in Japan.

However, Mr. Mnuchin was far less optimistic about a deal than he was just a month ago.

“We were beginning to send out the date for the two presidents to meet and have a signing ceremony,” he said. “Unfortunately, China has taken a big step backward.”"
DOJ agrees to share some Mueller documents with Democrats,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-agrees-to-share-some-mueller-documents-with-democrats,"The Justice Department has agreed to share some documents from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation with House Intelligence Committee Democrats -- but warned that their cooperation would grind to a halt should the panel move to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt.

The agreement comes amid negotiations between committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and the DOJ for the full Mueller report and underlying evidence and documents from the probe -- and effectively hits pause on Schiff's efforts to enforce a subpoena against the DOJ.

NADLER SUBPOENAS HOPE HICKS, ANNIE DONALDSON AFTER MCGAHN DEFIES PANEL'S DEMANDS

“The Department of Justice has already begun the process of identifying, locating, and reviewing the materials potentially responsive to the categories of documents [requested by the Committee],” the Justice Department said in a statement Tuesday, warning that it is a “process that will not continue should the Committee take the unnecessary and unproductive step of moving to hold the Attorney General in contempt.”

Schiff appeared to accept the Justice Department’s response while maintaining that their subpoena remains in effect.

“DOJ has accepted our offer, and will begin turning over to the Committee twelve categories of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence materials beginning this week. Our subpoena will remain in effect, and be enforced should DOJ fail to comply with the full document request,” Schiff tweeted Wednesday.

Schiff, though, said that while the Democrats are ""pleased"" they will receive documents, the Justice Department's cooperation on this specific matter is ""no substitute in any way, shape or form"" for the testimony of Mueller himself, and former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

""We have every expectation that [Mueller] is going to appear before our committee as well as the Judiciary Committee,"" Schiff told reporters Wednesday, stressing the importance of having Mueller testify in a public hearing. ""We're going to insist on that being the case as well.""

It's unclear whether Mueller will testify before any committee. Meanwhile, the agreement comes after the Judiciary Committee already voted, on party lines, to hold Barr in contempt for not turning over the unredacted Mueller report and other documents.

The president had asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

AG BARR: 'I FELT THE RULES WERE BEING CHANGED TO HURT TRUMP'

In the agreement with the House Intelligence Committee, the DOJ identified 12 categories of documents

""The Department may be in a position to discuss making them available to the Committee in relatively short order, subject to processing and reviewing"" and consultations with the intelligence community, the DOJ said.

Schiff said the ""initial production should be completed by the end of next week.""

The Justice Department already has made available a minimally redacted version of the special counsel’s report to a select group of congressional Democrats. The Justice Department said Tuesday, though, that “no Democrat has accepted the Department of Justice’s offer to review a less-redacted report at the Department of Justice.”

Internal memo orders military to restrict information it shares with Congress,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Missy Ryan', 'Reporter Covering The Pentagon', 'Military Issues', 'National Security', 'Greg Jaffe', 'National Security Reporter', 'May At Am']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/lawmakers-bristle-at-new-rules-for-sharing-pentagon-information-with-congress/2019/05/21/79315df9-d792-41df-a42e-10df9af7306e_story.html,"Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan has mandated new restrictions on the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress about military operations around the world, a move that is straining ties with key Republican and Democratic lawmakers.

In a May 8 internal memo, which was obtained by The Washington Post, Shanahan lays out the criteria for when Pentagon officials may provide congressional offices or committees information they request about operational plans and orders.

The memo comes as lawmakers from both parties complain that the Trump administration has withheld information that prevents them from executing their constitutionally mandated oversight role. Some lawmakers are also concerned about whether Shanahan has allowed the military to be drawn too deeply into President Trump’s immigration agenda.

“Congress oversees the Department of Defense; but with this new policy, the department is overstepping its authority by presuming to determine what warrants legislative oversight,” Reps. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) and Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.), the chair and ranking Republican of the House Armed Services Committee.

The memo was shared widely inside the Pentagon but was sent to key lawmakers only after inquiries by The Post. It outlines a half-dozen guidelines, including requirements that military officials and political appointees evaluate whether the request “contains sufficient information to demonstrate a relationship to the legislative function.” The memo urges Defense Department officials to provide a summary briefing rather than a requested plan or order itself.

The memo appears to have been inspired by concerns that lawmakers, who have security clearances, will not safeguard military plans. It calls on officials to assess “whether the degree of protection from unauthorized disclosure that Congress will afford to the plan is equivalent to that afforded” by the Pentagon.

Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the memo “seems to be another way in which they can claim that they don’t need to respond to legitimate inquiry of Congress.” Reed received the memo Saturday, shortly after The Post asked the Pentagon about it.

“From what I can glean from the memorandum basically they can use any factor they want to say no and they can make a determination what they think we need to do our job,” Reed said in an interview. “I think we’re better positioned to determine what we need to do our job.”

A defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe military officials’ thinking about the memo, said Pentagon leaders had been concerned about preserving the military chain of command and about the potential for congressional interference in what they consider to be an executive branch function, the formulation of military operations.

The official said that Congress had been most interested in learning more about Special Operations activities, which are among the most sensitive military operations but have also, in recent years, produced some of the biggest public backlashes.

“While I understand they’re not happy . . . we’ve gone from saying no to setting a process to adjudicate and consider saying yes,” the official said.

The guidelines represent a dramatic twist in a decades-long tug-of-war between the Pentagon and Congress over access to sensitive information.

While lawmakers routinely request information on a host of military matters, including weapons programs, personnel procedures and support to allies, they are also sometimes provided classified information about current or future military operations, which they are barred by law from disclosing.

The memo could complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Shanahan, who took over in January after his predecessor, Jim Mattis, resigned over differences with Trump. Shanahan is expected to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee in June.

Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said the new policy aims to increase “transparency and information sharing with Congress.”

Under Shanahan’s direction, Buccino said, “the Department of Defense has been engaging with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees to develop a process for providing Congress with access to plans and operational orders, including Executive Orders.”

While Trump has praised Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, numerous lawmakers have expressed skepticism about his ability to act as a counterweight to the president and his closest advisers in delicate matters of national security. Mattis labored to insulate the military from the country’s divisive politics and the White House, which won him plaudits from lawmakers but damaged his relationship with Trump.

Since taking on the top Pentagon job, Shanahan has presided over a deepening of the military’s involvement along the southern border, a mission Mattis viewed with skepticism but did not resist.

Some lawmakers see Shanahan’s decision to shift resources toward construction of a border wall, which has helped make up for Congress’ refusal to allocate funds for that purpose, as an effort to flout their prerogative.

In the new memo, Shanahan concentrates responsibility for evaluating congressional requests in the office of the undersecretary of defense for policy, which is typically led by a political appointee. Previously, officials across the Defense Department responded to requests on a more ad hoc basis, in keeping with what officials described as a “gentleman’s agreement” with lawmakers.

According to Reed, obtaining access to such information has become harder since Trump took office. Reed cited a 2017 operation in Niger in which four U.S. service members died, after which he said lawmakers had to “track down” the related operational orders and review the legal authorities under which troops were operating.

But officials from both the Pentagon and Capitol Hill agreed that a more formalized process for sharing information, if done in a mutually acceptable way, would be of value.

A former senior Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the memo did not appear to establish a more difficult process for routine congressional requests related to other oversight topics, including policy and budgetary issues.

“Rather, it appears to set an elevated, formal and mostly reasonable process relative to requests for a specific and especially sensitive subset of Pentagon materials provided the Pentagon doesn't seek to weaponize the process to frustrate a broader range of oversight requests, which would be deeply problematic,” the former official said.

Smith and Thornberry said they intended to address the sharing of operational information in this year’s defense authorization bill, which is now being drafted.

They appeared particularly galled by the memo’s suggestion that Congress might make sensitive information public, which they characterized as “inexcusable and inaccurate.”

“The Department is not in a position to evaluate defense committees’ worthiness to receive classified information, nor characterize our ability to appropriately protect it,” they said."

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said during a congressional hearing Wednesday that a redesign of the $20 bill to feature abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman would not be ready in time for a planned 2020 release.

""The primary reason we've looked at redesigning the currency is for counterfeiting issues,"" Mnuchin said when asked by Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., whether the new currency would be ready on time. ""Based upon this, the $20 bill will now not come out until 2028. The $10 bill and the $50 bill will come out with new features beforehand.

""The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary's down the road.""

Mnuchin explained during his appearance before the House Financial Services Committee that his department would ""meet the security feature redesign in 2020"" but ""the imagery feature will not be an issue that comes up until, most likely, 2026.""

After then-President Barrack Obama said he thought putting more women on U.S. currency was a ""pretty good idea,"" Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew asked for public comment about which woman should be added.

""We actually listened to people. And there was a legitimate concern about what bill a woman goes on the front of, and what story we had to tell,"" Lew said. In April 2016, he announced that Tubman would be replacing Jackson on the $20 and that Jackson would be moved into a scene of the White House on the reverse side.

Lew admitted that it would be up to the next Treasury secretary to see the change through, but he said the change's popularity would lead to backlash if it was abandoned.

""I don’t think someone is going to want to do that,"" he said.

Pressley asked Mnuchin – who agreed ""representation is important,"" but refused to say whether he thought U.S. currency should be more reflective of American diversity – whether he supported putting Tubman on the $20 bill.

""I've made no decision as it relates to that,"" he said.

Pressley argued that the change to the bill was made after a lengthy ""community process.""

""It's a decision of the secretary of the Treasury,"" he replied. ""Right now, my decision is focused on security features.""

When Pressley asked Mnuchin whether he agreed with President Donald Trump – who said in 2016 that replacing former President Andrew Jackson with Tubman on the $20 was ""pure political correctness"" and suggested she instead could be placed on the $2 – Mnuchin again said his focus was on the currency's security features.

""So does that mean you have no intention of executing the redesign as planned by your predecessor?"" Pressley asked.

""That is correct. I have not made a decision to execute on a redesign,"" he said.

""People other than white men built this county. And Sec Mnuchin agrees, yet he refuses to update our #currency,"" Pressley said in a tweet after exchange. ""#HarrietTubman #MarianAnderson & #EleanorRoosevelt are iconic Americans & its past time that our reflects that. #RepresentationMatters.""

Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

The May 8 document lists criteria for when Defense Department officials are allowed to provide congressional offices or committees with information regarding operational plans and orders, according to the newspaper.

The Pentagon hit back at the criticism, saying the new policy is intended to increase transparency between the Pentagon and Congress.

“In establishing this policy, Secretary Shanahan seeks to increase transparency and information-sharing with Congress. Under his direction, the Department of Defense has been engaging with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees to develop a process for providing Congress with access to plans and operational orders, including Executive Orders. This policy establishes such a process. Previously, no such policy existed,” Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said in a statement to The Hill.

The memo, which was reportedly shared widely within the Pentagon but was sent to key lawmakers after inquiries from the Post, lists six guidelines for information sharing with Capitol Hill.

The document orders military officials and political appointees to determine whether a congressional request “contains sufficient information to demonstrate a relationship to the legislative function” and urges officials to provide a summary briefing instead of the requested plan or order itself.

It also gives responsibility for evaluating congressional requests to the undersecretary of Defense for policy, often a political appointee. Officials across the Pentagon previously responded to requests on an ad hoc basis.

The memo appears to arise from worries that lawmakers could leak military plans, calling on officials to evaluate “whether the degree of protection from unauthorized disclosure that Congress will afford to the plan is equivalent to that afforded” by the Pentagon, according to the Post.

The memo “seems to be another way in which they can claim that they don’t need to respond to legitimate inquiry of Congress,” Sen.

“From what I can glean from the memorandum, basically they can use any factor they want to say no and they can make a determination what they think we need to do our job,” he continued. “I think we’re better positioned to determine what we need to do our job.”

An anonymous Pentagon official told the Post that the agency’s officials had been worried about potential congressional interference in the formulation of military plans, what the Defense Department considers to be an executive branch function. The official added that Congress had been most interested in special operations activities, which are highly sensitive and have produced significant public backlash in recent years.

I.R.S. Memo Undercuts Mnuchin on Withholding Trump’s Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/irs-memo-trump-taxes.html,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service has no choice but to honor congressional requests for President Trump’s tax returns unless he invokes executive privilege to protect them, according to a draft legal memo written by agency staff members.

The memo appears to undercut the reasoning offered by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has refused to comply with Democrats’ requests because they lack a “legitimate legislative purpose.” Mr. Mnuchin said he made his decision after consulting with lawyers from the Treasury Department, the I.R.S. and the Justice Department.

But the I.R.S. memo says the Treasury secretary does not have the authority to deny tax-writing committees’ requests for taxpayer returns.

The House Ways and Means Committee is seeking six years of the president’s personal and business tax returns. Mr. Trump has not asserted executive privilege to block the request, and his personal lawyers have asked the Treasury Department not to release them. The president has indicated that he is prepared to take the legal fight over his returns to the Supreme Court."
DHS has 'strong concerns' Chinese-made drones stealing data,https://www.ktvz.com,['David Shortell'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.ktvz.com/news/national-world/dhs-has-strong-concerns-chinesemade-drones-stealing-data/1079685723,"Copyright 2019 CNN Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert.

Copyright 2019 CNN Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

The warning from DHS follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump last week that effectively banned US firms from using telecommunications equipment made by the Chinese company Huawei, which has drawn similar national security concerns of government spying.

The US and China are currently locked in a trade war that has frayed the two countries' relationship as it deteriorated in recent weeks.

US officials have raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones in the past. In 2017, the US Army issued a ban the use of DJI drones, alleging in a memo that the company shared critical infrastructure and law enforcement data with the Chinese government.

Also that year, an internal report from an intelligence division of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency in Los Angeles assessed that DJI was ""selectively targeting government and privately owned entities within (the US. critical infrastructure and law enforcement sectors) to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive US data.""

Users are warned to ""be cautious when purchasing"" drones from China, and to take precautionary steps like turning off the device's internet connection and removing secure digital cards.

The alert also warns users to ""understand how to properly operate and limit your device's access to networks"" to avoid ""theft of information.""

""Organizations that conduct operations impacting national security or the Nation's critical functions must remain especially vigilant as they may be at greater risk of espionage and theft of proprietary information,"" the alert states.

In a statement, DJI said that it gives customers ""full and complete control over how their data is collected, stored, and transmitted,"" adding that ""customers can enable all the precautions DHS recommends.""

""At DJI, safety is at the core of everything we do, and the security of our technology has been independently verified by the U.S. government and leading U.S. businesses,"" DJI said.

""For government and critical infrastructure customers that require additional assurances, we provide drones that do not transfer data to DJI or via the internet, and our customers can enable all the precautions DHS recommends. Every day, American businesses, first responders, and U.S. government agencies trust DJI drones to help save lives, promote worker safety, and support vital operations, and we take that responsibility very seriously,"" DJI said.

DJI, which reported $2.7 billion in revenue in 2017, is best known for its popular Phantom drone. Introduced in 2013, the drone is the top-selling commercial drone on the market.

Seventy-nine percent of drones operating in the US and Canada and 74% globally are made by DJI, according to a 2018 market sector report from Skylogic Research, an industry analyst.

Industry experts say the drone's easy-to-use software combined with sophisticated cameras and advanced technology allowed DJI to take over sales in the US for hobbyists, as well as professional organizations.

""A lot of companies found out that using a drone to inspect a roof or to inspect industrial facilities is a really good way -- you save a lot of people climbing ladders,"" said Kay Wackwitz, the CEO of Drone Industry Insight, a market research and consultancy company focused on the commercial drone market.

Agencies from local police departments to the Interior Department have used drones for sensitive work. According to the 2017 ICE memo, contractors in Kansas building a DHS bio-defense facility used a DJI drone ""to assist with construction layout and provide security during construction."""
E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."
U.S. eases curbs on Huawei; founder says clampdown underestimates Chinese firm,https://www.reuters.com,"['Brenda Goh', 'Min Read']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-usa-license-idUSKCN1SQ27T,"SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States has temporarily eased trade restrictions on China’s Huawei to minimize disruption for its customers, a move the founder of the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker said meant little because it was already prepared for U.S. action.

The U.S. Commerce Department blocked Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from buying U.S. goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war between the world’s two top economies, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.

The two countries increased import tariffs on each other’s goods over the past two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said China had reneged on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.

On Monday, the Commerce Department granted Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19 to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to Huawei smartphones, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements.

Shares of U.S. suppliers to Huawei including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp and Lumentum Holdings Inc rose, with the Philadelphia Chip Index up 2.1%.

Radio frequency chipmaker Qorvo was the latest U.S. supplier after mobile parts maker Lumentum to halt shipments to Huawei.

It is unclear what the U.S. government extension permits, but if it allows Huawei to keep purchasing components, the company will likely order more to build inventory, said Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.

Huawei is still prohibited from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without further, hard-to-obtain licenses.

Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on Tuesday told Chinese state media that the reprieve bore little meaning for the company as it had been making preparations for such a scenario.

“The U.S. government’s actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities,” Ren said in an interview with CCTV, according to a transcript published by the Chinese state broadcaster.

The temporary license suggests changes to Huawei’s supply chain may have immediate, far-reaching and unintended consequences for its customers.

The Commerce Department said it will evaluate whether to extend the license period beyond 90 days.

CURRENCY FIRMS

China’s yuan firmed versus the dollar on Tuesday as news of the reprieve eased some worries that trade tensions would be further inflamed and inflict deeper losses on the currency.

Beijing has struck an increasingly defiant tone as the trade war has escalated, saying it will take measures to safeguard the interests of its companies, but has not said whether or how it may retaliate over the U.S. action against Huawei.

President Xi Jinping’s Monday visit to a rare-earth company in southern China sparked speculation that the sector could be the next front in the trade war, driving up shares in Chinese rare-earth related firms on Tuesday.

China produced 80% of rare-earths, a group of 17 chemical elements used in electronics, imported by the United States in 2017.

“Given the Huawei decision, I feel they (China) have no choice but to retaliate, for face sake,” Cliff Tan, head of East Asian research at MUFG Bank in Hong Kong, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, at a media briefing, rebuffed Trump’s claim that his tariffs were causing companies to move production away from China, saying foreign investors remain enthusiastic about the country.

GOOGLE SUSPENSION

Huawei is on the receiving end of a U.S. government accusation that it engaged in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and move money via the international banking system. Huawei has pleaded not guilty.

The trade blacklist has added to its woes, following which Alphabet Inc’s Google suspended some business with Huawei, Reuters reported on Sunday citing a person familiar with the matter, raising worries about the Chinese firm’s smartphones that run on Google’s Android operating system.

Monday’s temporary license is likely to allow companies such as Google to continue providing service and support, including software updates or patches, to Huawei smartphones that were available to the public on or before May 16.

“Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone’s best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Tuesday.

The license also allows Huawei to engage in the development of standards for fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks.

APPLE PRAISE

Ren put up a brave front on Tuesday, reiterating claims that the restrictions will not hurt Huawei’s prospects and that no other company will be able to catch up with Huawei in 5G technology in the next two to three years.

China was nevertheless still “far behind” the United States in technology, he said.

Chip experts have called out Huawei on its claims that it could ensure a steady supply chain without U.S. help, saying the technology it buys from American companies would be “hard to replace.”

Nearly 16% of Huawei’s spending on components in 2018 went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm, Intel and Micron Technology, analysts said.

Ren said Huawei was at odds with the U.S. government, not U.S. firms, and in a comment that trended on Chinese social media, he praised Apple Inc’s iPhones, saying he gifted the American firm’s devices to family members.

“Apple has a good business ecosystem. ... We cannot think narrow-mindedly that loving Huawei equals loving its phones.”

U.S. firms could lose up to $56.3 billion in export sales over five years from stringent export controls on technologies involving Huawei or otherwise, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation said in a report. Missed opportunities threatened as many as 74,000 jobs, the foundation said."

In response to a question from Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, about proposed tariffs and potentially higher prices on items including diapers, infant formula and strollers, Mnuchin said he discussed such concerns with Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs.

""I can tell you I am monitoring the situation very carefully. I was on phone with the CFO of Walmart, which obviously is one of the biggest sellers of the items that you've described to specifically understand from Walmart what things they can source from other areas and what items they can't,"" Mnuchin said at the House Financial Services Committee hearing.

""I would say we haven't made any decisions yet, but we will be especially sensitive to the consumer items,"" Mnuchin said.

Mnuchin added that he speaks with Biggs on a ""regular basis"" and has ""spoken to all of the major companies that provide consumer goods"" about the issue. Asked for comment, Walmart reiterated statements from its first-quarter earnings call made by Biggs and the chief executive of its U.S. arm, Greg Foran.

""In regards to tariffs, we continue to monitor the situation. Our goal is always to be the low price leader and we'll continue to actively manage pricing and margins with our customers and shareholders in mind,"" Biggs said Thursday. ""We're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low, that's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices we believe for our customers.""

Foran later added on the earnings call: ""Merchants are managing costs and retails on an item by item basis. We are working closely with domestic and international suppliers to drive higher efficiency and reduce costs."""

The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.

The Trump administration's action was welcome news to some environmentalists. “Certainly we have a ways to go,” said George Kimbrell, legal director at the nonprofit advocacy group Center for Food Safety, whose lawsuit prompted the EPA’s action. “But it's an important first step in acknowledging the harm they cause.”

The EPA has pulled other neonics from market before, agency spokesman John Konkus said in an email. But close observers of the agency say such actions are rare.

“For the EPA to pull a previously registered pesticide is a pretty major step,” said Mark Winston, a professor of apiculture and social insects at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C. “It’s not something they do very often.”

The decision follows five years of litigation in which the beekeepers and environmentalists pressed the agency to mount a response to the use of neonics as regulators in Europe and Canada have taken steps toward banning the chemicals.

Finally, at the end of 2018, three agribusinesses — Bayer, Syngenta and Valent — agreed to let the EPA pull from shelves the 12 pesticide products used by growers ranging from large-scale agricultural businesses to home gardeners. The legal settlement also compels the EPA to analyze the impacts of the entire neonic class on endangered species.

Two of the pesticide makers, Bayer and Valent, say their products are tested and safe to use, noting that the environmentalists and beekeepers won their case on the technical grounds that the EPA did not follow the right steps under the Endangered Species Act when registering their products.

“Neonicotinoids are rigorously tested before going to market to ensure they can be used safely and effectively,” said Steve Tatum, a spokesman for Valent, which makes four of the delisted products.

Bayer noted its two products targeted by the EPA action are not sold in the United States. But spokesman Darren Wallis added: “Growers rely on these critical pest-management tools because of their performance against destructive pests, as well as their favorable human and environmental safety profile.”

Concern over neonics has grown since 2006, when beekeepers first started witnessing the sudden and mysterious collapse of honeybee hives across the nation.

Researchers have shown the compounds to be harmful to bees in laboratory tests. But they have had less luck pinning down the pesticides’ effects on beekeepers’ colonies when they go about their work pollinating apple orchards and other farms.

In his second term Barack Obama, who had earlier approved installing a beehive on the South Lawn of the White House, launched an initiative to promote the health of honeybees and other pollinators.

But Rebecca Riley, legal director of the nature program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that the agency has failed often in the past to adequately consider the potential impact of its pesticide approvals on endangered animals — something every federal agency is supposed to do.

“EPA for years has been ignoring this requirement of the law,” she said.

That has led to a number of lawsuits, such as one the NRDC filed in 2017, asking a federal court to vacate the registrations of nearly 100 products that contain one of several insecticides that are harmful to various bees, butterflies, birds and insects. That case remains unresolved, even as the separate Center for Food Safety case led EPA to pull some pesticides from the market.

“This is a win for both the rule of law and also for bees, birds and other wildlife impacted by these pesticides,” Riley said of the latest case. “But the reality is there are hundreds of pesticide products on the market. So, this is important … but it does not get rid of the danger.”

POWER PLAYS

— EPA doesn't send rep to hearing: Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to send a representative to testify during a hearing about a Trump administration proposal to roll back Obama-era mercury regulations. “I am continually frustrated and surprised by the administration's refusal to send witnesses to Congress,” she said. “And the EPA's refusal to show up today is just another example of the efforts to block Congress from performing its oversight functions. And so we're going to have to move forward, but it would be really helpful if we had the agencies here to help us.”

— Nominee for top Interior Dept. lawyer advances: The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced the president’s pick to be the Interior Department solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, on a party-line vote. Jorjani advanced despite objections from Democrats including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who criticized the nominee during Tuesday’s panel meeting. “It concerns me Mr. Jorjani has spent the past two years he served as acting solicitor overturning prior interpretations of our public lands laws in a manner that is out of step with the congressional intent,” Manchin said in a statement. “The Solicitor must uphold the law above all else—above party, politics, and ideology. That was not the sense I got from Mr. Jorjani’s responses to our questions.”

— Texas bill could penalize pipeline protesters: Under a new bill approved by both chambers in Texas’s state legislature, protesters who are found to have delayed pipeline operations or otherwise damaged equipment could face up to a decade in prison. “The Texas Oil & Gas Association applauded its passage and said the bill provides property owners and pipeline companies ‘greater protections against intentional damage, delays, and stoppages caused by illegal activity,’” Bloomberg News reports. “Environmental groups, meanwhile, called the measure an assault on free speech.” Cyrus Reed, interim director for the Sierra Club’s Texas chapter, said the bill is about “silencing protesters trying to protect their water and land.”

— “Flint is everywhere here”: California’s low-income farmworkers who pick crops in the state’s Central Valley are experiencing a water crisis that is affecting more than 1 million Californians. “Today, more than 300 public water systems in California serve unsafe drinking water, according to public compliance data compiled by the California State Water Resources Control Board,” the New York Times reports. “Though water contamination is a problem up and down the state, the failing systems are most heavily concentrated in small towns and unincorporated communities in the Central and Salinas Valleys, the key centers of California agriculture.”

— The reality of plastic pollution: A new study found there are about 414 million pieces of debris scattered across the remote Cocos Islands of Australia, which could be an underestimate because a lot of the waste is below the surface, NBC News reports. The findings could suggest the amount of plastic polluting the world could be much more than previously realized. “The scientists surveyed seven of the 27 islands, which made up 88 percent of the total landmass of the islands, and estimated that they were littered with 262 tons of plastic. A quarter of those pieces of debris were single-use or disposable items such as straws, bags and toothbrushes (about 373,000 of them). The researchers also identified about 977,000 shoes,” per the report.

— A wild spring storm: A powerful spring system drove a variety of extreme weather throughout the country on Monday and Tuesday, with serious flooding and more than 20 tornadoes blasting through the Southern Plains, The Post’s Jason Samenow reports. ""Flash flooding proved to be more of a widespread hazard than the tornadoes,” he writes. “Flooding spread from the north and west sides of Oklahoma City northeast to Tulsa, where four to eight inches of rain fell in a short time. Roads were closed, and numerous high-water rescues were required.”

Biden would beat Trump in Pennsylvania despite president's 2016 win: Donna Brazile,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Julia Musto', ""Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S"", ""America'S Newsroom.""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-would-beat-trump-in-pennsylvania-despite-presidents-2016-triumph-in-the-state-over-hillary-clinton-donna-brazile,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has what it takes to win back a key battleground state for the Democratic Party that President Trump took in 2016, according to ex-DNC Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile.

Brazile, speaking during an interview on ""America's Newsroom"" Tuesday, said Biden would be able to make up the less than one percentage point Trump won by in Pennsylvania over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

“Look, I think it’s going to be a close election across the country. But, Donald Trump won the state of Pennsylvania by less than 50,000 votes,"" she said.

""Joe Biden will be able to make that up. But, not just Joe Biden—any one of the Democrats I think can be very competitive in the Keystone State.”

TRUMP, AT RAUCOUS PENNSYLVANIA RALLY, SLAMS SCRANTON-BORN BIDEN: 'HE DESERTED YOU'

Brazile’s comments follow a fiery rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, Monday night where the president hit hard at Biden.

As he was ending his speech, Trump told a packed crowd, “Don’t forget: Biden deserted you. He’s not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state. Remember that, please.”

Biden served as a Senator from Delaware for over 30 years but was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

""This guy talks about 'I know Scranton,'"" Trump said. ""Well, I know the places better. He left you for another state and he didn't take care of you.""

JOE BIDEN TELLS YOUNG ACTIVISTS HE STARTED PUSH TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE IN 1987

Brazile countered, “He’s well known in Pennsylvania and he’s not the forgotten son. He is the forgotten hero.”

A Quinnipiac University poll released last week shows Biden beating Trump in a head-to-head matchup in Pennsylvania 53 to 42. Additionally, according to a report from Politico using what it said was the Trump campaign’s internal polling, Biden is also ahead in two more highly contested states: Wisconsin and Michigan.

However, both Biden and the president will face a packed field in 2020 with 22 other Democratic candidates now in the running and a long road still ahead.

“The one thing you can give Joe Biden credit [for] is he understands the electorate and he wants to win,” said Brazile. “But, again, he has to get through the Democratic primary...Joe Biden has got to not only maintain his lead, but he has to expand his appeal to voters who might not be familiar with his record as well as voters who might want to see a different face in the White House in 2020.”

In modern times, presidents have rarely been church mice afraid of a little salty language. But President Donald Trump has grown increasingly willing in recent months to say in public what most of his predecessors tried to keep behind closed doors.

His is the profanity presidency, full of four-letter denunciations of his enemies and earthy dismissals of allegations lodged against him. At rallies and in interviews, on Twitter and in formal speeches, he relishes the bad-boy language of a shock jock, just one more way of gleefully provoking the political establishment bothered by his norm-shattering ways.

In a single speech on Friday alone, he managed to throw out a “hell,” an “ass” and a couple of “bullshits” for good measure. In the course of just one rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, earlier this month, he tossed out 10 “hells,” three “damns” and a “crap.” The audiences did not seem to mind. They cheered and whooped and applauded.

“I’d say swearing is part of his appeal,” said Melissa Mohr, the author of “Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing,” published in 2013. “It helps create the impression that he is saying what he thinks, ‘telling it like it is.’ We tend to believe people when they swear, because we interpret these words as a sign of strong emotions. In his case, the emotion is often powerful anger, which his supporters seem to love.”

While traditionalists may deem it unpresidential and a poor example for children, Martha Joynt Kumar, a longtime scholar of presidential communication, said gritty language was part of the show put on by Trump, the onetime reality television entertainer, for his fans.

“He knows they like him to use words that lie over the edge of the traditional boundary of presidential decorum,” she said. “His controversial word choices are an aspect of his role as the disrupter he promised his constituents he would be.”

But critics say the vulgarity comes at a cost. “No one has debased the civil discourse in this country more than President Trump, and the president really does set the tone in the country,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “We see it reflected in our offices by the hateful, belligerent, obscene and violent calls that we get now that we didn’t used to get.”

Schiff has experienced it personally when Trump turned his name into a profanity last fall by nicknaming him “little Adam Schitt.” Schiff said, “The last time that happened, the person who did that had their mouth washed out with soap by his mother.”

An unscientific survey seems to suggest that if anything, Trump is growing more comfortable with crudeness. He used the word “bullshit” in public just once in his first two years in office, according to the Factba.se database that tracks his speeches, but on four occasions in the last three months.

He has either coarsened the public discourse or reflected it, or perhaps both, depending on your view of him, but he is not alone. Society in recent years has embraced what used to be considered profanity. Even The New York Times, the so-called Gray Lady with all the news that’s fit to print, found it fit to print the BS word just 14 times in the many years before Trump’s inauguration, according to a Nexis search, but has used it 26 times since — not all in stories covering the president.

Other presidents, of course, have engaged in common language and found a connection to everyday people. Harry S. Truman was told to “give ’em hell, Harry,” to which he famously replied: “I don’t give them hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it’s hell.” But in general, it used to be something of a mini-scandal when a president was caught cursing in public.

During a campaign event in 2000, George W. Bush was heard over a live microphone talking with his running mate, Dick Cheney, calling a Times reporter he did not particularly like a “major-league asshole.” In 2004, as vice president, Cheney told a senator on the Senate floor to “go fuck yourself.” His successor, Joe Biden, was overheard in 2010 using a variation of that profanity to tell Barack Obama what a big deal passage of health care legislation was.

Never has any president pushed the boundaries of language as far as Trump. He had a foul mouth long before politics, of course, but he seemed to try, however fitfully, to clean it up for a while when he set his sights on the White House. Still, he could not resist at times. At one rally during his 2016 campaign, he quoted a supporter calling a Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a “pussy.”

Once taking office, he tried, at least, to keep it private, but he was uninhibited when the cameras were not on. After the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was appointed, he told aides, “I’m fucked.” Speaking with lawmakers, he called African nations “shithole countries.”

Yet Trump feigned shock in January when the newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan said she and her fellow House Democrats were “going to impeach the motherfucker.” The president told reporters that “she dishonored herself” by “using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.”

Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, acknowledged a certain raw quality in Trump’s discourse but dismissed its significance. “The president does use coarse language in private a lot with us,” he told Jake Tapper on CNN after Tlaib’s comment. “Many people do.” But, he added, “I think there’s more important things as to who’s coarsening the language.”

Any restraint Trump may have sought to exhibit early in his term seems to have eroded in recent months. In a January interview with The Times, he boasted that he had “beat the shit out of” Republican rivals in 2016. A month later, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference that his enemies were trying to take him out “with bullshit.”

A few weeks later, he told a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that Democrats were peddling “ridiculous bullshit” about him. In April, he said some statements in the special counsel report were “total bullshit.” Last week, he retweeted a post by his son Eric Trump saying that under Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor now running for president, “our great city has gone to shit.”

By the time the president took the stage before the National Association of Realtors in Washington on Friday, he was in a feisty mood.

He recalled that a consultant tried to make work for himself by identifying environmental concerns on a property Trump wanted to develop. “I fired his ass so fast,” the president recalled.

He told the Realtors that he used to refuse to pay brokers their traditional 6 percent commission and instead gave them just 1 percent. “I was famous for that,” he said. When they booed, he quickly retreated. “Don’t worry. Nobody accepted it. But I tried like hell.”

Then he went after one of his favorite targets — journalists — claiming that recent reports of infighting within his national security team were made up. “There is no source,” he said. “The person doesn’t exist. The person’s not alive. It’s bullshit, OK? It’s bullshit.”

Tillerson quietly meets with House lawmakers to discuss Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Zachary Cohen'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/tillerson-meeting-house-foreign-affairs/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson quietly met with the top Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday for an interview that focused primarily on his time in the Trump administration, a congressional aide with direct knowledge of the discussion confirmed to CNN.

Tillerson traveled to Capitol Hill where he sat down with the committee's Democratic chairman Rep. Eliot Engel and ranking Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, the aide said, adding that major topics of interest included the administration's dealings with Russia and uncertainty surrounding the role of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in deciding foreign policy.

The interview lasted roughly seven hours, including breaks, the same source said.

On Wednesday, a House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican aide called on the Democratic majority to release the transcript from Tillerson's meeting, claiming the ""tone and facts"" of the discussion were skewed by some media reports.

""We believe Tillerson's testimony best speaks for itself, and are hopeful that our Democrat chairman will release the full transcript of the meeting to the public soon,"" the aide said.

""Contrary to media reports, Secretary Tillerson made clear that 2016 Russian election interference was raised clearly at the highest levels with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Regarding Kushner, every single administration is entitled to choose and seek counsel from their own advisers. Tillerson emphasized that all presidents ultimately and appropriately determine which advice to follow in their decisions,"" they added.

A Democrat committee aide told CNN that Tillerson will have the chance to review the transcript before any of it is made public.

""Per an agreement with Secretary Tillerson, he will have the chance to review the transcript before any of it is made public. Our Republican colleagues were aware of this arrangement prior to yesterday's interview,"" they said.

In his prepared opening statement submitted to the committee leaders, Tillerson explained why he returned to Washington to speak with lawmakers.

""As you know, I am here today voluntarily in response to your request for my testimony. I chose to come back to Washington to speak with you today on a bipartisan basis because I understand and appreciate the critical role that Congressional oversight of the Executive Branch plays in our constitutional system,"" he wrote, according to a copy of the remarks released Wednesday.

""That role is especially important with respect to foreign affairs, where our position is strengthened when the world knows that we speak with one voice in protecting America's interests abroad,"" Tillerson added.

In a statement also released Wednesday, Engel applauded Tillerson for his willingness to appear before the committee.

""It's become clear that across the government, President Trump is trying to shut down any inquiry into what his Administration is doing. That's why Rex Tillerson's appearance before the Committee was so heartening. It's how the government is supposed to work: Congress and the executive branch seeking answers together,"" he said.

While specific details related to the meeting remain murky, it is clear that Tillerson's visit to Capitol Hill came as a surprise to many in Washington, including to some members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Several members of the House panel did not know about the interview until after it was first reported by The Daily Beast , according to a Republican lawmaker and an aide to a Democrat on the committee.

Tillerson was unceremoniously fired i n March 2018 and replaced by Trump's current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Tension between Tillerson and Kushner, who effectively ran a shadow State Department on Middle East issues, was well documented before Engel and McCaul probed the former top diplomat on the issue Tuesday.

As was the frayed relationship between Tillerson and the President, himself.

In a December 2018 interview with CBS News, Tillerson called President Trump ""undisciplined.""

""When the President would say, 'Here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it.' And I'd have to say to him, 'Well Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law. It violates treaty,'"" he said at the time.

Tuesday's meeting comes as House Democrats seek to use their power as the majority party to conduct various oversight investigations into Trump's financial dealings and foreign policy decisions.

Specifically, Democratic lawmakers have expressed interest in learning more about Trump's meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- and signaled they would like to know more about specific interactions between the two leaders that occurred during Tillerson's tenure at the State Department.

In January, CNN confirmed that after a 2017 meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, Trump took the interpreter's notes and told him not to share anything about the discussion with anyone else, according to a former State Department official who was in Hamburg when the meeting took place.

Senior White House and State officials who work on Russian issues asked for notes on the meeting and did not get them, the source said.

Another former State Department official said that Tillerson did not provide a readout of the meeting to US ambassadors in the region at the time. The source said that ""Tillerson played stuff pretty close to his chest"" with all meetings and this one was no different."

EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

The EPA plans to stop counting potential lives saved from new pollution rules. GM reveals a platform that's connected to the future. Stanford scientists devise a way to use seawater to make hydrogen. And our latest Twitter poll asks what types of incentives work best to sell EVs. All this and more on Green Car Reports.

In its latest effort to unwind the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the EPA is considering a new analytical model that will quit counting thousands of lives potentially saved by cleaning up the air, according to a new report in The New York Times.

GM introduced a new electrical architecture expected to go into most of its cars by 2023, which can provide faster communications for electric drive systems, self-driving, and infotainment, with future expandability and Tesla-style over-the-air updates.

How to make enough hydrogen is one of the main challenges with fuel-cell cars. Getting it from water, in addition to requiring a lot of energy, could stress water supplies. Now scientists at Stanford have figured out how to make lots of it from seawater. That leaves several other challenges unsolved, however.

After checking out how Norway managed to find success with electric cars, our latest Twitter poll asks, ""What kinds of EV incentives are most effective?""

Spy photographers from our partners at Motor Authority have caught images of the new Chevy Bolt–based electric SUV from GM out testing on public roads. The new model, which could be called the Bolt EUV, is expected to be built alongside the Bolt EV in 2021.

Finally, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recalled almost 200,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans—but not the Pacifica Hybrid this time—for an electrical problem that could lead to a stall or a lack of power-steering assistance.

Piketon protesters voice radiation fears as US Energy Secretary Rick Perry urges officials to move quickly on testing,https://www.dispatch.com,"['Jessica Wehrman', 'Jessica Wehrman Dispatch Washington Bureau', 'Jessicawehrmanjoanne Viviano The Columbus Dispatch']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190521/energy-secretary-urges-piketon-officials-to-move-quickly-to-test-for-nuclear-contamination,"WAVERLY — Holding signs saying “We want to live” and T-shirts pleading “Don’t Dump on Our Future,” a handful of children joined other protesters Tuesday outside a U.S. Department of Energy event designed to answer questions about the cleanup efforts at a former uranium enrichment plant in southern Ohio.

Crystal Glass of Piketon said the children needed to be there because “they are our future.”

“We’ve suffered enough here,” said Glass, whose 5-year-old daughter, Ruby Torian, wore a rainbow-colored tutu as she played in the grass outside the Pike County YMCA.

The protest drew 15 to 20 people who live in areas around the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, which enriched uranium from the mid-1950s until 2001.

>>VIDEO: Pike County residents allege nearby uranium enrichment plant causes cancer

Their concerns stem largely from recent discoveries that a form of the radioactive metal neptunium had been detected in 2017 by a U.S. Department of Energy air monitor outside Zahn’s Corner Middle School in Piketon.

Residents and local officials also were alarmed by an April report from researchers at Northern Arizona University that detected uranium and plutonium in homes, schools and creeks around the plant. DOE later disclosed that it had also found a form of a second radioactive metal, americium, in 2018.

Federal and state officials have said that the amounts detected by the DOE are of such a low amount that they do not pose health concerns. Still, the agency has agreed to fund a new round of independent testing to be conducted by a firm chosen by local officials.

U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday sent a letter to Gov. Mike DeWine urging the community to quickly pick the third-party company that will conduct the additional independent testing so it can be completed before the upcoming school year.

Perry was responding to a Thursday letter to a DOE official from DeWine, who said his understanding is that the amounts of neptunium and americium detected “are far below any public health risks."" He asked the DOE ""to provide any new radiological data to (the Ohio Department of Health) as soon as possible so that department experts can evaluate this data to make informed decisions regarding any potential public health concerns.”

Perry responded that he has directed the department to provide local and state authorities with all raw air-monitoring data from the 16 Portsmouth air-sampling locations from 2015 through the first quarter of 2019.

The third–party, independent study will be paid for via an existing grant to Ohio University. The third party will conduct tests of the Piketon community’s four schools and other areas of interest, Perry wrote.

But finding a third-party group to test the site has turned out to be something of a challenge, said Matt Brewster, health commissioner for the Pike County General Health District. He said his agency has spoken to four different labs that have backed out.

""When they realize what the scope of the work is as far as DOE involvement and the political nature of it all, they decline,” he said. “It’s a small, specialized field and some people, I think, don’t want to ruffle the DOE’s feathers if they have major contract work that comes from DOE.”

Inside at the open house, Jeff Bettinger, the DOE's Piketon site lead, said he hopes the new independent study will answer the community’s questions.

People who have worked in the industry for a long time, he acknowledged, may not always appreciate that the public views the issues differently.

“It’s a lesson to be learned, and we’re gonna get through it,” he said.

Cathy Eick of Waverly is a substitute teacher who has worked at Zahn’s Corners, which closed early for the year last week due to contamination fears.

She was joined at Tuesday’s protest by daughters Madison Scott, 17, and Kaylee Scott, 12, who both attended the school.

Eick said the community has seen too many deaths, cancers and illnesses that have not been explained. And she wonders what is going on.

“My kids have had friends that have either passed away or they’ve watched them fight cancer and it’s just not acceptable, especially when you hear the reports that they find something in your school that can make your child sick,” she said. “The amount doesn’t really matter as much as it’s shocking that they found it there, and it isn’t acceptable.”

Eick lost her 26-year-old son, Corey Scott, to a heart condition two years ago. Now, she’s contacted her physician to ask if anything should be done for her daughters over the contamination concerns.

""I’m not willing to lose another child,” she said.

Glass, who protested outside the DOE meeting, said she was 36 when she was diagnosed last April with a rare woman’s cancer and went through surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. She attended Zahn’s Corners as a child.

Many can’t just pick up and leave the community, and Glass believes the government should pay plant neighbors for properties that have lost value due to contamination concerns. She plans to leave the community next year for Alabama and says some others are giving up.

DOE has rankled locals by declining a request to cease cleanup work until testing is done. Residents and local officials also oppose plans for a dumpsite on the plant property.

Charles Lux, who worked 18 years at the plant as a senior scientist, joined the protesters outside the YMCA, saying the government should perform full-body testing on the schoolchildren and teachers to determine if they have been adversely affected by any contaminants

Marilyn Ison and Gina Doyle, sisters who both live in Piketon, sat in lawn chairs nearby.

“We want heard. We want them to hear this in Washington,” said Ison, who held a sign asking ""Are we the next walking dead?""

Doyle cited a number of family members affected by cancer and said her sister has to have biopsies of several nodules in her thyroid. She said it is hard to believe that the cancer that has affected her family and others in the community is coincidental.

“It goes on and on. There are so many people, so many families in this county that have lost people to cancer and other horrible illnesses that everybody is tired of it,” Doyle sad. “Nobody wants to see anybody else die.""

"McGahn confirms he will skip House hearing, as DOJ asserts 'immunity' and Nadler fumes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-mcgahn-house-hearing,"President Trump has directed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to skip a House Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday, citing a Justice Department opinion that he cannot be compelled to testify about his official duties -- and, through his legal team, McGahn confirmed Monday evening that he won't appear.

The development prompted an obstinate response late Monday from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.: “We are having the hearing tomorrow and we’re expecting Mr. McGahn to show pursuant to the subpoena.""

Earlier this month, House Democrats opted to question an empty chair -- and a bucket of fried chicken -- when Attorney General Bill Barr failed to appear, citing Democrats' unusual demands.

In a letter to Nadler, McGahn attorney William Burck said his client won't show up. Burck said current White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had communicated that Trump had instructed McGahn not to testify, and that Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel had said McGahn was immune from testifying.

""Mr. McGahn understands from your prior correspondence that the Committee would vote to hold him in contempt should he not appear tomorrow and the House of Representatives may follow suit,"" Burck wrote to Nadler. ""While we disagree with the Committee’s position and hope it will instead seek an accommodation with the White House, Mr. McGahn also must honor his ethical and legal obligations as a former senior lawyer and senior advisor to the President. In short, it is our view that the Committee’s dispute is not with Mr. McGahn but with the White House.""

Burck added: ""Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and respect the President’s instruction. In the event an accommodation is agreed between the Committee and the White House, Mr. McGahn will of course comply with that accommodation.""

In a statement released Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders blasted Democrats for continuing to pursue Trump investigations, saying they want a ""wasteful and unnecessary do-over"" in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe -- and describing the subpoena for McGahn as part of that.

""The House Judiciary Committee has issued a subpoena to try and force Mr. McGahn to testify again. The Department of Justice has provided a legal opinion stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and Constitutional precedent, the former Counsel to the President cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly,"" Sanders said. ""This action has been taken in order to ensure that future Presidents can effectively execute the responsibilities of the Office of the Presidency.""

The related DOJ memo said McGahn, like other senior advisers to a president, has ""immunity"" from being compelled to testify about his official duties.

""This immunity applies to the former White House Counsel. Accordingly, Mr. McGahn is not legally required to appear and testify about matters related to his official duties as Counsel to the President,"" the memo said.

The New York Times first reported that the president would likely direct McGahn to skip the hearing.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN SUBPOENAS EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN

The committee announced the hearing last week, but it was unclear whether McGahn would appear due to the ongoing battle between congressional Democrats and the White House over his testimony.

Earlier this month, Sanders said she did not “anticipate” that a hearing would take place. “We consider this to be a case closed and we’re moving forward to do the work of the American people,” Sanders said on ABC News’ “The Investigation” podcast.

The committee, led by Nadler, subpoenaed McGahn on April 22, days after the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which featured McGahn prominently in its section related to the obstruction of justice inquiry. This included a claim that McGahn disobeyed Trump’s call to have him seek Mueller’s removal.

“On June 17, 2017, the president called [White House Counsel Don] McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre,” the report stated, referencing the Watergate scandal.

The report also revealed that when the media reported on the president’s request, the president directed White House officials “to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” He did not.

The House committee's subpoena, coming amid a fight over access to the unredacted Mueller report, called for McGahn to appear before the panel to testify and provide documents related to the Mueller investigation.

But earlier this month, Cipollone first notified the committee that McGahn would not be allowed to comply with the subpoena, saying requests for documents and materials must go to the White House.

“The White House provided these records to Mr. McGahn in connection with its cooperation with the Special Counsel’s investigation and with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes,” Cipollone wrote. “The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.”

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SCHEDULES HEARING FOR DON MCGAHN, DESPITE WHITE HOUSE MOVE TO BLOCK SUBPOENA

He added: “Because Mr. McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties, I would ask the Committee to direct any request for such records to the White House, the appropriate legal custodian.”

Cipollone wrote that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney “has directed Mr. McGahn not to produce these White House records,” adding that the Justice Department concurs with their legal position.

But Nadler has stressed the importance of McGahn’s testimony, saying it would “help shed further light on the president’s attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others to do the same.”

Trump, though, said he never told McGahn to fire Mueller, and tweeted last month that if he “wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.""

The battle over McGahn's testimony is just one front in the clash between the White House and congressional Democrats.

Earlier this month, the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Mueller's full and unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence and documents used in the investigation.

Trump, prior to the vote, asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from being turned over to the committee. The full House has yet to take a final vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

On Monday, he said the two companies need to build up adequate capital before they can be privatized, which means that the sweeps of extra profits from Fannie and Freddie into the U.S. Treasury would have to end. He gave no time horizon for when that would happen.

He said that common shareholders are part of the discussions. Existing shareholders could see their stakes shrink if the GSEs issue and sell new shares to build up the capital needed.

Trump to Tap Anti-Immigrant Crusader Ken Cuccinelli for Homeland Security Post,http://nymag.com,['Adam K. Raymond'],05-21-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/anti-immigrant-crusader-ken-cuccinelli-joining-trump-dhs.html,"Virginia’s former Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP/REX/Shutterstock

Donald Trump is tapping Ken Cuccinelli, the anti-immigrant crusader and former attorney general of Virginia, to lead immigration efforts at the Department of Homeland Security, multiple sources reported Tuesday. Though Cuccinelli had reportedly been in consideration for the role of White House immigration czar, that job remains unfilled.

Cuccinelli’s hiring at DHS comes a month after Trump declared his intention to take immigration policy in a “tougher direction.” So far, he’s dismissed former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen because she wouldn’t break the law for him, and withdrawn a nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement because the guy wasn’t brutal enough. Bringing Cuccinelli onboard is in line with these moves.

Prior to winning election as attorney general, Cuccinelli served in Virginia’s state Senate, where he sponsored bills to compel employees to speak English in the workplace and made an ill-fated attempt to repeal birthright citizenship, a change Trump would endorse years later. As Virginia’s AG, he boosted his immigration hard-liner bona fides by supporting Arizona’s SB 1070, known as the “papers please” law. He also briefly flirted with birtherism.

Unsurprisingly, Iowa’s Steve King is “one of his very favorite congressmen.”

In 2013, Cuccinelli made an unsuccessful bid for governor of Virginia. At the time, he was a frequent Fox News guest known as a far-right culture warrior willing to fight anything Democrats favored. Action against climate change? He waged a war against a top climate scientist at the University of Virginia and fought the Obama EPA. Equal rights for everyone? He wanted to ban sodomy. Access to a doctor for more people? He tried to kill Obamacare. Cuccinelli ended up losing the election to Terry McAuliffe by 56,435 votes.

The next time we heard from the “Cooch,” he had emerged as an early NeverTrumper. Cuccinelli aligned himself with Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican primary and attempted to protect “movement conservatism” from Trump. He lost that battle too.

Cuccinelli then joined CNN, where he ran into trouble for the way he treated women on air. In one notable incident, he told former Bernie Sanders spokesperson and current Joe Biden adviser Symone Sanders to “shut up.”

The only blemish on that record, from the standpoint of the Trump administration, would be Cuccinelli’s work for Ted Cruz in 2016. But like the Texas senator, Cuccinelli has seen the error of his ways and fallen in line. Just last month, he was on CNN railing against the “factless, baseless advancement of the collusion theory.” Now he’s going to work for Trump."
"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Utah Gov. Herbert to meet over roadless rule",https://www.deseretnews.com,"[""Amy Joi O'Donoghue"", 'Amy Joi Is The Environmental Reporter For The Deseret News.']",05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900071458/agriculture-secretary-sonny-perdue-utah-gov-herbert-to-meet-over-roadless-rule.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is coming to Utah this week and will meet with Gov. Gary Herbert to discuss multiple issues, including the state's desire for a roadless rule specific to Utah and the formalization of a stewardship agreement with the U.S. Forest Service.

Herbert and Perdue will spend most of the day together Wednesday, kicking things off with a meeting, talks over breakfast, a Tooele County tour of a watershed restoration project, lunch and a tour of Welfare Square operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

As head of the agriculture department, Perdue oversees the management of the nation's forests. In Utah, there are 8.1 million forested acres, of which more than 4 million are designated and managed as roadless.

The 2001 Roadless Rule, according to the U.S. Forest Service, establishes prohibitions on road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting on 58.5 million acres of inventoried forest lands across the country.

Utah is following the lead of Alaska, which in 2018 successfully received approval of its petition to the U.S. Forest Service for the agency to begin developing a specific roadless rule plan for the Tongass National Forest.

Any new rule or update requires an environmental review process, and the state's petition to change what is on the books has prompted outcry and objection from multiple organizations.

In a briefing to lawmakers last week, the head of the Utah Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office, Kathleen Clarke, said Utah's petition was submitted at the end of February and is awaiting action by the U.S. Forest Service.

Perdue's visit is a good sign, she added, in her presentation to the Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Interim Committee.

“I think it is a very solid petition,"" Clarke said. ""There is a lot of rumor out there. There are a lot of accusations of it taking over management, which it does not do,"" she said.

Utah's desire for the roadless rule alteration comes in the aftermath of a record-breaking wildfire season in 2018 that cost the state more than $42 million in funding to quell.

Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News The Dollar Ridge Fire continues to burn at Strawberry Reservoir on Friday, July 6, 2018.

In a video presented to the legislative committee, Clarke's office detailed the specific motivation for seeking a Utah specific rule, citing the need to update the 18-year-old management structure that fails to keep pace with modern challenges of drought, climate change and rampant insect infestation killing millions of trees.

""Utah is not scheming to put more roads in forests,"" the narrator said, adding it is only asking for an updated rule that encompasses Utah's conditions that may differ from the rest of the nation.

But there are plenty of critics who say Utah's move for a modification of the rule is unnecessary and suspect, prompting some to threaten lawsuits or lobby personally in Washington, D.C.

Trout Unlimited sent Andy Rasmussen, the organization's Utah coordinator of the Sportsmen's Conservation Project, and Heidi Lewis, chairwoman of the Women's Initiative Council, and others to the nation's capital on Friday to press its case on keeping the current roadless rule intact.

""Trout Unlimited feels like it should not change and that we can work things out with programs already in place,"" Lewis said. ""Ultimately if you put roads in, you can't remove them.""

Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Linda Adams looks at the damage after the Dollar Ridge Fire in Fruitland on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. The fire destroyed her home, shed and camper.

Lewis added that Utah's prized Blue Ribbon fisheries would be threatened via changes to the roadless rule management.

The group met personally with Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and staffers with other members of Utah's delegation.

""It was surprisingly positive,"" he said. ""They are definitely open to a path forward that does not include"" a revision of the rule, Rasmussen said, stressing that Utah's petition is especially concerning because it is so vague.

Rasmussen added the organization believes a better solution, and less costly one, would be an administrative agreement between Utah and the Forest Service, rather than wholesale makeover of the rule.

""I am with the governor on the goals as far as forest health and resiliency,"" he said, but added there should be an agreement that ""maintains the integrity of the roadless rule and still addresses (Utah) concerns.""

Lawmakers demand change after VA fumble left veterans without help,https://www.king5.com,"['Author', 'Taylor Mirfendereski', 'Published', 'Pm Pdt May', 'Updated', 'Am Pdt May']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.king5.com/article/news/lawmakers-demand-change-after-king-5-reveals-va-fumble-left-veterans-without-help/281-3033b13d-537e-4486-a5c1-deff292ad863,"SEATTLE — Several current and former members of Congress who championed a 2018 law that makes a vulnerable group of veterans eligible for mental health care at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are calling for change after a KING 5 story revealed the VA mishandled the program's roll out.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said Tuesday that she's concerned about the VA's failure to reach other-than-honorable veterans who qualify for mental health treatment under the law, which Congress passed in March 2018 to reduce suicides among the group of veterans who previously were largely ineligible for care.

""Obviously I am not happy with how the VA has implemented the law,"" said Murray, who co-sponsored the legislation. ""It is their responsibility. It is our responsibility for oversight, which we are following this very closely on.""

Nationwide, less than one percent of veterans with other-than-honorable discharges received mental health treatment at the VA last year, according to data provided by a VA spokeswoman.

Congress set a 180-day deadline for the VA to notify eligible veterans about the change, but it took the agency nearly a year after the law passed to make direct contact with veterans who qualified for care.

Murray said the 477,404 letters VA officials mailed to eligible veterans in January 2019 isn't sufficient, and the agency needs to do more to train personnel on the change.

""I'm happy they finally mailed the letters, but even that doesn't get to some of the most hard-to-reach veterans who do not have mailing addresses or an e-mail address or a phone who should be getting these services,"" she said. ""If a veteran him or herself calls the VA and the person who answers doesn't have a clue what they are talking about, (the law) isn't implemented correctly.""

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), who was the lead sponsor of the legislation in the Senate, wrote in a statement last week that the details KING 5 reported on May 14 are ""very concerning.""

""The VA needs to get its act together and provide the services veterans are entitled to under the law,"" Murphy wrote. ""I've been pushing the VA to do more to spread the word about the mental health services available to veterans, and I'll keep up this congressional oversight until more veterans are connected with the care they deserve.""

Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who sponsored the legislation in the House, blasted the VA on Twitter and Facebook last week in response to KING 5's reporting.

""New reporting shows the VA has done little to spread the word and ensure these veterans get this lifesaving care. It's unacceptable. We know what's wrong, we know how to fix it, and now we need the VA to act,"" O'Rourke wrote. ""It's unconscionable for even one veteran to be left behind. We're going to serve every veteran who served every single one of us.""

Angeline Riester, a spokeswoman for Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA), said the congresswoman plans to follow up with the VA and assess ""what else can be done to strengthen training and outreach.""

""The VA should be following the directive set by Congress; look no further than the number of veterans facing homeless and mental health crises across Washington as evidence,"" Riester wrote in an e-mail Tuesday. ""Expanding access to mental health resources has the potential to make a profound impact on these individuals and our communities, but it doesn't work if they aren't connected to the services.""

VA blog post follows KING 5 story

To date, local and national VA officials haven't responded to KING 5's repeated interview requests, and they have not answered specific questions, including whether the agency will make changes to reach more veterans who qualify for care.

On May 15 — the day after KING 5 reported the VA mishandled the roll out of the law and failed to do enough to reach veterans who qualify— the VA published a blog post on the agency's website titled ""Other-than-honorable discharge? You're still eligible for VA mental health care.""

The post announced that mental health care treatment is available to former service members with other-than-honorable discharges through ""two new programs."" It includes information about a 2017 VA policy change that increased access to mental health care for other-than-honorable veterans on a short term, emergency basis. It also includes information about who qualifies for care under the 2018 law, which expanded the 2017 policy.

""The blog post is a good Band-Aid to address the problem, but they are going to have to do a lot more,"" said Kristofer Goldsmith, associate director for policy and government affairs at the Vietnam Veterans of America. ""This is something that requires the attention of the (VA) secretary.""



Goldsmith isn't the only veterans advocate who's calling for more action from the VA than a blog post.

Rose Goldberg, a veterans legal expert who has represented veterans with less-than-honorable discharges for years, said the blog post misses the mark because the people who need care the most won't see it.

""It doesn't change the fact that homeless veterans and elderly veterans have limited access to the Internet, and they are not going to be reached by a blog,"" Goldberg said. ""Separately from that, the blog doesn't change the fact that VA health care staff isn't sufficiently trained on the program.""

Margaret Kuzma, who represents veterans with less-than-honorable discharges at the Connecticut Veterans Legal Center, also said she's not satisfied with the VA's response.

""Is a blog post or letter describing a change in policy enough to reach this population? If I were struggling with a mental health condition after deploying or being the victim of military sexual trauma, and the VA had rejected me because my service 'didn't count,' I imagine that I might be so frustrated I wouldn't open mail from the VA. I certainly wouldn't be reading its blog posts."" she said."
Assistant Attorney General Williams: Violent crime is declining -- DOJ is working to make America even safer,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Beth Williams', 'Beth A.

After two years of disturbing increases, the preliminary FBI statistics for the first six months of 2018 demonstrate a sustained reduction in violent crime. The numbers show a 6.7 percent decline in murders, a 12.5 percent decline in robbery, and a 12.7 percent decline in burglary compared to the first six months of 2017.

This is a win for the American people and especially for those communities most impacted by violent crime.

GERMANY REPORTS DROP IN CRIME, 96% OF HOMICIDE CASES CLEARED

Such decreases were not predestined. From 2014 to 2016, nationwide violent crime increased by nearly 7 percent -- with a troubling 21 percent increase in the murder rate. 2015 alone saw an 11 percent increase in murders, the largest annual increase since 1968.

Some of our large cities suffered the brunt of this violent crime spike with the murder rate rising in 22 of the 34 largest cities in 2016.

Following this significant increase in violent crime and murder, the Department of Justice under President Trump is committed to addressing the problem in a smart, systematic manner.

One of the government’s flagship programs is Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a nationwide strategy that brings together federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement -- and the communities they serve -- to address the most pressing violent crime issues and develop comprehensive solutions to address them.

Project Safe Neighborhoods is premised on three guiding principles. First, the best way to reduce violent crime is to target the most violent offenders. Research has shown that repeat violent offenders -- a small percentage of the overall criminal population -- are responsible for a grossly disproportionate number of violent crimes.

Second, local jurisdictions need to tailor enforcement to meet their specific needs. PSN is effective because it is not a Washington-centered, “one-size-fits-all” program. Every jurisdiction faces unique challenges, so federal authorities are working with local stakeholders to tailor methods and strategies to their respective communities. Using both pooled intelligence and the latest technology, law enforcement can target and interdict those who are the greatest threats to our communities.

Third, the approach must be comprehensive.

To have long-term, sustained reductions in the violent crime rate, we must dedicate resources to reach at-risk individuals and improve reentry outcomes for criminals who have completed their sentences.

The Department provides millions of dollars to support these programs nationwide. We are already seeing strong signs of progress.

To further decrease violent crime, the Department of Justice has focused on enforcing our gun laws.

Gun crime in America is driven by the illegal use and possession of firearms, including by felons and drug traffickers. In fact, according to a 2016 study of gun crimes in a major American city, 80 percent of firearms recovered by police were from people who were not the lawful owners. In fiscal year 2018, the Department of Justice prosecuted nearly 20 percent more firearms offenders than it did in 2017, and 30% more than it did in 2016.

But effective violent crime reduction is not simply about increasing prosecution rates -- it is about minimizing the number of crime victims by taking the most violent criminals off the streets.

To do so, our PSN partners have leveraged effective and innovative crime-fighting strategies, such as Crime Gun Intelligence Centers and focused deterrence models. Each U.S. Attorney is working with his or her local partners and stakeholders to identify the worst offenders and bring them to justice.

Preventing violent crime by enforcing the law is not a partisan issue; it is an issue for all Americans. Nobody takes that mission more seriously than the men and women of the Department of Justice and our partners in law enforcement. Through programs such as PSN, the Department of Justice under President Trump will continue vigorously to prosecute society’s most violent offenders, working to make every American neighborhood safer."
State Department condemns killing of American citizen in Nicaraguan prison,https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Bohn'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/politics/state-department-nicaragua-prison/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department condemned the killing of an American citizen being held in Nicaragua after a prison uprising, according to Nicaraguan and US officials.

However, they disagreed whether the killing of Eddy Antonio Montes Praslín was a justified homicide as the US ambassador and a lawyer representing Nicaraguan political prisoners maintain, or if it was justified because he was attacking guards as the Nicaraguans maintain.

Montes was killed during an incident at La Modelo prison on Thursday, according to Nicaraguan officials.

""We vehemently condemn the killing of Mr. Montes. His death, the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians at the hands of (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega's security and parapolice forces, and the continued detention of hundreds more political prisoners demonstrate the regime's utter disregard for human life and democratic freedoms,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""We call for an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of Montes's death. We reiterate our call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. The United States will hold accountable the Ortega regime and Nicaraguan security forces involved in human rights abuses and violations,"" she continued.

Democrats still worried: While congressional leaders from both parties and some individual lawmakers were previously briefed, Tuesday's all-members briefings provided the first opportunity for many on Capitol Hill to question the administration on intelligence and policy toward Iran.

And while the Trump administration's messaging Tuesday appeared designed to assuage concerns, Democrats emerged from the briefings continuing to voice concerns about President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump rips Dems' demands, impeachment talk: 'Witch Hunt continues!'

A refresher: Tuesday's briefing followed an outcry from lawmakers that the administration had not provided enough information to Congress on its decision to deployment military assets to the Persian Gulf and pull non-emergency personnel from diplomatic missions in Iraq in response to alleged Iranian threats.

The State Department then pulled non-emergency personnel from Iraq last week over the threats.

For his part, Trump spent days repeatedly pushing back on reports of disagreement among top aides over his administration's Iran strategy and said last week he hoped there would not be war with Tehran. On Monday evening, in a change in message, Trump said he had ""no indication"" Iran will act.

""With Iran, we'll see what happens. But they've been very hostile,"" Trump said. ""We have no indication that anything has happened or will happen. But if it does, it will be met, obviously, with great force. We'll have no choice.""

Shanahan says threat 'on hold': In addition to his comments at the Capitol, Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon ahead of the briefing Tuesday that any threat from Iran is ""on hold"" after the arrival of U.S. military assets to the region.

""That doesn't mean that the threats that we've previously identified have gone away,"" Shanahan continued. ""Our prudent response, I think, has given the Iranians time to recalculate.""

Iran not open to talks: Iran on Tuesday dismissed the idea of talks with the United States, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saying that ""today's situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only.""

Trump had said Monday that if Iran called, ""we would certainly negotiate,"" but added that ""if they're not ready, they don't have to bother.""

The mood on Capitol Hill: The Hill's Rebecca Kheel also took a look at the tensions around Iran ahead of the congressional briefings.

HOUSE APPROPS PASSES DEFENSE BILL THAT WOULD LIMIT FUNDS FOR BORDER WALL, PULL US SUPPORT FROM YEMEN: The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday passed its version of the fiscal year 2020 defense spending bill, voting along party lines for legislation that falls $8 billion below what the Trump administration requested, curtails the use of defense dollars to build a border wall and ends U.S. military support for the Saudi-led conflict in Yemen.

The panel voted 30 to 22 to move ahead the bill that funds the Defense Department at $690.2 billion in fiscal 2020, $15.8 billion above what was allocated the previous year but $8 billion below the White House's request.

Broken down, it includes $622.1 billion in base funding and $68.1 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) war fund.

""The Defense subcommittee has put forward a responsible spending bill that increases funds by $1 billion to address readiness requirements and ensure the well-being of our service members and their families,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey Nita Sue LoweyOvernight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds House Appropriations passes defense bill that would limit funds for border wall, pull US support from Yemen war Ending AIDS requires US investment MORE (D-N.Y.).

""This bill also would prohibit the use of funds for President Trump's wasteful border wall, reserving DOD resources to protect the United States from actual threats, rather than those imagined by our President. This reflects a commitment to our national security for which we can all be proud.""

The AUMF fight: The bill reflects House Democrats' desire to curtail Trump's recent moves in foreign policy and along the border, most notably through Rep.

The provision would sunset the AUMF – used as legal justification for military operations against terrorist groups 41 times in 18 countries since it was passed – eight months after the bill is enacted, giving Congress time to debate and vote on a new AUMF.

The AUMF debate comes as Trump has threatened Iran with military force.

But GOP lawmakers argued ending the current war authorization without a new one already approved could hamper military operations.

""I can think of few things more dangerous and ill-conceived than removing a fundamental underpinning for US military operations without having consensus agreement on what is to replace it,"" said the Defense subcommittee's ranking member, Rep.

The reprogramming issue: The legislation's passage also sets up a fight over the bill's language to restrict the Pentagon's reprogram authority – or the amount of money it is allowed to move from the purpose for which the funds were designated into another area – to $1.5 billion. The move was a response to Trump's use of reprogram authority to move defense dollars to the construction of his promised border wall.

""It is unfortunate that the historical and unprecedented comity that has existed between the Committee and the Department of Defense no longer exists, and as a result, the bill reduces the amount of money the Department can move between accounts,"" said House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense Chairman Pete Visclosky.

Other problematic areas: In addition, the bill is likely to rankle the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House over its $690.2 billion defense top-line, which GOP lawmakers said would exceed budget caps and force budget cuts under sequestration.

The administration had instead sought to inflate its OCO request to $164.3 billion to stay under the caps, but Democrats accused the White House of attempting to set up a slush fund.

The bill also only allocated $15 million for the Pentagon to research setting up Trump's desired Space Force, far below the $72 million the department requested to build a Space Force headquarters.

Democrats have not been pleased with the administration's sparsely detailed plans for a separate space branch, and Visclosky said the Pentagon's Space Force proposal was ""incredibly lacking in detail.""

TRUMP TAPS NEW AIR FORCE SECRETARY: President Trump on Tuesday announced plans to nominate Barbara Barrett as the next Air Force secretary.

The president shared his choice via Twitter, adding that he believes Barrett ""will be an outstanding Secretary!""

""I am pleased to announce my nomination of Barbara Barrett of Arizona, and former Chairman of the Aerospace Corporation, to be the next Secretary of the Air Force. She will be an outstanding Secretary! #FlyFightWin,"" he wrote.

Who is Barrett? Barrett is the former chairwoman of The Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research center for national security and military space systems.

She previously served in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, first as the deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and later as the U.S. ambassador to Finland.

If confirmed by the Senate, she will replace outgoing Secretary Heather Wilson, who will step down at the end of the month.

""Ambassador Barrett is a force to be reckoned with and who has the leadership, experience, and knowledge to lead our Air Force into the future during a time of increased global threats,"" McSally, a veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.

What about Wilson?: Wilson has served in the role since May 2017. An Air Force veteran and former Republican congresswoman from New Mexico, she announced in March that she would leave to become president of the University of Texas at El Paso.

Her departure followed reports that her relationship with President Trump had soured amid the debate over his desire to establish a standalone ""Space Force.""

Air Force Under Secretary Matt Donovan will take over as the service's acting secretary beginning June 1 while a full-time replacement is confirmed.

USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."
"DHS Eyeing Loose Coins From TSA Checkpoints to Pay for Border Operations, Says Report",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jamie Ross'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/immigration-dhs-wants-to-take-dollar200m-from-tsa-for-border-operations-says-report?source=cheats&via=rss,"The loose change you forget to take out of airport trays could soon be funding the Department of Homeland Security’s operations at the U.S. border with Mexico, NBC News reports. The DHS reportedly wants to take $232 million from the Transportation Security Administration in order to fund its work at the border, if Congress doesn’t agree to $1.1 billion of its funding request. The millions would reportedly include $50 million set aside by the TSA to buy advanced airport screening equipment and $64 million from a worker’s compensation fund set aside for injured employees. Bizarrely, it would also include $3 million of loose change left in trays at airports. Money for Transportation Security Officers, who run security screening lines in airports, is also “in play,” according to leaked internal docs, which could cause significant disruption over the summer if reallocated. The Daily Beast reported late Monday that Secret Service officers are being sent to the border, joining Air Marshal agents and National Park Service police."
Democrats grill Trump Interior chief for saying he hasn't 'lost sleep' over climate change,https://thehill.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/445016-dems-grills-interior-head-over-climate-change-comments,"Democrats grilled President Trump's new Interior secretary on Wednesday over his recent comments that he hasn't ""lost any sleep"" over aspects of climate change.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt appeared before a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, but faced more questions about his response to climate change and a slew of ethical concerns than about his budget.

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) centered his questions entirely on Bernhardt’s ""sleep"" comment, flanked by a staffer holding photos of climate-related disasters in Puerto Rico, California and Texas, listing off the number of people who died in the disasters and how much damage they caused.

""Do you lose sleep over it?"" Merkley asked after each example.

“I think it’s an issue that need to be addressed, but I don’t lose sleep over it,” Bernhardt responded.

“The policies you’re promoting are doing enormous damage to our planet,” Merkley said, calling the agency's policies “an immoral thing to do to the generations to come.”

Merkley told the secretary he should “maybe lose some sleep and maybe decide to be part of the solution” on climate change.

Bernhardt later said: “We completely respect that the climate is changing, and we need to study and address it,” and listed divisions of the department he said are making such efforts.

Some of Bernhardt's comments echoed his past assertion that the legislative branch needs to take a greater role in directing the department to respond to climate change.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, subcommittee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) agreed, saying it shouldn’t fall to one secretary to make such determinations, and criticized her colleagues for ""rhetorical"" questioning of the secretary.

“I think the secretary, in response to rhetorical questions, is just kind of pointing out the obvious that the authority rests with Congress,” she said.

But Democrats have criticized Bernhardt for not viewing climate change as part of his job, with Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) arguing that Bernhardt is ignoring the intent of legislation.

“Blaming Congress is a dodge,"" Udall said.

He also raised conflict of interest concerns related to Bernhardt's past as a lobbyist.

“We could spend this entire hearing probing your various conflicts of interest,"" Udall said. ""It’s clear you’re making decisions that benefit former clients instead of the American people.""

Senators on both sides of the aisle also pressed Bernhardt to limit offshore drilling and clarify the department’s position on the issue after pausing the development of its five-year offshore drilling plan.

In responding to a question from Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) Bernhardt said litigation was the driver behind halting the plan’s development.

“I’ve paused it until I figure out a pathway,” Bernhardt said, nodding to an Alaska case that would bar drilling in the Arctic.

“I’m glad you’ve paused it and hope you permanently pause it,” Van Hollen replied.

The Trump administration’s $30 billion budget request for the Interior Department would be a cut from last year’s budget, though Bernhardt noted it is larger than what the department requested last year.

Republicans praised aspects of the budget that would help deal with the maintenance backlog in national parks and funds included to protect the Everglades."
Justice Department offers to share additional Mueller documents to avoid House action against Barr,https://www.salon.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.salon.com/2019/05/22/justice-department-offers-to-share-additional-mueller-documents-to-avoid-house-action-against-barr/,"The Department of Justice agreed to turn over documents to the House Intelligence Committee relating to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, seemingly in a last-ditch effort to stave off an imminent ""enforcement action"" against Attorney General William Barr.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff released a statement early Wednesday announcing the Justice Department had accepted the panel's offer as a ""first step towards compliance with the subpoena.""

The move comes after the California Democrat said last week that he would hold a ""business meeting"" Wednesday to take an unspecified ""enforcement action"" against the Justice Department for not complying with his subpoena for counterintelligence information related to Mueller's report.

The Justice Department on Tuesday offered to give the committee access to a less redacted version of the first volume of Mueller's 448-page report — the section discussing alleged ties between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Moscow — and identify other documents related to the special counsel's investigation if House Democrats dropped its threat to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. The House Judiciary Committee has already voted to hold Barr in contempt for not complying with that panel's subpoena for an unredacted version of Mueller report.

Schiff said the Justice Department would begin turning over to the committee ""twelve categories of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence materials as part of an initial rolling production"" and noted that ""the initial production should be completed by the end of next week.""

The committee was expected to vote Wednesday on an enforcement action regarding Barr's subpoena, but Schiff said that meeting had been postponed as a result of the department's agreement. The subpoena, however, will remain in effect and will be enforced should the Justice Department fail to comply with the committee's full request, he added.

""The Department has repeatedly acknowledged the Committee's legitimate oversight interest in these materials,"" Schiff said. ""I look forward to — and expect — continued compliance by the Department so we can do our vital oversight work.""

The agreement between the Justice Department and the House Intelligence Committee represents a rare detente and comes amid escalating tensions between the White House and House Democrats over investigations on issues including foreign election interference, alleged mismanagement in the White House security clearance procedures, the president's finances and his immigration policies.

Since the Democrats seized control of the House of Representatives in January, current and former Trump administration officials have faced a barrage of subpoenas, demands to testify before a host of congressional panels and letters seeking a flurry of documents. But the White House has often ignored congressional requests for documents and witnesses, claiming that the demands are an unconstitutional infringement on the president's powers. Democrats, meanwhile, have accused the Trump administration of stonewalling or flat-out ignoring their requests for documents and information.

The executive branch's attempts to push back against congressional inquiries targeting the White House have led a growing number of Democrats to contemplate new ways to compel current and former West Wing aides to acquiesce to their demands, including heightening calls to open impeachment proceedings against the president. Some Democrats have even proposed personally fining or jailing administration officials who do not comply with their requests."
Devin Nunes 'likely' sending obstruction criminal referral over Steele-State Department meeting,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-likely-sending-obstruction-criminal-referral-over-steele-state-department-meeting,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said on Sunday that he may send another criminal referral to the Justice Department.

During an interview on Fox News, Nunes said notes about a meeting between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and a State Department official were withheld from the House Intelligence Committee during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election that wrapped up last year.

""It's likely now, as we do our investigation as to why we didn't get this information that we've just been discussing from the State Department two years ago when we should have received it, there could be another referral coming on obstruction a congressional investigation,"" he said.

Newly released notes from an Oct. 11, 2016, meeting between Steele and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec cast doubt on the reliability of his dossier and called into question the information provided to the court in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application that was submitted later that month against onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The notes, which Kavalec is believed to have emailed to the FBI in mid-October, indicate that Steele knew he had been hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee and had been told they wanted his findings made public prior to the 2016 election on Nov. 8.

The Daily Caller reported the notes show Steele identified Russian sources, including former Russian foreign intelligence director Vyacheslav Trubnikov and Vladislav Surkov, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Nunes said Clinton's campaign and the DNC ""plainly colluded"" with the Russians to receive and disseminate false information about Trump.

Last month, Nunes notified the Justice Department of ""several potential violations of the law"" in eight criminal referrals as part of an investigation into origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department citing concerns that Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers. Both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Steele and the opposition research firm who hired him, Fusion GPS.

The notes from the Steele-Kavalec meeting came out after special counsel Robert Mueller found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The House Intelligence Committee found no Trump-Russia collusion in its assessment.

Attorney General William Barr has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham from Connecticut with reviewing the origins of the federal Russia investigation."

Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."
US Treasury yields stable ahead of big week for Fed comments,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/20/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-higher-ahead-of-fed-speeches-auctions.html,"U.S. government debt yields rose Monday as U.S.-China relations remained chilled after Washington cracked down on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei and investors awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.

At around 3:19 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was higher at around 2.414%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also higher at around 2.834%.

Market participants are likely to closely monitor a flurry of speeches from policymakers at the U.S. central bank. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Vice Chair Richard Clarida are all set to comment on the world's largest economy at separate events on Monday.

The Fed earlier this month said that it would keep interest rates unchanged, though Powell added that officials saw a decline in inflation in the first quarter as simply ""transcient""

""We think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment and we don't see a strong case for moving in either direction,"" Powell said on May 1. ""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%.""

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added."
