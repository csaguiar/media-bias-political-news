"Trump administration is 'inept and insecure', says UK ambassador",https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48898231,"Image copyright AFP

The Trump administration has been labelled ""inept"", insecure and incompetent in leaked emails from the UK ambassador to Washington.

Sir Kim Darroch said that the White House was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and ""divided"" under Donald Trump.

But he also warned that the US president should not be written off.

The Foreign Office said the leak of the memos to the Mail on Sunday was ""mischievous"" but did not deny their accuracy.

The White House has not yet responded to the revelation of the contents of the memos, but it could test the so-called ""special relationship"" between the US and UK.

In the messages, Sir Kim said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept.""

He questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"".

Although Sir Kim said Trump was ""dazzled"" by his state visit to the UK in June, the ambassador warns that his administration will remain self-interested, adding: ""This is still the land of America First"".

Differences between the US and the UK on climate change, media freedoms and the death penalty might come to the fore as the countries seek to improve trading relations after Brexit, the memos said.

To get through to the president, ""you need to make your points simple, even blunt"", he said.

In a message sent last month, Sir Kim branded US policy on Iran as ""incoherent, chaotic"".

Mr Trump's publicly stated reason for calling off an airstrike against Tehran with 10 minutes to go - that it would cause 150 casualties - ""doesn't stand up"", Sir Kim said.

Instead, he suggested the president was ""never fully on board"" and did not want to reverse his campaign promise not to involve the US in foreign conflicts.

'Infighting and chaos'

Sir Kim said it was ""unlikely that US policy on Iran is going to become more coherent any time soon"" because ""this is a divided administration"".

The leaked files date from 2017 to the present day, covering the ambassador's early impressions that media reports of ""vicious infighting and chaos"" in the White House were ""mostly true"".

They also give an assessment of allegations about collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia, saying ""the worst cannot be ruled out"". The investigation by Robert Mueller has since found those claims were not proven.

A Foreign Office spokesman said the public expects diplomats to provide ministers with an ""honest, unvarnished assessment"" of politics in their country.

""Their views are not necessarily the views of ministers or indeed the government. But we pay them to be candid,"" he said.

He said ministers and civil servants would handle this advice ""in the right way"" and ambassadors should be able to offer it confidentially.

The UK embassy in Washington has ""strong relations"" with the White House and these would continue despite ""mischievous behaviour"" such as this leak, the spokesman said."

Aided by a strong economy and perceptions that he has dealt with it effectively, President Trump’s approval rating has risen to the highest point of his presidency, though a slight majority of Americans continue to say they disapprove of his performance in office, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.

The survey highlights the degree to which Trump has a narrow but real path to reelection. His approval rating on most issues is net negative, and more than 6 in 10 Americans say he has acted in ways that are unpresidential since he was sworn into office. Still, roughly one-fifth of those who say he is not presidential say they approve of the job he is doing, and he runs even against four possible Democratic nominees in hypothetical ­general-election matchups. He trails decisively only to former vice president Joe Biden.

[Read full Post-ABC poll results ]

Trump’s approval rating among voting-age Americans stands at 44 percent, edging up from 39 percent in April, with 53 percent saying they disapprove of him. Among registered voters, 47 percent say they approve of Trump while 50 percent disapprove. In April, 42 percent of registered voters said they approved while 54 percent said they disapproved.

More than a year before the general election and long before the Democrats will select their nominee, the 2020 contest is playing out against the backdrop of an electorate deeply divided over the president, with a small percentage of registered voters up for grabs. Both Democrats and the president enjoy solid bases of support, but more Americans say it is extremely important that Trump not win reelection than those who say it is extremely important that he is reelected.

The survey highlights significant differences between women and men in their candidate preference, a continuation of a trend that has been evident throughout Trump’s presidency. Those gender differences shaped the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats captured the House with strong support among women. In the new survey, men clearly favor Trump against four of five potential Democratic challengers (they are evenly divided over a Biden-Trump contest) while women back all five by strong margins.





The economy is the lone issue in the survey where Trump enjoys positive numbers, with 51 percent saying they approve of the way he has dealt with issues. A smaller 42 percent disapprove of his handling of it, down slightly from 46 percent last October. Asked how much credit Trump deserves for the state of the economy, 47 percent say a “great deal” or a “good amount,” while 48 percent say he deserves “only some” or “hardly any.”

When asked the same question in a January 2018 survey, a smaller 38 percent of Americans gave him credit for the economy while 56 percent said he deserved little or none. In that 2018 poll, 19 percent said he deserved a great deal of credit for the economy; today that number is 30 percent.

On the eight other issues measured, Trump gets negative ratings, ranging from a net negative of seven points on taxes to a net negative of 33 points on climate change. More than half of all Americans disapprove of his handling of immigration, health care, abortion, gun violence and “issues of special concern to women.”

The survey was conducted while Trump was attending a meeting of world leaders in Japan, where trade tensions with China were eased. He later met with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un — taking steps into that nation and coming to an agreement to restart nuclear negotiations. But by 55 percent to 40 percent, Americans disapprove of his handling of foreign policy.

The survey matched Trump against five possible Democratic nominees: Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

Among registered voters, only Biden emerges with a clear advantage, leading Trump by 53 percent to 43 percent. Trump runs very close against Harris (46 percent Trump, 48 percent Harris) and Sanders (48 percent Trump, 49 percent Sanders), and he runs even against Warren (both at 48 percent) and Buttigieg (both at 47 percent).





Among the broader pool of voting-age adults, all five Democrats hold at least a slight advantage over Trump.

Trump and Republicans are trying to attach the label of “socialist” to all the Democrats. Asked a generic question about a matchup between Trump and a candidate regarded as a socialist, the president holds a slight edge of 49 percent to 43 percent among registered voters.

Across the five matchups against named possible Democratic nominees, 41 percent of registered voters always choose the Democrat, and 40 percent always choose the president. Meanwhile, 54 percent of voters either support Trump against at least one named Democrat or say they would consider backing him.

Trump’s hardcore base includes 21 percent of registered voters who support him against any of the five possible Democratic challengers tested and who say it is “extremely important” that he be reelected. That rises to 31 percent when those who say it is “very important” that he win a second term are added to those solid Trump supporters.

Arrayed against Trump are 36 percent of registered voters who never support Trump in the matchups and say it is “extremely important” that the president not win a second term. That rises to 43 percent when those who say it is “very important” that Trump not be reelected are added to those consistent anti-Trump voters.

Biden’s lead over Trump is built in part on stronger support among independent voters and among self-identified moderates. He enjoys a seven-point edge among independents, while the other Democrats are even or trailing Trump with those voters. Among moderates, Biden has a 28-point advantage over the president, significantly more than any of the other Democrats tested.

Gender and education are clear fault lines in the electorate as voters think about 2020 choices. Trump receives between 38 percent and 42 percent support from women when matched against the five potential Democratic challengers. Even tested against a hypothetical candidate regarded as a socialist, he gets only 42 percent of support from women. Among men, Trump’s support ranges from 49 percent against Biden, to 54 percent against the other Democrats, and to 57 percent against a hypothetical socialist.

Trump wins majority support among white voters, but he does far better with those who do not have college degrees than those who do, a pattern that emerged strongly in the 2016 election and continues to define the political divisions today. Nonwhite voters favor all Democrats by a wide margin over Trump; 76 percent of all nonwhite voters say they would support Biden if the election were held today, as would 85 percent of African American voters.

There is also a strong urban-rural split, with potential Democratic challengers enjoying big margins among urban voters and Trump holding sizable margins among those who live in rural and small-town areas.

As what happened in 2016, the geographic battle in 2020 will center on the suburbs: In the head-to-head comparisons, Biden leads slightly among suburban voters. Trump is competitive with the other Democrats tested in suburban areas.

Overall, the top issues for Americans as the 2020 election nears are the economy, health care and immigration. Foreign policy, gun violence, taxes, issues of special concern to women and abortion follow behind. Climate change trails the others — but still over half say it’s at least “very important.”

Republicans and Democrats diverge on which issues they would list as one of the single most important in influencing their vote. For example, 31 percent of Democrats cite health care as one of the single most important issues, compared with 9 percent of Republicans. Climate change is another example, with 27 percent of Democrats and 6 percent of Republicans calling it one of the single most important issues for 2020. On the economy, there is more agreement about its significance.

In the area of health care, the cost of coverage and treatment ranks as a serious concern, with 71 percent of Americans saying they are worried about this, including 45 percent who say they are very worried.

A slight majority (52 percent) of Americans say they would favor a universal health-care system run by the government and funded by taxes over the current system. But when asked whether they would prefer such a system if it meant an end to private insurance, support falls to 43 percent.

As Congress prepares for testimony by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters, the survey shows a clear majority of Americans continue to oppose impeachment proceedings.

The new poll finds 59 percent of Americans saying the House should not begin such proceedings, including 46 percent who strongly oppose such a move. That is a slight increase since April. The percentage favoring impeachment proceedings, 37 percent, is the same as it was in April and 12 points lower than in August 2018.

A 61 percent majority of Democrats support impeaching Trump, including 49 percent who support doing so “strongly,” reflecting the cross pressures hitting both the presidential candidates and members of Congress.

This Washington Post-ABC News poll was conducted by telephone from June 28 through July 1 among a random national sample of 1,008 adults, with 65 percent reached on cellphones and 35 percent on landlines. Results from the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points; the error margin is four points among the sample of 875 registered voters.

Night before Trump’s inauguration was ‘very emotional’: Michelle Obama,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brie Stimson', 'Michelle Obama']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/night-before-trumps-inauguration-was-very-emotional-michelle-obama,"Michelle Obama in an interview Saturday evening said the night before President Trump’s inauguration in January 2017 was “very emotional.”

""The truth is, on that day I was moving my children out of the only house they had really grown up in,” the former first lady told Gayle King of CBS News at the Essence Festival in New Orleans. “I think that gets lost on people.”

She said she was rushing to get her daughters and their friends out of the White House after they’d had a sleepover the night before the inauguration.

“The girls didn't get up,” she explained. “They're all crying and they have their teddy bears and they're moving slow and I'm like, 'You've got to get up and get out of this house.' And I don't know where these kids are going, but they had to get up and out of that house. So you've got tears and I'm pushing people out a freight elevator and my kids are crying.”

She said she and former President Barack Obama then had to meet with the Trumps.

“I didn't want to go out and greet them with tears in my eyes because people would think I was crying for other reasons,” Mrs. Obama said, according to CBS News.

The former first lady said after eight years of watching her husband “get raked over the coals” and feeling like they had to be perfect, ""It was a lot emotionally that when I got on that plane, it was a release.""

She also spoke personally about marriage and motherhood, saying kids can “take up all the oxygen in the land.”

“That's why they make the babies cute because you would leave them at the post office,” she joked.

She told King the most important thing in a marriage is for spouses to be equals.

""My husband is my teammate and if we are going to win this game together, he has to be strong and he has to be OK with me being strong,” she said.

Mrs. Obama also waded into the 2020 election, telling King she and her husband are supportive of all the Democratic candidates and plan to support whoever wins the primary because the general election is “so important.”

She appeared to criticize Trump without using his name.

“The leader of the free world with a tweet can start a war, can crush an economy, can change the future of our children,” she said, adding the next president needs to have “deep seriousness and focus” and operate “with a clear base of facts and ideas.""

“The leader of the free world with a tweet can start a war, can crush an economy, can change the future of our children.” — Michelle Obama

She said she thinks her husband sometimes made the presidency look easy.

“I guess it's kind of like if the black guy can do it, anybody can do it -- and that's not true. It's a hard job.”

Obama said people forget how many punches they took to win the White House and that for a bit she was portrayed as “an angry black woman who was emasculating her husband.” Both Democrats and Republicans were afraid of “the strength of a black woman,” she said.

She added that she knew when she became the first lady she would have to “earn [her] grace.”

“I want all young girls out there to know - we all struggle with that, people of color, working-class folks, women of color - people try to define us in a negative way before we get a chance to get out there and tell our own stories,” she said.

Five of the presidential candidates - Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren – also spoke at the festival earlier in the day."

President Donald Trump saw it as an opportunity to showcase what he characterized as America’s strength. But for journalists working for Russia’s state-run media it was the perfect time for a little trolling. Specifically, talking heads on Russian news channel Rossiya 24 and the program 60 Minutes mocked the military equipment that was on display as laughably out of date and the parade itself as “low energy” and “weak,” according to journalist Julia Davis. The state-run media claimed the machinery was held together with “adhesive tape” and covered with “peeling paint,” according to the Washington Post. A co-host of the show said that the tanks on display were “used during World War II and withdrawn from service in 1957.”

Artem Krasulin, a journalist on Rossiya 24, noted that some of the weapons looked “battered” and they did not even look complete. “Asked by journalists why no new technology was brought to the center of Washington, the Pentagon answered…. the White House requested these exact machines,” Krasulin said, according to Time. Journalists on 60 Minutes also openly mocked Fox News commentators and how they were gushing over Trump and how he is “changing all of our lives.”

The co-host of 60 Minutes also made a comparison between Trump’s parade and the way Russia has been criticized for a similar display of force. “Americans are allowed to hold a parade because theirs is democratic, but we are not allowed because ours is chauvinistic” she said. She also sent out a tweet that included footage of military equipment arriving in Washington for the parade. “Tanks in the streets of Washington, Trump is preparing for the parade. Putin’s America,” she wrote accompanied by a laughing emoji.

This is hardly the first time Russia’s state-run media has mocked Trump. Last year, journalists on Russia 24 celebrated after Trump reportedly said Crimea should be seen as part of Russia because people there speak Russian. “Crimea is ours, Trump is ours!” the hosts said."
Census citizenship question: Justice Department tells court it is looking at options,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Gregory Wallace', 'Katelyn Polantz']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/05/politics/census-citizenship-question-deadline-donald-trump/index.html,"(CNN) Lawyers for the Department of Justice told a federal judge in Maryland Friday afternoon that the Trump administration will continue to explore options of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but made no mention of a potential executive order being considered by the White House.

Judge George Hazel nevertheless ordered the government to begin producing details about how the citizenship issue was handled in a lawsuit brought by immigrant rights groups who argue it is discriminatory.

An administration official stressed that as of now the census will be printed without the citizenship question, though discussions are continuing about how to challenge last week's Supreme Court ruling blocking the Census Bureau from adding it to the questionnaire.

Earlier Friday, President Donald Trump said he is considering his options, which include an executive order or a potential addendum to the questionnaire that would allow the question to be added at a later date. Such a move could require the administration to provide a new justification for the addition of the question, following a Supreme Court ruling requiring a new rationale.

Trump, who has been increasingly frustrated over the issue, has been encouraging his lawyers and aides to find a way to include the disputed citizenship question and did not on Friday rule out the possibility of signing an executive order.

""It's one of the ways -- we have four or five ways we can do it,"" Trump told reporters earlier Friday on the White House lawn. ""It's one of the ways that we're thinking about doing it very seriously.""

In its court filing, the Justice Department said the administration continues to ""reevaluate all available options.""

The filing goes almost directly against Hazel's previous order to Justice to provide an answer on its plans, and instead attempted to pause the court action while the Justice Department considers its options.

Hazel will not allow a pause in the case. He responded Friday that the groups suing the Commerce Department will be allowed to collect more evidence regarding whether the agency's reason to add a citizenship question was to discriminate against non-citizens.

""Regardless of the justification Defendants may now find for a 'new' decision, discovery related to the origins of the question will remain relevant,"" Hazel wrote Friday. ""Given that time is of the essence, therefore, the prudent course is to proceed with discovery.""

The immigrant-rights groups can start collecting evidence as early as Friday, Hazel said, and have until Aug. 19 to ask questions of the Commerce Department and Justice Department. They also may depose five Commerce and Justice Department witnesses, Hazel said, though it's not clear yet who those might be.

In a separate court case over the citizenship question, the possible deposition of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was a heated dispute that the Supreme Court ultimately stepped in to prevent last fall.

A parallel proceeding will continue in New York as well.

The Justice Department in its filing argued that schedule should be paused while lawyers search for a ""new rationale for reinstating a citizenship question"" -- a move made possible by the wording of the Supreme Court ruling, which left the door open for the administration to try again to add the controversial question.

Federal Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan is considering the Trump administration's recent statements about still trying to add a citizenship question to the census at the direction of the President, despite a Supreme Court ruling.

The American Civil Liberties Union has asked Furman to stop the Commerce Department from adding any citizenship-like questions to the 2020 Census or changing it in any way, and Furman said he would hear arguments on its request on July 23.

Civil rights groups argue it could scare off legal immigrants and others from responding, leading to undercounts.

""The Trump administration repeatedly argued the census forms could not be altered after June 30,"" Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said in a statement. ""They've now changed their tune because the Supreme Court ruled against them. They can't have it both ways. Trump's lawlessness will not go unanswered.""

The plaintiffs in the case argued in their filing on Friday that their case should go ahead on schedule, saying the government could not erase questions about discriminatory intent ""merely by pretending that the same or a similar decision is somehow 'new' or somehow cures the discriminatory intent that Plaintiffs have established as motivating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 census.""

Moves by the Justice Department to satisfy Trump would mean that the administration would face daunting legal challenges and a tenuous timeline as it prepares for the decennial population survey, which is used to set electoral boundaries as well as to determine how government funding is distributed for an array of programs.

A legal adviser who has been involved with the discussions over the last several days with Trump administration officials on the citizenship question said that while the administration is considering its options, lawyers are drafting potential language for an executive order. The source stressed that other options are on the table, but that some outside advisers believe that an executive order could pass legal muster.

Earlier this week an administration official called that option unrealistic, but others are pushing for that option.

""I believe the Supreme Court will affirm the constitutional right of the President and commerce secretary to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census, in a 5-4 opinion authored by the chief justice of the United States,"" said J. Michael Luttig a former judge who has close ties to top players in the administration.

But critics say courts would be unlikely to agree. They contend that while the Census Act vests power in the commerce secretary to administer the census, the President has no constitutional authority to modify it.

The White House said late Thursday that the President was ""looking at every option.""

Trump threw the situation into disorder earlier this week when he tweeted he wouldn't give up the battle even after his Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the census forms would be printed without the question -- a move the President signed off on earlier in the week. The internal dispute has led the President to privately air frustrations at his 81-year-old commerce secretary.

Trump has been frustrated at Ross's handling of the census issue, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, believing he folded too easily after the Supreme Court ruled on the matter this week.

His frustrations with his commerce secretary started before the high court decision, believing the issue has been mishandled from the start. But in recent days he's told allies that Ross let him down.

At this point it does not appear that Ross will be dismissed, the two people said. But in speaking with advisers, Trump has bemoaned the Commerce Department and the Justice Department for ""giving up,"" according to the people.

He has said that all of his options weren't explored before the announcement earlier this week that the printing would go forward.

The legal adviser who has been involved with the discussions says that when the Department of Justice went forward earlier in the week to say that a citizenship question would not be added to the census, the department got ""ahead of itself."" The source acknowledges that the White House was informed in some form of what DOJ lawyers would argue, but said that there was not ""adequate communication.""

The President remains in contact with outside advisers and is frustrated that the DOJ seemed to be throwing in the towel and has complained that Chief Justice John Roberts should be responsible for the failure to get the question on the census, not the President, according to the source. A continued legal effort, the source contended, might ""force"" Roberts to make a decision.

Trump has aired frustrations at Ross previously. Early in the administration, Trump kept berating him for his handling of China trade talks. He also complained that he fell asleep in meetings. But he's remained on good personal terms with his longtime friend

Trump has said publicly that asking census-takers their citizenship status should be a no-brainer. But opponents say it could deter minorities and immigrants, even those in the United States legally, from taking the survey. That, in turn, could skew electoral maps in favor of Republicans and reduce government assistance programs for some communities.

At left, Attorney General William Barr, and, at right Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Trump is facing ""limited options,"" according to a person familiar with the matter, that include a potential executive order or adding the question as a supplement with the upcoming census forms, which are already being printed.

Trump tweeted early Thursday that officials were working on the Independence Day holiday to resolve the issue.

""Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July!"" the President wrote, before departing the White House for his Virginia golf club.

Trump's seemingly out-of-the-blue tweet on Wednesday reversing the administration's stance came as a surprise to the government lawyers tasked with arguing the case.

There was initially consensus among the White House and other top administration officials over the position the Justice Department would take -- that it would go ahead with preparing the census without a line asking ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?""

But Trump changed his mind after a hearing Tuesday, according to a source familiar with discussions. Top Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Bill Barr, became aware of the pivot before Trump tweeted about it, but lower level attorneys at the Justice Department, including the lawyers who were due in front of a federal judge in Maryland on Wednesday, were not aware of the shift.

The legal adviser who has been involved with the discussions with the Trump administration officials told CNN the President is committed to showing leadership on the issue, adding, ""The President has made clear he wants to fight.""

DOJ inspector general reaches 'breakthrough' with key witness in FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-reaches-breakthrough-with-key-witness-in-fisa-abuse-investigation,"At least one key witness in the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into potential abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act came forward as the inquiry was winding down.

The individual, who is not part of the Justice Department or FBI, only did so after Attorney General William Barr tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham of Connecticut to lead a review of the origins of the Russia investigation, according to Fox News. It is unclear whether this ""breakthrough"" was actually due to Barr's appointment.

The report did not identify the witness, but it follows reporting that British ex-spy Christopher Steele agreed a month ago to meet with inspector general Michael Horowitz's team. Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia and was funded by Democrats, was used by the FBI obtain a series of FISA warrants to wiretap one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Sources said fresh developments led to Horowitz to reinterview some witnesses.

Earlier this week, House Judiciary Committee member John Ratcliffe of Texas said he met with Horowitz and learned that the FISA abuse investigation had been wrapped up after the inspector general appeared to miss Barr's prediction for a late May or early June completion. He said Horowitz's team is ""in the process of drafting that report"" but cautioned that their findings may not be released for at least a month. A representative for Horowitz declined to comment on the status of the inspector general investigation to Fox News.

The DOJ's review of the early stages of the Russia investigation is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity, he can take prosecutorial action."

In May, authorities apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 border crossers, representing a stunning increase over the past several months. Current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that he anticipates the numbers decreased in June, amid new efforts to crack down both at the U.S.-Mexico border and Mexico's border with Central America.

Johnson’s warning that any gains could be reversed comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have lurched to the left on immigration, calling for health care for illegal immigrants and scrapping certain immigration enforcement measures.

At a Thursday night primary debate in Miami, candidates making up about half the field were asked if they support making crossing the border a civil, rather than a criminal, offense. Almost all the candidates, including former Obama Vice President Joe Biden, raised their hands.

The moment demonstrated how a once-fringe policy, pushed earlier this year by former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, has become mainstream among Democrats. Just days before the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came out in favor of such a proposal.

OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION CHIEFS SPEAK OUT ON 'CRISIS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER

However, Castro on Thursday denied he supported open borders.

“Open borders is just a right-wing talking point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what Democrats do on immigration.”

Since then Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. announced on Tuesday a plan to “virtually eliminate immigration detention.”

“Without waiting for Congress to act, Cory will stop the treatment of immigrants as criminals, close inhumane DHS facilities, end the use of for-profit detention facilities and end unnecessary barriers for refugees and those seeking asylum to virtually eliminate immigrant detention,” a press release said.

Johnson, meanwhile, has also pushed back on the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's use of detention centers for migrants. On Friday, he said that chain link fences or ""cages"" weren't ideal, but were one of the ways authorities are forced to cope with the surge of migrants crossing the border, and that the alternative was putting them ""on the streets.""

""Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages -- whatever you want to call them -- were not invented on January 2017,"" Johnson said.

Michael Morell: A DOJ-led review of CIA intelligence will weaken the intelligence community,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael Morell', 'Contributing Columnist Covering Intelligence', 'National Security.', 'Contributing Columnist', 'July At Pm', 'A Post Contributing Columnist', 'Was Deputy Director Of Cia To', 'Twice Its Acting Director During That Period.']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-and-barr-are-crossing-another-line/2019/07/05/3c90944a-9d08-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html,"Contributing columnist

Michael Morell was the deputy director of the CIA from 2010 to 2013 and twice its acting director. He is a contributing columnist for The Post.

From his very first day in office, President Trump has had a strange and, at times, strained relationship with the U.S. intelligence community. The president and his political aides have often challenged the honesty and integrity of the community, damaging morale, undercutting its mission and making the already difficult challenge of uncovering threats to our nation even harder.

But, by putting the CIA’s analytic judgment (that one of Russia’s objectives in interfering in the 2016 election was to help then-candidate Trump) into the crosshairs of the Justice Department, as reported by several news organizations , the president and Attorney General William P. Barr are crossing another line.

I see no problem with a Justice Department review of whether the CIA and other intelligence agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities as to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons — U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals. There are strict rules in this regard — the most important promulgated by multiple attorneys general over time — and, in our divisive political environment, it would be beneficial to our democracy for the country to know whether the rules were followed or not.

Nor am I arguing that CIA analytic judgments should be beyond review, but that has already happened in this case. Both the Senate and the House intelligence committees have done reviews of the analysis, with the bipartisan Senate committee calling the overall analysis a “sound intelligence product.” The partisan House committee split on the question of the specific judgment about Russian President Vladi­mir Putin’s intent to help Trump.

What I am arguing is that the Justice Department has no standing to review the CIA’s analytic judgment. The whole idea is inappropriate and dangerous. It is certainly unprecedented, and there are good reasons it has never been done before.

I have great respect for John H. Durham , the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut tapped by Barr to do the review. But, while Durham is familiar with the CIA from previous investigations, he and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis itself. He and his team could well impose a hard-to-meet law enforcement standard on the analysts’ conclusions. That would create a burden of proof that might be right in a court of law but would be risky and unwise in the assessment of intelligence for real-time decision-making.

A similarly dangerous consequence of a Justice Department review of analysis is the chilling effect it may have on analysts and analysis. Out of prudence, any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham’s investigators will want to have a personal lawyer nearby — likely a first for many, if not all, of the analysts. This will all be watched closely inside the intelligence community: The prospect that Justice Department prosecutors could ask questions about how an analyst came to a specific conclusion — along with the thought that there may be legal consequences for having done so — could lead analysts to withhold their judgments or even decide that this profession is not for them. We lose as a nation with either outcome.

If the shoe were on the other foot — if a senior intelligence community official were asked to review decisions made by the FBI and career prosecutors — how do we think the attorney general, or career prosecutors, would react? With loud protests, no doubt.

There seems to be an erroneous belief among some that if the analysts had not come to the conclusion that Putin was trying to help Trump, there would not have been an FBI counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. This belief is misplaced; there was likely never a link between a judgment by the intelligence community analysts and a decision by the FBI on whether to open a counterintelligence case. The two were most likely completely separate. And, further, it seems that the analytic judgment about Russian intent came after the opening of the counterintelligence investigation. If so, it could not have been a predicate for the investigation.

A Justice-led review of the quality of intelligence analysis represents yet another weakening of the intelligence community as an institution. The country could be paying for these kinds of decisions for years to come."

"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."
Acting DHS chief launches probe into 'disturbing & inexcusable' Border Patrol social media posts,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-launches-probe-into-disturbing-inexcusable-border-patrol-social-media-posts,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that he has launched an “immediate investigation” into what he called “disturbing & inexcusable” social media posts from Border Patrol agents that purportedly included graphic and vulgar jokes about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

“Reporting this week highlighted disturbing & inexcusable social media activity that allegedly includes active Border Patrol personnel,” McAleenan said in a statement on Twitter. “These statements are completely unacceptable, especially if made by those sworn to uphold the @DHSgov mission, our values & standards of conduct.”

OCASIO-CORTEZ ACCUSES BORDER OFFICERS OF 'VIOLENT CULTURE' AFTER REPORT ON GRAPHIC FACEBOOK POSTS

“I have directed an immediate investigation, and as the @USBPChief has made clear, any employee found to have compromised the public’s trust in our law enforcement mission will be held accountable. They do not represent the men and women of the Border Patrol or @DHSgov.”

The website ProPublica posted a story Monday headlined “Inside the Secret Border Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke About Migrant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes.” In addition to showing indifference toward the deaths of migrants, members made vulgar jokes about Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ahead of their visit a Border Patrol facility in Texas on Monday, the story said.

In one post reported by ProPublica, a group member referenced the visits by Democrats and encouraged an officer to throw a “burrito at these b-----s.” Other posts included a vile, fake photo illustration of Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with President Trump.

Ocasio-Cortez blasted what she described as a “violent culture” within Border Patrol.

“They’re threatening violence on members of Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “How do you think they’re treating caged children+families?”

Matthew Klein, the assistant commissioner of the CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, said the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general opened its own investigation on Monday.

""Today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was made aware of disturbing social media activity hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees,"" Klein said. ""CBP immediately informed DHS Office of the Inspector General and initiated an investigation.""

"Lots of DoD Small Launchers, But What Will They Launch?",https://breakingdefense.com,"['Theresa Hitchens', 'Arie Egozi', 'Sydney J. Freedberg Jr.', 'Breaking Defense', 'Leonardo Drs']",,,,https://breakingdefense.com/2019/07/lots-of-dod-small-launchers-but-what-will-they-launch/,"WASHINGTON: Small satellite launcher projects are all the rage at DoD, but there aren’t many actual small satellites for them to launch. While there are numerous experimental satellites being designed and flown, there is no officially funded program aimed at designing, building and using smallsats for DoD missions.

“I think there’s been a long chicken and egg problem between small launch and small satellites” says Steve Nixon, president of the aptly-named SmallSat Alliance. “The traditional way is to attack them at the same time: do a little bit of both consecutively. We would like to see the national security side move out more aggressively, because there is lot of agreement about the value of small satellites.”

Indeed, part of the mission of the SmallSat Alliance, formed last year, is to help DoD figure out how it can “go beyond just experiments and begin to use small satellites for true operations.”

A DoD official admitted this week that right now it would be impossible to name a “program of record” for small satellites within the military services.

Part of the problem is that Air Force leadership has sent mixed signals on the level of interest in small satellites. The Air Force accounts for about 90 percent of DoD space spending.

Former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson waxed decidedly noncommittal in a speech at the annual Space Symposium in April. Wilson said that an internal Pentagon study on future space architectures found that “exquisite satellites” (that is, large, expensive, and highly capable) are still a key DoD focus. (That study has not been released publicly.)

Air Force Space Command Vice Commander Lt. Gen. David Thompson, however, told a New America conference here in May that the Air Force will “definitely be using” large constellations of small satellites.

“The external and internal communication regarding [DoD] smallsat strategy is not consistent and not clear,” Carissa Christensen, CEO of Bryce Space and Technologies, said somewhat wryly in a Tuesday interview.

Experiments Everywhere

At the same time, practically every space-related body within DoD seems to be experimenting with small satellites based in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) — or in Pentagonese, “proliferated LEO.”

One of the flagship programs underway is the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) Blackjack program, designed to test small satellite constellations based on a Lego-like model of standardized bus designs with switchable payloads. While the Air Force has been planning to transition technology proven successful from Blackjack — called CASINO for Commercially Augmented Space Inter Networked Operations — to its own LEO-based constellation of smallsats, funding for that is uncertain.

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright Patterson AFB long has developed smallsat-based experiments, such as the Demonstration and Science Experiments (DSX) spacecraft studying the affects of the Van Allen radiation belts on spacecraft components. The DSX was launched last week on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, along with 24 other small satellites under Air Force Space and Missile System Center’s (SMC) Space Test Program-2 mission.

The DoD Space Test Program (STP) has been around for decades, working to orbit Army, Navy and Air Force space experiments that are chosen by the DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB), chaired by the head of Air Force acquisition, Will Roper. SMC manages the STP program.

The Army, which has long been interested in the promise of small satellites for its tactical needs, has its own programs as well. The most recent effort is the Gunsmoke-L program started last year with a two-year (plus an option for a third), $8.3 million contract with Dynetics, based in Huntsville, Ala., to develop, test, integrate and demonstrate two “tactical space support vehicles.” The Army has built a series of the classified Gunsmoke satellites, dating back to at least 2017.

Further, my colleague Vivienne Machi last week broke the news that the Army is developing its first “tactical space layer” strategy that could include satellites in LEO for communications; position, navigation, and timing (PNT) and battle management command and control (BMC2) missions.

The Navy, in November 2018, launched its ICE-Cap (Integrated Communications Extension Capability) nansosatellite to demonstrate the ability of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to expand the coverage of its Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) narrow-band communications satellite network to the polar regions.

But none of these test projects are slated to transition to formal programs, with formal budgets, and formal military missions.

Proliferating Launch Initiatives

Meanwhile, there is enormous industry buzz in the small launch vehicle market, including about the potential for DoD contracts.

Christensen said one of the reasons small launch vehicle vendors around the world are increasingly looking at governments as potential customers is that the commercial market is simply not going to be able to support all of them. Based on market history and future trends, she explained, not all the thousands of smallsats being proposed (or even already licensed) will actually be deployed; even some of the companies that manage to orbit some smallsats will fail; and once a company actually manages to become economically viable, the size of its satellites is likely to grow.

But rather than being concerned about the disconnect between DoD’s eagerness to on-ramp commercial launch capability and the lack of real DoD smallsat programs, Christensen believes DoD is doing the right thing by moving out to try to harness the capability for responsive launch. (Responsive launch, the ability to launch practically on demand, has been a Holy Grail for the Pentagon for more than a decade. See Operationally Responsive Space.)

“I really feel like this slight disconnect of market dynamics is creating a really good opportunity to take advantage of emergent systems and determine if they have applicability to future military of IC [Intelligence Community] needs, for much cheaper than starting from scratch and building internal DoD programs.”

There are at least three significant DoD programs seeking to validate smaller launchers for future military use.

STP is partnering with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) on the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI). RALI is designed to leverage DIU’s expertise in open sourcing by rapidly awarding DoD launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies.

Last week, the truly non-traditional startup SpinLaunch announced it has become the latest winner of a DIU contract under that initiative. The contract (for an unspecified amount) is to prototype SpinLaunch’s ground-based, kinetic energy launch system that functions as a kind of centrifugal force catapult to heave a small rocket carrying a satellite out of the atmosphere.

A SpinLaunch fact sheet explains that the launch system uses “existing technology and components from oil/gas/mining and wind turbine industries to construct an innovative mass acceleration system, which achieves very high launch speeds without the need for enormous power generation or massive infrastructure. After ascending above the atmosphere, a relatively small, low-cost onboard rocket will be used to “provide the final required velocity for orbital insertion.”

The RALI program’s first launch was in May, when New Zealand startup Rocket Lab successfully lofted three small experimental satellites into LEO. It included the Army’s Harbinger, a commercial small satellite built by York Space Systems in Denver, to “demonstrate the ability of an experimental commercial system to meet DoD space capability requirements.”

DARPA’s Launch Challenge in April awarded $400,000 to each of three companies chosen to demonstrate “flexible and responsive” launch of small payloads. Tucson-based Vector Launch, Virgin Orbit, and a “stealth” startup now are competing for prizes up to $10 million for proving they can successfully launch twice in a row — from any launch facility chosen by DARPA — within a short timeframe. As a next step, the competitors early next year will be asked to launch a payload to LEO within two weeks from one of eight predetermined sites — after receiving notice of the launch site only a few weeks prior, and exact details on the payload and intended orbit just days before. One of the goals is to demonstrate that DoD can contract backup launches if one of its few fixed launch facilities is put out of commission by either an accident or an attack.

Todd Master, the program manager for the DARPA Launch Challenge, told me that DARPA is busy with preparatory work in the run up to the actual launch-off planned for early next year. This includes, he says, working with the Federal Aviation Authority to ensure that the commercial licensing process is smooth, given the “challenges” the project presents to the FAA’s normal launch licensing process. “They’ve been a great partner,” he said, adding that DARPA sees the Launch Challenge as “hopefully laying the ground work for streamlined licensing processes that could work in the future” to help DoD acquire commercial space launch capabilities.

And yet another new Air Force small launch effort, called the Rapid Space Launch Initiative (RSLI), was kicked off in late May by SMC’s Rocket Systems Launch Program based at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. The RSLI request for proposals says that the Air Force is “investigating the possible procurement of a capability to rapidly launch and deploy space payloads critical to national security in an ultra-responsive manner. The objective is 24 hours from “call up” notification to on-orbit capability.”

That project seeks to demonstrate rapid space launch capabilities to LEO “on a small scale,” with “the intended payload” an “Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) class space vehicle or smaller with a mass up to 220kg.” The RFI, however, notes that “demonstrated solutions that can scale to orbits and payloads of national security value are also of great interest. The program intends to hold an industry day in El Segundo, Calif., July 29-30."
Trump administration reverses course on census citizenship question,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Gregory Wallace', 'Jeremy Diamond']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/census-question-trump-tweet/index.html,"(CNN) In a major reversal following a presidential tweet, Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge in Maryland on Wednesday that they have been told to try to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census in a way that's consistent with a Supreme Court ruling.

The change comes after President Donald Trump tweeted earlier on Wednesday that ""we are absolutely moving forward, as we must"" on the citizenship question, despite statements Tuesday from both his Department of Justice and his secretary of commerce that the administration was printing the census without the question.

""We at the Department of Justice have been instructed to examine whether there is a path forward consistent with the Supreme Court's decision that would allow us to include the citizenship question on the census,"" Jody Hunt, the assistant attorney general for the Civil Division, told the judge Wednesday afternoon.

Government attorneys painted a picture of disarray within the administration, even as the Census Bureau moves ahead with printing the survey without the controversial question asking, ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?""

The Supreme Court blocked, for now, the question from being on the census in a decision last week, which hinged on Chief Justice John Roberts concluding there was sufficient reason for concern about why the administration wanted to ask the question. Roberts had not ruled out that the Department of Commerce could come back with a new rationale.

Hunt told Judge George Hazel in a teleconference that if the administration finds a viable path to include the question on the decennial survey, it plans to return to the Supreme Court for ""instructions ... to simplify and expedite the remaining litigation and provide clarity to the process going forward.""

The judge requested more information from the Justice Department by 2 p.m Friday.

In a separate case in New York on Wednesday, the Justice Department attorney told a federal judge that while the department had told counsel on Tuesday that the questionnaire would not include a question about respondents' citizenship status, it has shifted its position.

""The Departments of Justice and Commerce have now been asked to reevaluate all available options following the Supreme Court's decision and whether the Supreme Court's decision would allow for a new decision to include the citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census,"" Hunt said.

Hazel told attorneys that he has a Twitter account and follows Trump. He said the tweet Wednesday morning ""directly contradicted the position"" the Justice Department articulated on Tuesday.

Sudden shift

In the Wednesday hearing, another Justice Department attorney told the judge that the administration has instructed printing to move forward without the citizenship question, but also acknowledged the situation is fluid.

The attorney, Joshua Gardner, acknowledged he was now backing away from his statements made only a day earlier, when he suggested that a final decision had been made.

Gardner said that he had ""confirmed that the Census Bureau is continuing with the process of printing the questionnaire without a citizenship question, and that process has not stopped,"" but he said the President's tweet Wednesday morning could change the government's ultimate position.

""The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the President's position on this issue, just like the plaintiffs and your honor,"" Gardener told the judge.

""I do not have a deeper understanding of what that means at this juncture other than what the President has tweeted,"" he said, adding, ""I am doing my absolute best to figure out what is going on.""

The plaintiffs challenging the question in the Maryland court were highly critical of the government's change in position.

""This administration's flagrant disregard of court orders is appalling, and will result in the same kind of misinformation that leads our communities to be reluctant to participate in the Census, at a time when the Census Bureau should be actively encouraging everyone's full participation,"" said Denise Hulett, the lead counsel in the case for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

When the government asked for an extension until Monday, the judge refused and questioned whether the Justice Department was speaking for the President.

""If you were Facebook and an attorney for Facebook told me one thing, and then I read a press release from Mark Zuckerberg telling me something else, I would be demanding that Mark Zuckerberg appear in court with you the next time because I would be saying I don't think you speak for your client anymore,""Hazel said.

After the lashing, Gardner told the judge he'd been with the Justice Department for 16 years ""through multiple administrations"" and that he had ""always endeavored to be as candid as possible with the court.""

Tweet sends administration scrambling

The news comes after Trump's tweet sent administration officials scrambling.

A White House official said earlier Wednesday afternoon that there were ongoing discussions at the White House about finding a path forward for the government to continue to press its case on getting the citizenship question on the census, even though printing is now underway without the question.

This official suggested the printing process and Trump's vow to keep fighting this issue are not necessarily mutually exclusive -- or at least that administration lawyers are trying to figure out how to square the two.

The discussions and confusion at the White House came a day after a Justice Department Attorney, Kate Bailey, notified plaintiffs challenging the question via email that she could ""confirm that the decision has been made to print the 2020 Decennial Census questionnaire without a citizenship question, and that the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process.""

The Department of Justice later confirmed the question would not be on the census. And Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross issued a statement saying, ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question"" even though he said he disagreed with the Supreme Court ruling.

In addition, during a hearing Tuesday evening, a federal judge asked the department whether the decision was ""final"" and the Department of Justice said that it was, according to plaintiff's lawyers participating in the call.

On Tuesday night, another lawyer involved in a separate case, expressed some skepticism that the administration's position could change.

""We're happy about the development but want to make sure it is thorough and complete,"" said Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He told CNN on Tuesday he was concerned that the administration might find other ways to undermine the count.

A fluid situation

The government had initially said that Monday was the deadline to begin printing forms. As late as Monday afternoon, however, the administration asked Hazel for more time to decide how it would proceed following the Supreme Court decision. The outcome was uncertain until Tuesday because the Supreme Court ruling last week that blocked the question from appearing for the time being had left the door open for the administration to present a new rationale.

On the one hand, it is true that the government was facing a daunting timeline. A Census official had testified at trial that extending the deadline to October under the current budget would ""impair the Census Bureau's ability to timely administer the 2020 census"" and that it would only be feasible with ""exceptional resources.""

On top of that, there were collateral legal actions set to occur over the summer in two lower courts that were sure to drag out. US District Court Judge Jesse M. Furman of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York was considering a sanctions motion against the government after a trove of documents surfaced from the files of a deceased redistricting expert raising the question of whether the decision was politically motivated. And Hazel, based on those same files, was set to order deposition and new discovery aimed at learning more about the government's rationale for adding the question.

Still, the decision came as a surprise.

Another thing that could have been in play was the testimony of Census Bureau officials that there were other ways to get citizenship data. In a memorandum, Census Bureau official John Abowd recommended that Commerce use existing administrative records — from the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service — instead of adding the question. Ross ultimately chose to do both: Ask the question and compile the administrative records. In May, Abowd said the bureau was operating with the understanding that the administrative records needed to be assembled regardless of whether the courts allowed the question to be included.

In addition, there is another survey that is sent to one out of 36 households that asks the question.

Interim executive director delivers her 12-month plan to the Columbia Housing Authority,https://www.wltx.com,"['Author', 'Loren Thomas', 'Published', 'Pm Edt July', 'Updated']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.wltx.com/article/news/interim-executive-director-delivers-her-12-month-plan-to-the-columbia-housing-authority/101-656b0a6b-c2c3-4343-a16e-2585fcbc7ef9,"COLUMBIA, S.C. — The new interim executive director of the Columbia Housing Authority (CHA) met with the board of commissioners in a special-called meeting on Friday, all to outline her plan for the CHA.

Ivory Mathews, who is coming off of her role as executive director of the Greenville Housing Authority, says they should be focused on the residents first.

""Some of the immediate changes that they will begin to see is just our ability to respond to them as they might have concerns and to know that their questions or needs aren't just going on deaf ears,"" says Mathews.

She outlined her 12-month plan to commissioners, starting with a top to bottom approach of reviewing and updating bylaws, providing training to the board of commissioners, and improving resident services.

She also stressed the importance of respect towards residents during her presentation.

""That is a culture that we will resonate deeply in this organization under my leadership.""

Mathews also wants to make sure there's a full assessment of the CHA's Public Housing Program and Housing Choice Voucher Program.

""For me, because I lived it, I want to make sure that every piece of oxygen that I breathe, can do the work to make sure that children and families are given the opportunity to live in stable housing,"" says Mathews.

Community leaders were also impressed with Mathews plan.

""I think the re-tooling process that we're going through is going to be a win-win not only for the residents, but for our community also.""

Board chair Ernest Cromartie III says he's excited for what Mathews will bring.

""We think that she brings the right skill set, competency, compassion needed to perform well and be the leader of the new path forward for the Columbia Housing Authority.""

Her role is as interim executive director and she's under contract with the CHA for a year, but Mathews expressed that she is interested in the permanent executive director role."

Correspondence shows how climate change deniers got into EPA fuel economy rollback fight,https://electrek.co,"['Renogy Watts Volts Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit', 'Chargepoint Home Wifi Enabled Electric Vehicle', 'Ev']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://electrek.co/2019/07/03/climate-change-deniers-epa/,"In the ongoing saga of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back fuel economy standards, it’s been known that automakers sought to ease the rising MPG requirements set by the Obama administration. But a new report reveals how a number of climate change deniers injected themselves into the conversation, pushing the administration to go “much further” than planned.

Recently released government emails show how these deniers even went so far as to call automakers “the opposition,” according to a new report from the New York Times.

Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute — described by the Times as “a free-market think tank in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem” — did just that in a May 2018 email to an EPA official, among others.

Ebell, who leads the climate change-denying “Cooler Heads Coalition,” wrote that the administration should stick to the rollback. He was also, unsurprisingly, selected to lead the Trump administration’s EPA transition team in 2016.

As the administration finalizes its plan to roll back fuel economy standards, the automakers are concerned about a “split market” between California and states which plan to follow higher standards, and the other states. Last month, 17 automakers wrote a letter asking to stop the planned rollback.

Prior to that, in a letter sent to Trump this May, Ebell and his group wrote about the automakers’ pushback. From the Times:

“Their main concern is the expected legal battle with California,” they wrote. “In fact, what many liberal California politicians really want to do is ban gasoline-powered cars altogether.” Their letter went on to say: “You should dismiss this concern. We agree that in an ideal world, California would negotiate with you in good faith, but we all know that is not a reality in this current political climate.”

The administration still hasn’t shown any signs of pulling back.

As National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deputy administrator Heidi King simply told the Times, “In my experience, these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” The NHTSA is making the new rules in conjunction with the EPA.

The Times also notes how another conservative group, American Commitment, generated “almost 1,600 public comments in support of the rollback, or 13 percent of the 12,000 comments received and posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.”

Many of these particular comments came with the same boilerplate language accusing Obama and California as wanting to ban the internal combustion engine, and so forth.

Even the oil companies seem to want no part of these efforts. BP sent a letter to EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in June that found the oil giant siding with the automakers, asking the administration to focus on improving fuel economy, the Times said.

Electrek’s Take

As unsurprising as any of this might be to anyone who’s been following what’s going on with the fuel economy rollback — or with the current EPA and administration in general — it’s still gross beyond belief. A group of people that has absolutely no business even being involved in these decisions instead has an incredible amount of influence.

We’ve reached a point where even BP — BP! — is pushing back against the administration’s efforts.

Automakers are still not without blame in their role here. Not by a long shot, not at all. They’re the ones who opened this Pandora’s box and pushed the EPA to reduce emissions standards the first chance they got.

But now, at this point in time, it seems clear that if it were just a discussion between automakers that have realized the error of their ways and an administration that actually cared about listening to their concerns about what might happen to the market… or an EPA that cared about reducing emissions… or improving the environment… things could be at least a little different. There could be some sort of “compromise,” at a minimum.

But it’s not.

If you’re looking for a glimmer of hope on this, look to King’s quote about how “these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” California and 17 other states already filed suit against the EPA last year for its proposed rollback. Upon finalization of the plan, legal challenges against the rollback only seem set to increase.

States will be leading the way in that regard, but after all this, wouldn’t it be something if the automakers stepped up with a legal pushback of their own? If the rules are indeed finalized as expected, we’re curious to see what the next move will be from the industry as they face the dreaded “split market.” After all, there’s nothing stopping them from wanting to meet the Obama-era standards on their own.

Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen not yet briefed on DOJ probe into origins of Russia probe,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kevin Johnson', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/05/deputy-ag-jeffrey-rosen-not-yet-briefed-doj-surveillance-probe/1655150001/,"CLOSE Attorney General William Barr told a network television interviewer that he wants answers on how the probe began into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. (May 17) AP, AP

ENGLEWOOD, Colorado – Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said that he has yet to be briefed on the potentially volatile inquiry into possible surveillance abuses by federal authorities in the early days of the Russia investigation.

Rosen, in an interview with USA TODAY this week, said that he was unaware of the investigation’s status and did not know whether it has since morphed into a criminal inquiry.

“I don’t know the answer to that. I’d have to check and get back to you. I hear it described as an inquiry. I don’t want to say something that won’t be accurate. So let me defer on that one. “

The Justice Department later declined to elaborate. But Rosen’s deference on such a high-profile matter underscored the extreme close-hold on an inquiry launched by Attorney General William Barr and now managed by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham.

It also highlights how Rosen, more than a month following his confirmation, has so far assumed a role largely out of the public eye in a stark departure from his predecessor, Rod Rosenstein, whose rocky two-year tenure was defined by his management of the Russia investigation and former Justice special counsel Robert Mueller.

John Durham: Attorney general taps top Connecticut federal prosecutor for review of Trump-Russia inquiry

""It (the surveillance inquiry) started before I arrived,"" Rosen said, adding that he was ""not currently"" being briefed on it. ""I had some generalized awareness, but I'm not meeting regularly with Mr. Durham.""

In April, Barr startled some lawmakers when he disclosed that he was reviewing the FBI's use of surveillance involving associates of President Donald Trump during the presidential campaign as authorities sought to understand Russia's interference efforts. At the time, Barr said he did not know whether officials had done anything wrong, though the review's disclosure was instantly cheered by some Republicans and Trump who has long disparaged Mueller's work as a ""witch hunt.""

""Spying on a campaign is a big deal,"" Barr told a Senate panel then. ""I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.""

In May, the attorney general injected new urgency into that review when he tapped Durham, a long-time federal prosecutor, to review the ""genesis and the conduct"" of the FBI's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Durham's appointment came just three days before Rosen's confirmation as second-in-command at Justice.

The inquiry is proceeding, as Justice's inspector general is conducting its own review of how federal authorities obtained a warrant in 2016 to monitor former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page and his possible links to Russia. The results of that investigation are expected to be disclosed soon.

While not briefed on the Barr-Durham inquiry, Rosen nevertheless characterized it as ""serious.""

""I'm not sealed out,"" the deputy attorney general said, explaining that the attorney general had already taken on the coordinating role with Durham.

Rosen, 61, arrived at the Justice as a largely unknown player, having served in the top ranks of the Transportation Department – but never at the sprawling Justice Department.

His lack of Justice experience drew criticism from some Democrats who have expressed concern for the department's independence from the White House in the aftermath of the Mueller investigation.

""At this critical moment, we need a deputy attorney general who knows the Justice Department, who has experience in criminal investigations and prosecutions, and who is committed to the department’s role of enforcing the law independently,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said after voting against Rosen's confirmation.

Acknowledging his role as ""the new guy,"" Rosen said the learning curve has presented few problems so far.

""You know it’s always risky to assume that you know what you don’t know,"" the deputy attorney general said. ""So, I’m sure there are things I don’t know. But it’s gone extremely well from my vantage point. I think some of the concerns that were raised about that (lack of experience) didn’t account for the fact that the Justice Department, in some ways, is like a big law firm. I spent a lot of time at a big law firm; there (are) tremendous resources available. And so the things that I need to get up to speed on, I have like the foremost experts in the world available to me to brief me on them.""

In his first month, Rosen has sought a fuller understanding of the opioid crisis in America and has taken a lead role in Justice's implementation of bipartisan criminal justice legislation aimed at easing sentences for non-violent drug offenders, reducing the federal prison population and assisting offenders' transition back into their communities.

Rosen said Justice is on schedule to deliver a critical tool to assess the needs and risks of future recidivism for federal prisoners. The program, required under the First Step Act, a sweeping measure intended to reduce the nation's prison population, is due by July 19.

On the same date, the federal Bureau of Prisons is set to recalculate the amount of so-called ""good time"" earned by federal offenders, an action that is expected to result in the release of 2,200 offenders to their home communities.

Barr: Attorney general says he will review government 'spying' on Trump campaign; 'I am concerned'

Rosen, who was touring the federal prison in Englewood, Colo., earlier this week in advance of the actions slated for later this month, said Justice was ""pushing hard"" to abide by the requirements of the new legislation.

Since the First Step Act was signed into law in December, Rosen said 1,093 drug offenders have been released from federal prisons as part of a provision that reconciled overly harsh sentences issued to crack cocaine offenders. Another 171 low-risk elderly inmates and 46 chronically-ill offenders also have been released under terms of the legislation.

""I’m putting my personal attention on that,"" Rosen said of the legislation. ""The attorney general is, too.""

Rosen's personal attention to a separate prison-related matter, however, captured the most public notice of his tenure so far.

In a letter to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance earlier this month, the deputy attorney general weighed in on the question of where former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort should be confined during his prosecution on state financial fraud charges.

Citing Manafort lawyers' concern for their client's ""health and safety"" if moved to a state prison, Rosen directly raised the issue with Vance, noting that that lawyers preferred that Manafort remain in federal custody where he is serving a 7.5-year sentence on a financial conviction. Such issues are generally not raised to the highest levels of the Justice Department.

Manafort: Reports: Manafort not headed to Rikers Island after DOJ intervened

Rosen dismissed the suggestion he was intervening on behalf of Manafort. He said he was merely attempting to resolve a question raised by federal prison officials.

""To me that seemed pretty benign,"" Rosen said. ""Maybe…I have to adapt to a new environment, as someone who came from another department. But it didn’t seem like an extreme measure to me to ask the New York district attorney, 'What do you think we should do with this?'""

Going forward, Rosen said he expects to apply a simple rule of management.

""It’s not my job to do their jobs,"" he said of the department's more than 110,000 employees. ""It’s to ensure that everyone is doing their job.""

U.S. reviews export requests to Huawei with 'highest scrutiny': Commerce Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Min Read']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech-commerce-idUSKCN1TY2HA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday it was reviewing license requests from U.S. companies seeking to export products to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd “under the highest national security scrutiny” since the company is still blacklisted.

In an email to Reuters, the Commerce Department said that as it reviewed applications, it was applying the “presumption of denial” standard associated with Entity Listed companies, meaning applications are unlikely to be approved.

President Donald Trump surprised markets on Saturday with an announcement that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei [HWT.UL], which was placed on the so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns.

U.S. chipmakers, which had been seeking a carve-out for exports of less sensitive technology to the world’s top telecoms technology maker, welcomed the news.

But four days after Trump’s announcement on the sidelines of the G20 in Japan, industry and government officials were uncertain what the new policy will be.

“It seems like nobody has made up their mind as to what the policy is and, as a result, nothing’s changing,” said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer.

“There’s even less change than we anticipated if we’re still applying the presumption of denial,” Jacobson added, noting that he’s advising clients not to even apply for a license because it’s not worth their time and money under that review policy.

In an email to enforcement staff on Monday, seen by Reuters, John Sonderman, deputy director of the Office of Export Enforcement in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, sought to clarify how agents should approach license requests by firms seeking approval to sell to Huawei.

All such applications should be considered on merit, he wrote, citing regulations that include the “presumption of denial” licensing policy.

The Commerce Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the department intends to notify companies of decisions on export license applications once the review is complete.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this week that the government would allow “lower tech” chip sales that do not impact national security, echoing similar comments from National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow.

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It has launched a lobbying effort to convince U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."

It's time to break up the Department of Homeland Security,https://www.cnn.com,['David Perry'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/opinions/department-of-homeland-security-needs-dismantling-perry/index.html,"David M. Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the history department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter . The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Every day, it seems, we get another story about the horrible conditions in the US Customs and Border Protection detention facilities or Border Patrol officers behaving badly . This current crisis at the border and in the various immigration agencies is not just a byproduct of Trump and his advisers' virulent nativism, but a manifestation of the flaws built into the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was never going to work. It's time to break it up.

The department was thrown together during George W. Bush's administration, forged in fear in the aftermath of 9/11. Today, it's a hodgepodge of diverse agencies -- including the TSA, FEMA, ICE, and many more -- often with conflicting missions, all of which have been subordinated beneath Trump's anti-immigrant agenda

I remember remarking to a friend in 2002, when the Homeland Security Act created the new department with broad bipartisan support, that ""Homeland Security"" sounded like something out of a dystopian novel. A year after 9/11, American politicians were afraid of another attack, they were being misled toward war in Iraq, compromising civil liberties in exchange for projecting a feeling of security, and making lots of mistakes, usually with wide margins of support from their constituencies.

As we head toward the 2020 election, and as horrific conditions in prison-like facilities run by the immigration agencies of DHS are headline news , it's long past time to take a sober look at the post-9/11 moment and find ways to fix some of those mistakes.

This week, as the Congressional Democrats were touring a Texas border facility run by Customs and Border Protection, ProPublica broke a story that described a secret Facebook group of some 9,500 current and former Border Patrol agents. Here, members ""joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant."" The US Customs and Border Protection Agency has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"" and promised to investigate its officers

Examining these abuses shines a light on the folly of slamming immigration enforcement agencies (such as ICE and CPB) into a single department with agencies in charge of emergency management (FEMA), transportation (TSA), and energy (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), all bound together by a counterterrorism mission statement.

As security expert Bruce Schneier often says , in the aftermath of terrorism, politicians feel desperate, rationalizing: ""Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it."" That's the kind of thinking that created the Department of Homeland Security.

Immigration police from throughout the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of DHS, which includes ICE and CPB, seem to feel free to act with impunity , knowing they can resist oversight by citing the counterterrorism mission of DHS. Any budgetary limit on one agency opens up the other components to plundering, such as when DHS transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ICE, the funds at least partially used for immigration detention and deportation, in the midst of the 2018 hurricane season.

JUST WATCHED Border patrol agent warns of derogatory culture at CBP Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Border patrol agent warns of derogatory culture at CBP 03:55

I'm far from the first to call for breaking up DHS and returning its components to other departments where they belong, back to pre-existing agencies like Transportation, Justice, and Energy. In 2006, not long after FEMA failed New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow offered some ""dreary conclusions"" in Homeland Security Affairs, writing that DHS is not particularly adept at fulfilling its core mission of streamlining intelligence sharing among federal agencies while diverting funds from supporting first responders in the wake of natural disasters.

In 2011, David Rittgers, a legal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, made his case that ""the Department of Homeland Security should be abolished and its components reorganized into more practical groupings."" In 2012, Tulane scholar Kevin Gotham linked the 2002 Homeland Security Bill to an accelerated process of privatization of disaster relief at least partially responsible for the failures during Hurricane Katrina.

Former DHS counterterrorism official Matt Mayer, later a scholar of homeland security, wrote in 2015 , ""after twelve years of mediocre-to-poor operations and countless scandals ... the core functions overseen by DHS can be managed more effectively elsewhere, especially where territorial battles undermine operational efficacy.""

None of these authors are radicals. They are just looking at the mission of DHS, assessing its successes, condemning its many failures, and concluding that the agency can't be fixed.

DHS was a bipartisan mistake. It's made it harder for FEMA to respond to national disasters. It's enabled a culture of impunity and aggression among our immigration officers. It has a history emerging from a specific historical context and time. I believe that as the decades pass, historians like me will look back in sadness at the years after 9/11, when national unity was squandered in persuading Americans to abandon their civil liberties, plunging the nation into endless war, and laying the groundwork for our new regime of concentration camps (as some genocide scholars characterize them ) on the American border.

The country’s annual celebration of its independence is not complete without family gatherings, picnics, parades, and the sights and sounds of fireworks.

Yet on national forests and grasslands, fireworks and other explosives are prohibited permanently. Public lands provide another option for celebrating the Fourth: Simply look up at night. Nature’s light show can provide its own “oohs and ahhs.” Stargazing, especially in areas where darkness is broken only by campfires, provides spectacular shows.

Although fireworks are not allowed, national forests and grasslands are the perfect spaces to spend your holiday. They provide entertainment for everyone, from camping, to cookouts, to places to enjoy water recreation.

If camping or picnicking is what you are planning, make sure you check with the local ranger district of your national forest or grassland for any bans on open flames, whether it’s a fire pit, grill or campfire. Even if there are no bans, please be cautious. The rule to ensuring your campfire is out is to drown, stir, drown and feel with the back of your hand to ensure the fire is fully out. Letting a campfire die out naturally is not safe. Hot embers could be smoldering underneath the ashes and could reignite. Remember, the ashes should be cold to the touch.

You can also use a mesh dome over fire pits to help stop embers from flying in the air and landing on dry grass. These embers could spark a fire in an area further than your campsite.

Other safety tips include being careful to not park on tall, dry grass. The heat from the car, or chains dragging along the ground if you are pulling something, could spark a fire. For more information, check out our Know Before You Go tips and wildfire prevention advice from Smokey Bear.

We want you to enjoy your Fourth of July safely. Remember, you are responsible for your safety and for the safety of those around you.

Vintage EPA photos reveal what US waterways looked like before pollution was regulated,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aylin Woodward'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-epa-photos-reveal-us-waterways-before-pollution-was-regulated-2019-6,"Just over 50 years ago, Ohio's Cuyahoga river caught fire.

The disaster prompted a public outcry that in part led to the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA was charged with regulating the country's polluted air and waterways, among other environmental objectives.

Soon after its founding, the agency dispatched 100 photographers to capture the US' environmental issues as part of a photo project called Documerica. The photographers took about 81,000 images, more than 20,000 of which were archived. At least 15,000 have been digitized by the National Archives, and the images now function as a kind of time capsule, revealing what states from California to New York looked like between 1971 and 1977.

The official nickname for Kansas is “The Sunflower State.” Sherman County produces more sunflowers than any other county in Kansas. There are dozens of species of sunflowers. Sunflower seeds can be transformed into oils, birdseed, and more.

Kansas farmers know how to grow wheat. In 2017, Kansas ranked No. 1 in wheat production, according to the 2017 Census of Agriculture. Kansas farms produced 319 million bushels of wheat from 7 million harvested acres, accounting for almost 18 percent of all wheat grown in the United States.

Kansas also ranked No. 1 in grain sorghum production. On the 2.4 million acres of sorghum harvested for grain in Kansas, 194 million bushels were produced; this accounted for a whopping 55 percent of all grain sorghum produced in the U.S. in 2017.

But Kansas farmers know how to grow other crops as well. Kansas corn production totaled 694 million bushels in 2017, ranking seventh in the nation. Soybean production in Kansas was 197 million bushels, 10th in the nation. Kansas also produced 74 million pounds of sunflowers in 2017, coming in fourth.

Kansas ranked sixth in forage production with 5.6 million tons harvested in 2017. Cotton production in Kansas totaled 188 thousand bales in 2017, almost three times as much as in 2012.

What about livestock in Kansas? On the nearly 27,000 Kansas farms and ranches raising cattle and calves in 2017, nearly 8 million head were sold. This accounted for over 11 percent of all cattle and calves sold in the United States. Just over 5.4 million hogs were sold off Kansas farms in 2017, up almost 8 percent from five years before.

Overall, the nearly 59,000 Kansas farms and ranches, which encompassed almost 46 million acres, accounted for roughly $19 billion dollars’ worth of agricultural products sold in 2017.

I would like to personally thank all the Kansas farm and ranch families who completed the 2017 Census of Agriculture. Without your help, we would not be able to provide an accurate measurement of the food, feed, and fiber supplies that contribute so greatly to the prosperity of our state and nation."

On Aug. 3, 2016, Strzok wrote, ""I think we need to consider the lines of what we disclose to DOJ. For example, the last stipulation notes we will not disclose [the] identifies outside the FBI. I think you might argue the unauthorized disclosure might (reasonably) be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to US national security...""

In an earlier discussion on Aug. 2, 2016, Strzok reported he had a “good meeting.” Page warned, ""Make sure you can lawfully protect what you sign. Just thinking about congress, foia (Freedom of Information Act), etc. I'm sure it's fine. I just don't know how protection of intel-type stuff works in that context.""

Fox News has learned some of the words and names that were redacted in the string of Strzok-Page messages; they are included below.

[NOTE: 'OUTBOX' messages are from Page, 'INBOX' messages from Strzok]

The New York Times was first to report lengthy details about the 2016 meeting in question, when the FBI ""dispatched a pair of agents to London on a mission so secretive that all but a handful of officials were kept in the dark."" The report said this assignment included questioning Australian Ambassador Alexander Downer. Downer's information about then-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos helped lay the foundation for the FBI’s counterintelligence probe – which later grew into former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

House Republicans, continuing to probe the texts, have considered August 2016 a pivotal month. They have been looking closely at these exchanges, and how long before the August meeting Downer reported the Papadopoulos information.

Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, meanwhile, has been conducting a separate investigation into alleged surveillance abuse during the 2016 campaign, with that case in its final phases. And, this past May, Attorney General William Barr asked U.S. Attorney John Durham to probe the origins of the FBI counterintelligence case which was opened in late July 2016 by then-agent Strzok.

Fox News also has learned what's behind some of the redactions for the texts during that period, revealing new details of the Strzok meeting which took place at the U.S. embassy in London inside a secure facility known as SCIF.

In the texts, Strzok said the meeting did not include the No. 2 State Department official in London known as the deputy chief of mission.

""Was DCM (deputy chief of mission) present for the interview?"" Page asked.

""No, two of them, two of us."" Strzok responded.

Other texts indicated then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was trying to reach someone named “Jeremy” and make multiple references to “Ben,” though it’s not clear if they worked within or outside the FBI.

Strzok and Page then discussed how widely the information needed to be shared within the bureau, including Strzok’s immediate supervisor Bill Priestap.

Page wrote on Aug. 3, 2016, ""New case. Information flow. Control."" The section that followed was heavily redacted, but Strzok responded, “...plan on telling Bill I'm obviously going to tell him anything he wants to know, but recommend we not tell him or [higher] … specific data so that he and higher can tell DOJ, even we don't know the admin details.""

Horowitz also has been investigating leaks from senior FBI officials as part of his probes. The expectation is that report will come after the surveillance abuse investigation.

In an apparent reference to bureau leaks, Strzok wrote, ""this is MUCH more tasty for one of those (redacted) aholes to leak. For the first time in a while I'm not worried about our side.""

The lawsuit was filed in D.C. District Court against Treasury and the IRS and their respective leaders, Steve Mnuchin and Charles Rettig.

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is seeking the President's tax returns using a little-known IRS provision known as 6103 , which allows the Chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to request and obtain an individual's tax information for a legitimate legislative purpose.

The move comes months after Neal made his initial request for the President's tax information and as outside groups and other liberals on the Ways and Means Committee grew impatient with the pace of Neal's efforts. Neal initially made his request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of follow-up letters, the Treasury Department formally denied the request at the beginning of May, and Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

""In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation's voluntary tax system,"" House attorneys wrote in the complaint.

The Environmental Protection Agency has weighed in once again on the proposed Pebble Mine, and it has mine opponents cheering.

In formal comments released Tuesday, the EPA says a draft report on the mine’s environmental impact lacks important information and likely underestimates the risk to water quality and fish habitat in the Bristol Bay watershed.

Longtime Dillingham fisherman Norm Van Vactor, CEO of the Bristol Bay Economic Development Corporation, always believed the professional staff at the EPA would see the holes in the draft report on Pebble. Still, he worried some voices might be stifled for political reasons. Even before he finished reading the EPA comments, Van Vactor could feel his faith restored.

“It’s a powerful statement,” Van Vactor said. “I think it’s a powerful indictment.”

The two primary federal agencies involved in Pebble’s application for a Clean Water Act permit are the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps prepared the draft report looking at what impact the copper and gold mine could have on the environment. The EPA issued comments critical of that report.

“I mean, it’s almost like we were singing off the same page,” said Pebble critic Rich Borden.

He used to manage environmental matters for mining giant Rio Tinto but he believes the Pebble mine is too risky. Borden said the EPA pointed out some of the same deficiencies he noticed in the Army Corps’ report.

“Lack of detail, the fact that it’s conceptual, and there’s a lack of engineering drawings or even sufficient design to tell what the impacts are going to be – that’s exactly the same thing I said,” Borden noted. “They seem (to be) very substantive, honest comments. “

Meanwhile, the mine developers are soldiering on.

“Hey, you know, it’s Tuesday,” Pebble spokesman Mike Heatwole said.

The EPA’s comments haven’t disrupted Pebble’s work at the site. Heatwole said they’re doing wetlands-mapping of the proposed road corridor and plan to drill a dozen new holes for a groundwater study.

“There’s really nothing in their comments that come as a surprise to us,” Heatwole said. “And really the issue at hand is whether or not the issues highlighted by the EPA have been adequately addressed via the process, and if they have not, we’re confident the Corps will ensure this as they work toward finalizing the EIS for the project.”

The EPA provided pages and pages of recommendations for the Army Corps to improve its final environmental impact statement. The comments were signed by Chris Hladick, the EPA administrator for Region 10, which includes Alaska.

In a second document issued by EPA Region 10, the agency concludes the project “may have substantial and unacceptable adverse impacts on fisheries resources in the project area watersheds, which are aquatic resources of national importance.”

A disagreement between EPA Region 10 and the Corps could be decided by higher-ups in Washington. In the meantime, mine opponents say they hope the EPA’s comments embolden Alaska’s congressional delegation to take a stand against Pebble. They’ve been targeting Sen. Lisa Murkowski. She chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. She also chairs the appropriations subcommittee that decides the EPA’s budget."
JBS a big winner in USDA trade war relief contracts,https://www.wisfarmer.com,"['Christopher Walljasper', 'Midwest Center For Investigative Reporting', 'Published P.M.

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) - A Brazilian-owned meat processing company undercut its competition by more than $1 per pound to win nearly $78 million in pork contracts through a federal program launched to help American farmers offset the impact from an ongoing trade war.

As a result, JBS USA has won more than 26% of the $300 million the USDA has allocated to pork so far — more than any other company, according to an analysis of bid awards by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

The USDA's Trade Mitigation Program was announced last August, and included direct payments to farmers, as well as $1.2 billion in food purchases from farmers and ranchers whose crops normally benefit from international markets. The plan called for $558 million worth of pork purchases. The program is intended to help U.S. farmers and ranchers hurt by the ongoing trade disputes with China, Mexico, Canada and other trading partners.

JBS bid an average of $2.56 per pound for five pound pork loin cuts, while its competitors bid an average of $3.80 per pound. The company bid as low as $2.02 for the cut, the Midwest Center found.

The analysis found that JBS bid 33% less on the contracts — undercutting its competitors, even Tyson Foods, the second largest meat processor in the country.

JBS USA is the U.S. division of JBS SA, the world's largest meat producer. The company owns more than 300 live hog operations in the United States.

It's expanded its reach in the U.S. in the last decade, buying Swift & Co., Smithfield Beef Group, Inc., Pilgrim's Pride poultry and Cargill's Pork business, in addition to other acquisitions abroad.

JBS' facilities in Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois and California have won trade mitigation contracts with the USDA.

""Who's the government going to purchase it from? The Brazilian-owned JBS or the Chinese-owned Smithfield? They've allowed enough concentration in the packing industry, you're running out of choices,"" said Brian Duncan, a hog farmer from Northwest Illinois and vice president of the Illinois Farm Bureau.

Duncan raises 70,000 hogs each year, selling mostly to Tyson, but also to JBS' Beardstown, Illinois facility.

Following publication of this story, the USDA provided a response from Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue:

""We're buying U.S. produced agricultural products. The premise behind procurement is to take product off the market and support prices. This will help U.S. Farmers,"" said Perdue. ""These are legal companies operating in the United States. This is no different than people buying Volkswagens or other foreign autos that are manufactured in the United States, where their executives may have been guilty of some issue along the way. They still buy the cars. JBS is a Brazilian company operating in the United States, buying product from U.S. farmers. What we do through these companies — it's not to help the companies — they offer a bid to us based on buying U.S. farmers production. This helps U.S. Farmers by supporting prices. Companies are able to buy from our farmers more because we are buying that product and taking it off the market.""

Greg Gunthorp, who raises hogs near Mongo, Indiana, said its JBS' size that allows it to offer such low prices.

""They're a huge global corporation,"" he said. Because of that, they are less impacted by the demand problems purely American pork processors are facing. ""To claim we're bailing out the farmer and bailing out agriculture, and giving it to foreign multinational corporations is a joke.""

In an emailed statement, JBS stressed its American roots.

""We operate U.S. pork plants, processing American hogs raised by U.S. farmers — the true program beneficiaries,"" said Nikki Richardson, a spokesperson for JBS USA. ""Like other companies in the program, our sole intent for participating was to support U.S. producer prices and help our American producer partners. It was not a bailout.""

The pork JBS is selling to the federal government comes from American farmers, the company said. JBS said its facilities in Worthington, Minnesota, Marshalltown, Iowa, Ottumwa, Iowa and Beardstown, Illinois work with more than 3,165 pork producers, paying $3.5 billion in livestock payments each year.

But many of those producers are on long term pricing contracts with JBS and may not see much benefit from the USDA's purchases.

""How does that trickle down to farmers raising pigs for them?"" asked Gunthorp. ""They're on a contract. That contract's not changing because JBS sold more pork to the government.""

Duncan said he hasn't seen much uptick in prices because of the trade dispute commodity purchases.

""There was a slight run up in price late last fall,"" he said. ""There was a rally and the rumor was the government was making some purchases.""

The first USDA awards for pork products were released in November. But Duncan said a bigger factor affecting hog prices has been the African swine fever that's been hurting hog farmers in China and Southeast Asia since last August.

China's hog population has dropped by 40 million.

The U.S. produces 74.3 million hogs annually, according the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service.

The disease has increased global demand for pork and could be an opportunity to sell more U.S. pork to Asian markets. But that depends on trade with China reopening.

""There's opportunity there for us to be a major supplier,"" said Duncan. ""But I don't know if this administration is going to let us take advantage of that opportunity.""

The USDA's purchases represent such a small portion of U.S. hog production, it's unclear they'll make much difference.

Ted Schroeder, an agriculture economist at Kansas State University, said many of the impacted markets will barely notice these purchases.

""I just don't see these programs being huge support for farmers,"" said Scheoder.

While pork makes up nearly half the food to be purchased through the USDA trade mitigation program, it's small in comparison to the amount of pork produced each year, Schroeder said.

""Once completed, it will have resulted in moving a week's worth of U.S. pork production, which is significant during a challenging time,"" said Jim Monroe, Senior Communications Director for the National Pork Producers Council, referring to the first round of pork purchases. ""Our preference is an end to trade disputes that have prompted retaliatory tariffs against U.S. pork from two of our largest export market, Mexico and China.""

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has bought $748 million worth of food from farmers and ranchers, nearly two thirds of the original $1.2 billion goal according to the Midwest Center analysis.

That's five times as much on food as the agency bought in the first six months of the program, according to analysis by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

The program was intended to be temporary relief for farmers struggling against the effects of the trade wars. On May 13 President Trump announced the USDA would buy another $1.3 billion in food from U.S. producers.

An agency spokesperson said in an email that the first round of commodity purchases won't be completed until January 2020. The USDA has yet to give details on the second round of purchases.

JBS is under scrutiny by several U.S. senators who say the company shouldn't be able to participate in the USDA program.

""It is counterproductive and contradictory for these companies to receive assistance paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this Administration's trade policy,"" said the May 29 letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, from nine U.S. senators.

This new tool cuts VA disability claims’ processing time in half,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Tajha Chappellet-Lanier'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/digital-va-disability-claims-tool-form-526ez/,"Written by Tajha Chappellet-Lanier

Veterans looking to receive compensation for service-connected disabilities can now use a self-service online tool developed by the U.S. Digital Service team at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The new tool, built in partnership by the digital team (DSVA), the VA’s Office of Information Technology and the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), aims to make it easier for veterans to submit disability claims to the agency. And it comes with a side benefit for all involved: It’s reportedly decreasing the overall adjudication times for claims.

The Disability Compensation Claim Tool is a new digital front end for the form 526EZ, a deeply bureaucratic 12-page document that begins with seven pages of instructions. In it, veterans are called upon to describe their service-connected injuries neatly and in a small table — a process that can be as taxing as it is confusing.

The new digital version is designed such that veterans can “get through the process easily and understand what’s happening,” Andrea Schneider, product lead at DSVA, told FedScoop in an interview. It’s not just an online version of the old paper form — it’s a revamped experience that guides veterans through the process, asking user-friendly questions and using the answers to populate a regular 526EZ on the backend. In a sense, the tool works to translate the kind of plain language a veteran would use into the bureaucratic officialese that claims adjudicators require.

“We don’t need the veteran to be an expert in our administrative processes,” Paul Shute, chief of operational innovation at the VBA’s Compensation Service, told FedScoop.

As always, DSVA emphasized user-centered design in building the tool, talking with “hundreds” of veterans to unveil their needs and testing an early version of the tool beginning in August 2018, the team said. The final version, which fully launched in March, is the culmination of about two years of “solid, dedicated effort,” Schneider told FedScoop.

“It’s been a labor of love,” she added.

But the tool isn’t just easier — it’s also faster. Before launch, the average disability claims processing time was somewhere between 108 and 120 days (FedScoop got differing feedback on this). The majority of that time, Shute told FedScoop, was spent gathering evidence — often in a back-and-forth between the veteran and the adjudicator. The new tool’s use of conditional logic and data integration has already managed, on average, to cut that time in half, the team said. Since March, there have been more than 10,000 claims submissions sent through the tool.

“It’s been an incredible project,” Schneider said. “It’s been impactful from a service perspective, feeling like we’re really able to touch people’s lives and make them a little bit better.”

The new tool is the latest in the VA’s continued focus on putting its veteran “customers” first. In November 2018 the agency launched a new version of VA.gov, one that puts veteran service front and center. And in May the agency officially added customer experience to its “Core Values and Characteristics” — the guidelines in the the Code of Federal Regulations that define priorities of VA employees as well as what the agency stands for.

“We depend on Veterans, their caregivers, and our business partners to help us form the vision of an improved Veteran experience,” James Gfrerer, CIO at the VA, said in a statement emailed to FedScoop. “Human-centered design, powered by IT, is transforming VA.”"
House Democrats sue Treasury Department to obtain Trump's tax returns,https://www.salon.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/02/house-democrats-sue-treasury-department-to-obtain-trumps-tax-returns/,"House Democrats filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on Tuesday over the White House's refusal to provide lawmakers with access to six years of President Donald Trump's tax returns.

The move escalates the standoff between the executive and legislative branches of government over the president's financial records, setting the stage for what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle. It comes after a months of fighting between the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee, which requested and then subpoenaed the returns, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

The outcome of the dispute will likely determine whether the financial information that Trump has kept secret will be viewed by Congress and the public.

In the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the House Ways and Means Committee argued that the administration's refusal to provide the documents represents ""an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the I.R.S., and the tax laws on behalf of the American people.""

The panel's chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., is seeking Trump's tax returns under Section 6103 of the federal tax code that says the IRS ""shall furnish"" the returns of any taxpayer to the chairmen of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee for a legitimate legislative purpose.

Neal initially made the request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of letters between the panel and the administration, Mnuchin formally rejected the request at the beginning of May, arguing that the request represents an unprecedented abuse of power. Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

The panel stated in the filing that they need access to the president's returns to ""carry out its broad mandate to oversee Treasury, the IRS, and the Nation's tax laws.""

Ways and Means member Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas said on Tuesday, ""This long-overdue legal action is needed to keep this bad president from setting a bad precedent. It should not take a court to affirm that 'shall' means 'shall.' But Trump will do what it takes to delay the inevitable, hiding his tax returns as long as he can.""

The Treasury Department and Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, have argued that the request represents an abuse of power.

Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means panel, previously urged Mnuchin to reject Neal's request, calling it an ""abuse"" of authority from Democrats on the committee.

""Weaponizing our nation's tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans privacy right,"" Brady wrote in an April 3 letter to Mnuchin. ""All Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns.""

Democrats have been on a hunt for Trump's tax returns since he bucked decades of tradition when he refused to release them during the 2016 election cycle,

Although not required by law, every major party presidential nominee since the 1970s has chosen to publicly release his or her tax returns except for Gerald Ford, who only released a summary. Financial disclosures can help paint a fuller picture of a candidate's business positions and interests by providing information about financial dealings, such as investments, donations, business relationships, assets and possible conflicts of interests.

The lawsuit over Trump's taxes is the latest development in an escalating feud between Congress and Trump, who has vowed to fight ""all the subpoenas"" looking into his administration and personal finances.

Trump has asserted executive privilege to block the release of an unredacted version of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report, as well as its underlying evidence, on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He also blocked subpoenas for testimony from former White House communication director Hope Hicks, former White House deputy counsel Annie Donaldson and former White House counsel Don McGahn.

Trump also sued the House Oversight and Reform Committee to block the panel for obtaining years of his financial records from accounting firm Mazars USA.

He also sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One in an attempt to block the banks from responding to subpoenas, issued by House Intelligence Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, seeking financial documents related to the president, his family and the Trump Organization.

The district court judges ruling on the two separate cases sided with Congress, saying the panels have broad authority to subpoena documents for investigative purposes that could result in legislative action. Trump's legal team appealed both rulings."
DOJ says citizenship question being dropped from 2020 Census: NY attorney general's office,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

This past May, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines introduced legislation that would require the census to include a citizenship question.

""This is America,"" Daines told Fox News at the time. ""We are a sovereign nation. It's absurd that we don't know how many citizens and non-citizens are living in this country. That's why I'm introducing this bill to require a citizenship question on the census - and ensure that states harboring millions of illegal immigrants are not rewarded with additional taxpayer dollars.""

Members of Congress representing many of the D.C.-based federal workers whose jobs are about to be reassigned or moved to the Midwest are running out of ways to try to stop the Trump administration from relocating those offices.

Democratic lawmakers have written a flurry of letters, bills and amendments in a race to block the measures before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, with little success.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue last month finalized plans to move about 550 jobs at two scientific agencies in the Agriculture Department from Southwest Washington to the greater Kansas City region.

In a separate move, the administration has threatened to furlough and possibly lay off 150 workers at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal workforce’s human resources agency, if Congress blocks the administration’s plans to eliminate the department.

Proponents of the changes say they want to streamline operations, save taxpayer money, spread the economic effects of federal jobs beyond the nation’s capital and bring workers closer to the people they serve.

Opponents of the USDA’s move, including Democratic lawmakers and unions representing federal workers, say the agencies will hemorrhage talent because many scientists and researchers would rather quit than move their families 1,000 miles from the District.

[Perspective: Stark choice for USDA employees: Move to Kansas City or lose your job]

Capital region lawmakers say both of the administration’s proposals are part of a long-standing Republican campaign, bolstered by President Trump, to paint federal workers as unnecessary bureaucrats.

“In the White House, there is, among some people, a real disrespect for federal employees, animated by their disrespect for the government generally,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), whose district includes part of Prince George’s County, said in a brief interview. “So if you’re hostile to government, you’re then . . . hostile to those who work in government.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who represents most of Fairfax and Prince William counties, said an “unrelenting assault” on benefits, compensation, hiring, workers’ rights, workplace conditions and appellate rights started when Republicans took control of Congress in 2011.

“The Republicans, and especially the Trump administration, view the entire federal enterprise, federal workers, as part of the swamp, and anything they can do to diminish it, demean it, from their point of view is a good thing,” Connolly said.

He pointed to a March 2017 resolution spearheaded by Republican Jason Chaffetz of Utah, then the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, that would have deemed it unnecessary for federal agencies to be located in the District. The measure, called Divest D.C., advanced to the full House but never got a floor vote.

Current efforts appear to be moving ahead unabated, raising concerns among federal workers that the administration could try to replicate the plans across government.

“It seems like if they are successful here, this could just be the tip of the iceberg,” said Sandra Salstrom, a lobbyist for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union for federal workers. “We don’t know who’s next.”

Connolly is chairman of the House Oversight Committee’s panel on government operations, which in May held a three-hour hearing titled “The Administration’s War on a Merit Based Civil Service.”

The hearing focused on the administration’s plans to move most Office of Personnel Management functions into the General Services Administration, the government’s real estate and procurement arm. The plan also would shift leadership to the executive branch, raising worries that the agency could become politicized.

The OPM-GSA merger was the subject of a rally last week organized by federal worker unions across from the current OPM headquarters.

In addition to Connolly and Hoyer, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s nonvoting delegate, took turns at the microphone in the shadow of a statue of Argentine independence hero José de San Martín.

Plans to move the USDA agencies — the Economic Research Service, a statistical agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds cutting-edge agricultural science — to Kansas City intensified Democrats’ frustration.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) of Montgomery County has tried to stop the USDA move through a bill and an amendment, and he sits on a committee that could block the leases on new office space if the contracts exceed a certain threshold.

He suggested the move was part of an ongoing effort by the administration to suppress scientific data on climate change.

“I will use every tool I have on both the Appropriations Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee to block this move,” he said in a statement.

The USDA Office of Inspector General began a review of the relocation in November at the request of Norton and Hoyer. The report is under review by the agency before its release to Congress and the public.

Kevin Hunt, a geographer and head of his union bargaining unit at the Economic Research Service, is a Missouri native but does not plan to move.

He said he is sad to leave what he considers a “dream job” that allows him to do research and publish in scientific journals, pays well and has promotion potential. His partner has a good job elsewhere, making it difficult to move.

Hunt said he believes the agency belongs in the District, where collaboration with other agencies is seamless.

“It’s not about Kansas City,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s about moving people who are established here and who are at the top of their game.”

Lawmakers have inserted language into multiple appropriations bills to block the administration from spending money to move workers in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

However, the changes are on track to begin before the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30, which prompted Norton to suggest litigation as a next step. The basis for a legal challenge is unclear.

“I’ve got to be absolutely candid with you,” she told workers at the rally. “I am going to ask you to go into court. . . . I’m standing here this afternoon to say, ‘If we don’t beat them, I am sure that you will beat them. Keep fighting. We are there with you!’”

She added in an interview: “I think we have done everything we can do. We’re racing against the clock.”

Asked about litigation, an AFGE spokesman said they are pursuing collective bargaining to block or delay the moves.

Trump tweet breaks Interior Department webpage,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-tweet-breaks-interior-department-webpage,"A tweet from President Trump’s account generated so much web traffic to the Department of Interior’s press release regarding Fourth of July celebrations that it broke the webpage.

“What to Expect At This Year’s Annual Fourth of July Celebration,” the article was titled.

Trump’s tweet gained more than 6,000 likes and 2,000 retweets in less than 20 minutes.

The link to the press release was broken for about 30 minutes. It has since been fixed.

Trump has been hyping up his first-ever “Salute to America” event on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. — an event that will feature U.S. Army Abrams Tanks and shutdown the airspace around Washington during and after Trump’s speech.

"Giants Fans Can Find Solace in California, U.S. Agriculture’s MVP in Sales",https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Gary Keough', 'Director', 'Nass Pacific Region In']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/07/05/giants-fans-can-find-solace-california-us-agricultures-mvp-sales,"Posted by Gary Keough, Director, NASS Pacific Region in Research and Science

While California’s value of agricultural products sold increased 6 percent from the last Ag Census, so did production expenses in the Golden State. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, agricultural production expenses increased 7 percent from 2012 to 2017.

It might not be the Giants’ year in baseball, but in U.S. agriculture, California is clearly the MVP in sales. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, California’s 70,521 farms ranked No. 1 in agricultural sales with $45.2 billion; this accounted for nearly 12 percent of the U.S. total and was over $16 billion more than the No. 2 state. In addition, Fresno, Tulare, Monterey, Kern, Merced, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin Counties led all U.S. counties in sales. In fact, Fresno County’s agricultural sales were greater than 25 states.

The Golden State’s commodity roster ranges widely from grapes to poinsettias to mozzarella. In 2017, California led the nation in crop sales ($33.4 billion) by toping all other states in sales of fruits, nuts, and berries ($19.7 billion); vegetables ($8.2 billion); nursery, greenhouse, and floriculture production ($2.9 billion); and other crops and hay sales ($1.0 billion). California also ranked third in cotton sales ($0.5 billion).

California ranked fifth in the nation for livestock and poultry sales ($11.8 billion). California’s the No. 1 milk producer in the country ($6.5 billion); it is also a top ten producer of: cattle and calves ($3.1 billion); poultry and eggs ($1.9 billion); aquaculture ($105.6 million); sheep, goats, wool, and mohair ($86.9 million); and other animals and animal products ($76.6 million), and equine ($48.3 million).

Looking for that little known statistic to plug into your own sabermetrics of agriculture? California is the top state for using renewable energy producing systems in agriculture with 14,552 farms. Solar is the state’s most common renewable energy producing system on farms and ranches. For more Census statistics about this heavy-hitter in agriculture, check out the California state and county profiles and congressional district rankings and profiles on the NASS website.

California is the primary producer of American grown flowers with a variety of types grown by farmers throughout the state. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, the Golden State led the nation in floriculture sales at $2.9 billion."
