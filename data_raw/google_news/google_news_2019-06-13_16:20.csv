Democrats are, too. ‘It’s the 78-year-old elephant in the room,’ said a Democratic consultant and pollster, referring to the age the former veep would be if he’s elected president.

Donald Trump isn’t subtle about telegraphing what he believes is his best line of attack against Joe Biden: the Democratic front-runner’s advanced age.

But Democrats are beginning to publicly talk about it themselves.

Story Continued Below

In overt and indirect ways, questions about the former vice president’s age and vigor are increasingly surfacing within his own party, fueled by the former vice president’s relatively light campaign schedule and attempts to limit his public exposure. If elected, Biden would be 78 upon entering the White House — making him the oldest president ever to take the office.

“It’s the 78-year-old elephant in the room,” said Miami-based consultant and pollster Fernand Amandi, who consulted for the Obama-Biden campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and is unaffiliated with any 2020 campaign.

“There is no question that what has propelled Vice President Biden to clear front-runner status is his unparalleled experience in contrast to his primary counterparts, but am I hearing gargantuan concerns among Democratic insiders about Biden’s advanced age, which is the very byproduct of that experience derived from a lifetime of public service? Absolutely, yes.”

In a field in which six of the 23 Democrats running for president are over 65, no Democrat is willing to go as far as Trump — who turns 73 on Friday — who frequently denigrates Biden’s energy and stamina.

The door to the Democrats’ discussion opened wider last week amid a deluge of criticism for Biden’s flip-flop on the Hyde Amendment, which essentially banned publicly funded abortions.

Biden’s new position brought him in line with other Democrats in the race. But his unsteady handling of the issue suggested he was out of touch with party activists and served to highlight how long he had been in politics — the Hyde Amendment was first approved 43 years ago when Biden, in the Senate at the time, voted for it.

David Axelrod, former adviser to President Barack Obama, told POLITICO that Biden’s back-and-forth on the Hyde Amendment was a “bad look” in light of a background narrative surrounding his age.

“When you are 76 and age is in question, you don’t want to be in a situation where your campaign says you ‘misheard’ the question,” Axelrod said. “[T]his kind of story will raise issues.”

If he won in 2020, Biden would be eight years older than the oldest president ever to take office — Donald Trump, Axelrod emphasized. And he’d be two years older than the life expectancy for a male in the United States.

“This is one reason I think they've kept him on a relatively leisurely pace on the campaign trail and away from some of the major events and away from reporters, frankly, because they are worried about things just such as the one we have just seen,” Axelrod said in a separate interview on CNN.

Pete Buttigieg, who’s rising in primary polls, has taken several subtle swipes at Biden and the older candidates in the race. As one of the youngest hopefuls in the race, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., has made generational appeals central to his campaign.

“I think our party is certainly ready to lift up leaders from a new generation,” Buttigieg said in a May interview on the “Today Show.” “The exciting thing is that I think this race will create a fair playing field where people who’ve been in the public sphere for longer than I’ve been alive and people like me get to compete on the basis of our ideas.”

The use of coded generational language to attack an older politician without mentioning age directly is a tactic that Biden himself successfully employed as a 29-year-old challenger in his first U.S. Senate race against incumbent Cale Boggs in 1972. Boggs was 63 at the time.

Biden acknowledges that there are questions about his age, and has sought to parry them by pointing to his physical appearance and public performances.

When asked about Trump’s criticisms of his age and vitality Tuesday by a reporter, Biden leaned in toward his questioner.

“Look at me and answer the question,” Biden said.

When pressed to answer himself, he said: “It’s self-evident. You know it’s a ridiculous assertion on his part. But anyway, look, people have a right to question all of our ages. It’s a totally legitimate thing. All I can say is watch me. Just watch me.”

The next day, at an event in Clinton, Iowa, spoke off the cuff to an audience for more than 40 minutes.

Still, one Biden campaign fundraiser said his age is a concern that the campaign is attempting to manage.

“Of course, we’re going to call any of this criticism ‘ageist’ and counterattack Trump as a madman because he is and everyone knows Joe is a thousand times better than Trump,” the fundraiser said. “But yeah, Joe’s older. It’s harder. And this is a sprint. It’s not a marathon.”

The campaign, the source said, is “easing him in and we’re not going to tire him out because the fact of the matter is that we don’t have to. We’re winning in the primary. We’re beating Trump in the general.”

Biden hasn’t helped his cause with his use of outdated cultural references and his practice of regaling audiences with anecdotes about long-dead senators he worked with — such as North Carolina’s Jesse Helms, South Carolina’s Strom Thurmond and Louisiana’s Russell Long, whom he mentioned at a Miami fundraiser in May that left some donors scratching their heads.

In South Carolina last month, Biden dropped references to former Nixon-Ford national security adviser/Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and then said that Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister who died in 2013, was worried about President Trump. Biden corrected himself and then said he meant Theresa May.

Occasionally, Biden will catch himself looking back too far, such as when he talks about the 1951 Plymouth he used to drive in high school.

“That was old even for me then,” Biden joked in Dubuque during his first visit to Iowa.

The long-term danger for Biden is that polls and focus groups suggest the age issue is a liability in the minds of some voters.

According to the most recent Morning Consult poll, voters express some hesitation about a candidate older than 70. But they also view Biden’s experience as his best asset — 72 percent say they are more likely to support Biden because of his experience as vice president and senator.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Monday indicated that Biden, Trump and 77-year-old Sen. Bernie Sanders could face some resistance because of their ages, with 48 percent of Americans saying they would be less likely to support a presidential candidate older than 70.

Though older than Biden, Sanders hasn’t generated the same volume of discussion about his age. He has had a more aggressive campaign schedule than Biden, speaks in a more animated style and was even seen marching with McDonald’s workers last week in support of higher wages.

Joe Trippi, a Democratic campaign veteran, said Biden in the first months of the campaign escaped public discussion of his age partly because his main opponent, Sanders, is older than he is and also because the race became a debate about the centrist vs. progressives. But with Buttigieg rising, along with middle-aged candidates like California Sen. Kamala Harris, 54, and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, 46, the race could turn into a contest of new vs. old.

Biden, Trippi said, needs to start picking up the pace and engaging more with voters in early states like Iowa, where he began a five-event, two-day swing Tuesday,.

“Anybody who doesn’t put the time in on the ground is putting their candidacy at risk. In Iowa, people will start wondering, particularly if other candidates and people like Axelrod are raising the issue of age,” Trippi said. “If he doesn’t notch things up, it’s only a matter of time before his opponents or the pundits dig in and start leaning into issues like age.”

But to progressive critics of Biden like consultant Rebecca Katz, it might be too late for the candidate to change perceptions.

“People go to hear Uncle Joe and wind up seeing Grandpa Joe,” said Katz, noting that fellow Democrats who have seen Biden speaking at campaign events and come away believing that he’s not the same vigorous politician many remember. “The Joe Biden of 2019 is not the same Joe Biden of 2008, and anyone who has seen him on the stump or even reads the transcripts of one of his recent speeches can see that.”

Yet that wasn’t the experience of Mike Sly, an undecided voter who saw Biden speak Tuesday in Davenport, Iowa. Like more than a dozen potential caucusgoers interviewed at Biden’s Iowa events, he said he didn’t see age as an issue.

“I’m almost 65, I don’t feel like I’m going to keel over,” Sly said.

Edward Nydle, a Sanders supporter, said he decided to go see Biden after his son, who is a Buttigieg supporter, had seen Biden deliver a foreign policy speech and told his dad to check him out.

“I think that anyone who mentions age with him [Biden] or Bernie Sanders, that’s age discrimination. I know people his age, Bernie’s age; I know a woman who’s in her 90s who has more energy than Donald Trump does,” Nydle said.

When told that other Democrats raised questions about Biden’s age and vigor, he said: “I think they’re wrong. I’ve seen Bernie running through airports to catch planes. It doesn’t bother me, but I think they’re overemphasizing that too much. With age comes wisdom and experience that’s how I see it.”

Hong Kong’s relationship with the mainland is supposed to be governed by the principle of “one country, two systems.” But as with any form of pluralism, it’s a principle that poses inherent dangers to Beijing. It was little West Berlin that, merely by being free, helped bring down the mighty (as it seemed at the time) Honecker regime in East Germany in 1989. The Chinese supreme leader, Xi Jinping, isn’t about to let that happen to him via Hong Kong.

Then again, maybe he shouldn’t be so worried. Throughout the 1980s the free world was politically united and morally confident: It believed in its liberal-democratic values, in their universality, and in the immorality of those who sought to abridge or deny them.

It also wasn’t afraid to speak out. When Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union “the focus of evil in the modern world,” one prominent liberal writer denounced him as “primitive.” But it was such rhetoric that gave courage to dissidents and dreamers on the other side of the wall. What’s really primitive is to look upon the oppression of others and, whether out of deficient sympathy or excessive sophistication, remain silent.

Compare the free world then with what it is today. “I’m sure they’ll be able to work it out,” was just about all Donald Trump could bring himself to say about the Hong Kong protests during a press conference on Wednesday with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda. As clarion moments in U.S. moral leadership go, “Ich bin ein Berliner” it was not.

Trump and Duda are two of the more prominent champions of the new populist nationalism, which believes in butting out of the affairs of others so they may butt out of yours. Trump has applied the principle widely, from Saudi Arabia’s treatment of gadfly journalists to North Korea’s treatment of everybody. It’s the right-wing version of the left’s cultural relativism, always asking: “Who are we to judge?”"

"House Panel Votes For Contempt For Barr, Ross As Justice Dept.

Holds Back Documents

Updated at 5:53 p.m. ET

The separation-of-powers standoff between Congress and the executive branch deepened on Wednesday over a dispute about access to materials involving the controversial citizenship question planned for the 2020 census.

The Justice Department notified the House oversight committee that it's withholding documents sought by the panel's chairman because it says they're shielded by executive privilege — the doctrine that permits an administration to conceal some of its internal workings.

The letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd arrived electronically at the Capitol at the same time Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had convened a hearing at which the committee debated whether to find Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress.

After a day's worth of discussion and amendments, it did, voting 24 to 15 by the late afternoon on contempt for the Cabinet officials.

Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., who has lately stepped up his criticism of Trump, broke with Republicans to support the measure.

The dispute over documents

Boyd's letter blamed Cummings for the administration's invocation of privilege.

The Justice Department has already provided tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses but nothing is ever enough, officials say — and Democrats' threats of contempt meant these talks can't continue.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said after the Oversight Committee contempt vote made no sense.

""The committee's attempt to define the Department of Justice's good-faith cooperation as 'contempt' defies logic,"" she said. ""Today's action by Chairman Cummings and his committee undermines Congress's credibility with the American people.""

The Justice Department has provided Congress with tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses on the census matter, Kupec said, over months of prior negotiations.

Cummings and the Democrats blame Barr, Ross and the administration for what they've called an effort to ""stonewall"" their investigation.

Critics argue that Trump's administration wants to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to suppress some responses, including those of Latinos, and Democrats say they want unredacted communications to see how the question was discussed inside the government.

""The census is critical to our democracy and our constituents,"" Cummings said. ""We must protect the integrity of the Census, and we must stand up for Congress' authority under the Constitution to conduct meaningful oversight.

The action in the committee on Wednesday followed a vote by the full House on Tuesday authorizing chairmen such as Cummings to file civil contempt lawsuits in order to try to obtain testimony or evidence.

That's what may happen now following the oversight committee session on Wednesday: Cummings, with the assent of the House leadership, could file suit and ask a judge to order Barr and Ross to provide the census materials he wants.

Republicans have criticized Democrats' litigation strategy as a waste of taxpayer dollars given the court costs involved and also as a dangerous road for the House. If members of Congress file suit but lose, Republicans warn, they could harm the oversight powers of the House over the long term."

Perhaps none have been so brazen, or so seemingly corrupt, as Attorney General William Barr’s latest move to avoid scrutiny.

On Tuesday, House Democrats passed a civil enforcement resolution that effectively holds Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress. The vote came 24 hours after House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., reversed his planned contempt vote against Barr after reaching a last-minute deal with the Department of Justice to hand over some underlying materials from special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. With Tuesday’s vote, congressional committee chairs can now enforce subpoenas in court if their requests go ignored.

Barr responded to Tuesday’s vote by again threatening to withhold documents requested by Congress — but in a totally unrelated case.

The House Oversight Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for refusing to provide documents related to the 2020 census in response to congressional subpoenas. In a blatant attempt to stop this oversight effort, the Justice Department on Tuesday threatened to withhold the documents on its efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, by fair means or foul, unless House Democrats abandon their vote to hold Barr and Ross in contempt.

In a Tuesday letter to Oversight Committee chair Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd demanded that the committee halt the issuing of the subpoenas and delay its contempt vote until Trump makes a determination on the materials the committee wants. Boyd argued that the requested documents are covered by either deliberative process privilege, attorney-client privilege or by the ""attorney work product"" component of executive privilege.

""The Committee has failed to abide by the constitutionally mandated accommodation process by declining to negotiate over the scope of the subpoenaed materials or to recognize legitimate executive branch interest, as well as by its premature decision to schedule a contempt vote,"" Boyd wrote in the letter. In other words, the DOJ’s claim of privilege appears to depend on Cummings' behavior, not on objective questions of law or fact.

According to Tuesday’s letter, Barr intends to seek a privilege assertion not just for the DOJ documents, but also for Commerce Department documents covered by the committee’s subpoena.

The requested documents are related to the Trump administration’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, which Democrats argue was added to trigger newly drawn congressional districts that would boost Republicans electorally. A report released last week found that the census could undercount more than 4 million people, particularly in Latino and African American communities.

""We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation, but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress,"" Cummings said in a statement announcing the planned contempt vote.

""They produced none of the documents we asked for, they made no counter-offers regarding these documents, and they seem determined to continue the Trump administration’s cover-up,"" he added.

The DOJ’s threat is nothing more than a delay tactic — as evidenced by a similar move Barr pulled with Nadler’s committee — but ironically, the attorney general's contempt for Congress is shown in his tactics to avoid being formally accused of contempt of Congress.

Barr’s DOJ is no longer even pretending to be an independent, non-political department; still less pretending to respect Congress' role as a co-equal branch of government with an oversight role.

Barr's defense against Congress asking him to do his job is to threaten to do even less of his job. His argument against oversight essentially amounts to: “If the House continues to ponder holding me in contempt, I will continue to obstruct justice and perform more contemptuous acts.”

Executive privilege has a role. It is meant to protect the intimate conversations of the president with his advisers and top-level cabinet officials. The Trump administration, with its latest request, is attempting to apply privilege to documents written before Trump even took office. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision in the 1974 U.S. v. Nixon case — which led directly to a president's resignation — supposedly settled this issue. Assertions of executive privilege beyond the scope of that decision would seem to be blatant obstruction of justice. That's exactly where we are."
"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

""If we continue business as usual, it's catastrophic,"" said Reilly, who led the agency under President George H.W. Bush. ""We're the number two emitter in the world after China.""

Whitman, a former New Jersey governor who ran the EPA under President George W. Bush, raised concerns about ""the disrespecting of science in the administration and the undermining of science and the importance of science.""

Thomas said his old boss, President Ronald Reagan, would have wanted the agency to recommit to its central purpose.

""Change the direction, change the management and go back to the mission of the agency. That's what I think President Reagan would say, 'That's not how I want this agency to operate,'"" Thomas said.

The trio spoke with ABC News before a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing Tuesday on the direction of the EPA, which was created in 1970 by Republican President Richard Nixon to protect the human health and the environment. Former Obama administration EPA chief Gina McCarthy also testified.

Asked to grade the performance of the current EPA leadership, led by Administrator Andrew Wheeler, the three Republicans agreed on ""D"" or ""a little lower.""

""You need an agency that is credible, has consistency in its rule making and is science-based,"" said Thomas, who lamented a steady exodus of career employees from the EPA because of disillusionment with its current direction.

When ABC News Live spoke with Wheeler earlier this year, he insisted that the agency remains focused on its core purpose but is balancing other economic priorities. He said he does not believe climate change is a ""hoax,"" as President Donald Trump has insisted, but also does not think it's the ""crisis"" many environmentalists make it out to be.

""That's an unfair characterization,"" said Reilly of Wheeler's position, noting that the agency's own National Climate Assessment has painted a dire picture of the situation.

""The Green New Deal did something really wonderful,"" he said. ""I am told by so many Republican members of Congress that they are never asked about climate when they go on the stump. And now, they're asked. That is marvelous. It's put it on the agenda.""

Whitman agreed.

""For the first time in my memory, an environmental issue is going to be a major part of a political campaign for the presidency,"" she said. ""I haven't seen that before, and it's not going to go away, and that's good.""

State Department Defends Saudi Arms Sales Before Hostile House Panel,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Catie Edmondson', 'Edward Wong']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/arms-sales-saudi-arabia.html,"WASHINGTON — A senior State Department official on Wednesday defended the Trump administration’s use of an emergency declaration to push through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, telling a hostile House committee that holding back the weapons would have offered an opening to commercial rivals in China and Russia.

In a contentious hearing, lawmakers from both parties pressed R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state in the bureau of political-military affairs, to detail when the administration first developed the plan to declare an emergency and sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Congress’s will.

Lawmakers are outraged by the decision by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late May to use a loophole in the Arms Export Control Act to push through more than $8 billion worth of weapons sales, almost all to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The two countries are leading an air war against rebels in Yemen that has resulted in a humanitarian disaster and thousands of civilian deaths, many of them children. In both chambers, bipartisan groups of lawmakers are already moving to block the sales, many of which Democrats had informally held up since last year.

Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee asked whether the emergency declaration was being discussed within the administration when Mr. Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan briefed legislators in a closed-door meeting on threats posed by Iran, which took place three days before Mr. Trump declared the emergency on May 24."
"Kamala Harris: If elected, my DOJ would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-if-president-doj-would-have-no-choice-but-to-charge-trump,"2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.

Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and Harris was emphatic in saying the DOJ should pursue them.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said on this week’s NPR Politics Podcast.

The former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney cited the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions.

“I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor,” Harris said. “Well, I’ll tell you one of the reasons – I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.”

Harris is not the first high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump -- but he should face criminal charges once out of office.

Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told colleagues last week: “I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.”

REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: PELOSI MENTIONED TRUMP IMPRISONMENT TO ‘KEEP IMPEACHMENT ZEALOTS IN LINE’

Trump reacted to this by calling Pelosi ""a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., however, had no problem with Pelosi's remarks.

""I don’t have any difficulty with those words,"" Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday,"" comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired ""lock her up"" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton. A 2018 New York Times report also said that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton, as well as former FBI Director James Comey.

Joining the chorus of Democrats hinting that prosecuting Trump might be appropriate was another 2020 candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be ""carried out in handcuffs"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.

Asked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said “no one is above the law” while leaving the question open.

“To be very blunt, if my attorney general at the Department of Justice finds that there is probable cause that a law has been broken by anyone, I expect him to hold the alleged offender accountable no matter who they are or what title they’ve held in the past,” he said. “I’m not going to be a president that undermines the independence of the DOJ or the judiciary in a way that I’ve seen this administration do.”

The Energy 202: 'Just do your jobs': Ex-EPA chiefs go off on Trump administration,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'June At Am']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/06/12/the-energy-202-just-do-your-jobs-ex-epa-chiefs-go-off-on-trump-administration/5d00011a1ad2e55f2de7c082/,"THE LIGHTBULB

""Afraid."" ""Concerned."" Or just plan ticked off.

That is what past leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency said they felt when they think about the direction the agency has taken under President Trump.

Four former EPA chiefs — three Republicans and one Democrat — spent Tuesday criticizing the EPA's shrinking size and ambition in testimony on Capitol Hill, saying the agency has moved away from its core duties under Trump, The Post's Brady Dennis and I reported.

“I’m deeply concerned that five decades of environmental progress are at risk because of the attitude and approach of the current administration” Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the agency during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

""Climate change is real, and the administration is abdicating its responsibilities by denying it,"" added Whitman, once the governor of the coastal state of New Jersey.

Similar worries dominated the testimony of Gina McCarthy, who led the EPA during the final years of the Obama administration and has been an outspoken critic of the current one.

Like Whitman, McCarthy bemoaned the exodus of longtime EPA employees and what she calls the sinking morale of many career staffers. She and others raised questions about whether the Trump administration is adequately relying on science to drive its policy decisions, and said the White House is ignoring the threat of climate change amid an aggressive push to scale back environmental regulations.

And for McCarthy, the Trump administration is in the process of rolling back her own work.

“I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and it’s not to weep about all my precious rules being rolled back. Although I admit that the constant roll back is beginning to tick me off a bit,"" McCarthy said. ""Maybe even more than just a bit.""

""I’m here to remind the political leadership at the EPA that what they do matters, and it’s time for them to step up and to do their jobs. Just do your jobs,"" she continued, adding the current EPA seemed to value lowering costs to industry more than safeguarding public health.

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment on the testimony. Earlier this year, the agency touted its work during the first two years under Trump, highlighting dozens of deregulatory actions and saying that it had “continued to deliver on its promise to provide greater regulatory certainty while protecting public health and the environment.”

The Hill hearing was intended to “address the mission and future” of the agency, according to Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the committee chairman. It comes after seven past EPA chiefs, representing Republican and Democratic administrations, wrote to House lawmakers in April, offering Congress help with oversight of the agency.

“We are united that there has never been a more important time for us to put aside our differences and advocate collectively for public health and the environment,” they wrote in the letter, which was first reported by E&E News.

The letter was signed by the EPA’s first administrator, William Ruckelshaus, a Republican who also has been critical of the Trump administration’s approach, as well as a host of other past leaders.

The ex-EPA chiefs, who served under Reagan, Obama and both Bushes, pressed Congress to use its oversight power to rein in the current deregulatory push and to ensure the EPA relies on science over politics in its actions. House Democrats who invited the former officials echoed their concerns and promised they are already looking into the rollback of air and chemical rules.

“The four former administrators with us this morning truly know what is at stake and how to accomplish EPA’s mission,” Pallone said.

Some Republicans on the committee criticized McCarthy’s management of the EPA for what they saw as exceeding her authority, pointing to the EPA’s efforts to drastically slash emissions from coal-fired power plants.

“Under her leadership, I think the EPA went rogue,” Rep. David B. McKinley (R-W.Va.) said.

Other Republicans emphasized how often their constituents, many of whom are rural farmers, have to contend with difficult-to-understand regulations on pesticides and fertilizers. And at times, the former administrators acknowledged the challenges of making the public understand their work.

“It’s not an accident that the president can say the kind of things he said about wanting to break up EPA into little bits,” said former administrator William Reilly, who served under George H.W. Bush.

But Reilly still expressed apprehension with what he sees as the pro-industry direction the agency has taken, with its revisions to Obama-era air pollution rules on mercury and methane.

He noted that while the EPA needs to consider the ""economic impact"" of its actions, ""the environment and health come first.""

Lee Thomas, a Republican who led the EPA from 1985 to 1989, compared the current EPA management to the tenure of Anne Gorsuch Burford — Reagan’s controversial first EPA administrator.

Burford, the mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, resigned amid sharp budget cuts, a rift between political and career staff and a scandal over mismanagement of the Superfund cleanup program.

“EPA in 1983 was in the middle of chaos and turmoil,” Thomas said. “There were six different congressional committees that were investigating what was going on at EPA … There was a deregulatory agenda. There was an attack on science at many levels.”

“All that sound familiar?” he added. “ Well there’s an awful lot of that going on today.”

POWER PLAYS

— 2020 watch: Joe Biden told a Greenpeace activist he supports having a climate-focused presidential debate. “We should,” Biden said when asked on a ropeline after a speech in Iowa. “I think that’s what we should be doing. …Yeah, I’m all in. Take a look at what I’m talking about – and by the way, the first climate change plan in the history of the Congress? Biden.”

The context: “Biden has been at pains to emphasize his devotion to climate action, especially since an aide was quoted as saying Biden would take a ‘middle road’ to fighting climate change — a characterization he strongly disputes,” The Post’s David Weigel reports. Biden’s remarks make him the 15th Democratic candidate to endorse a climate debate.

Meanwhile: The chair of the Democratic National Committee defended his decision not to hold a single-issue debate. He called climate change an “urgent threat” and insisted he’s “confident that climate change will receive more attention than ever before — and deservedly so.” But he said “[t]o amend these rules now, after having enforced them throughout this primary process, would be putting our thumb on the scale,” he said in a post on Medium. “If we change our guidelines at the request of one candidate who has made climate change their campaign’s signature issue, how do we say no to the numerous other requests we’ve had?”

In response: Democratic contender and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who is running on a climate change platform, said the DNC “won’t recognize the climate crisis as an existential threat, but instead has chosen to treat it as a pet issue of one candidate.”

Trump in Iowa: While speaking at the Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy in Council Bluffs, the president touted his work on ethanol while taking a jab at Biden. “I fought very hard for ethanol,” Trump told the audience. “Under the previous administration, our leaders rejected American energy and they rejected ethanol.""

Biden fires back: The former vice president criticized the Trump administration’s tariffs between the United States and China, which he said “crushed” the state’s farmers, during remarks in Iowa, The Post’s Matt Viser, John Wagner and Jenna Johnson report. “[Trump] thinks he’s being tough,” Biden said. “Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain.”

Biden's legacy on ethanol: The ex-vice president ""was considered instrumental in orchestrating the blending cuts as a way to help struggling refineries on the East Coast deal with rising compliance costs under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard,” per Reuters. “A federal court struck down the cuts in 2016. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has yet to make the biofuel industry whole for the lost gallons despite repeated promises to do so.”

— It'll be harder for China to choke the U.S. of “rare earth” minerals than it thinks: Amid escalating trade tensions between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, China is threatening to hold these minerals hostage as retaliation. The elements are linchpins of many high-tech products such as wind turbines, electric vehicles and nuclear reactors. And China’s share of global production was at more than 97 percent in 2010, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

But: According to The Post's David J. Lynch, the U.S. economy is more resilient to such a rare-earth ban than it appears. New mines in California, Australia and Myanmar have shrunk China's production share to 71 percent last year. And any embargo won't be foolproof, with rogue operations in China last year producing an estimated 60,000 tons of rare earths.

— Democratic chair wants an explanation for the suppression of congressional testimony on climate: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) sent letters to the State Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence demanding more information about the White House’s suppression of written testimony about “possibly catastrophic” consequences of climate change. The Post first reported last week that the White House blocked a State Department intelligence agency from submitting written testimony to Schiff’s committee about the national security threat from human-driven global warming. “

If these reports are accurate, I applaud your Bureau for standing by its analysts and the integrity of its analysts and the integrity of their work in the face of political pressure, but the Committee remains gravely concerned about the events surrounding [bureau senior analyst Rod Schoonover]’s withheld written testimony,” he wrote in the letter to State Assistant Secretary Ellen McCarthy, who oversees the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research.

Schiff’s demand: The chairman called for details about communications with the White House on any review process for the written testimony as well as testimony from McCarthy or other officials to explain the basis for Schoonover’s analysis.

He reportedly agreed to the interview because he thought it was with his hometown newspaper, the Glenwood Springs Post Independent. He spoke briefly about climate change and about national parks, mentioning that he recently saw structures in Acadia National Park that are “literally crumbling.” “You may go look at a campground and charcoal grills are falling down, the amenities don’t work, the water doesn’t turn on when you turn it on,” Bernhardt said, telling the publication he’s hoping to address park maintenance by raising entry fees and visitor costs.

— Adrift in the Arctic: This fall, scientists will launch the largest Arctic research expedition ever, to document how climate change is affecting the fastest-warming region on Earth, as The Post’s Sarah Kaplan reports from Utqiagvik, Alaska. “What the scientists discover during their year in the frozen north will help them forecast the future of the entire planet,” she writes. “Struggling on the sea ice off Alaska during their training this April, they get a taste of how tough the task will be. They are steeling themselves for what awaits at the pole: profound isolation and protracted darkness, laborious experiments, cold that can plunge to 45 degrees below zero. There are countless ways the Arctic might thwart and threaten them at every turn.”

By the numbers: It will take one year and $134 million and will be part of a 17-nation project. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, a 387-foot research station, is scheduled to launch on Sept. 20 and will see a rotating set of 300 meteorologists, biologists, oceanographers and ice experts.

— A “new climate regime”: A study published this week in the journal Earth’s Future warned about a “new climate regime” with “extraordinary” heat waves, The Post’s Jason Samenow reports. He points to heat waves that killed hundreds and hospitalized thousands across the Northern Hemisphere last summer, a pattern that may be part of a new normal. “The study’s modeling analysis, conducted by researchers in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, found heat events like last summer’s do ‘not occur in historical simulations’ and ‘were unprecedented prior to 2010,’ ” he adds. “As the climate warms, the study projects that the area affected by heat waves like last summer’s will increase 16 percent for every 1.8 degrees (1 Celsius) of warming.”

Explainer: Can Trump use executive privilege to block congressional probes?,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jan', 'Min Read']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-privilege-explainer/explainer-can-trump-use-executive-privilege-to-block-congressional-probes-idUSKCN1TD2LE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Like numerous U.S. presidents before him, Donald Trump has invoked the legal doctrine known as executive privilege to try to block congressional investigators from getting access to certain documents and witnesses they are seeking.

Trump has cited executive privilege twice so far as part of his effort to stonewall Congress on its multiple inquiries into his presidency, finances and businesses. The Republican president has called the Democratic-led investigations “presidential harassment.” In an unusual move, he is even suing to try to stop the release of some material lawmakers have sought.

Trump turned to executive privilege for a second time on Wednesday to keep under wraps documents on adding a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. census, defying a Democratic-led House of Representatives committee’s subpoena.

Trump first invoked it in May to block House Democrats from getting an unredacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election to boost Trump’s candidacy.

Here is how executive privilege works and how useful it might be to Trump as the investigations close in on him.

WHAT IS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE?

Executive privilege is a legal principle that allows a president to refuse to comply with demands for information such as congressional subpoenas or Freedom of Information Act requests. The doctrine is generally used to keep private the nature of conversations a president has with advisers, or internal discussions among executive branch officials.

The idea is that the White House operates more effectively if a president and his aides can engage in private, candid conversations, without worrying about public scrutiny.

HOW DID THE DOCTRINE ORIGINATE?

Executive privilege is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the Constitution, the foundation of U.S. law. But the Supreme Court has said that it is “fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.” This separation of powers involves assigning different authority to the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the federal government.

The first use of executive privilege, although it did not carry that name at the time, may have been President Thomas Jefferson’s refusal in 1807 to provide evidence in a treason prosecution against his former vice president, Aaron Burr. In the end, a judge ordered Jefferson to produce the evidence, which Burr said would exonerate him, and Burr was acquitted.

The term executive privilege was not used until the 1950s. The doctrine’s contours were unclear until a 1974 Supreme Court ruling. In the case U.S. v. Nixon, President Richard Nixon was ordered to deliver tapes and other subpoenaed materials to a federal judge for review. The justices ruled 9-0 that a president’s right to privacy in his communications must be balanced against the authority of Congress to investigate and oversee the executive branch.

The U.S. v. Nixon ruling is also widely understood to mean that executive privilege cannot be used to cover up wrongdoing. That view was endorsed by current U.S. Attorney General William Barr during his Senate confirmation hearing.

One lesson of U.S. v. Nixon is that an executive privilege claim is particularly weak when Congress has invoked its power to remove a president from office through impeachment, University of Missouri School of Law professor Frank Bowman said. In the impeachment context, “virtually no part of a president’s duties or behavior is exempt from scrutiny,” Bowman added.

Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all invoked executive privilege in response to congressional investigations. But compared with previous presidents, recent ones have hesitated to claim executive privilege, in part because of how Nixon used it, said Mitchel Sollenberger, a politics professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump gestures to news media outside the Oval Office as he returns to the White House after visiting Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, U.S., May 23, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo

“Once you do an executive privilege claim, it becomes a politically charged event,” Sollenberger said. “The media sees that, and it flares up quickly.”

HOW DOES CONGRESS COMBAT AN EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CLAIM?

If U.S. lawmakers are seeking testimony from officials, a House or Senate committee can vote to hold them in contempt of Congress and then go to court and ask a judge to issue an order forcing compliance. The judge would then decide the merits of an executive privilege claim. Likewise, lawmakers can also sue in court to seek access to documents on which the president has asserted executive privilege."
Treasury Department finalizes rule to stop Democratic states’ tax workaround,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/treasury-department-finalizes-rule-stop-democratic/,"The Treasury Department released its final rules Tuesday outlawing the push by Democrat-led states to undermine the GOP’s new tax law, saying that donating to state-run charities isn’t a substitute for paying federal taxes.

A number of high-tax states had balked after the tax changes President Trump signed in 2017 limited how much state and local taxes could be written off on federal returns.

New York, California and New Jersey all explored new laws allowing residents to make some of their state tax payments as contributions to charities, figuring that would be an end-run around the federal changes, since charitable contributions are still fully deductible.

But the feds said that violated the spirit of the law and they are shutting it down.

They said a longstanding principle of tax law is that someone who gets something of value in exchange for a donation to charity can only deduct the net value of the donation.

The new rule “applies that principle, known as the quid pro quo principle, to state tax benefits provided to a donor in return for contributions,” Treasury said.

That means if someone donated $1,000 to a state charity and the state gives a $700 tax credit for the donation, the taxpayer can only take a federal write-off on the remaining $300, since the taxpayer already got $700 of value.

Rep. Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat and one of the most vocal critics of the GOP’s tax overhaul, blasted the IRS rules.

“This Trump administration seems to wake up in the morning trying to think up ways to screw my state,” he said, saying the move undermines New Jersey’s workaround.

“This isn’t over,” he vowed.

The IRS had proposed the rules earlier, and Tuesday’s announcement was a finalization of the rule.

Limiting state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $10,000 for a married couple filing jointly was a major part of the GOP’s tax overhaul. While income tax rates were lowered, the new law imposed caps or did away with a number of deductions.

The SALT limits struck particularly hard at wealthier people with expensive homes, who pay high property taxes.

Republicans said high-tax states had been benefitting unfairly, since residents wrote off a larger share of their tax burden. That meant those states were powering their spending at the expense of federal taxpayers.

GOP lawmakers said the answer was for those states to cut their taxes.

The states, though, had other ideas.

Several of them sued, arguing the rules were discriminatory. Some sought the workarounds.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pascrell and other Democrats from those high-tax states rushed to introduce legislation repealing the SALT limits, in a move that would have amounted to a new tax cut for wealthier Americans.

That legislation has not gained traction on Capitol Hill.

"T-Mobile, Sprint vow to fight state AGs if they get DOJ approval",https://www.foxbusiness.com,"['Lydia Moynihan', 'Charles Gasparino']",,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/t-mobile-sprint-vow-to-fight-state-ags-if-they-get-doj-approval,"T-Mobile US. Inc., and Sprint Corp., are prepared to fight the 10 state attorneys general suing to block their $26 billion merger if the U.S. Department of Justice approves the deal, FOX Business Network has learned.

Continue Reading Below

The coalition of state AGs led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California’s Xavier Beccera filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to stop the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing the merger would reduce the number of major wireless carriers to three from four, and possibly lead to higher prices for consumers. The move briefly upended the negotiations between the companies and the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, which had been making progress toward a possible solution.

But on Wednesday, officials from T-Mobile and Sprint both resumed their consultation with the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, and importantly, developed a legal strategy to fight the state AG lawsuit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

That strategy is to proceed with attempting to convince the DOJ to approve the deal, and if that happens, fight what the companies believe is a long-shot attempt to block the merger by the states, these people said. The companies believe that even if a court issues an injunction to block the deal, the state case is weakened by the fact it was filed before the DOJ finished its discussions with the companies about their agreement to make further concessions to address antitrust concerns, they added.

Press officials from T-Mobile and Sprint had no comment. A DOJ spokesman also declined comment. A spokesman for the New York Attorney General had no immediate comment.

Even with the latest twist to hit the merger, officials at T-Mobile and Sprint believe a final decision from the DOJ’s Antitrust Division could come by next week.

In their negotiations with the DOJ, T-Mobile and Sprint have discussed concessions including selling wireless spectrum and additional businesses outside the Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid service. The companies agreed to sell Boost, build out their rural network, and not raise wireless prices for three years in order to receive approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the merger to proceed.

The state attorneys general ""saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued."" Peter Adderton, founder of Boost

The Trump administration has made the development of fifth-generation wireless networks, also known as 5G, both a national security and an economic objective. The development of such super-fast wireless networks are expected to be an economic boom, adding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product. The companies have also argued that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be better able to compete on price with wireless heavyweights AT&T and Verizon and gain ground in the area of 5G.

But DOJ staffers are eager to nix the merger on the grounds that fewer major carriers will lead to higher prices—the same argument made by the state AGs. They can be overruled by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, who is said to be officially undecided but may be warming to the companies’ argument that the merger would not lead to high prices, particularly, after additional concessions are agreed upon.

Progress toward forming a set of concessions may be behind the state lawsuit, according to Boost founder Peter Adderton. The state AGs “saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued,” Adderton said Tuesday in an interview with FOX Business.

Another theory for the lawsuit is that the “states just got frustrated with the slowness of the process at DOJ,” said Craig Moffett of MoffetNathanson Research. “There’s a fair amount of pressure on DOJ to end this process,” he added.

An antitrust lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the state AGs' announcement may signal the DOJ is looking to approve the deal. “The state AGs want to get ahead of the DOJ decision… and undermine whatever action [the Department of] Justice is going to take."" However, a ruling with concessions could “take the wind out of the state AG’s sails,” this person told FOX Business.

Another possibility is the DOJ is looking to file its own suit and the state AGs want to deny the Trump administration a pro-consumer victory by launching their lawsuit first.

In filing their lawsuit, the attorneys general blindsided Delharim and his staff, which wasn’t notified of the filing, this person added. Officials at the DOJ’s Antitrust Division were recently in negotiations to appease the state attorneys general and prevent state legal action from taking place.

FOX Business has also learned that the AGs are attempting to recruit other states to create the strongest possible case that might find a sympathetic judge to block the deal, or delay it indefinitely through an injunction. “If the states win their injunction, it’s not a slam dunk but it could make the merger messy,” Moffett notes, adding that an injunction could prevent the deal from closing, forcing one or both of the parties to walk away.

Still, legal experts say the states face an uphill battle in looking to kill the merger if the DOJ approves it.

Not only do states have fewer resources than the feds, they also have a higher bar to meet to prove their case: They must show the merger would cause “irreparable harm” whereas the FCC’s “general interest” paradigm and the DOJ’s mandate to keep markets competitive are much broader and less restricting, experts say.

As the telecom deal continues to face opposition, some on Wall Street are looking at what may happen if the companies call it quits. In an unusual provision, T-Mobile is not required to pay Sprint the agreed upon $600 million break-up fee if Sprint’s debt doesn’t meet minimum credit ratings from the three major bond-rating services.

Sprint’s debt must have at least a “B-2” bond rating from Moody’s Investors Service, a “B” rating from S&P Global and “B-plus” from Fitch Ratings.

Sprint is the smallest of the major wireless carriers, and its finances are considered the most suspect contributing to a stock price that is just above penny-stock levels. Ironically, its shaky finances could help the deal gain approval; Delrahim told FOX Business in an April interview that he was considering the so-called “failing firm defense,” meaning he was weighing the argument made by company officials that if Sprint wasn’t purchased by T-Mobile it might fall into bankruptcy and the number of wireless carriers would be reduced."
Homeland Security’s Jeanette Manfra is coming to Disrupt SF – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/jeanette-manfra-disrupt-sf/,"We can’t talk cybersecurity without hearing from the government.

We’re thrilled to announce Homeland Security Assistant Director Jeanette Manfra, a senior executive at the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), will be at Disrupt SF.

Manfra is one of the federal government’s most experienced cybersecurity civil servants. She currently leads CISA’s cybersecurity efforts in protecting and strengthening the country’s most important infrastructure, like the power grid and water supplies. A decade-long government career professional, she previously served as acting deputy under secretary for cybersecurity at the National Protection and Programs Directorate, a division of Homeland Security dedicated to protecting government networks and critical infrastructure, later absorbed by CISA after the agency was created by President Trump in November 2018.

Prior to Homeland Security, Manfra served in the U.S. Army as a communications specialist and a military intelligence officer.

For years, cybersecurity warfare was somewhat limited to governments attacking governments. But the threat landscape has changed, and the new battleground is both in government and in the private sector.

Now under one roof, CISA acts as the nation’s cybersecurity risk adviser — working closely with government departments to protect federal systems and networks, and private industry to advise and warn on ongoing and emerging threats.

The agency has recently doubled down on its efforts to ensure election security, as well as risks to the U.S. supply chain.

Cybersecurity is one of those universal topics that affects every consumer, business, enterprise and government. We’re excited to talk shop with Manfra about the state of the security union.

Cheaper summer gas in Allegheny County continues as EPA extends fuel waiver,https://triblive.com,['Jacob Tierney'],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/cheaper-summer-gas-in-allegheny-could-be-here-to-stay-as-epa-extends-waiver/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

The federal Environmental Protection Agency has extended an emergency waiver that will keep gas costs lower in Allegheny County.

State and federal regulations have long required the county to sell a low-polluting, more expensive blend of gas during the summer.

However, due to damage to the Buckeye Partners Laurel Products Pipeline, the federal Environmental Protection Agency last month waived this requirement until June 17 because of fuel shortage concerns.

On Wednesday the EPA issued an extension until July 1.

The cross-state pipeline was damaged May 20 after a release of water near Pittsburgh during scheduled maintenance and testing, according to the company.

Meanwhile, Allegheny County is on the brink of removing the summer gas requirement entirely. Since modern cars don’t pollute as much as older models, state officials saw the regulation as no longer necessary.

Last year the state and EPA lifted the requirement for Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties.

The change is taking longer in Allegheny County, which has to go through extra steps because it manages its own air quality program.

The county and state have moved to repeal the regulation, and the EPA has tentatively agreed, but required an in-depth analysis to prove the change would not add pollution to the county.

The agency is expected to issue its final ruling this month.

‘Not above the law’: Executive privilege’s contentious history from Washington to Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ronald G. Shafer', 'June At Pm']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/06/12/not-above-law-executive-privileges-contentious-history-washington-trump/,"

Presidents long have fought to shield sensitive White House documents and discussions from congressional scrutiny by asserting executive privilege. (Andrew Harnik/AP)

Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to use the phrase “executive privilege” after refusing to allow his advisers to testify at a Senate hearing in May 1954. Eisenhower believed that what is said in the White House should stay in the White House.

“Any man who testifies as what he told me won’t be working for me that night,” the president said.

On Wednesday, President Trump asserted executive privilege to shield documents from Congress that would provide insight into the administration’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

[Trump asserts executive privilege to shield documents on census citizenship question]

It is the second time the president has invoked executive privilege. In May, he asserted it over special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report.

Executive privilege is “the right of the president and high-level executive branch officers to withhold information from Congress, the courts and ultimately the public,” according to Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. Executive privilege, Rozell wrote, can be used to protect national security and “the privacy of White House deliberations.”

The Constitution makes no mention of the concept of executive privilege. However, presidents from George Washington to Trump have resisted demands to share sensitive information with Congress. Some have succeeded. But over the past few decades, presidents have lost key court battles to withhold information.

It all began in 1792 when President George Washington declared that he didn’t have to provide internal documents demanded for a congressional investigation into a disastrous military loss by Maj. Gen. Arthur St. Clair to Native Americans. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton warned that in the future, Congress “might demand secrets of a very mischievous nature.” But Washington eventually turned over papers that “the public good would permit.”

In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson claimed he was exempt from a subpoena for him to testify at the trial of his former vice president Aaron Burr, who was charged with treason.

“Constantly trudging” to the trial in Richmond, he said, would prevent him from fulfilling his presidential duties. Chief Justice John Marshall, who was presiding over the trial, ruled that the president wasn’t exempt. Jefferson didn’t testify, but he did “voluntarily” provide documents sought by Burr, who was acquitted.

Presidential power expanded in 1833, when President Andrew Jackson refused a demand by the U.S. Senate to turn over a list of advisers with whom he consulted before moving money from the national bank to state banks. “I have yet to learn under what constitutional authority that a branch of the Legislature has a right to require of me an account of any communications,” Jackson responded. The Senate voted to censure Jackson, but it still didn’t get Old Hickory’s documents.

President Grover Cleveland “almost single-handedly restored and strengthened the power” of the presidency by his frequent use of executive privilege, according to Henry F. Graff, professor emeritus of history at Columbia University. After taking office in 1885, Cleveland declined to hand over documents to Congress “in the fight over presidential appointments,” Graff wrote.

In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt refused to give the Senate his administration’s papers about an antitrust prosecution of U.S. Steel Corp. To make sure senators didn’t get the documents, Roosevelt had them moved to the White House.

“The only way the Senate or the committee can get those papers now is through my impeachment,” he declared.

The clash over presidential confidentiality grew more intense when Eisenhower ordered his defense secretary not to allow Army officials to testify at hearings by Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) into alleged Communists in the Army. On May 17, 1954, Eisenhower wrote a letter that cited the need for advisers in the executive branch to be in the position “to be completely candid” in providing internal advice.

At a meeting before issuing the letter, Eisenhower said he had tried to stay out of the “damn business on the Hill.” But “I will not allow people around me to be subpoenaed.” McCarthy slammed the action as an “iron curtain,” but it was beginning of the end of his red-baiting hearings.

Eisenhower’s letter didn’t use the words “executive privilege,” but it soon established the practice under that name. The Eisenhower administration used executive privilege a record 44 times, raising concern that the president had too much power. It was Eisenhower’s onetime vice president who changed that perception.

In 1973, President Richard M. Nixon invoked executive privilege as president to try to stop a congressional order to release secret White House recordings that been revealed during Senate Watergate hearings. Nixon argued that “the special nature of tape recordings of private conversations is such that these principles [of executive privilege] apply with even greater force to tapes of private Presidential conversations than to Presidential papers.”

On July 24, 1974, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Nixon had to turn over the tapes. The justices upheld the right of executive privilege, but they ruled that this privilege couldn’t be used to withhold material sought for a criminal proceeding. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, whom Nixon had appointed, noted the precedent of the decision in the Burr trial that a president was “not above the law.”

“The decision establishes the legal duty of even a President to furnish evidence of what was said in conversations with his closest aides when relevant to the trial of a criminal cause,” wrote former Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

“Nixon went too far when he claimed executive privilege in an attempt to conceal evidence of White House wrongdoing,” said Rozell, the George Mason University dean. “His actions had the consequence of giving executive privilege a bad name.”

The Nixon precedent also turned out to be bad news for President Bill Clinton, who invoked executive privilege 14 times during the investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. In 1998, a federal judge ruled that Clinton couldn’t use the action to block questioning of his aides about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege six times. President Barack Obama took the action once in 2012, when his Justice Department refused to turn over documents sought by the Republican-controlled House for a “Fast and Furious” program to track guns. A negotiated settlement was reached in court just weeks ago after seven years, an indication of how long such disputes can take if litigated.

Trump’s assertion of executive privilege could wind up being resolved in the courts, as well. How long that takes is anyone’s guess.

In particular, Wyden said that Brent McIntosh, Trump's nominee to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, should not receive a hearing until Wyden receives answers to his information requests.

McIntosh is currently general counsel for Treasury, and his office has been involved in discussions about the request for Trump's tax returns.

""Mr. McIntosh was central to the Treasury Department’s decision making and without additional context on the process, committee members will not be able to ask informed questions,"" Wyden said.

Both Neal and Mnuchin expect the dispute to eventually be resolved in the courts.

Wyden in May sent letters to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, asking them about Treasury and IRS communications related to Neal's request, including communications made before Neal's initial request in anticipation of it. Earlier this month, Wyden sent another letter to Rettig, asking for information about a draft IRS memo prepared last fall that found that the agency had to comply with congressional tax committees' requests for returns unless executive privilege was invoked.

Treasury responded to Wyden's May letter to the department by saying that Neal's request was different than past congressional requests for tax returns, and by sending Wyden copies of Mnuchin's past correspondence with Neal and an annual report that the IRS prepares for the Joint Committee on Taxation about requests for tax return information. The IRS did not respond to Wyden's June 4 letter to the agency by the senator's June 11 deadline.

“In letters to Secretary Mnuchin and Commissioner Rettig, I asked a number of questions about compliance with congressional requests for tax return information. They included basic inquiries about whether the treasury secretary has been involved in compliance before and when political appointees learned of a memo prepared in advance of an expected congressional request for tax return information,"" Wyden said in a statement. ""I have received non-answers or no response at all, which is completely unacceptable.""

Wyden had also put a hold on Trump Treasury nominees in the past because he felt like the department was stonewalling his information requests.

For example, he had put a hold on Trump's nomination of Justin Muzinich to be deputy Treasury Secretary last summer but then lifted that hold in November after Treasury cooperated with several of his information requests. Muzinich was confirmed in December on a mostly party-line vote."
DOJ antitrust chief warns Big Tech that low prices or free products won't protect them,https://www.foxnews.com,['Christopher Carbone'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/doj-antitrust-big-tech-low-prices-free-products-wont-protect,"The Justice Department's assistant attorney general highlighted the antitrust case against Silicon Valley's major players during a Tuesday speech.

Makan Delrahim described a range of possible arguments against tech companies as his office takes the lead in probing Google and, possibly, Apple. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is overseeing inquiries into possible antitrust practices of Facebook and Amazon.

After discussing the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, the 1982 dissolution of AT&T into the ""Baby Bells"" and the government's successful monopoly case against Microsoft in 2001 – which arguably helped lay the foundation for the success of Google and Yahoo – Delrahim explained several arguments that could be made against the world's most powerful tech companies on antitrust grounds.

Offering Low Prices or Free Services

Critics have pointed out Amazon's undeniable power in the area of American e-commerce and its foray into the world of bricks-and-mortar retail, but the company's defenders note the consistently low prices it offers on a gigantic array of consumer goods. In addition, Facebook and Google offer a multitude of services for free.

WHY IS NANCY PELOSI IGNORING FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG?

But Delrahim said the Justice Department takes a much broader view.

""The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition. Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low,"" he said in his speech at the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference. ""It is well-settled, however, that competition has price and non-price dimensions.""

Besides price, ""diminished quality"" is a factor the Justice Department would consider.

""As an example, privacy can be an important dimension of quality. By protecting competition, we can have an impact on privacy and data protection. Moreover, two companies can compete to expand privacy protections for products or services, or for greater openness and free speech on platforms,"" Delrahim said.

Exclusive Agreements

Delrahim said the Antitrust Division has a history of investigating ""exclusive conduct"" under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.

""[Exclusivity agreements] also can be anticompetitive, however, where a dominant firm uses exclusive dealing to prevent entry or diminish the ability of rivals to achieve necessary scale, thereby substantially foreclosing competition,"" he said. ""This is true in digital markets as well.""

SOCIAL MEDIA CONTRIBUTES TO RADICALIZATION, TOP TWITTER EXEC SAYS

The Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft focused in part on that company's inclusion of its own browser in its Windows operating system, which the federal agency found discouraged users from seeking alternatives.

“This theory is broadly applicable to other technology markets,” Delrahim added.

CREEPY DEEPFAKE AI LETS YOU PUT WORDS INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH

Swallowing Up Competitors

Facebook and Google have gobbled up hundreds of other companies – some of them former competitors – over the last two decades. Delrahim indicated that this type of behavior could be considered anticompetitive.

“It is not possible to describe here each way that a transaction may harm competition in a digital market, but I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition is to block potential competitors, protect a monopoly, or otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation, or reducing quality,"" he said. ""Such circumstances may raise the Antitrust Division’s suspicions.”

According to The New York Times, Google has acquired at least 270 companies over nearly two decades, including YouTube, which was a competitor to Google Video; Waze, which competed with Google Maps; and DoubleClick, which had been the tech giant's chief advertising competitor.

Facebook has acquired 92 companies since 2007, including Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The Menlo Park, Calif. based company also bought and shut down other social networks, including Gowalla, Beluga and Nextstop, the Times reports.

Still, Delrahim said that acquisitions can be positive if they ""combine complementary technologies or bring products and services to market that would not have been made available to consumers otherwise.""

Although these investigations may take years to complete, Delrahim made it clear that the Justice Department is taking a serious look at Silicon Valley's main players.

""While antitrust is not a panacea for every policy challenge presented by the digital market, the Antitrust Division will not shrink from the critical work of investigating and challenging anticompetitive conduct and transactions where justified,"" he said. ""That is because where competition is harmed, consumers and markets lose with higher prices, lower quality, lower rate of innovation, less free speech and even lower privacy protections.""

House Intelligence panel requests documents after reports WH blocked climate change testimony,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/house-intelligence-state-department-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has requested documents from a State Department agency on the heels of reports that the White House blocked an official from submitting testimony on climate change.

Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a letter dated Tuesday to Ellen McCarthy, the assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, that his committee was left with ""deep concern"" that the Trump administration recently sought to bar the submission of written testimony from Rod Schoonover ""for political reasons."" Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department agency, testified before the House panel last week.

The Washington Post, citing several administration sources, reported that officials from several different White House offices took issue with Schoonover's prepared testimony in which he was going to warn Congress about wide-ranging and ""possibly catastrophic"" national security concerns as a result of human-caused climate change.

In his letter, Schiff said the administration ""repeatedly confirmed"" ahead of the June 5 hearing that Schoonover would submit written testimony, but that the evening before the hearing, the State Department informed the committee ""without explanation"" that the agency would not submit a written statement.

He said the House Intelligence Committee, ""in light of these reports of undue White House interference in testimony before the Committee,"" now requests testimony from McCarthy or ""an appropriate senior representative"" to address: Schoonover's testimony; communications with the White House about that written testimony; the prepared written testimony itself; and other documents relevant to the hearing and blocked testimony.

EPA: No plans to order cleanup at Coakley landfill,https://www.seacoastonline.com,"['Jeff Mcmenemy', 'Jeff Mcmenemy Jmcmenemy Seacoastonline.Com']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190612/epa-no-plans-to-order-cleanup-at-coakley-landfill,"GREENLAND�� A spokesperson for the Environmental Protection Agency said there are no immediate plans for the agency to order the Coakley Landfill Group to clean up contaminated water at the Superfund dump.

Kelsey Dumville, a senior community involvement coordinator for the EPA�s Boston Public Affairs Office, acknowledged this week that high levels of PFAS and 1,4-dioxane have been found in multiple monitoring wells at the now closed dump in Greenland and North Hampton. Both chemicals are suspected carcinogens.

There�s also been high levels of PFAS found in surface water in the nearby Berry�s Brook, the headwaters of which are adjacent the Superfund cleanup site.

�As far as PFAS and 1,4-dioxane within the scope of the site, it�s not moving offsite and it�s not impacting people,� Dumville said. �We don�t necessarily conduct treatment if there�s chemicals within the landfill.�

She said there have been other Superfund sites in the United States that have chemicals within the site that have not been treated. Asked if it were theoretically possible that the contamination on site could stay in Coakley forever, she said, �Yes, but EPA will continue to monitor it, that�s part of the Superfund process.�

Dumville stated several times this week that �it�s important to note like we have that nobody in the area is drinking contaminated water as a result of the landfill.�

But the CLG in 2018 was ordered to install private water treatment systems at a home and the Breakfast Hill Golf Course after 1,4-dioxane was found at both locations above the state�s new health standards. Before that, people in the home and at the golf course were exposed to 1,4-dioxane, which the EPA�s website describes as �a likely human carcinogen.�

�It is highly mobile and does not readily biodegrade in the environment,� an EPA fact sheet states about the chemical.

Dumville�s comments this week came after the EPA announced it will hold a public meeting on the Coakley landfill from 6 to 8 p.m. June 25 at the Bethany Church in Greenland.

The EPA�s Office of the Inspector General got an earful at its �listening session� last week in Greenland. Several speakers blasted the EPA for what they saw as its failure to force the Coakley Landfill Group (CLG) to clean up the toxic Superfund site. Others criticized the EPA for failing to respond nationally to PFAS contamination.

The CLG includes municipalities and private companies that used the dump. Portsmouth is responsible for the largest share of the remediation at 53.6%. The landfill accepted waste from 1972 to 1982 and then incinerator waste until 1985. It was capped in 1998.

Many people living around the landfill are concerned a plume of chemicals, including PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, will migrate from the site and contaminate their drinking water wells.

Mindi Messmer is an environmental scientist and former state representative who advocates for people living around the landfill to have access to safe, clean municipal water. She said it is �highly irresponsible� that the EPA does not have a plan to clean up the contaminated groundwater at Coakley.

�It is not acceptable for there to be no plan to deal with that,� Messmer said Tuesday.

She noted New Hampshire and other states are looking at setting �much more stringent� standards for PFAS chemicals �than the EPA has.� The EPA set a permanent health advisory for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at a combined 70 parts per trillion.

PFAS are man-made chemicals used in products worldwide since the 1950s, including firefighting foam, non-stick cookware and water-repellent fabrics. They also have a range of applications in the aerospace, aviation, automotive and electronics industries, among others. The Agency For Toxic Substances and Disease Registry states studies have shown PFAS exposure can increase cancer risks, lower birth weights, harm liver, thyroid and pancreas functions and increase cholesterol levels.

Messmer said despite the EPA�s assurances �there are people right now living near Coakley who are drinking water with higher levels of PFAS than other states say is safe. It�s irresponsible for the federal government to let these people pollute the environment and not have to clean it up.""

Former Portsmouth Mayor Eric Spear is chair of the CLG�s executive committee. He acknowledged there are high levels of PFAS and 1,4-dioxane in monitoring wells but only within the landfill�s boundaries. Asked when they would be cleaned up, Spear said, �At the end of the day, the task for the CLG like all Superfund groups is to fully cleanup the site.�

But it is up to the EPA how and when that cleanup will occur, he stressed. �We have to follow the EPA�s directives,� Spear said Wednesday.

�I think the number one mission for the CLG in the near term being certainly the next five years, our mission is to make sure that we�re following the dictates of the EPA so we protect public health,� Spear said.

He added he believes the network of monitoring wells will alert them if there�s any future migration of chemicals. �If you look at the map of the monitoring wells we have in place, we�re completely surrounded,� Spear said. �Everyone knows these chemicals are bad, that�s why they�re being monitored.�

�I think it�s unhelpful to create a lot of fear unnecessarily when the situation is being closely monitored,� he added.

Spear said he will attend the June 25 meeting in Greenland."
Protesters want to fly ‘Baby Trump’ balloon during the president’s Fourth of July address in Washington,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Marissa J. Lang', 'Local Reporter Focused On D.C.

The blimp known as “Baby Trump,” which has appeared at protests during the president’s visits to London, might be on its way to Washington for the July 4 festivities.

On Monday, activist group Code Pink became the first organization to request a protest permit from the National Park Service ahead of Trump’s planned overhaul of the city’s premier Fourth of July celebration. But organizers hope the screaming-baby balloon will be a sign of what’s to come that day: protests, and more of them.

The day will be busy as it is. More than a dozen other groups and individuals have requested space on the Mall that day — for activities that include making cards for troops, leading group meditations, selling books of poetry and preaching. They will join hundreds of thousands of Americans who annually head to the Mall to watch the fireworks.

District officials have expressed concern over how the president’s presence might affect visitors and the typically nonpartisan tenor of the celebration.

“It’s about the worst holiday he could have chosen,” D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) has said. “You never want to make events like this around a single person. This is the difference between the Soviet Union — the old Soviet Union — and the United States. Cults of personality are not how we operate in this country.”

Code Pink organizers said the decision to import the blimp originated around the time Trump announced he would hold a military parade in Washington last year. The parade was canceled amid questions about its impact and price tag, estimated to cost as much as $92 million.

Through online fundraising efforts that began in July 2018, Code Pink raised more than $10,000 to bring “Baby Trump” to the District.

[Perspective: A stain on the Lincoln Memorial]

“We’ve just switched our plans from the military parade to the Fourth of July,” Code Pink co-director Ariel Gold said. “We’re appalled that Trump is taking that day to spew his hateful and racist rhetoric . . . and we really hope this gets canceled, too.”

Code Pink is asking to fly “Baby Trump” over “any open grassy area nearest to [the] Lincoln Memorial,” according to a permit application filed with the Park Service. The group said it expects about 40 people — including its setup and teardown crews — to attend its protest.

The Park Service has permitted a protest-by-balloon before: In 2017, an inflatable 30-foot-tall chicken with a golden head of coifed hair meant to look like Trump’s was displayed on the Ellipse south of the White House.

No other protest organizers have requested a permit from the Park Service for July 4. Such requests are handled on a first-come, first-serve basis, Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said.

The U.S. Secret Service has not released details about the timing and duration of the president’s speech.

The White House declined to comment about the blimp or the day’s activities on the Mall.

Trump announced his plans to speak July 4 in a February tweet promising one of the biggest gatherings in Washington history, with a “major fireworks display, entertainment and an address by your favorite President, me.”

[Trump takes over Fourth of July celebration, changing its location and inserting himself into the program]

The Washington Post reported last month that the president was deeply involved in organizing changes to the annual event, which draws large crowds to the Mall each year.

Calling the program “A Salute to America,” Trump plans to address the nation from the Lincoln Memorial and move the fireworks to West Potomac Park. Federal agencies, including the Park Service and U.S. Park Police, have said they are working with the White House to determine the logistics of the day.

Litterst likened piecing the day’s events together to playing a giant game of Tetris.

“As long as everyone’s flexible, we do our best to accommodate the requests we get,” he said.

This month, House Democratic leaders — including Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) — wrote a letter to Trump, decrying his decision to place himself at the center of the July 4 festivities as something that “could create the appearance of a televised, partisan campaign rally on the Mall at public expense.”

Code Pink’s primary goal, Gold said, is to fly the “Baby Trump” balloon close to where the president will speak.

“We see it as an image of Trump’s behavior, which is, as we all know, unpredictable and prone to tantrums about things that are really, really dangerous,” she said. “It’s a way of saying, we really need an adult in the White House.”

USDA Cuts Projections for Corn Production to Four-Year Low After Wet Planting Season,https://www.wsj.com,['Kirk Maltais'],,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/usda-cuts-projections-for-corn-production-to-four-year-low-after-wet-planting-season-11560278067,"A key monthly report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed Tuesday the damage done by heavy rainfall in the Corn Belt, reducing expected corn production to its lowest in four years.

The wet weather this year prevented farmers from planting the crop on time, and the Agriculture Department cut its corn-production estimate to 13.68 billion bushels, down 9% from its May forecast.

Ethics group goes after Interior for sidestepping Senate when filling posts,https://thehill.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448141-ethics-group-goes-after-interior-for-sidestepping-senate-when,"An environmental group filed a complaint against the Department of the Interior on Tuesday, saying the agency shuffled controversial employees into roles without Senate confirmation.

A May 23 order from Interior Secretary David Bernhardt slotted people into various vacant roles that would normally require a nomination to the Senate.

Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) argued the agency is violating federal law on vacancies by “temporarily redelegating” roles to existing employees for the 27th time under the Trump administration.

PEER said some of those who took over positions that require confirmation by the Senate would be unlikely to get confirmed if officially nominated. ADVERTISEMENT

The group is especially focused on Karen Budd-Falen, who had sued Interior and the Bureau of Land Management numerous times as a lawyer in Wyoming.

PEER senior counsel Peter Jenkins said Budd-Falen is too controversial for approval by the Senate.

“Putting Karen Budd-Falen in this position is like putting Genghis Khan in charge of a day care center,” he said in a statement. “Since David Bernhardt knows Budd-Falen is so right wing that she could never be confirmed for the job he just gave her, this maneuver only underlines the Administration’s continuing contempt for the Senate’s constitutional advice and consent prerogative.”

Interior did not respond to a request for comment.

Budd-Falen was serving as deputy solicitor at Interior, a role that does not require Senate review. Bernhardt appointed her to the role of assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. Robert Wallace was recently nominated to take over that post — a role that has gone without a Senate-confirmed leader since 2011.

Wallace looks headed for likely confirmation given his support from Republicans, Democrats and some in the conservation community, but it’s not clear when the Senate may vote to confirm him.

PEER said the lack of Senate-confirmed leadership at Interior across multiple departments invalidates some agency decisions regarding Sage Grouse management. Their complaint asks the inspector general's office to remedy the issue by forcing Interior to reissue some decisions that were made by offices without an official leader."

"DOJ slams latest committee contempt vote, warns of retaliation",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/doj-slams-latest-committee-contempt-vote/,"The Justice Department warned Tuesday that it could retaliate against the House Oversight Committee should the panel vote this week to pursue contempt of Congress proceedings against Attorney General William P. Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.

Homeland Security watchdog retires early after his office was forced to retract ‘feel-good’ audits of disaster response,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-retires-early-after-his-office-was-forced-to-retract-feel-good-audits-of-disaster-response/2019/06/10/a370f488-8b9d-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"A house on Staten Island that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Sandy, shown in 2012. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."
State Department appoints special envoy to Sudan amid violence,https://thehill.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/international/africa/448279-state-department-appoints-special-envoy-to-sudan-amid-violence,"The State Department on Wednesday appointed a special envoy to Sudan amid a civil disobedience campaign in the country's capital.

Ambassador Donald Booth was appointed as the special envoy to Sudan, the State Department said, and will attend meetings in Khartoum, Sudan, and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Wednesday and Thursday with Assistant Secretary Tibor Nagy.

Booth previously served as the chief of mission to Ethiopia, Zambia and Liberia and as the U.S. special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan from August 2013 until January 2017.

The announcement comes amid mounting unrest in Sudan's capital that was sparked in April with a military coup leading to the ouster of longtime Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir.

Pro-democracy protesters have railed against the military junta that took his place, demanding a civilian government. The junta includes allies of al-Bashir.

Reports have emerged that more than 100 people were killed amid clashes between protesters and government-backed paramilitary forces last week outside the military headquarters.

The junta has declared elections will be held in later months, though protesters and domestic observers have expressed skepticism of the validity of such elections.

The State Department said last week it is engaging with officials in the region to produce a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

“The United States condemns the recent attacks on protesters in Sudan,"" the department said.

""We send our condolences to the victims and families who lost loved ones. We call on Sudan’s Transitional Military Council and the Rapid Support Forces to desist from violence and we call for resumed contact with the Forces for Freedom and Change with the aim of a civilian-led transition that leads to timely elections and free expression of the will of the Sudanese people,"" it added."
Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

The most unpopular president could win again in 2020,https://www.salon.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/12/the-most-unpopular-president-could-win-again-in-2020_partner/,"Donald Trump is the first president to ever be elected while being actively disliked by the majority of Americans. Trump was also the first person elected president who was significantly less popular than his counterpart.

Most Americans have heard of presidents losing the popular vote but winning the election. But to win while the majority of Americans oppose you? How is that possible?

Advertisement:

At the time of the election, Trump had the highest unfavorability rating in history, with over 61% of Americans having an “unfavorable” view or “disapproving” of Trump. (There’s also an “undecided” option.)

Luckily for Trump, he faced a historically unpopular opponent. Before 2016, no losing presidential candidate had had an unfavorable rating above 47%. But on election eve, Hillary Clinton’s was 52%, an unprecedented election in American history.

Pretty soon, Americans will start to hear nothing but polls, predictions and political forecasts in the news cycle for the 2020 elections. But, as a statistician and political polling expert, we think that there is one polling prediction device that will be overlooked and misunderstood: approval ratings.

Winning without the popular vote

History has been rather kind to presidents who didn’t win the popular vote. Trump is the fifth U.S. president to lose the popular vote and win the Electoral College.

Advertisement:

All presidents have experienced a bump in popularity between election and Inauguration Day. But only Trump still found his approval rating — the percent of Americans who approve of the way the president is handling his job — below 50% upon entering office.

According to FiveThirtyEight, the day Trump stepped into the White House, he had only a 45.5% approval rating. This stands in stark contrast to Barack Obama, for example, who took office with a 68% approval rating.

Moreover, Trump has the lowest approval average in history, at only 40%. The next lowest is Harry Truman at 45.4%.

These data clearly show that Trump is the least-liked president in American history. With such unpopularity, how could he possibly win again?

Approval ratings and reelection

While election forecasting has become increasingly complex with new prediction models and techniques, there is an unsung hero of polling predictions: the approval ratings.

Introduced by George Gallup in the late 1920s, presidential approval ratings aimed to gauge the level of public support for the sitting president at any given time during his presidency.

Advertisement:

Every single reelected president since approval rating polls began has had over a 50% approval rating when reelected, or been on an upward approval rating trend over 30 days before the election. If neither of those is satisfied, the incumbent loses.

It has been that simple.

As with any statistical analysis, the trends are more important than the raw numbers. The 2016 election was historically unprecedented in terms of favorability of the candidates, as is the political polarization of the U.S.

Look at the spread

We think that pollsters, and the general public, shouldn’t compare Trump’s approval ratings to past presidents.

What can be compared? The difference of highs and lows.

According to historical Gallup polls, Trump’s spread — the difference between the highest recorded and lowest recorded approval rating poll — has never been more than 13%.

Advertisement:

Not a single president since this type of robust polling began, back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, has ever shown this level of consistency in approval ratings. In fact, the next-smallest spread was 27%, for John F. Kennedy.

Trump’s approval ratings show that he has the strongest base in historical times.

2020 by the numbers

Advertisement:

There are still nine months to go until the first ballots will be cast in the race to the White House for 2020, and the Democratic nominee’s identity will most likely not be known for almost a year. Still, Trump’s chances of reelection are being discussed daily.

Trump’s approval ratings are unlikely to go over 50%, given his lackluster starting point. So what does he actually need to win?

A simple statistical model applied to recorded approval ratings shows Trump has been garnering higher and higher approval ratings since taking office. Put simply, his base is staying strong and even growing. This is in direct contrast to all presidents except Bill Clinton.

Past incumbent presidents followed the rule that 49% approval and above means winning reelection, and anything below meant no second term. But Trump did not start at, nor will most likely ever reach, that level of approval.

Americans may again see something that, statistically speaking, has never been seen before. Approval ratings have high correlations with predicting the next president, but with Trump, the numbers are outside any historical trends.

The most unpopular winner ever may very likely win again.

'Dangerous Proposal': USDA Seeking to Replace Government Inspectors at Beef Slaughter Plants With Private Employees,https://www.ecowatch.com,"['Common Dreams', 'The Conversation', 'Olivia Rosane', 'Nexus Media', 'Jordan Davidson']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.ecowatch.com/usda-inspectors-deregulation-2638771530.html,"By Julia Conley

In an apparent effort to boost profits for meat manufacturers despite potential harms to food safety, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reportedly planning to privatize inspections of beef slaughter plants.

""This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors,"" Food and Water Watch said in a statement.

The group released an application from beef, pork, and poultry manufacturer Tyson Foods, in which the company requested a waiver to allow Tyson employees to conduct more inspections at its beef plant in Holcolm, Kansas, instead of relying on USDA food safety inspectors.

Food and Water Watch reported Monday that the USDA is pursuing deregulation of the food inspection system that has been used for years at beef slaughterhouses. The information came from documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.

BREAKING: We have obtained documents that confirm the USDA is seeking to privatize inspections of beef slaughterhouses. This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors. https://t.co/jNospAvLYn pic.twitter.com/cbx4fo6lHy

The documents were uncovered after many recent denials by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) that it plans to privatize inspections of mass-produced beef, Food and Water Watch stated.

Tyson's proposal comes 21 years after FSIS first launched a pilot program in more than two dozen poultry and pork plants in which government food safety inspectors were replaced by the manufacturers' own inspectors, allowing the companies to regulate themselves.

In 2013, the USDA's inspector general found that the agency ""did not critically assess whether the new inspection process had measurably improved food safety at each plant"" that produced pork.

The following year, FSIS expanded the program to the entire poultry industry. The agency will not conduct an assessment of the new system's effects on food safety until 2022.

""The previous attempts at privatized inspection have led to weaker food safety performance and are a ploy by the industry to increase line speeds,"" said Tony Corbo, a senior lobbyist with Food and Water Watch.

Despite a lack of evidence that the privatized food safety inspection system is making food safer — and CDC data showing that foodborne illnesses from foods including chicken have been on the rise since 2015 — FSIS is weakening standards in order to increase the speed with which meat is processed, allowing for greater manufacturing profits.

""The Tyson plant in Holcomb, Kansas is approved to operate at the current maximum line speed allowable"" said Corbo. ""FSIS management has had difficulty meeting its inspection staffing requirements in the past in western Kansas, which has contributed to beef slaughter plants not being able to maintain maximum line speeds. Tyson's solution seems to be to get rid of the government inspectors."""

Three new Shigella specific anti-microbial therapeutics under preclinical evaluation

A preventative treatment that protects against enteric diseases, specifically Shigella, is a high priority objective for the US Army

MELBOURNE, Australia, June 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immuron Limited (ASX: IMC; NASDQ: IMRN), an Australian biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing oral immunotherapeutics for the prevention and treatment of many gut mediated pathogens, today is pleased to provide shareholders with an update on the company’s cooperative research and development agreements with the US Department of Defense (US DoD).

The Shigella challenge model was used to assess the therapeutic potential of Travelan® as a prevention treatment for shigellosis or dysentery. The placebo-controlled study was carried out in 12 juvenile rhesus monkeys segregated into 2 groups: a Travelan® treatment cohort of 8 and a placebo cohort of 4, which were treated twice daily for a total of 12 doses over a 6-day period. The animals received treatment for 3-days prior to oral challenge with ~3 x 109 viable Shigella organisms.

As reported in September last year, all (4 of 4 - 100%) placebo-treated animals displayed acute clinical signs of dysentery within 24 – 36 hours of Shigella challenge. Only two of the eight Travelan-treated group displayed any signs of dysentery. The remaining 6 of 8 (75%) of the Travelan-treated group remained healthy and without signs of dysentery post challenge. Recently completed histopathological analysis, which provides a comprehensive view of the clinical disease and its effect on tissues of gut, revealed that all animals in the placebo-treated group displayed severe inflammation in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. These animals also had very high levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8) in fecal samples collected throughout the study. The inflammation seen in the gastrointestinal tract and the increase in inflammatory cytokines in the feces were closely associated with the observed clinical outcomes of dysentery. Only 3 of the 8 Travelan-treated animals had signs of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, and only 2 of those had high levels of inflammatory cytokines in fecal samples. All other animals in the Travelan-treated group were clinically healthy and did not excrete any inflammatory cytokines. Overall the results suggest that Travelan® is functionally cross-reactive and may have some prophylactic activity against Shigellosis.

“The latest results reported by our colleagues at the US Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS), an overseas laboratory of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), located in Bangkok, Thailand are very impressive indeed. The study results clearly demonstrated that animals with severe inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and high inflammatory cytokines in fecal samples were associated with severe dysentery and that prophylactic administration of Travelan® significantly reduced the inflammatory response,” said Dr. Robert Kaminski, Chief, Subunit Enteric Vaccines and Immunology, Department of Enteric Infections, Bacterial Diseases Branch, WRAIR.

The abstract of the study findings has been submitted for presentation at the 10th International conference on Vaccines for Enteric Diseases which will be held at the University of Lausanne Switzerland on the 16th to 18th October 2019.

“This is further validation of our technology platform,” said Dr. Gary Jacob, CEO of Immuron. “The work completed by our research collaborators at the WRAIR has clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of Travelan® and the Immuron technology platform in neutralizing pathogenic gastrointestinal bacterial infections and offers significant potential as a preventative treatment for US military personnel and civilians stationed or traveling in locations where such infections may be debilitating.”

The company is also pleased to report that it has completed the manufacture of three new Shigella specific therapeutic products which have been manufactured with proprietary vaccines developed by the WRAIR. Preliminary laboratory evaluation has indicated that all three products have generated a strong antibody response to the Shigella antigens used in the manufacturing campaign. The three products will be evaluated in preclinical models of shigellosis developed by the WRAIR.

“The WRAIR has been developing vaccines against Shigella for over a decade and the combination of our Shigella vaccine research and development efforts with Immuron’s oral immunotherapy platform make perfect sense. The WRAIR will fund the evaluation of the anti-Shigella specific activity of the new products including assessing their protective capacity in established small animal models which will be completed and reported throughout the remainder of this year,” said Dr. Robert Kaminski.

WASHINGTON – One described a Veterans Affairs police officer throwing a New York veteran seeking therapy to the ground. Another said a California veteran died after receiving similar treatment at the hands of VA police there. A third noted that a VA officer training to be an instructor at the national VA police academy threatened employees with a gun at a Massachusetts car dealership.

The underlying question from lawmakers to VA officials Tuesday: What is going on with VA police?

“I mean really what are they doing over there?” asked Rep. Gilbert Cisneros, Jr, D-Calif., who questioned training in particular. “Why are we having these situations where individuals are being injured or hurt or killed?”

An investigation of the VA police force by the agency’s inspector general concluded in December that systemic management failures had resulted in short-staffing and millions in overtime charged to taxpayers, as well as missed opportunities to ensure staff and veteran patients were protected.

USA TODAY reported in December on a case in Missouri where a veteran died after being tackled and detained by VA police in Kansas City.

Senior VA executives told lawmakers at the hearing Tuesday that the agency has hired a new security manager and appointed police supervisors in every VA region to improve management. They said officer training has been extended in recent years and includes a focus on de-escalating situations rather than confrontation.

“It’s really troubling, it’s hard for me to sit here and answer questions after hearing the stories that you’re talking about, and certainly anytime anything like this occurs, we have to go back and question whether or not the things that we are doing are being effective,” said Renee Oshinski, acting deputy under secretary for health for operations and management.

Kevin Hanretta, the principal deputy assistant secretary for operations, security and preparedness, said the incidents in New York and California described by lawmakers are “very unfortunate.” But he said they are not representative of “the VA police in the field serving our nation’s veterans.” Hanretta said the job offer for the instructor-trainee at the academy, since rescinded, is under investigation.

The VA employs nearly 4,000 officers at 139 medical centers who play a critical role in securing property, preventing and investigating crimes and often intervening to help patients or staff during potentially dangerous incidents.

'Literally body-slammed'

Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that mission went awry when one of her constituents went last June to the VA in Northport, N.Y. Jean Telefort, a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, was seeking therapy after spinal surgery.

She said the VA had allowed him to see a non-VA therapist after the procedure, but then cut that off and sent him to a VA facility instead. That facility, however, didn’t offer therapy. So the VA sent him to the VA in Northport. When he became frustrated, a scheduling clerk there called VA police.

“He was literally body slammed onto the ground, with his arms twisted behind his back,” Rice said. “This is someone who was post spinal surgery – he informed them of that, ‘I can’t breathe, I just had spinal surgery.’”

But VA officers kept him on the ground, and refused to take his handcuffs off, even after a physical therapist who had treated him before said Telefort was not a danger.

Rice said he later received summonses to appear in federal court for charges that have since been deferred. She said a VA employee later accessed his medical records and entered false information.

“This incident keeps going on and on and on,” Rice said. “The questions that I have are many.”

The director of the VA’s office of security and law enforcement, Frederick Jackson, said an investigation after the incident, which included statements from witnesses, concluded the VA officers acted appropriately.

Veterans die after VA police run-ins

In Loma Linda, California, a 65-year-old veteran became frustrated after waiting four hours for a procedure in 2011. He tried to leave and go to a VA in Long Beach instead, but VA officers wouldn’t let him.

“They pretty much took him, slammed him to the ground, hit his head and he ended up dying,” Cisneros said.

The family won a $500,000 settlement from the VA in 2015, according to the lawyer who filed the case, although the agency maintained he had died from an unrelated stroke.

Family members of the veteran who died in Kansas City after an altercation with VA police also have filed suit. USA TODAY reported in December that a veteran tackled by VA officers outside the VA medical center was found by emergency medical workers to be “non-verbal, moaning with a decreased level of consciousness,” according to internal documents.

They said he had a gash in his scalp and “multiple” cuts and bruises on his face. A CT scan of his head showed areas of bleeding around his brain. The veteran, identified as Dale Farhner in the lawsuit, died soon afterward.

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY at the time, VA spokesman Curt Cashour said the incident was under investigation.

An instructor trainee

In January, a VA police employee who had recently won a post as an instructor trainee at the national VA police academy stumbled into a car dealership in Massachusetts, flashed a gun and demanded gas for his car, The Boston Globe reported.

Police arrested him and put him in a cell, where he stuffed the toilet with paper and banged his head against the door. He had previously been dismissed from the Massachusetts State Police, faced allegations of sexual harassment and, in 2017, had his permit to carry a weapon revoked.

“Can you just help me understand how that would happen – how this man of all people would be sent to the elite VA police academy?” Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., asked VA officials Tuesday.

Hanretta, the deputy assistant secretary overseeing security, said the VA immediately launched an investigation and the academy job offer was rescinded.

“In this particular case, at the time of his selection, we were not aware of all of the background circumstances,” he said.

Jackson, the director of law enforcement noted that while he did “go down to the law enforcement training center, he was never an instructor” because he hadn’t completed training yet.

“I have no idea why this man would wear the uniform period,” Moulton said.

DOJ watchdog: FBI lost track of 62 foreign cooperators in U.S.,https://thehill.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/international/448271-doj-watchdog-fbi-lost-track-of-62-foreign-cooperators-in-us,"The FBI lost track of more than 60 foreign cooperators in the U.S. after sponsoring them to aid in investigations, according to a report released Tuesday by the Justice Department’s (DOJ) Office of Inspector General.

In addition, the watchdog's audit identified 1,000 DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was not provided information on in February 2018. By that August it was still seeking information from DOJ on 665.

While DHS facilitates the cooperators' entries into the U.S., the DOJ takes custody of them once they are in the country.

“We believe that all DOJ components need to improve their execution of the responsibilities integral to the sponsorship programs, including enhancing the policies for monitoring the locations and activities of sponsored foreign nationals and the management information systems used within the program,” the report says.

The 62 people that absconded included both “benign” absconsions by foreign nationals who simply failed to notify their sponsoring agent of a move and “deliberate” ones by people purposely evading law enforcement. The report does not specify how many of each it identified.

The OIG found 22 cases of people who absconded without the DOJ notifying the DHS until a 2018 review.

In another 18 cases, the DOJ let foreign nationals’ sponsorship lapse, which put them at risk for being detained and deported while the DOJ was still using them for investigations, according to the report.

To address such issues going forward, the report states, the DOJ should ensure the DEA and FBI take all necessary steps to help DHS located absconded people, as well as developing compliance processes for DHS reporting requirements.

The department should also “institute a more efficient process to resolve DHS’s existing unresolved sponsorship matters and ensure that any future sponsorship matters needing resolution are addressed expeditiously,” the report states."
State Department praises release of US resident from Iran,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/state-department-nizar-zakka/index.html,"(CNN) The US State Department on Tuesday praised the release of Nizar Zakka after nearly four years of detention in Iran, expressing ""hope"" that it could be ""a positive sign for American detainees"" in that country.

Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent US residency, was released after being held in Tehran for ""espionage"" since 2015. The 52-year-old was arrested in September of that year ""while attending a conference on women and sustainable development,"" according to Iran's semi-official state news agency Tasnim. He was convicted on espionage charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2016.

Zakka, speaking with Al Arabiya following his release, said he was ""subjected to all kinds of torture from the Iranians"" when he was first arrested. He told the news outlet that the torture became psychological.

""I can't describe it. It's very hard to describe,"" he said of his detention in Iran's Evin prison.

In a statement, a State Department spokesperson hailed Zakka's release as ""without a doubt a great day for Mr. Zakka, his family, and all those who have supported him during his unlawful imprisonment.""

In the past two months, almost every top job on immigration policy has turned over once—and in some cases, twice—with the administration at times employing creative maneuvers to get officials in place. The personnel changes have occurred against a backdrop of especially dramatic action, including high-stakes negotiation with Mexico over a surge of Central American..."
