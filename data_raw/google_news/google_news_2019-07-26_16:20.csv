DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"

Aide fired after fake presidential seal displayed next to Trump at Turning Point USA event,https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-presidential-seal-russian-imagery-doctored-image-turning-point-usa-aide-fired,"An aide has been fired after President Trump took the stage at a Turning Point USA event earlier this week in front of a doctored presidential seal that featured pro-Russian imagery and said “45 is a puppet.”

White House spokesman Judd Deere told the Associated Press officials ""never saw the seal"" before it was projected on a screen behind Trump as he was introduced Tuesday at Turning Point USA's teen summit. The altered seal appeared on the projector screen for at least 80 seconds behind Trump before it was taken down, the Washington Times reported.

Turning Point USA, a conservative group that has been aligned with Trump, announced Thursday that the aide responsible for the supposedly accidental mix-up has since been fired.

TURNING POINT USA FOUNDER: TRUMP'S FREE SPEECH EXECUTIVE ORDER PROMISE IS THE MOMENT WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR

The doctored image featured a two-headed eagle, a direct nod to the Russia Federation’s coat of arms. The bird’s left claw held golf clubs instead of the original’s 13 arrows, which symbolize the 13 colonies. The right claw grasped cash, instead of the original’s olive branch.

The altered presidential seal read ""45 es un titere,"" which translated from Spanish means “45 is a puppet.” The authentic seal sports the Latin phrase ""e pluribus unum,"" the U.S. motto meaning ""out of many, one.""

Turning Point USA claimed that, in haste, a member of the video team searched for a high-resolution file of the presidential seal and did not realize that the image was doctored before placing it on the screen behind Trump.

“We’re sorry for the mix-up and meant no disrespect to the White House or the President or the advance team,” the nonprofit told CNN. Turning Point USA insisted they had “zero malicious intent” in the switch.

The Washington Post identified the original graphic designer who created the doctored seal after the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Charles Leazott, 46, of Richmond, Va., said he designed the seal after Trump was elected as a joke among friends and family. It was not intended for a larger audience, he said.

“This is the most petty piece of art I have ever created,” Leazott said of his mock presidential seal design. Leazott told the newspaper he had been a long-time member of the Republican Party and voted for George W. Bush twice. He said when Trump was elected, he no longer identified with the new president's GOP."
Mueller untangles the Russia web: Trump's not the only Republican to welcome election meddling,https://www.salon.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/26/mueller-untangles-the-russia-web-trumps-not-the-only-politician-to-welcome-election-meddling/,"Mueller untangles the Russia web: Trump's not the only Republican to welcome election meddling It is impossible to ignore the fact that Trump isn't the only politician willing to accept foreign interference

Now that a couple of days have passed and we've all had a chance to digest the testimony of special counsel Robert Mueller and shake off the media's predictable theatre criticism and sports analysis, it's easy to see that the man's focus in the investigation was on the Russian sabotage of America's electoral system rather than Trump abusing his power to cover it up. And after the Senate Select Intelligence Committee released its report on the same subject on Thursday, it's easy to see why.

Mueller obviously didn't want to get into the obstruction case with the committee and for understandable reasons. He was hamstrung from the beginning with that ruling by the Office of Legal Counsel that holds that a sitting president cannot be indicted and the infuriating precedent James Comey set when he foolishly went outside established Department of Justice guidelines to discuss his decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton in the infamous email case. Mueller and his team know very well that the president obstructed justice but since they couldn't indict him they undoubtedly felt that boldly asserting Trump had committed crimes would be seen in the same light.

The Judiciary Committee did what they could but those charges, being in that prosecutorial legal and ethical gray area, made that hearing only marginally fruitful. And, in any case, it was clear that Mueller was far more concerned with the issues raised in the second hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. And that's because the national security implications are extremely serious.

Mueller reiterated the findings of all the intelligence agencies that have said the Russians interfered in the 2016 election on Donald Trump's behalf. And he alluded to the classified counterintelligence investigation that was outside his narrow criminal purview during a line of questioning with Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Il:

KRISHNAMOORTHI: Individuals can be subject to blackmail if they lie about their interactions with foreign countries, correct? MUELLER: True.

I've written about this issue as it pertains to former national security adviser Michael Flynn before, intrigued by the very real possibility that Trump was being blackmailed or unwittingly compromised in exactly the same way as his former national security adviser had been when he lied about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.

Krishnamoorthi said, ""Flynn’s false statements could pose a national security risk because the Russians knew the falsity of those statements"" and Mueller replied that there are many elements of the FBI that are looking at different aspects of that issue.”

KRISHNAMOORTHI: Currently? MUELLER: Currently KRISHNAMOORTHI: As you noted in volume two of your report, Donald Trump repeated five times in one press conference, Mr. Mueller, in 2016, “I have nothing to do with Russia.” Of course Michael Cohen said Donald Trump was not being truthful, because at this time Trump was attempting to build Trump Tower Moscow. Your report does not address whether Donald Trump was compromised in any way because of any potential false statements that he made about Trump Tower Moscow, correct? MUELLER: I think that’s right — I think that’s right.

Trump had to fire Flynn for possibly being compromised under these exact circumstances — only Trump's lies were much more consequential. And, as we know, Trump's behavior toward the Russian president is downright sycophantic.

Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., drilled down a little more:

SCHIFF: The need to act in an ethical manner is not just a moral one, but when people act unethically it also exposes them to compromise, particularly in dealing with foreign powers, is that true? MUELLER: True. SCHIFF: Because when someone acts unethically in connection with a foreign partner, that foreign partner can expose their wrongdoing and extort them. MUELLER: True. SCHIFF: And that conduct — that unethical conduct can be of a financial nature if you have a financial motive or elicit business dealing, am I right? MUELLER: Yes. SCHIFF: It could also just involve deception. If you are lying about something that can be exposed, then you can be blackmailed. MUELLER: Also true.

Mueller's mandate didn't include this line of inquiry which is apparently still being investigated by the FBI counterintelligence division. (Or, at least it was. Trump's henchman Bill Barr may have closed it down by now.) But it didn't take any kind of super-spy to see that Trump's behavior toward Vladimir Putin, particularly at that shameful summit in Helsinki, is abnormal, even for him.

Nobody asked Mueller about Helsinki. But one imagines that with all he knew, that had to have been an especially unnerving spectacle.

Immediately after the hearing Republicans blocked two bipartisan election security bills that would require campaigns to alert the FBI and Federal Election Commission about foreign offers of assistance. On Thursday, Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell blocked two more, one to require a paper ballot back-up and the other to fund the Election Assistance Commission saying that Democrats wanted to give themselves a ""political benefit"" which is actually true. They would like the benefit of free and fair elections.

At this point, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Donald Trump isn't the only politician willing to accept foreign interference in our elections. The entire Republican Party now welcomes it as well.

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released the first volume of its report on the 2016 election interference Thursday and it contained a fairly shocking revelation. The election systems in all 50 states were targeted, a far bigger attack than we knew and apparently something that went almost completely undetected at the time. The report says that they did nothing with the information they gleaned but darkly suggest that its possible they may have been collecting information for a future date. This is, apparently, fine with President Trump and the Republican leadership.

Former solicitor general Walter Dellinger appeared on All In with Chris Hayes on Thursday night and made the important point that not all crimes are impeachable offenses, ""nor does it need to be a technical violation of federal criminal code."" But he noted that a president who consciously fails to defend the US against a foreign military intelligence attack for his political benefit is surely impeachable. But the Democratic leadership is convinced that the best course for dealing with Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors is not to impeach but to beat him fair and square at the ballot box.

Considering all we have learned from both the Mueller Report and the SSCI about Russian election interference and sabotage, as well as the continued unwillingness of the president and Republicans to do anything about it, that seems willfully naive."
How a Fake Presidential Seal Ended Up Onstage With Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Sarah Mervosh', 'Niraj Chokshi']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/presidential-seal-trump.html,"After he created the altered seal, Mr. Leazott shared it with friends, who encouraged him to sell it online, so he created a website and store and quickly moved on with his life. Then, on Thursday morning, he said he was surprised to come across his creation in a news article while he was drinking coffee and scanning Reddit.

“It kind of made my day,” he said.

At first, he had asked that his last name not be used because he was receiving hateful messages, but he soon changed his mind, giving multiple interviews to other news outlets and even posting an “Ask Me Anything” thread on Reddit.

The doctored image quickly became a talking point among liberals and conservatives alike. Online, some delighted in the dig and called it “brilliant trolling.” Others denounced the switch as an offense worthy of dismissal.

The alterations were subtle enough.

The traditional presidential seal contains the image of an eagle, which holds arrows representing war in one talon and olive branches representing peace in the other. A banner above its head bears the motto “E Pluribus Unum,” Latin for “Out of Many, One.”

The eagle in the altered image had two heads, a symbol featured on the national emblem of Russia, the flags of several other countries and the logos for two Trump golf resorts in Scotland. The symbol is often associated with power and empire.

In that seal, the eagle clutches golf clubs and what appears to be a wad of money in its talons. The banner above its head reads “45 Es un Títere,” Spanish for “45 Is a Puppet.” And a shield across the eagle’s chest features five instances of the hammer and sickle, a Communist symbol associated with the Russian Revolution.

The event was an unlikely setting for criticism, and it is unclear if the president was aware of the fake seal. He spoke for nearly 80 minutes in front of a supportive audience. The real presidential seal appeared on the lectern and on another part of the screen.

Only three federal executions have taken place since 1988, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. All five of the death-row inmates named in Thursday's release were convicted for the murders of children.

“Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding. The Justice Department upholds the rule of law—and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

Several states currently have a moratorium on the death penalty or have suspended the practice due to recent past wrongful convictions brought to light by groups such as the Innocence Project, which have secured the release of a number of death-row inmates in recent years. The total number of executions has declined over the last decade, in part, due to concerns that capital punishment disproportionately affects African Americans.

The death penalty has been abolished in about 70 percent of countries, including many democratic, industrialized nations similar to the U.S."

The Trump administration is bringing back federal executions,https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/2019/7/25/8930191/federal-execution-death-penalty-bill-barr-trump-administration,"US Attorney General William Barr ordered the Federal Bureau of Prisons on Thursday to resume capital punishment for federal prisoners for the first time in nearly two decades, and to change the drugs it uses to carry out executions.

Five people, all of whom have been convicted of murder and other crimes, now have executions scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020. There are currently 62 individuals on federal death row, and the federal government has executed only three people since 1988.

“The Justice Department upholds the rule of law — and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system,” Barr said in a statement.

The five inmates to be executed are Daniel Lewis Lee, who murdered a family of three; Lezmond Mitchell, who killed a 63-year-old woman and her 9-year-old granddaughter; Wesley Ira Purkey, who raped and killed a 16-year-old, in addition to two other victims; Alfred Bourgeois, who molested and killed his 2-year-old daughter; and Dustin Lee Honken, who fatally shot five people.

The death penalty has been on the decline in America: Although it’s still legal in 29 states, the number of executions carried out each year is falling, and the number of new death sentences is also on the decline. But at the federal level, the Trump administration wants to reverse the trend.

The federal government hasn’t executed anyone since 2003, and there’s a nationwide pushback against the practice

The death penalty as it was practiced in the US, including state and federal executions, was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia in 1972, and then reinstated in 1988 when Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act.

Federal executions, though, were not reinstated until 1988, and then for only a narrow range of cases, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 expanded the number of eligible offenses to 60, but the first federal execution still didn’t occur until 2001.

Federal executions are rare — only three people have been executed by the US government — because the death penalty, like most of the criminal justice system, works largely at the state level. The federal government continues to seek the death penalty, but federal executions were under an informal moratorium under President Barack Obama, who ordered the Justice Department in 2014 to conduct a broad review of its lethal injection practice and the drugs it uses.

Support at the state level is falling as well. In May, New Hampshire became the 21st state to abolish the death penalty. There are several explanations: Support from the general public is declining, there’s a persistent shortage of lethal injection drugs, the cost is high, and there’s a growing realization that the punishment is applied unequally.

The benefits of the death penalty are also simply questionable. As Vox’s German Lopez wrote:

The research and experts have long been skeptical that the death penalty actually deters or prevents more crime. As the Death Penalty Information Center noted, a 2009 survey of the US’s top criminologists found that 88 percent “do not believe the death penalty acts as a deterrent to homicide” and 87 percent “believe that abolition of the death penalty would not have any significant effect on murder rates.”

Experts also argue that the death penalty is inhumane. New York University professor David Garland, who has done extensive research on crime and punishment, called the practice “unnecessary and barbaric.”

“The idea that the government should be permitted deliberately to take the life of a living human being is an outrage when we have punishments — such as life in prison without parole — that serve the same criminal justice ends but do so more effectively and more humanely and in a more civilized way,” he said in an interview.

Amnesty International USA executive director Margaret Huang criticized the administration’s move, calling it out of step with both national and international trends.

“The Trump administration’s decision to restart federal executions after a 16-year hiatus is outrageous,” she said. “It is the latest indication of this administration’s disdain for human rights. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment. It is a system flawed beyond repair, and the federal government should not proceed with any executions.”

There are still states that practice executions regularly, such as Texas, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia. But for many states, death penalty sentences have been rendered almost useless as governors have vowed to block them or courts have shut them down as unconstitutional. It seemed like the government was backing these states with its informal moratorium on executions — until now.

Using pentobarbital is the government’s solution to a shortage of traditional lethal injection drugs

Another major change to the government’s execution protocol is the swap from a three-drug cocktail to just pentobarbital. A traditional three-drug cocktail consists of sodium thiopental, which induces unconsciousness; pancuronium bromide, which causes muscle paralysis and respiratory arrest; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart.

But there’s been a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental. Since 2010, drug companies have refused to supply executioners with the drug for ethical reason or simply because they do not want to be associated with the practice.

In 2011, Hospira, the only US supplier of sodium thiopental, announced it would no longer produce the drug after pressure from a global campaign by death penalty activists. Since then, several states have had to delay their executions as they try to procure the drug from overseas.

Some states, however, have turned to pentobarbital, a drug that is commonly used as a sedative during surgeries. Before being used in the US as a substitute lethal injection drug, it was better known as a euthanasia drug in Europe. Texas was the first state to use the drug for lethal injection in 2012, and according to the Justice Department’s statement, 14 states have used it in more than 200 executions.

Yet the use of pentobarbital has been controversial because some claim it isn’t painless as promised. When Anthony Shore was executed with pentobarbital in 2018, he shouted, “I can feel that it does burn. Burning!” Several other Texan inmates made similar statements before their death. The Texas Department of Justice, however, refutes these claims and said the drug has been used for years without incident.

One big question is how the US will obtain pentobarbital, which is getting increasingly harder to obtain. Lundbeck, a Danish company that makes it, condemned the US for using its drug for execution and had even banned its US distributors from providing executors with the drug. Most states have a stockpile of lethal injection drugs — Texas has 27 doses left — but they’re quickly depleting.

It might not even matter that the US government won’t be able to proceed with the executions. If anything, the Trump administration is trying to make a political point here, Garland said.

“The federal death penalty being reinvoked and executions being scheduled is to make a political point, not because this is a government that feels that criminal justice can’t work if these individuals aren’t executed,” he said. “But purely to communicate that this is a tough government willing to put people to death to show its bravado and its masculinity.”"
"Bitcoin Escrow Firm Bilked Investors for $7 Million, DOJ Says",https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/doj-says-bitcoin-escrow-firm-bilked-investors-for-7-million,"U.S. prosecutors have charged the head of a bitcoin escrow company with defrauding investors for $7 million.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, part of the Department of Justice (DOJ), brought two counts each of commodity and wire fraud against Jon Barry Thompson, principal of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC. In a complaint unsealed Thursday, he is accused of making misleading statements about investment risks and false representations of his custody and control of digital assets.

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement:

“As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

Thompson “preyed” on his clients’ lack of information regarding the emerging asset class, prosecutors said. In promotional materials and communication with clients, he allegedly presented himself as a competent investor, custodian, or financier.

The two companies Thompson allegedly defrauded sent him multi-million-dollar wires hoping to receive bitcoin in exchange. Prosecutors alleged that Thompson told one client, “cash is with me, coin is with me,” though he had sent their $3 million to a third-party exchange, skimming thousands off the top for personal use, without first obtaining any bitcoin.

The DOJ did not identify either alleged victim. According to a Forbes article published in January, Volantis negotiated a deal to transfer 6,600 bitcoin to Symphony, a crypto investments firm, but “the transaction never closed.”

Thompson, who was arrested Thursday in Pennsylvania, faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.

Monica Crowley, who was appointed by Trump last week as assistant Treasury secretary for public affairs, made the baseless claim on posts and at least one tweet between 2009 and 2015, according to CNN.

She also reportedly suggested that Obama was trying to convert the U.S. to Sharia law and that conspiracies about his birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns.""

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" Crowley wrote in an April 2011 post.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she said.

Trump was one the most prominent proponents of the birther movement, which falsely held that Obama, who was born in Hawaii, is not actually an American citizen.

In a 2013 blog post, Crowley suggested that the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote.

""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy,"" she continued.

Media Matters for America, a left-leaning advocacy organization, reported on Crowley's blog posts earlier this month.

It also noted that she has called the press, which her job will include working with, “dishonest, hostile, biased, rude fake news.”

Crowley previously bowed out of a bid to join the National Security Council as a press secretary in 2017 after CNN's KFile reported that her book, ""What the (Bleep) Just Happened,"" and her Ph.D. thesis contained instances of plagiarism.

The Justice Department’s decision to resume federal executions after a hiatus of 16 years instantly set off a new round of political debate about crime and punishment ahead of next year’s elections.

Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrBarr's talking points on the death penalty are misleading The question isn't whether Trump obstructed justice, but whether Congress even cares The Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate MORE on Thursday announced the government in December and January will use lethal injection to execute five death-row inmates convicted of murdering children. The government has not put a prisoner to death since 2003 (The Hill).

“Let me be clear: capital punishment is immoral and deeply flawed. Too many innocent people have been put to death,” Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisAl Sharpton calls for end to Democrats' infighting: 'The objective is Trump' Panel: Kamala's debate magic fades Harris proposes B investment in historically black colleges MORE (D-Calif.), a former state attorney general and district attorney with a mixed record on the death penalty, tweeted Thursday while campaigning for the White House. “We need a national moratorium on the death penalty, not a resurrection.”

Other Democratic presidential candidates joined in expressing their opposition to Barr’s announcement, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenWatchdog: Thousands may be committing fraud to lower student loan payments Harris proposes B investment in historically black colleges Bernie Sanders, Frank Sinatra and income inequality MORE (D-Mass.), Cory Booker Cory Anthony BookerAl Sharpton calls for end to Democrats' infighting: 'The objective is Trump' The Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate Team Biden fires back: 'You can't let people say bullshit and not respond to it' MORE (D-N.J.) and Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersWatchdog: Thousands may be committing fraud to lower student loan payments Al Sharpton calls for end to Democrats' infighting: 'The objective is Trump' Bernie Sanders, Frank Sinatra and income inequality MORE (I-Vt.), and Washington Gov.

They questioned disparities of race and class in the application of the death penalty, described capital punishment as an ineffective crime deterrent and questioned its humanity.

Barr’s announcement that “we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system” occurred days before a Democratic presidential primary debate in Detroit next week, when race and equality are expected to be prominent issues.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said they were taken by surprise at the administration’s announcement. Rep. John Garamendi John Raymond GaramendiBipartisan House duo unveils amendment to block Iran strike without Congress's approval House panel shoots down funding, deployment of low-yield nukes in defense bill Overnight Defense: Latest on House defense bill markup | Air Force One, low-yield nukes spark debate | House Dems introduce resolutions blocking Saudi arms sales | Trump to send 1,000 troops to Poland MORE (D-Calif.) told the Morning Report he believes the decision is political. “The timing is for two potential reasons. One, the runup to next year’s election — tough on crime. The other is deflection, which the president uses every other hour,” he said.

Rep. Scott Perry Scott Gordon PerryConservatives ask Barr to lay out Trump's rationale for census question Pennsylvania state official launches Democratic challenge to GOP rep in district carried by Trump Lawmakers push to block pay raises for members of Congress MORE (R-Pa.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said the resumption of federal executions was “totally unexpected,” but not unwelcome. “Look, I’m for punishing criminals,” he said on Thursday before House members departed Washington until September. “If somebody kills somebody, a member of a family, and that’s adjudicated appropriately and fully, I think it’s a form of deterrence and I just don’t like to see it languish on forever and ever in appeals.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenAl Sharpton calls for end to Democrats' infighting: 'The objective is Trump' Harris proposes B investment in historically black colleges Bernie Sanders, Frank Sinatra and income inequality MORE, who is in the process of amending his tough-on-crime Senate record from the 1990s and working, along with the other White House aspirants, to woo progressive and African American voters, released a new plan on Tuesday that calls for eliminating the death penalty.

More than 160 people have been sentenced to death since 1973 and later been exonerated, Biden’s plan states. The former Delaware senator said he now favors life sentences without chances for probation or parole at the federal level and would work to pass legislation to outlaw the federal death penalty as a way to encourage states to follow suit.

Twenty-nine states have the death penalty, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, and a map of those states looks a lot like the red-blue political demarcations of next year’s presidential contest.

A majority of Americans supports the practice, although the percentage has ebbed since the mid-1990s when crime rates were on the upswing. A Pew Research Center survey last year found 54 percent of Americans supported the death penalty for those convicted of murder (The Washington Post).

In yet another example of partisan divisions, most Republicans back capital punishment while most Democrats say they oppose it.

The Justice Department says the government will use the barbiturate pentobarbital as its method to execute Daniel Lewis Lee of Oklahoma; Lezmond Mitchell of the Navajo Nation, the only Native American on death row; Wesley Ira Purkey of Michigan; Alfred Bourgeois of Louisiana; and Dustin Lee Honken of Iowa. They are all to be put to death in Terre Haute, Ind. (The New York Times).

LEADING THE DAY





CONGRESS: The House officially fled Washington last night after lawmakers passed the bipartisan deal to raise the spending caps and the debt ceiling for two years. The bill will now go to the Senate, which will take it up next week before adjourning for its August recess.

The House passed the package, which boosts government spending by $320 billion over the next two years, by a 284-149 vote. Sixty-five House Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyWashington gives up on spending cuts The Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate Overnight Health Care: Senate panel advances drug pricing bill amid GOP blowback | House panel grills Juul executives | Trump gives boost to state drug import plans | Officials say new migrant kids' shelter to remain open but empty MORE (R-Calif.), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseThe Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate Carbon tax shows new signs of life in Congress On The Money: House passes sweeping budget, debt limit deal | Dem court filing defends powers to get Trump's NY tax returns | Debt collectors to pay M to settle consumer bureau charges MORE (R-La.) and Rep. Liz Cheney Elizabeth (Liz) Lynn CheneyThe Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate House passes sweeping budget, debt limit deal Trump tweets, rally chant dominate Sunday shows as president continues attacks MORE (R-Wyo.), voted for the bill, while 16 Democrats voted against it.

The package would suspend the debt limit through July 2021 and increase spending caps for the next two years. The United States would be on track to add an estimated $1.7 trillion to the deficit over the next decade when compared with the billions in automatic spending cuts that would have kicked in as a result of the 2011 Budget Control Act.

While most conservatives voted against the bill, they never made a concerted effort to press the president to oppose it. Trump tweeted earlier Thursday urging GOP lawmakers to back the measure, arguing that it “greatly helps our Military and our Vets.” The legislation boosts Pentagon spending to $738 billion, a reason some Republicans decided to vote for the agreement (The Hill).

The House adjourned Thursday night after House leadership decided not to bring up legislation from Rep. Veronica Escobar Veronica EscobarMueller declines to answer dozens of questions from lawmakers The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump targets Mueller ahead of testimony This week: Mueller dominates chaotic week on Capitol Hill MORE (D-Texas) that would overhaul migrant detention policies.

> Impeachment: Rep. Katherine Clark Katherine Marlea ClarkWendy Davis launches bid for Congress in Texas Two Democrats vow to press forward on Trump impeachment Democratic staffer says Wendy Davis will run for Congress MORE (D-Mass.), the House Democratic Caucus vice chair, announced Thursday that she supports opening an impeachment inquiry, making her the highest-ranking House Democrat to move into the impeachment camp.

""I deeply respect the committee work of House Democrats to hold the President accountable, including hearings, subpoenas and lawsuits. All of our efforts to put the facts before the American people, however, have been met with unprecedented stonewalling and obstruction,"" said Clark, the No. 6 House Democrat, in a statement.

""That is why I believe we need to open an impeachment inquiry that will provide us a more formal way to fully uncover the facts.""

Clark is the fourth House Democratic to announce support for opening an inquiry since former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerDemocrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony Kellyanne Conway: 'I'd like to know' if Mueller read his own report Graham: Mueller was 'pretty much a figurehead' of investigation MORE’s hearings on Wednesday.

The Washington Post: Democrats struggle to figure out next move against Trump after Mueller hearing falls flat.

The Hill: Appetite for Democratic term limits for leadership fizzling out.

> Saudi Arabia: The Senate is expected to vote Monday on overriding presidential vetoes of resolutions blocking arms sales with Saudi Arabia.

Despite the scheduled vote series, they are not expected to override Trump’s vetoes given that the initial resolutions of disapproval passed with no more than 53 votes, well short of the necessary 67 votes. Trump vetoed the resolutions on Wednesday.

""This resolution would weaken America's global competitiveness and damage the important relationships we share with our allies and partners,"" Trump wrote in veto messages to Congress (The Hill).

The Hill: GOP chairman yanks Saudi bill after Democrats muscle through tougher language.

> Joint Chiefs: The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Gen. Mark Milley, the Army’s top officer, to serve as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replacing Gen. Joseph Dunford when his term expires on Oct. 1.

Milley was confirmed by an 89-1 vote after being nominated by the president in December. Sen. Jeff Merkeley (D-Ore.) was the sole vote in opposition. While the chairman of the Joint Chiefs does not command any military forces, Milley will advise the president, the Defense secretary and the National Security Council on military matters (The Associated Press).

IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES





2020 POLITICS: Biden is no longer holding his fire at rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination after taking heat for months as he readies for the second Democratic debates next week.

As Jonathan Easley and Amie Parnes report, the former vice president has been absorbing shots from Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker on everything from his opposition to “Medicare for All” to his record on race with little to no pushback, leaving his allies frustrated by the passive approach.

However, the sustained questions about his commitment to civil rights seemed to finally provoke Biden to action, with his latest missives against Booker’s record on incarcerations and criminal justice during his tenure as Newark, N.J., mayor serving as the most recent example. The former vice president also said that he would not be as “polite” with Harris at the next debate after their back-and-forth on busing in late June, describing her attacks as a crass political play and wholly disingenuous.

Underlining the attacks is the continued push by Biden and others for support from African American voters and the former vice president’s need to rebound from an underwhelming debate performance last month in Miami to reestablish him as the undisputed front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nod.

“You can't be called the architect of mass incarceration and remain quiet,” a Biden ally said. “That's cruel and personal. That goes against his entire career. You can't let people say bullshit and not respond to it.”

> DCCC feud: The House Democratic campaign arm is locked in a bitter feud with top African American and Hispanic lawmakers over the lack of diversity at the committee and comments they believe are tone-deaf as they look to keep their majority next year.

According to Politico’s Laura Barrón-Lopez, Heather Caygle and Jake Sherman:

“ ‘There is not one person of color — black or brown, that I’m aware of — at any position of authority or decision making in the DCCC,’ said Rep. Marcia Fudge Marcia Louise FudgeHere are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment New York bans discrimination against natural hair Democrats already jockeying for House leadership posts MORE (D-Ohio), a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. ‘It is shocking, it is shocking, and something needs to be done about it.’ ”

“And Fudge isn’t alone. Interviews with more than two dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides and strategists detailed months of frustration and unanswered questions about Bustos’ efforts to retain minority staffers in top positions, boost Latino voter outreach and hire firms run by people of color. They charged Bustos of being tactless when challenged by lawmakers of color.

“‘The overall plan for Latino outreach seems to be some 1980s playbook, which doesn't work anymore,’ Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said.

“The DCCC declined to make Bustos available for an interview but said that the ‘DCCC has continued to increase diversity amongst our staff.’

Chlorpyrifos is closely related to nerve agents used in World War II. Trump’s EPA doesn’t care.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joseph G. Allen', 'July At Pm']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/25/this-pesticide-is-closely-related-nerve-agents-used-world-war-ii-trumps-epa-doesnt-care/,"

A sign on a door of the Environmental Protection Agency. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)

Joseph G. Allen is assistant professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and faculty adviser to the Harvard Healthy Building Materials Academy.

Here’s a question: Do you think that a chemical cousin of nerve agents used in World War II that alters the brain function of children should be used as a pesticide? I’d hazard a guess that most people think this is a bad idea. The Trump administration, on the other hand, thinks this is just fine.

What I’m talking about here is the decision from President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency — going against decades of science and its own scientist’s advice —to reject an Obama-era petition to ban the pesticide called chlorpyrifos.

What we know about chlorpyrifos is alarming. Perhaps the most well-known study is one done by researchers at Columbia University who performed brain imaging on young kids with high exposure to chlorpyrifos. The results are shocking and unambiguous. In the words of the researchers: “This study reports significant associations of prenatal exposure to a widely used environmental neurotoxicant, at standard use levels, with structural changes in the developing human brain.”

Yes, you read that right. The pesticide the Trump administration wants to continue to use interferes with childhood brain development. Trump’s EPA assured the public in a statement that “there is good reason” to continue allowing farmers to use the chemical, arguing that “critical questions remained” regarding its harmful effects. Let’s explore the science.

Chlorpyrifos operates by targeting the nervous system of living animals. Here’s how it works: When a nerve cell in our body is stimulated and wants to pass that message to an adjacent nerve cell, it needs a means to pass that message along. Nerve cells do this by releasing a small amount of acetylcholine (ACH) at their terminal end so that adjacent nerve cells can pick up that signal and pass that message along. The receptors on the adjacent nerve cell detect the ACH, which triggers them to “fire,” and the cascade continues, thereby transmitting the signal throughout the brain and body. For that reason, ACH is what is called a neurotransmitter.

The ACH released into the synapse between nerve cells has to be cleaned up quickly so the nerve cells can fire again. Our bodies do this with an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE), that breaks down ACH in less than a millisecond, thus resetting the system.

Here’s where chlorpyrifos comes in. Chlorpyrifos specifically targets this AChE enzyme, thereby preventing the ACH from getting cleared up at the synapse. The result, as you might expect, is an overstimulated nervous system. High levels of chlorpyrifos can cause dizziness, confusion and death. At low levels, it impacts cognitive function — and brain development.

Chlorpyrifos also crosses the placenta.

In this light, the results from the Columbia study make sense and may even be intuitive. Disrupting the finely tuned symphony of messages in our body necessary for normal brain development can lead to changes in brain structure and function.

Other studies have shown harmful effects on kids, too. Chlorpyrifos is associated with reduced IQ and working memory among children as well as delays in psychomotor development. In another study, chlorpyrifos exposure was associated with autism spectrum disorder. In that study of nearly 1,000 pregnancies, proximity to agricultural lands that used chlorpyrifos during the second trimester was associated with a threefold greater likelihood of having a child with ASD.

Of course, it’s not only humans who are at risk here. Chlorpyrifos acts on the same biological pathways in other living species. The National Institutes of Health has labeled chlorpyrifos as “toxic” to birds and “extremely toxic” to fish and bees.

We’ve known this science for a long time now. In fact, chlorpyrifos was banned for use in homes almost 20 years ago in the George W. Bush administration because of concerns over toxicity. The Obama administration followed that with proposing a complete ban in 2015. EPA scientists in 2016 reported that, “expected residues of chlorpyrifos on food crops exceed the safety standard” and “the majority of estimated drinking water exposure from currently registered uses, including water exposure from non-food uses, continues to exceed safe levels.” Now, the Trump administration is denying that ban.

Let’s cut right to the chase: A war on health is underway, and it is being waged through attacks on the environment. To date, the Trump administration has reported more than 80 rollbacks of environmental protections.

Even more disturbing, Trump’s war on health is targeting children. Just a few months ago, his administration announced that it was cutting funding to the Children’s Environmental Health research centers, the flagship institutions around the country that focus on studying how kids are impacted by environmental hazards. In fact, one of these centers at Columbia University produced the landmark research showing that chlorpyrifos altered children’s brains.

One has to wonder: Was the cutting of federal research funds all part of a bigger plan in Trump’s war on kids' health? Consider that Trump’s inauguration fund accepted a $1 million donation from the maker of chlorpyrifos, Dow Chemical Company. The Trump administration also appointed then-Dow chief executive Andrew Liveris to head a White House manufacturing working group, which supported an executive order that mandated the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations.

Shortly thereafter, the EPA announced its intent to deny the chlorpyrifos ban proposal, a decision that Dow supported, unsurprisingly. Today, the toxic chemical has been unleashed, and the pesky scientists warning about it are defunded.

Now ask yourself: Who stands to benefit from this approach? I have the answer: It’s not our kids.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

""The State Department's policy is not only cruel, it is unconstitutional. The government refuses to recognize Jonathan and Derek's marriage and all of Simone's rights as a U.S. citizen,"" Aaron C. Morris, one of the couple's attorneys and executive director of Immigration Equality , said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it does not comment on pending litigation.

Facebook co-founder working with government officials to build anti-trust case against site: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/tech-execs/454820-facebook-co-founder-working-with-government-officials-to-build,"Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes reportedly met with the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and multiple state attorneys general in recent weeks to discuss breaking up Facebook.

Hughes and two prominent antitrust academics, Scott Hemphill and Tim Wu, met with federal and state officials and have laid out a possible antitrust case against the social media giant, The New York Times reported Thursday.

The group argues that Facebook has made “serial defensive acquisitions” to maintain its control over the market and allow the company to hike up advertising prices while also lowering the quality of the user experience, according to The Times.

It is unclear the extent of Hughes’s role in the meetings with regulators, but The Times notes that he could help investigators connect with current and former Facebook employees and competitors. A partly redacted copy of the slides showed the names of people to interview blacked out, the newspaper reports.

The news comes after Department of Justice announced Tuesday that it had launched an investigation into whether the country’s largest tech companies have stifled competition or harmed consumers in its broadest inquiry into potential tech antitrust violations yet. Facebook, Google and Amazon could all be implicated in the probe.

Facebook separately announced Wednesday that the Federal Trade Commission had opened an antitrust investigation into the company on the heels of a record $5 billion privacy fine from the agency over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

Since leaving Facebook more than 10 years ago, Hughes has previously called for the social media giant to be broken up, calling Zuckerberg’s power “unprecedented and un-American” in a May op-ed, pointing to his “staggering” influence at the company that controls Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Hughes wrote that Facebook should be separated into multiple companies and urged the FTC and Justice Department to enforce antitrust laws by undoing the platform’s 2012 acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp."
The Federal Government Plans to Revive the Death Penalty After 16 Years,https://slate.com,['Chip Brownlee'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/justice-department-bill-barr-orders-revival-federal-executions-lethal-injection.html,"Attorney General Bill Barr and President Donald Trump arrive at a press conference on July 11. Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images

On March 19, 2003, the federal government executed Louis Jones Jr., a 53-year-old Gulf War veteran who raped and killed a female soldier. Jones—who died by lethal injection at a federal prison near Terre Haute, Indiana—became the last person executed by the federal government. For 16 years, a combination of successful appeals, limited access to lethal injection drugs, and an effective moratorium during the Obama administration prevented any new executions—until now. In an unexpected announcement, Attorney General Bill Barr on Thursday ordered the Justice Department and Bureau of Prisons, the agency that oversees prisons and the federal death row, to resume the practice.

The Justice Department said five executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and early 2020. (The federal government carried out a total of four executions between 1960 and 2019—one in 1964, three between 2001 and 2003.) Daniel Lewis Lee, a member of a white supremacist group who murdered a family of three, is the first to be executed on Dec. 9. The final of the five executions is scheduled for Jan. 15. All of the executions will take place at the facility in Terre Haute, and the Department of Justice says additional executions will be scheduled “at a later date.”

Mounting difficulty in obtaining lethal injection drugs and uncertainty over the constitutionality of new drug combinations played a part in the lapse in federal executions since 2003. President Barack Obama’s Justice Department also ordered a review of the death penalty following a botched execution in Oklahoma in 2014. Trump’s DOJ said Thursday that the review has been completed and executions can resume, though no one knows what the results of that review are.

The federal government, the DOJ said, will adopt a new lethal injection protocol that replaces a long-used, three-drug cocktail that was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 2008 case, Base v. Rees, but is now difficult to source. The combination of drugs was used in the majority of executions in the United States until a series of events in 2009 and 2010 made it increasingly rare. Domestic and international pharmaceutical suppliers stopped providing sodium thiopental, the anesthetic used as the first step in the three-drug cocktail. A 2012 court injunction also forced the Food and Drug Administration to block importation of the drug from abroad because it was being used for unapproved purposes. The sodium thiopental shortage forced some states to drop the three-drug cocktail altogether in favor of other drugs. Some temporarily halted executions all together. Others replaced thiopental as the first drug in the cocktail with another controversial sedative, midazolam, which has also come under intense scrutiny and legal challenges because of botched executions in Ohio, Arizona, and Oklahoma.

Instead of the three-drug protocol, the federal government plans to use pentobarbital, a barbiturate used often in veterinary medicine and physician-assisted suicides. Since 2010, 14 states have used pentobarbital in more than 200 executions, according to the DOJ. But just how states obtain the drug has been criticized repeatedly and shrouded in secrecy. Texas, Missouri, and Georgia turned to compounding pharmacies—unregulated by the FDA and shielded from public identification—because licensed manufacturers stopped supplying pentobarbital for executions. The manufacturer of pentobarbital even requires its distributors to sign agreements that they won’t give the drugs to states that perform executions.

The DOJ says its protocol will “closely mirror” one currently in use in Texas, Missouri, and Georgia. Texas currently has 27 doses of pentobarbital in stock, more than enough for its scheduled executions. But Texas had done a better than other states at maintaining stock, and that’s only because it’s repeatedly extended expiration dates past the suggested shelf life. That’s on top of criticisms that compounded pentobarbital already degrades more rapidly. Experts say that could reduce the drug’s potency, making death more painful, and attorneys claim two executions in 2018 were botched because of aged drugs. (The DOJ has not responded to questions about how it will obtain the pentobarbital it plans to use.)

President Donald Trump has been an enthusiastic proponent of the death penalty, even going as far as advocating for the death sentence in individual cases. He also said during the 2016 campaign he’d issue an executive order requiring the death sentence for anyone found guilty of killing a police officer. (He never did, and he doesn’t have the authority to do so.) Even though support has declined since the 1990s, a Gallup poll in October 2018 found that 56 percent of Americans still favor the death penalty for murder.*

The administration’s surprise decision to begin executions again is sure to place the death penalty back at the center of the national debate. Just this week, Joe Biden called for an elimination of the federal death penalty even though he’s supported it for years. Only one Democratic candidate for president, according to the Associated Press, has publicly supported preserving the death penalty. That’s Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who has said he’d only leave it as an option for major crimes like terrorism. Top 2020 Democrats are already calling the decision “immoral,” “cruel,” and “deeply flawed.”

"Justice Department won't bring charges against Attorney General William Barr, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after contempt vote",https://www.cnbc.com,['Sunny Kim'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/doj-wont-bring-charges-against-barr-ross-after-contempt-vote.html,"Attorney General William Barr discussing the counting of citizens in the country and the legal issues surrounding that effort, behind him stands Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, in the Rose Garden at the White House.

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."

US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Thinks Outlook for Bitcoin Is Bleak,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/ius-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-thinks-outlook-for-bitcoin-is-bleak,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin commented on cryptocurrency’s future viability, in an interview on Wednesday.

“I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin in 10 years,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “I would bet even in five to six years I won’t even be talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary.”

While Mnuchin’s comments today do not elucidate his specific regulatory policies, he said previously that cryptocurrencies pose “risk to the financial system” if misused like Swiss bank accounts.

To prevent financial crime or monetary distortion, the Secretary has called upon the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to design guidance that will hold cryptocurrencies to the highest standards.

Today he added, “We’re going to make sure we have a unified approach and my guess is that there are going to be more regulations that come out from all these agencies.”

On July 18, Mnuchin erroneously claimed that fiat currencies are not vehicles for money laundering, while “there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.”

Several media outlets – including Squawk Box anchor Joe Kernan, at the time – responded with incredulity. Tom Robinson, CEO of research firm Elliptic, wrote an OpEd for VentureBeat claiming, “Less than 0.5 percent of bitcoin transactions are used for illicit purchases.”

While Mnuchin seems to think crypto’s future is bleak, he continues to bat for the U.S. dollar.

Mnuchin added later in today’s interview, “I think the dollar is the reserve currency in the world. It’s in our interest. We want to maintain it.”

Lawmakers urge Trump to delay $10B defense contract over Amazon conflicts probe,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dozen-reps-urge-trump-to-delay-10b-defense-contract-over-investigation-of-amazon-conflicts,"The Pentagon is gearing up to award a massive $10 billion winner-take-all contract for cloud computing, but 12 members of Congress are pushing President Trump to hold off on the award until after the conclusion of an investigation related to one of the bidders.

The finalists for the large contract -- known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) -- are Amazon and Microsoft, but allegations about conflicts of interest related to Amazon are currently under investigation by the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office. The concerns are based on Defense Department staffers who worked on the deal who previously or subsequently worked for Amazon, or in at least once case, both. The contract is expected to be awarded as soon as August 23.

ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR TARGETS FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AND AMAZON IN BROAD ANTITRUST PROBE

""It is unclear if the [Inspector General's Office] will issue its findings prior to the [Department of Defense's] expected award date in August,"" the lawmakers wrote in their Tuesday letter, which was obtained by Fox News. ""Therefore, we request that your Administration instruct [the Defense Department] not to award JEDI until the [Inspector General's Office] has had an opportunity to complete and report on its investigation.""

The lawmakers who signed Tuesday's letter are all Republicans and include Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sent a similar letter to national security adviser John Bolton last Thursday, seeking a delay to the awarding of the JEDI contract due to a ""lack of competition.""

A bid protest complaint from Oracle, who had also bid on the contract, pointed to the involvement of former Defense Department employee Deap Ubhi, who worked at Amazon before joining the Defense Department in August 2016. Ubhi is now at Amazon once again -- working with Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), the entity that handles cloud computing.

Oracle claimed that Ubhi influenced the decision to grant a single contract so that Amazon could get it. They also said he was involved in setting high standards for bidders that essentially limited the field to Amazon and Microsoft. AWS said in a court filing that Oracle overstated Ubhi’s role in JEDI.

Defense Department spokeswoman Heather Babb told Fox News that the department investigated allegations of conflicts of interest, but ultimately found that the JEDI process was not improperly affected.

""While some potential ethics concerns were raised that have been referred to the DoD OIG, DoD has concluded that there is no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process,"" Babb said.

A federal judge ruled against Oracle earlier this month, leaving the Defense Department left with Amazon and Microsoft as the two finalists.

Last week, President Trump commented on the JEDI contract and said that his administration would ""take a very long look"" at it.

""I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,” Trump said when asked about the matter. ""They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid.""

Trump has feuded for years with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The president has also criticized the Washington Post, which Bezos owns.

Meanwhile, Rep. James Langevin, D-R.I., has expressed opposition to any interference from Trump, given challenges to the bidding process have already been addressed.

Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump,https://thehill.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454805-interior-whistleblowers-say-agency-has-sidelined-scientists-under,"Former Interior Department employees who say they experienced retaliation at the agency for their work on scientific endeavors appeared before lawmakers Thursday, sparking political wrangling over the role of scientists in the Trump administration.

Republicans used the appearances to accuse Democrats of political theater, while Democrats in turn stepped up calls for scientists to be protected.

Among those testifying were Joel Clement, a whistleblower who said he was removed from his work on climate change and reassigned to an accounting role.

Also testifying was Maria Caffrey, who said she had to fight with the Interior Department to keep references to the human contributions to climate change in a report on how sea level rise would impact national parks.

Clement said under the Trump administration, the Interior Department “has sidelined scientists and experts, flattened the morale of the career staff, and by all accounts, is bent on hollowing out the Agency.”

Clement, now a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, said he was removed from his work with 30 Alaska Native communities that were “one big storm away from being wiped right off the map” and needed to be immediately relocated.

Caffrey, whose research was funded by the Interior Department, said she found herself repeatedly demoted at the agency after pushing to keep references to the human impacts of climate change in her report.

“It removes the meaning from my study. I prepared four different climate scenarios for those three different time periods, so those scenarios hang on how much greenhouse gases we produce in the future,” she said, including how much humans contribute to the atmosphere.

“I had become at outcast for standing up,” she added, noting the department told her they didn’t want her help even on a volunteer basis. She is now looking for work in the Denver area.

The hearing was to discuss the Scientific Integrity Act, a bill sponsored by Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoAutomakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California Overnight Energy: House Democrats offer rival to Green New Deal | Zinke clients include industries he regulated | Oil companies dealt blow in Rhode Island climate lawsuit House Democrats announce climate plan to rival Green New Deal with 2050 goal MORE (D-N.Y.) that would add protections for government scientists, including allowing them to publish research outside of government channels and establish a Scientific Integrity Officer.

Several Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee complained the hearing was political theater centered around a bill that would have to pass out of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.

They said there were more complaints about misuse of science under the Obama administration.

“In listening to some of our panelists today you would think that the Trump administration was the only one where there have been issues regarding scientific integrity, and that certainly is not the case,” said Rep. Jody Hice Jody Brownlow HiceThe 27 Republicans who voted with Democrats to block Trump from taking military action against Iran Conservatives ask Barr to lay out Trump's rationale for census question GOP moves to block provision banning use of Defense funds for border wall MORE (R-Ga.).

Tonko said such instances should only strengthen their interest in joining their bill.

“If you believe in science and scientific integrity we should have learned from that past and not look for a reason not to do this,” he said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said that ""it’s no secret that the Trump administration is not a fan of science.”

“There are the stories that career scientists at Interior are too afraid to share. And with good reason. They have seen their colleagues, like our witnesses, get threatened, harassed, reassigned, and retaliated against,” he added.

Scientists have been vocal about what they view as mistreatment under the Trump administration.

They have cited examples, ranging from limiting government-funded scientists from sitting on an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) board to a proposal to limit what kind of studies can be considered by the EPA, to recent plans to relocate U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers and Bureau of Land Management policymakers.

“To purge the language of climate change from the agency entirely is a direct assault on the science we know is very prominent and very clear on the risk to the mission of the agency that we act now to protect real people in harm’s way,” Clement said.

Interior was invited to attend the hearing but did not send a representative.

""The Department of the Interior diligently works to accommodate Congressional invitations to testify,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill, saying it had participated in 59 of 62 Congressional legislative and oversight hearings that the Department has been invited to, or 95 percent, and provided over 65 witnesses for Committees."""
DOJ vows to step up fight against Hezbollah amid Iran tensions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-vows-to-step-up-fight-against-hezbollah-amid-iran-tensions,"A top Justice Department official made it clear Thursday that combating Hezbollah is a top priority for the department, a move that puts pressure on the terrorist organization's sponsor, Iran.

Principal Deputy Attorney General John Cronan, who leads the department's team that investigates Hezbollah financing and narcoterrorism, laid out the government’s efforts and plans for dismantling and neutralizing the Iranian-backed terrorist group during a conference commemorating the victims of the Hezbollah bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina 25 years ago.

The deadly bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish cultural center on July 18, 1994 killed 85 people and injured hundreds more, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentina’s history. Argentina designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist group to coincide with last week's anniversary, something that the State Department did back in 1997.

""Destroying Hezbollah’s support networks and neutralizing the Hezbollah threat is a top priority for this Department of Justice and will continue to be,” Cronan said, though full details of the operations can't be shared.

“Investigations may be covert, charges may be sealed, defendants may be cooperating, and Hezbollah supporters may be facing non-terrorism crimes as we work to build terrorism charges,” he said.

The department is both combating Hezbollah’s terrorist acts and drying up its funding.

Hezbollah is Iran’s top paramilitary force and is among the crown jewels of its foreign influence efforts, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from the Iranian regime. Hezbollah, though based in Lebanon, operates across the Middle East and has made inroads around the world as well on behalf of its Iranian benefactors.

Cronan's comments from the come amid rising tensions with Iran and as the United States increases pressure on the ayatollahs. Iran seized and blew up allied ships and tankers in the Straits of Hormuz off the coast of Iran and shot down a U.S. drone over international waters in recent weeks.

The U.S., which pulled out of the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has been ratcheting up pressure on Iran ever since through increased sanctions and through designating Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group earlier this year, and it brought down Iranian drones in recent days too.

And as the U.S. has tried to limit Iran’s global operations and has called for Iran to cease its funding of terrorist groups, the department made it clear that it will be playing a major role in neutralizing Iran’s Hezbollah proxies.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions created Cronan's team in early 2018 as a coordinated and aggressive response to the “ongoing, sophisticated, and global threat posed by Hezbollah to the United States.” Department prosecutors and investigators will pursuing both non-terrorism and terrorism charges whenever possible, working with a host of federal agencies, and seeking help from foreign allies as well, as they pursue people who provide help to Hezbollah, whether through financial support or the provision of manpower or weaponry, for example.

Samer El Debek and Ali Khourani, for example, were arrested in June 2017 on charges of providing material support to Hezbollah, for which Khourani was found guilty earlier this year. The two were trained by the terrorist organization and then released into the U.S. as sleeper operatives waiting for assignments. Kourani, a years-long Hezbollah operative, trained for possible attacks and conducted surveillance of locations in New York City, such as an FBI federal office building and an Army National Guard facility.

Cronan said that cutting off Hezbollah’s financial support is key, because “money is the lifeblood of any terrorist organization.” He pointed to the recent conviction of multi-billion commodities tycoon Kassim Tajideen, who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for financing Hezbollah and who pleaded guilty in December to a money laundering scheme in evasion of U.S. sanctions on Iran, agreeing to forfeit $50 million to the U.S. government.

Treasury Department, he said, has wide efforts to dismantle Hezbollah's financial networks, including sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related people and entities since 2017. Among those dozens of now-sanctioned Hezbollah financiers were top Hezbollah figures with deep ties to Iran.

Cronan said the U.S. is working with its international allies to root out Hezbollah operatives and funders elsewhere in the world, an effort he put to the conference audience.

“How can we work even better with our partners across the globe? How can we strengthen the capabilities of those partners? How can we most powerfully combat the Hezbollah threat that we all face?”"
Barr says Mueller asked DOJ to send letter limiting testimony to ‘boundaries' of report,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jake Gibson', 'Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics', 'Law Enforcement', 'Intelligence Issues.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-mueller-asked-doj-to-send-him-letter-saying-testimony-must-remain-within-boundaries-of-report,"Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News on Tuesday that it was former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team who asked the Justice Department to send Mueller a letter telling him to keep his upcoming testimony to House lawmakers ""within the boundaries"" of the public version of his Russia probe report.

The letter provoked criticism from Democrats ahead of Wednesday’s highly anticipated hearing, with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler calling it “incredibly arrogant.” Asked by Fox News why the Monday letter was sent, Barr said Mueller’s staff asked the department for guidance ahead of the hearing.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS MUELLER HIS HOUSE TESTIMONY 'MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES' OF PUBLIC REPORT

“At his press conference, Bob had said that he intended to stick with the public report and not go beyond that,” Barr said in an interview. “And in conversations with the department, his staff was reiterating that that was their position and they asked us for guidance in writing to explain or to tell them [what] our position was. So we responded in writing. The department sent the guidance that they requested.""

Asked directly if it was Mueller who asked for the letter, Barr replied, “Yes.”

The letter, obtained by Fox News on Monday, was signed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer.

The letter said, “Should you testify, the Department understands that testimony regarding the work of the Special Counsel's Office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29 -- specifically, that the information you discuss during your testimony appears in, and does ‘not go beyond,’ the public version of your March 22, 2019 report to the Attorney General or your May 29 public statement.""

Speaking to Fox News, Barr also hit back at Nadler, who during a CNN interview Tuesday called the letter “incredibly arrogant” for trying to “instruct” Mueller what to say.

“He was misinformed as to the facts,” Barr said.

The attorney general also declined to comment on the Democratic-controlled House holding him and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt over questions having to do with the Trump administration’s proposed citizenship question to the 2020 census.

“Goes with the territory these days,” Barr said.

On Wednesday, Mueller is expected to testify in public before the House Judiciary Committee for two hours or more, followed by another two hours-plus of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Mueller, meanwhile, also has asked that Aaron Zebley, his former chief of staff and his top aide on the Russia investigation, accompany him at the witness table during Wednesday's hearing.

Republicans are opposed to the request. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the Judiciary panel's top Republican, called the move an ""apparent stunt"" by Democrats. He said it ""shows the lengths Democrats will go to protect a one-sided narrative from a thorough examination by committee Republicans.""

Mueller has only spoken in public once about his investigation – in May, when he signaled his disinterest in testifying, saying, “There has been a discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.”

Still, Democrats – as some in the party push to impeach President Trump – subpoenaed Mueller to testify.

During his press conference in May, Mueller said there “was not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” over whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. But he declined to reach a conclusion over whether the president took steps to obstruct his investigation – something Democrats are expected to focus their questions on Wednesday.

The Trump administration’s latest visa clampdown on Nigeria is targeting high-powered politicians,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/africa/1674848/trump-us-state-dept-issues-travel-ban-on-nigerian-politicians/,"Ahead of Nigeria’s general elections back in February, the United States government said it would consider placing visa restrictions on individuals who undermine the process or are involved in organizing electoral violence.

Earlier this week, it made good on its promise and issued visa restrictions on Nigerians who, it says, “operated with impunity at the expense of the Nigerian people and undermined democratic principles and human rights.” Despite email inquiries from Quartz, the US State Department did not name the banned individuals or state how many politicians are affected.

One reason for that, says Matthew Page, a Chatham House fellow and former US State Department official: “The US doesn’t name and shame because visa information is covered by privacy regulations and thus confidential.” The uncertainty around “who or what type of person was targeted or how many” could also see bad actors continue to fear they are at risk, he adds.

While unconfirmed, it’s likely the visa restrictions have been issued to high-level politicians who typically have enough power and access to resources to possibly “undermine” elections or co-ordinate violence.

The restrictions come after elections which were marred by sporadic violence across several parts of the country: according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based geopolitical intelligence firm, over 600 (pdf) people were killed during the last election season. YIAGA Africa, a coalition of election observers, also described the polls as a missed opportunity for Nigeria’s electoral commission to improve the quality of elections.

On the face of it, a US visa ban does not serve as much of a deterrent for errant politicians who will retain the ability to travel elsewhere or simply choose to remain in Nigeria. But such bans, even when not publicly confirmed, are often politicized as indictments on a politician’s transparency record by opponents. One of the more prominent examples is former vice president and 2019 presidential aspirant Atiku Abubakar who has long struggled to shake off talk of being subjected to visa restrictions by the United States over bribery scandals.

While there is some uncertainty as to the visa bans for politicians, the Trump administration has been explicit about its other clampdown measures on visas for Nigerians: it indefinitely suspended an interview waiver program for Nigerian applicants in May.

Even though the US State Department emphasized the actions are “specific to certain individuals and not directed at the Nigerian people or the newly elected government,” it is likely to further unsettle Nigerians interested in applying for US visas and likely spark more speculation.

"DOJ won't charge William Barr, Wilbur Ross after contempt vote",https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Desiderio'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/24/justice-william-barr-wilbur-ross-1432595,"The Democrat-led House voted to hold Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt last week. | Alex Brandon/AP Photo legal DOJ won't charge William Barr, Wilbur Ross after contempt vote

The Justice Department will not bring criminal charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the Democrat-led House voted last week to hold them in contempt.

In a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said the Cabinet officials’ defiance of congressional subpoenas seeking information about the 2020 census “did not constitute a crime.”

Story Continued Below

“[A]ccordingly the department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the attorney general or the secretary,” Rosen wrote, citing legal precedents from administration of both parties.

Lawmakers never expected the Justice Department to prosecute its own leader and another cabinet official, but Rosen’s letter represented the department’s formal response to a House vote that, in effect, referred Barr and Ross for criminal prosecution.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee subpoenaed both departments earlier this year as part of its investigation into the origins of efforts to add a citizenship question to the census. The Justice and Commerce departments refused to provide the documents requested, and President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege to block the release of those materials.

“The Department of Justice’s long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,” Rosen wrote in his two-page letter to Pelosi.

It remains unclear if the House will go to court to enforce the Oversight Committee’s subpoenas.

The Supreme Court last month blocked the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, and Trump ultimately backed down from the effort after flirting with an executive order.

A crackdown on working from home is pushing the EPA’s workforce in Boston to the brink,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/07/24/limits-telework-could-last-straw-embattled-epa-workers-say/eD4WGzT3XQ2NFV1198xcKL/story.html,"“There’s a lot of things this administration has done that makes it difficult to work here, but this is the first thing that’s really hit staff on a personal level,” said a public liaison for superfund site cleanups who moved to Exeter, N.H. — a nearly two-hour train ride from Boston — in part because of her ability to work from home two days a week, which allows her to pick up her 2-year-old from day care.

The Trump administration’s disregard for the Environmental Protection Agency’s mission has riled many agency veterans, particularly when it comes to sustainability and climate change. But a new crackdown on working from home is pushing the already beleaguered workforce in Boston to the brink.

Like other EPA employees who talked to the Globe, she asked that her name not be used.

The directive has left some staff members scrambling to find last-minute help with child care, the employee said. Others are looking for new jobs.

“This could be the last straw,” she said.

The new policy on remote work requires that, as of Aug. 4, the 10,000 EPA employees around the country who are members of the American Federation of Government Employees must be in the office at least four days a week, including those with compressed work schedules. The directive is part of a widespread attempt to reduce the federal workforce by eroding workers’ rights and driving out career employees who may disagree with President Trump’s beliefs, labor analysts say.

The limits on remote work, which was previously allowed two days a week, are part of a new contract that management refers to as a collective bargaining agreement and the union, which was not involved in any bargaining, calls an illegal “unilateral edict.” The contract also puts new restrictions on union activity, curtailing the amount of time union representatives can spend helping employees during the workday; prohibits union officials from using EPA office space and e-mail addresses for official union work; limits the grievance process; and makes it easier for the agency to fire and discipline workers.

These restrictions align with three executive orders issued by Trump in 2018 to curb the power of federal unions. With these orders being challenged in court, labor analysts say, the administration appears to be trying to instead implement them agency by agency.

Similar contract fights are roiling other government agencies, along with directives that labor analysts say are intended to weaken and reduce the government workforce, such as moving two Department of Agriculture scientific offices from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City and relocating the majority of the staff at Bureau of Land Management headquarters from D.C. to west of the Rockies.

Two-thirds of the roughly 400 employees affected by the USDA move to the Kansas City area have said they would not move, according to the department.

EPA employees are well aware of Trump’s disdain for their agency. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted to eliminate the EPA; after he was elected, officials talked of reducing the workforce by half.

Boston EPA employees held a rally July 16 to protest the policy changes, and railed at managers during a meeting the same day. The fact that the agency did not provide any explanation about their decision to reduce telework, simply saying it was going to improve efficiency, infuriated the staff. “To not provide any evidence in a science organization is not acceptable,” one person said, according to employees in the meeting.

In the Boston office, union president Steve Calder estimates that around 90 percent of the 450 employees in his bargaining unit work from home one or two days a week. Those who work four days a week will no longer be allowed to work from home at all.

“Morale is in the toilet,” said Calder, noting that some workers are blaming the union for the loss of remote work days because it refused to negotiate. “The Trump administration loves chaos. . . . That’s part of their MO: chaos, infighting, fear.”

Talks between the EPA and the union ground to a halt in mid-June, when AFGE filed a grievance over the agency’s effort to renegotiate the entire contract and walked away from the bargaining table. On July 8, the EPA implemented a new contract, a spokesperson said, “as is the agency’s right following the union’s refusal to bargain.”

“The contract provides more accountability and efficiency in dealings between the union, employees, and management, consistent with the direction set by the Administration,” the spokesperson said.

Already, so many longtime employees have left the EPA nationwide that there is a significant experience gap among the ranks, according to a scientist in the Boston office. And the recent changes will only add to the brain drain. “There will be more longer term damage in the loss of institutional knowledge,” she said.

And that is exactly the point, said David Madland, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Anyone who has scientific evidence showing that climate change is caused by humans and is capable of causing significant harm, for instance, is a threat to Trump’s beliefs, Madland said. Earlier this month, a State Department intelligence analyst resigned after the White House blocked parts of his written testimony to Congress citing evidence that climate change is a threat to national security.

“By weakening unions and undermining expertise, it gives Trump greater power to do what he wants without anyone having the ability to challenge him on it,” Madland said.

But according to John York, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, federal unions are in need of reform. Public sector employees already have more statutory protections than workers in the private sector, he said.

Federal unions are pushing back particularly hard since the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, he said, which reduced unions’ ability to collect fees from workers and put them on the defensive.

“Many of the forgotten men in Trump’s base see federal employees as more protected, higher paid, less hard-working than they are,” said York, who nonetheless insisted that the union changes were not politically motivated. “I think Trump’s efforts are trying to get federal personnel practices more in line with the rest of the labor market.”

An attorney at the Boston EPA office noted that, like other employees, she could have made more money in the private sector. But, in addition to believing in the mission, the attorney valued the benefits and flexibility of working for the government. Now all of that is under fire.

The administration’s attitude seems to be: “We’re going to make it difficult for you to carry out your mission of using science and the law to protect the environment,” said the attorney, who lives an hour south of Boston and had been planning to increase her remote-work schedule so she could do more day care drop-offs and pickups. “And now we’re also going to make it difficult for you to spend time with your families.”

The clampdown at the EPA is part of an “unmistakable pattern” of hostility toward public servants, said Sharon Block, a former labor adviser to former president Barack Obama who runs the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.

And the repercussions could go far beyond the current workforce.

“There’s just a point at which you can’t help but impact the level of service,” she said, “when you’ve so degraded those who provide the service.”

Justice Department launches antitrust probe into big tech,https://arstechnica.com,['Kate Cox'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-into-big-tech/,"The Department of Justice is launching an antitrust probe into some of the world's biggest and most influential tech companies, the agency announced Tuesday.

The department's Antitrust Division, which is responsible for reviewing and enforcing issues relating to mergers, monopolies, competition, and price-fixing, said its review would ""consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Makan Delrahim, head of the Antitrust Division, said. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The DOJ didn't name any names, but the list of ""market-leading online platforms"" accused of stifling competition through dishonest tactics, or simply of being too big for competitors to exist against, generally has Amazon, Facebook, and Google at the top; all three companies' stocks immediately tanked following the announcement.

Reports by several media outlets earlier this year, citing the ever-popular ""sources familiar with the matter,"" indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission were planning something of a divide-and-conquer approach to tech sector regulation, with the DOJ digging into Apple and Google, and the FTC handling Amazon and Facebook.

Widespread scrutiny

The Justice Department is just the latest, not the first, body to take a hard look at what the tech sector has gotten up to in the past decade.

Congress kicked off its own probe into big tech's behavior last month, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee launched a bipartisan investigation into ""competition in digital markets."" The subcommittee chair, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) at the time called the growth of monopolies in the US economy ""one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today.""

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is one of the party's leading candidates in the 2020 presidential primary race, in March issued a call to use existing antitrust law to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

Traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers have also been asking regulators to update antitrust policy in order to rein in Google and Amazon, which dominate the online marketplace through what the retailers say are anticompetitive practices.

The DOJ is also lagging behind its international peers. Germany, Austria, Italy, and the European Union have all launched separate antitrust investigations into Amazon's behavior with third-party merchants on its marketplace since November, and the EU has fined Google billions of dollars four separate times in recent years for violations of European monopoly law."

In an interview with Squawk Box CNBC on July 24, Mnuchin said:

“I won’t be talking about Bitcoin in 10 years, I can assure you that […] I would bet even in 5 or 6 years I’m no longer talking about Bitcoin as Treasury Secretary. I’ll have other priorities […] I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on Bitcoin.”

Mnuchin’s latest remarks follow a recent statement about how cryptocurrencies primarily exist as a vehicle for crime and speculative investment, saying, “I think to a large extent, these cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activities and speculation.”

However, CEO and Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert celebrated the Treasury Secretary’s remarks, saying that they were “complete and total validation of Bitcoin.”

Money Laundering

Mnuchin also recently claimed that fiat money is not laundered to the extent that Bitcoin is. In a separate Squawk Box interview, Mnuchin said that the U.S. has the strongest Anti-Money Laundering system in the world. Bitcoin, on the other hand, he believes is vulnerable to money laundering.

Trump’s DOJ Brings Back Capital Punishment,http://nymag.com,['Adam K. Raymond'],07-25-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trumps-doj-brings-back-capital-punishment.html,"The execution chamber in the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images

After nearly two decades without an execution, the federal government will put five people to death in December and January, the Justice Department announced on Thursday.

The DOJ also announced a change to the execution process. The traditional three-drug cocktail used for lethal injections with be replaced with the single drug pentobarbital. A handful of states have made a similar move after sodium thiopental, one of the three drugs used in the cocktail, became difficult to obtain after foreign manufacturers refused to sell it for use in executions.

In a statement, Attorney General William Barr said, “We owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

The DOJ announcement marks an end to an unofficial moratorium on federal executions. The death penalty is legal in 29 states, which execute around two dozen people each year. But the federal government hasn’t executed anyone since 2003 and has only put three people to death since 1976. The five inmates whose executions have been scheduled for December and January have “exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies,” according to the Justice Department. All have been “convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly.”

While it’s been nearly two decades since a federal inmate was executed, people were still sentenced to death during that time. In the past decade, death sentences were handed down to high-profile inmates such as Dylann Roof and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

But the number of federal death-penalty cases has increased under President Trump, a vocal fan of capital punishment. In 1989, he placed an ad in four New York City newspapers calling for the execution of the Central Park Five, who were later exonerated.

In 1989, Trump bought this ad to inflame public sentiment against teens known as the Central Park Five, who were later exonerated by DNA evidence.

The House last week voted mostly along party lines, 230-198, to hold Barr and Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas, in a largely symbolic effort. House Democrats were seeking information about Trump's efforts to add the controversial question.

Trump asserted executive privilege and told Barr and Ross not to release certain documents in response to the subpoenas from the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

BOOKER INTRODUCES BILL TO RESTRICT USE OF CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION

""The Department of Justice's longstanding position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a Wednesday letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of lying about the origin of the citizenship question. Critics of the question have suggested it was intended to discourage immigrant participation in the census, affecting the population figures that determine legislative representation.

Neither Pelosi nor House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., immediately responded to Fox News for comment Wednesday.

Rosen said the DOJ has taken the same position across several administrations. He cited a 2008 case in which the agency declined to prosecute Joshua Bolten and Harriet Miers, two high-ranking Bush administration officials who refused to testify before a panel investigating the firing of several U.S. attorneys.

TRUMP DECLARES PUSH FOR CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION NOT OVER, CALLS REPORTS ‘FAKE’

Bush directed Bolten, then the White House chief of staff, and Miers, White House counsel, not to release certain documents or to provide certain testimony related to a congressional subpoena.

The department took a similar position in 2012 when former President Barack Obama directed Attorney General Eric Holder to withhold certain documents related to the government gun-running project, dubbed Operation Fast and Furious.

In accordance with the policy, the department determined the responses by Barr and Ross to the subpoenas ""did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen said.

A group of state attorneys general met with U.S. Attorney General William Barr today to discuss antitrust concerns related to major tech companies, as the Justice Department launches a review of whether online platforms are reducing competition.

States, including New York, Texas, Arizona and Louisiana, sent representatives to the Justice Department for the meeting with senior officials.

""Our bipartisan coalition of eight state attorneys general was pleased with the opportunity to meet with U.S. Attorney General Barr to talk about the real concerns consumers across the country have with big tech companies stifling competition on the internet,"" participating states said in a joint statement. ""It was a productive meeting and we're considering a range of possible antitrust actions against such companies.""

In her own statement, New York Attorney General Tish James said of the state AGs, “We have concerns about the size of these tech companies and will hold them accountable for anticompetitive practices that endanger privacy and consumer data.”

Some of the states that had planned to attend the meeting, including Arizona, have opened inquiries into Google. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich has reportedly been investigating Google over its location tracking practices.

A spokesperson for Brnovich's office said the discussion at the DOJ, which also included Deputy U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, focused on online platforms and consumer protection concerns raised by the states.

The potential state action adds yet another layer to the growing scrutiny of the power of online platforms. In announcing its antitrust review this week, the DOJ said it will consider ""widespread concerns"" expressed about search, social media and online retail services.

“We are all aware that DOJ has an antitrust review of big tech companies underway, and the states are currently weighing all of their options and possible courses of action,” said Ryan Anderson, a spokesperson for the Arizona AG’s office. “There’s not many things Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump agree upon, but that should demonstrate the seriousness of these issues and the extent to which all options are being considered.”

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has called for breaking up big tech companies as part of her presidential campaign. President Donald Trump has floated potential antitrust action against major platforms, but has also repeatedly accused tech companies of an anti-conservative bias.

Meanwhile, Facebook revealed this week that it's facing an antitrust investigation the FTC launched in June.

Judge Rules Trump’s EPA Flouting Clean Air Act As Denver Ozone Spikes Again,https://www.westword.com,['Chase Woodruff'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.westword.com/news/judge-rules-trump-epa-flouting-clean-air-act-as-denver-ozone-spikes-again-11422270,"As ozone pollution in the Denver metro area took another turn for the worse this week, a federal judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency is violating clean-air laws by delaying a key decision on local air-quality standards.

In a ruling issued Monday, July 22, Judge John Kane of the U.S. District Court in Denver found that EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has “failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty” by delaying a determination regarding the metro area’s classification under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution. The partial summary judgment came as a result of a lawsuit filed by environmental group WildEarth Guardians against Wheeler and the EPA earlier this year. Court filings show that the agency didn’t object to Kane’s ruling.

“This is the Trump administration’s EPA on full display,” says Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and energy program director. “They just refuse to comply with the law. They’re willing to keep dragging their feet to the point where they get ruled against in court, because they don’t want to comply. They don’t want to have to clamp down.”

The group's lawsuit revolves around a regulatory decision that was due to be made by the EPA earlier this year. For more than a decade now, a nine-county region known as the Denver Metro/North Front Range Nonattainment Area has exceeded federal standards for ozone pollution that were set by the agency in 2008. The state faced a January 2019 deadline to bring the area's air quality into compliance, or be reclassified from ""moderate nonattainment"" to ""serious nonattainment,"" which would require regulators to impose stricter regulations on polluters. The state missed the deadline — air pollution in Denver got worse last year, not better — but the EPA's attainment determination hasn't yet been made.

""This is a simple finding that they need to make,"" says Nichols. ""It's not a complicated action. It's very clear that Colorado failed to meet the 2008 ozone air-quality standards, so this shouldn't be happening. It's a sign of how nuts the Trump administration is, and how they just refuse to take their legal duties seriously. And unfortunately, it's our clean air that suffers.""

The EPA did not respond directly to questions regarding the attainment determination and when it's expected to be made. ""EPA supports the state’s efforts to address ozone issues along the Front Range,"" EPA Region 8 spokesperson Lisa McClain-Vanderpool said in an email. ""The Agency does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

Monday's court ruling came as ozone pollution in Denver began to rise to its highest level of the year so far, reaching an eight-hour Air Quality Index of 133 on Tuesday, July 23. Parts of metro Denver reached one-hour ozone concentrations of 100 parts per billion on Monday and Tuesday, according to state air-quality data — levels that are considered “unhealthy” for all groups on the AQI scale.

High levels of ozone pollution are expected to continue along the Front Range this week. In a forecast issued this morning, officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned that ""active children and adults, and people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion"" in the afternoon and evening, when ozone levels are typically at their daily peak.

Ground-level ozone is a so-called criteria pollutant that can cause a wide variety of negative health effects, from acute symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath to chronic conditions like asthma and emphysema. It's formed primarily by the interaction between sunlight and ""ozone precursors"" like volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. In Denver, studies have shown that the two largest sources of ozone-forming pollutants are motor vehicles and oil and gas facilities along the Front Range, both of which can account for up to 40 percent of local ozone production on a given day.

A reclassification to serious nonattainment by the EPA would force CDPHE regulators to subject those emissions sources to a higher degree of scrutiny and regulation. In March, Governor Jared Polis withdrew a state request, made by his predecessor John Hickenlooper, for an extension to meet the federal ozone standards. ""There’s more we can do to protect our air quality and health, and we should do it sooner not later,"" Polis said at the time.

Even if the extension hadn't been withdrawn, it would have expired last week. Nichols and WildEarth Guardians, along with other environmental groups, have launched a campaign to pressure the CDPHE to act now, without waiting for the Trump administration to finally tell state officials what they already know.

""Having the backing of the EPA's finding forces them to [act], but the state shouldn't have to be forced to clean up the air,"" Nichols says. ""They could start to implement more rigorous permitting; they could start to put emissions on track. They could be taking some actions now.""

The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Potential sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders. The State accused blockchain-based online marketplace Pocketinns of selling over $400,000 in securities to investors, without registering with the state’s associated bureau."

Comey's inside man at White House emerges as DOJ inspector general finalizes FISA abuse report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/comeys-inside-man-at-white-house-emerges-as-doj-inspector-general-finalizes-fisa-abuse-report,"Former FBI Director James Comey had an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017.

Now this individual, who after leaving the government was hired by BuzzFeed to verify parts of British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier, may be tied to an investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI being conducted by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

This previously unreported mole in the White House appears in a new report by RealClearInvestigations that explored possible misconduct by Comey for what two U.S. officials described as essentially ""running a covert operation against"" the president even as he was assuring Trump he was not the subject of any investigation.

Anthony Ferrante, a longtime FBI official, worked as a cybersecurity adviser on the National Security Council. Officials said Ferrante was working in the White House even while the FBI held him on reserve status. All the while, he was sharing information about Trump and his aides back to FBI headquarters.

One former National Security Council official said Ferrante's unique position was highly irregular.

“In an unprecedented action, Comey created a new FBI reserve position for Ferrante, enabling him to have an ongoing relationship with the agency, retaining his clearances and enabling him to come back in [to bureau headquarters],” the official said, adding that the NSC division supervisor was ""not allowed to get rid of Ferrante"" and that the arrangement appeared to be ""in direct conflict with the no-contact policy between the White House and the Department of Justice.""

Ferrante left the White House in April 2017, not long before Trump fired Comey as FBI director.

He went on to join FTI Consulting, a business-advising firm headquartered in Washington, D.C. Through this firm, Ferrante was hired by BuzzFeed to investigate the dossier composed by Steele, to try and corroborate the unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia that appear in the research.

Ferrante was replaced in the White House by another FBI official, Jordan Rae Kelly, who signed security logs for Ferrante to enter the White House while he was contracted by BuzzFeed. Kelly left the White House last year and also joined FTI Consulting.

The FBI declined to comment for this report.

The dossier was published by BuzzFeed in January 2017 after reports came out that Comey privately briefed then-President-elect Trump on select allegations from Steele's work at a Trump Tower briefing. This meeting in New York, which came one day after Comey met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office with some of his top administration officials, is now under scrutiny by Horowitz's team.

In what has become an urgent area of consternation for Republican lawmakers, the FBI relied heavily on Steele's unverified dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants filed to surveil onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Four FISA warrant applications and renewals were filed from October 2016 through June 2017 against Page. Steele was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and his dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign.

While under contract for BuzzFeed, Ferrante compiled a report that was filed in federal court as part of a lawsuit over the publication of the dossier. He found that internet service providers mentioned in the dossier that were owned by Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev may have been used by Russian agents to support the hack of the DNC and the campaign chairman of Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 election. Unlike Steele's dossier, Ferrante's report did not directly link Gubarev or his executives to the hacking. “I have no evidence of them actually sitting behind a keyboard,” Ferrante said in a deposition.

It is unclear whether Ferrante is still working for BuzzFeed. A spokesman for the outlet declined to comment on questions from the Washington Examiner about Ferrante. Ferrante did not immediately return an emailed request for comment from the Washington Examiner and a spokeswoman at FTI Consulting declined comment to RealClearInvestigations, as did Comey's attorney.

Horowitz's team has reviewed more than 1 million records and conducted more than 100 interviews, including with Comey and Steele. The information provided by Steele was reportedly interesting or credible enough to justify extending the length of the investigation, which Attorney General William Barr earlier this year had predicted would be complete by May or June.

House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins said over the weekend he expects the inspector general's report to be released this fall. The RealClearInvestigations report puts a release date sometime in September.

Meanwhile Attorney General William Barr is conducting a review of the origins of the Russia investigation, and he has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and to subpoena people outside of the government."
Kansan is 3rd on the list as Justice Dept. resumes first executions since 2003,https://www.wibw.com,"['Nick Viviani', 'Michael Balsamo']",,,,https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Kansas-man-is-3rd-on-the-list-as-Justice-Dept-resumes-first-executions-since-2003-513198431.html,"A Kansan is slated to be among the first people put to death after the Dept. of Justice says it will begin carrying out executions of death row inmates for the first time since 2003.

In making the announcement Thursday, the agency listed five inmates who are scheduled to be executed starting in December.

The third person on that list, Wesley Ira Purkey, was convicted of raping and murdering a teenage girl at his Lansing home in January 1998. His execution date is set for December 13.

According to prosecutors, Purkey went to Kansas City, Missouri, on January 22, 1998, for a job interview. Afterwards, he smoked crack and began driving around when he spotted 16-year-old Jennifer Long. Luring her into his truck and refusing to let her go, Purkey drove back to his home where he raped he,r then stabbed her repeatedly until his blade broke. Over the next several days, he dismembered, burned, and dumped Long's body into a septic tank.

He was convicted of kidnapping a child, resulting in the child's death on November 5, 2003, and sentenced to die.

Separately, Purkey has been convicted of using a claw hammer to bludgeon to death a 80-year-old woman who suffered from polio and walked with a cane, the Justice Dept. pointed out.

The DOJ noted that Purkey, like all of the other inmates who have had their execution dates scheduled, have exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies. They do not foresee any impediments to stop the executions.

In 2014, following a botched state execution in Oklahoma, then-President Barack Obama directed the department to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs. It remains unclear today what came of that review and whether it will change the way the federal government carries out executions.

That review has been completed and the executions can continue, the department said.

Executions on the federal level have been rare. The government has put to death only three defendants since restoring the federal death penalty in 1988, the most recent of which occurred in 2003, when Louis Jones was executed for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of a young female soldier.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a news release. ""The Justice Department upholds the rule of law and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.""

Capital punishment has emerged as a flashpoint in the Democratic presidential primary, with former Vice President Joe Biden this week shifting to call for the elimination of the federal death penalty after years of supporting it. Biden's criminal justice plan also would encourage states to follow the federal government in ending the death penalty, 25 years after he helped pass a tough crime bill that expanded capital punishment for more potential offenses.

The lone Democratic White House hopeful who has publicly supported preserving capital punishment in certain circumstances is Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who has said he would leave it open as an option for major crimes such as terrorism.

Mueller scrambles hearing by tapping top deputy as counsel,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/23/nadler-doj-mueller-testimony-1426721,"Robert Mueller's spokesman Jim Popkin on Monday said he didn’t know yet who would be joining the former special counsel at the hearing | Carolyn Kaster/AP File Photo Legal Mueller scrambles hearing by tapping top deputy as counsel Republicans called the plan a 'stunt' that could be a breach of House rules.

Robert Mueller’s top deputy will appear alongside him for his highly anticipated testimony on Wednesday, according to congressional aides familiar with the preparations, a last-minute curveball that came despite the Justice Department's demand that Mueller’s deputies refrain from testifying.

Aaron Zebley, Mueller’s longtime right-hand man, will appear as Mueller’s counsel when he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning; but he will be formally sworn in as a witness for the House Intelligence Committee’s hearing with the former special counsel later that afternoon, an aide said.

Story Continued Below

Republicans said any decision to allow Zebley to accompany Mueller as a sworn-in witness would represent a breach of their tentative negotiations. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, called the prospect a “stunt” and said it could “jeopardize whether tomorrow's hearing complies with the rules of the House.”

“If Democrats believe it is the special counsel’s responsibility to testify to his report, they have no ground for outsourcing that duty at the expense of our committee’s integrity,” Collins said.

No Republicans on the Intelligence Committee, however, joined the public outcry.

Mueller spokesman Jim Popkin on Tuesday confirmed Zebley’s appearance for Mueller’s five hours of combined testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees.

“Aaron Zebley was the deputy special counsel and had day-to-day oversight of the investigations conducted by the office,” Popkin said. “He will accompany special counsel Mueller to the Wednesday hearings, as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago.”

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, cautioned that Mueller — not Zebley — would be answering lawmakers’ questions.

“Our intention is that Mueller do the testifying and not have someone else do it for him,” Schiff said. “Now, there may be questions that one of his team is better situated to answer of a technical nature. But we don't want a hearing with Bob Mueller converted to a hearing with someone else.”

Both Zebley and James Quarles, another Mueller deputy, initially were expected to testify before the Judiciary and Intelligence committees behind closed doors, but those sessions were called off amid opposition from Attorney General William Barr.

Barr has said that Mueller’s deputies should not testify, and he suggested that the Justice Department would move to block them from appearing if the committees issued subpoenas to compel their testimony. It is unclear whether the Justice Department will try to disrupt Wednesday’s arrangement.

The move threatens to further inflame tensions between the Justice Department and House Democrats. Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump’s Justice Department as “incredibly arrogant” for instructing Mueller to limit the scope of his testimony Wednesday before the Judiciary and Intelligence panels.

But the New York Democrat predicted that the Justice Department’s Monday directive would not affect Wednesday’s highly anticipated pair of hearings with the former special counsel.

“I don't think it's much of an impediment, simply because Bob Mueller had indicated repeatedly that he was going to do exactly that,” Nadler said on CNN. “I think it's incredibly arrogant of the department to try to instruct him as to what to say. It's a part of the ongoing cover-up by the administration to keep information away from the American people, but I think that it's not going to have a real impact.”

And in a letter to Mueller late Tuesday night, Schiff said the Trump administration was seeking to “obstruct the authorized oversight activity and legitimate investigations of the committee.”

“The committee rejects the limitations that the Department of Justice has attempted to place on your testimony on the eve of your appearance before our committee,” Schiff added.

Mueller has stated that his 448-page report “is my testimony” and that he does not intend to speak about topics that were not already made public, presenting Democrats with a challenge when Mueller appears before the House Judiciary and Intelligence panels.

And on Monday, the Justice Department told Mueller that his testimony “must remain within the boundaries of your public report” because the president has asserted executive privilege over the investigation’s underlying evidence, POLITICO first reported.

Nadler said on Tuesday that Democratic lawmakers have “been operating under the assumption that he'll do essentially what he said — he'll stay more or less within the bounds of the report.” But the chairman also said Mueller “does not have to comply” with the Justice Department directives.

“He doesn't work for them,” Nadler said, “and that letter asks things that are beyond the power of the agency to ask even if he still worked for them.”

Despite the Justice Department’s letter to Mueller, it is unlikely the department will insist on having a lawyer in the room during Mueller’s testimony to lodge objections to certain questions — essentially relying on Mueller to self-police his remarks. Mueller is known to strictly adhere to Justice Department guidelines, and Democrats do not expect him to deviate from that practice,

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/806/1155968404_6063098476001_6063107661001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

In May, Trump asserted executive privilege over Mueller’s entire report and underlying materials. The move came after the Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for the unredacted report and all evidence underpinning it, and the Justice Department’s defiance of that subpoena led the panel to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

Democrats are eager to ask Mueller several questions about his investigation and his legal conclusions, including whether he would have charged Trump with obstruction of justice if he were not the president — a reference to Justice Department policy that prohibits the indictment of a sitting president. While Mueller is unlikely to answer that question directly, Democrats say there are other ways to illuminate Mueller’s decision not to formally accuse the president of committing a crime.

The Judiciary Committee is expected to focus on five specific episodes of potential obstruction of justice — ones that, according to Mueller, met all three elements required for an obstruction charge.

Judiciary Committee Democrats held a mock hearing on Tuesday afternoon to prepare for their questioning of Mueller. They also rehearsed how they would respond to efforts by Republicans to discredit Mueller’s investigation or lodge procedural objections that could delay the hearing.

House Democrats are planning an all-out messaging blitz over the next few days, blanketing social media with excerpts of Mueller’s report and real-time clips from the hearing. It’s an effort to amplify any of the material Mueller gives them and line it up with the most damaging details of his report.

Democrats also have put together a five-page set of talking points for their colleagues who aren’t as deeply immersed in the Mueller report, distilling Mueller’s dense findings into a digestible summary they can use to help spread the caucus-wide message.

The Justice Department’s antitrust investigation is cause for caution,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-justice-departments-antitrust-investigation-is-cause-for-caution/2019/07/24/0ae8725e-ae43-11e9-bc5c-e73b603e7f38_story.html,"BIG TECH, meet Big Brother.

The Justice Department announced Tuesday a broad-based antitrust review of “the practices of market-leading online platforms,” without naming any names — and without explaining exactly what practices officials believe could be anti-competitive. The country is still catching up to a new era in which a handful of Internet companies have substantial power over Americans’ daily lives, and that power is worth examining. But the scope and circumstances of the investigation announced this week are cause for caution.

Increased interest across the government in scrutinizing top tech firms’ market behavior signals the erosion of the argument that platforms providing free services cannot possibly run afoul of authorities. Some critics believe industry giants are unfairly leveraging their dominance to bury rivals on the Web where Americans cannot see them or sucking up their data to drive them out of the game. Others think so much control resting with so few is itself a problem. President Trump and his allies, however, have seized on a highly specific grievance: Silicon Valley is too liberal, and its leaders are censoring conservatives online.

There is no evidence to support claims of censorship, yet conservatives have turned multiple oversight hearings into circuses full of rhetorical acrobatics and accusations. Only this month, Mr. Trump convened a “social media summit” similarly designed to bully companies for not behaving the way he wants. Last week, he promised to “take a look” at Google after allegations that the company was committing treason by working with the Chinese government. And in June, he explicitly connected Facebook, Google and Amazon to his electoral prospects. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.) “The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies,” he told CNBC. “They were so against me during my election run. Everybody said, ‘If you don’t have them, you can’t win.’ Well, I won. And I’ll win again.”

It is wishful to think that an increasingly political Justice Department operates independent of these pressures. We already know the president reportedly sought to push authorities to block a major media merger because of his animosity toward CNN. And last September, officials said outright that a meeting with state attorneys general about antitrust would revolve around concerns that companies were “intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms” — giving the lie to the argument that enthusiasm for a probe is untethered from the president’s perennial personal gripes.

Antitrust investigations should be targeted to particular practices by particular companies that hurt consumers or impede competition. They should not be a cudgel brandished against an entire industry for a vague set of violations that could well include having Democratic employees and leaders. Antitrust advocates worried about the concentration of power in one place should take care not to champion an even more dangerous accumulation in another."
