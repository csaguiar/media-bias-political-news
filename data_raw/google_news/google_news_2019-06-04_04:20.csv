Judge tosses House Dems' lawsuit over Trump's use of emergency military funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-house-dems-lawsuit-trump-emergency-military-funds-border-wall,"Washington, D.C., district court Judge Trevor McFadden threw out House Democrats' lawsuit seeking an injunction against President Trump's emergency border wall funding reallocation, saying that the matter is fundamentally a political dispute and that the politicians lack standing to make a legal case.

Trump had declared a national emergency this past February over the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, following Congress' failure to fund his border wall legislatively. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Democrats then filed suit in April, charging that Trump was ""stealing from appropriated funds” by moving $6.7 billion from other projects toward border wall construction.

Democrats argued that the White House had ""flouted the fundamental separation-of-powers principles and usurped for itself legislative power specifically vested by the Constitution in Congress.""

But, in his ruling, McFadden, a Trump appointee, suggested Democrats were trying to circumvent the political process.

""This case presents a close question about the appropriate role of the Judiciary in resolving disputes between the other two branches of the Federal Government. To be clear, the court does not imply that Congress may never sue the Executive to protect its powers,"" McFadden wrote in his opinion. ""The Court declines to take sides in this fight between the House and the President.""

McFadden's ruling contrasted with U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam’s injunction last week, which blocked the administration from using the reallocated funds for projects in specific areas in Texas and Arizona. Gilliam had been appointed by then-President Barack Obama.

McFadden began by focusing on two guiding Supreme Court cases he called ""lodestars""-- the 2015 case Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, and the 1997 case Raines v. Byrd.

""Read together, Raines and Arizona State Legislature create a spectrum of sorts,"" McFadden wrote. ""On one end, individual legislators lack standing to allege a generalized harm to Congress’s Article I power. On the other end, both chambers of a state legislature do have standing to challenge a nullification of their legislative authority brought about through a referendum.""

But, McFadden quickly distinguished the Arizona State Legislature case, which found institutional standing for legislators only in a limited instance. The Arizona case, the judge noted, ""does not touch or concern the question whether Congress has standing to bring a suit against the President,"" and the Supreme Court has found there was ""no federal analogue to Arizona’s initiative power.""

Democrats' dispute was more similar to the one in the Raines case, McFadden wrote. Under the framework and factors considered in Raines -- including how similar matters have been handled historically, and the availability of other remedies besides litigation -- McFadden ruled that House Democrats lacked standing.

Concerning past historical practice, the Trump administration argued in its brief that when Congress was concerned about ""unauthorized Executive Branch spending in the aftermath of World War I, it responded not by threatening litigation, but by creating the General Accounting Office."" The judge cited that argument approvingly in his opinion, calling it ""persuasive.""

Examples of hotly debated political questions being resolved without involving the courts, McFadden continued, ""abound"" throughout history.

PRIVATELY FUNDED BORDER WALL CONSTRUCTION BEGINS IN EL PASO

For example, McFadden wrote, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""fired an official from his Senate-confirmed position at the Federal Trade Commission. ...The President removed the official without providing a reason. ... The Senate likely had a 'strong[] claim of diminution of' its Advice and Consent power. ... Yet the Senate made no effort to challenge this action in court.""

Additionally, McFadden said Democrats retained constitutional legislative options with which to remedy their objections about the president's purported misuse of the Appropriations Clause. Under Supreme Court precedent in the Raines case, McFadden asserted, the existence of those additional options suggested Democrats lacked standing.

McFadden noted in particular that Democrats retained the power to modify or even repeal the appropriations law if they wanted to ""exempt future appropriations"" from the Trump administration's reach.

Because the White House had not ""nullified"" that legislative power, McFadden wrote, there was no urgent need for judicial intervention sufficient to override the considerations of the political question doctrine, which holds that courts generally stay out of politically sensitive matters best left to voters.

""Congress has several political arrows in its quiver to counter perceived threats to its sphere of power,"" McFadden wrote. ""These tools show that this lawsuit is not a last resort for the House. And this fact is also exemplified by the many other cases across the country challenging the administration's planned construction of the border wall.""

McFadden continued: ""The House retains the institutional tools necessary to remedy any harm caused to this power by the Administration’s actions. Its Members can, with a two-thirds majority, override the President’s veto of the resolution voiding the National Emergency Declaration. They did not. It can amend appropriations laws to expressly restrict the transfer or spending of funds for a border wall under Sections 284 and 2808. Indeed, it appears to be doing so.""

The judge added that House Democrats had the burden of demonstrating that they had standing -- a difficult hurdle for any plaintiff to clear, which involves showing a particularized injury that the court can address.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES ESCALATING TARIFFS ON MEXICO UNTIL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 'STOP'

To that end, McFadden quoted former Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in the seminal 1803 case Marbury v. Madison, in which Marshall wrote, the ""province of the [C[ourt is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to enquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion.""

McFadden also wrote, quoting from another Supreme Court case, ""Intervening in a contest between the House and President over the border wall would entangle the Court 'in a power contest nearly at the height of its political tension' and would 'risk damaging the public confidence that is vital to the functioning of the Judicial Branch.'""

Lawmakers expressly approved only $1.375 billion in the weeks after the shutdown, to go toward funding to 55 miles of wall along the southern border. But, Trump said that was inadequate, and he pushed ahead by moving funds from other Homeland Security projects previously approved by legislators. In his budget request earlier this year, Trump formally requested another $8.6 billion from Congress, saying that would be sufficient to build more than 700 miles of wall.

The emergency-appropriated funding alone could be used to build more than 230 miles of barriers.

At a hearing in May, McFadden hinted that courts should stay out of the matter -- and suggested an appeal was imminent regardless.

""I’m not sure how much necessarily our views will carry the day for the courts above us,"" McFadden said at the hearing.

Disagreement already has been brewing in the lower courts, setting the stage for appellate panels to step in. Gillam, the Northern District of California judge who ruled last month that Trump was likely breaking the law by reallocating the wall funds, blocked some projects slated for immediate construction in Yuma and El Paso.

""In short, the position that when Congress declines the Executive’s request to appropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds without Congress does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the earliest days of our Republic,"" Gilliam wrote."
"Kushner Sees a Problem in Trump’s Fund-Raising, but Not Everyone Agrees",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Annie Karni']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/us/politics/kushner-trump-2020-campaign-fund-raising.html,"But Mr. Kushner’s aggressive involvement has also been described as something of a defensive move: By positioning himself as the point person on raising money for the campaign, he prevents antagonists and potential rivals from taking over a job that comes with great power and proximity to the president.

Mr. Trump, for his part, has seemed uninterested in discussing the state of the fund-raising for 2020, or in hearing Mr. Kushner’s concerns at last month’s dinner. After regaling the group with stories about his foreign trips and past business ventures, the president left the meeting, declaring, “As long as we’re breaking records, I don’t care.”

A person close to Mr. Kushner, who was not authorized to speak publicly, insisted it was the president who had initially pitched the idea of a “thank you” dinner for staff members. But it morphed into an opportunity for Mr. Kushner, who has helped oversee an effort to attract more online small donors, to present himself to Mr. Trump as the person with the best solutions.

During the meal, Ms. McDaniel explained the party committee’s fund-raising goals for 2019, and Mr. Kushner countered that they were insufficient. For the last few months, people involved in fund-raising for the campaign have complained that it is hard to plan effectively when the White House gives little lead time for committing to dates. A major donor dinner in New York this month, for instance, was put together with just six days’ notice.

In a statement, Mr. Kushner said that he harbored no concerns about the committee’s performance. “The R.N.C. under Ronna’s leadership has done historic work and President Trump is well served with her at the helm,” he said.

And the committee, according to Michael Ahrens, a spokesman, “has a great working relationship with the team at the White House.” He added that it is “because of President Trump’s long list of accomplishments and the leadership of Chairwoman McDaniel that we’re able to break fund-raising records month after month.”"
Duchess Camilla Parker Bowles goes viral after winking to cameras during Trump's visit,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/duchess-camilla-parker-bowles-goes-viral-after-winking-to-cameras-during-trumps-visit,"Duchess of Cornwall Camilla Parker Bowles became a viral sensation on Monday after she was seen offering a wink to the cameras as she and Prince Charles greeted President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump during their state visit to the United Kingdom.

Following a private lunch with Queen Elizabeth II, the president and first lady met with the prince and duchess for an afternoon tea, but as President Trump and Prince Charles walked by, Duchess Camilla offered a light-hearted reaction that was captured by Sky News.

That sparked quite the royal response on social media, some calling it the ""best thing"" about President Trump's visit so far.

President Trump's visit to the UK has generated plenty of headlines from his ongoing feud with London Mayor Sadiq Khan to expressing his support for Conservative leader Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister."
Trump Insults London Mayor as ‘Loser’ as He Pays Tribute to the Queen,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Mark Landler', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/europe/trump-banquet-meghan-markle-sadiq-khan.html,"LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II welcomed President Trump to Buckingham Palace on Monday with an honor guard and royal artillery salute, while Mr. Trump carried on an ugly dispute with the mayor of London, whom he called a “stone cold loser” and said was doing a terrible job of running Britain’s capital city.

The juxtaposition of high pageantry and low name-calling, on the first day of Mr. Trump’s state visit to Britain, captured yet again the odd swath that this president cuts on the world stage: impulsive and erratic, delighted by a lavish welcome but preoccupied by petty feuds or events back home.

It also showcased the deep ambivalence Mr. Trump’s visit has elicited. The British public mostly rejects Mr. Trump and his policies, but the governing elite recognizes the need to reinforce the alliance with the United States as it negotiates Britain’s exit from the European Union."
Mexican Government Privately Warns Trump Administration Of Countertariffs,https://www.npr.org,['Franco Ordoñez'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/03/729402832/mexican-government-privately-warns-trump-administration-of-counter-tariffs,"Mexican Government Privately Warns Trump Administration Of Countertariffs

The Mexican government has employed a tone of friendship that's averse to conflict, but Mexican officials behind the scenes are warning the Trump administration that they're prepared to announce targeted countertariffs if the United States carries out threats of new tariffs on Mexican imports.

Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard met with State Department officials in Washington over the past 48 hours in an effort to find a solution to a tariff fight, which he later described as ""counterproductive"" and that would not decrease immigration.

Publicly, officials are saying they do not want to disrupt crucial supply chains, but those familiar with the talks say they are privately looking at imports that have political significance and are sent directly to Mexico for consumption.

The behind-the-scenes talks are part of a more public push led by Ebrard and other top Mexican officials who are warning their counterparts of disastrous consequences if President Trump carries out threats to impose 5% tariffs on June 10 as punishment for not curbing migration flows, according to two sources familiar with the talks.

""They're going to have to delicately balance inflaming tensions even further, as this could be horrific for both countries, but particularly the Mexican economy,"" said a former White House official familiar with the conversations. ""But you can't just roll over and play dead if you're verbally attacked like this by a foreign government's president. That doesn't play well, domestically.""

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sent Ebrard as well as Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Márquez and Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos to Washington in search of a solution to avert the tariff battle.

On Monday, Mexican officials said Márquez was expected to meet with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and Villalobos met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. There were also meetings planned with acting head of the Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Ebrard is expected to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday.

Some Republicans in key states that rely on a trade relationship with Mexico are warning Trump that he risks hurting U.S. interests.

""It's important to remember that any actions that we take to secure our Southern border must also keep in mind the important role that Mexico plays in the economy of the United States,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. ""My state enjoys a strong relationship economically with Mexico because of that 1,200-mile common border.""

The Mexican team argues the best way to combat immigration is to invest in Central America, but the Trump administration wants Mexico to take stronger steps along its southern border, dismantle human smuggling chains and improve coordination on asylum.

The relationship between the United States and Mexico goes well beyond immigration.

Mexico is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner. The two countries collaborate on everything from drug trafficking to human trafficking. The United States has invested more than $2 billion through the Mérida security initiative, and the Mexican government, after decades of hostility, is now allowing U.S. investment in its oil industry.

During a news conference Monday, Márquez expressed confidence in finding a diplomatic solution but said officials are evaluating the proper response if Trump carries out the tariffs.

""I cannot say that we're are going to do the same [tariffs], because we have to make a strategic plan to take into account aspects of the commercial relationship,"" Márquez said in Spanish. ""We do not want to use tariffs to damage supply chains, job creation or investment.""

But Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China, said what Mexico can do that China did not is implement more strategic countermeasures as opposed to blanket tariffs.

As an example, he said Mexico could consider targeting Kentucky bourbon because of its political importance and ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. It is also shipped to Mexico for consumption but is not part of a supply chain like production of various auto parts that make several trips back and forth over the border as a car is built.

""Very simply,"" Guajardo said, ""Sen. Lindsey Graham [R-S.C.] said he supported President Trump's tariffs. You can be first certain that Mexico is thinking [about what] South Carolina [is] exporting to Mexico. And that will be targeted as long as it's not in a supply chain."""
Meghan Markle a no-show at banquet for Trump,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/03/meghan-markle-a-no-show-at-banquet-for-trump-after-nasty-comment/,"Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, was a no-show at the Buckingham Palace banquet for President Trump’s state visit to England on Monday.

Markle — who is married to Prince Harry and on maternity leave after giving birth to their first child, Archie — sat out the dinner amid a feud with the president that included him calling the former actress “nasty” in an interview with a British newspaper.

Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, the wife of Prince William, was in attendance at the banquet as were Trump’s adult children.

The American-born Markle also missed a royal luncheon at the palace with Trump and first lady Melania Trump earlier Monday – although Harry attended.

Harry apparently also sat out the dinner.

In an interview with The Sun published on Saturday, Trump was asked about Markle referring to him as “misogynistic” and “divisive” and her claim that she would move to Canada if he was elected president in 2016.

“I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty,” he said, according to the newspaper."
Amazon Offered Job to Pentagon Official Involved With $10 Billion Contract It Sought,https://theintercept.com,[],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://theintercept.com/2019/06/03/amazon-defense-department-jedi-contract/,"In a federal lawsuit, the tech giant Oracle has provided new details to support its accusation that Amazon secretly negotiated a job offer with a then-Department of Defense official who helped shape the procurement process for a massive federal contract for which Amazon was a key bidder.

Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are now the two finalists to win the highly contested $10 billion contract for what is known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. The deal, one of the largest federal contracts in U.S. history, would pay one company to provide cloud computing services in support of Defense Department operations around the world.

But the contract has been hotly contested since the department began soliciting proposals last year. Two of Amazon’s competitors, IBM and Oracle, filed complaints with the Government Accountability Office saying that the winner-take-all process unfairly favored Amazon, which is seen as an industry leader in cloud computing. When its claim was rejected, Oracle sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

Since the court battle began in 2018, Oracle has aggressively lodged conflict-of-interest accusations involving a former DOD official named Deap Ubhi, who left the department in 2017 to take a job at Amazon. In a court motion filed on Friday, Oracle alleged that while Ubhi worked on the preliminary research for the JEDI program in the late summer and fall of 2017, he was also engaged in a secret job negotiation with Amazon for months, complete with salary discussions, offers of signing bonuses, and lucrative stock options.

The motion further alleges that Ubhi did not recuse himself from the JEDI program until weeks after verbally accepting a job offer from Amazon and that he continued to receive information about Amazon’s competitors and participate in meetings about technical requirements, despite a government regulation that forbids such conflicts of interest.

“Neither Ubhi nor [Amazon Web Services] disclosed the employment discussions or job offer to DOD — not when the employment discussions started, not when the informal job offer occurred, not when the formal offer occurred, and not even when Ubhi accepted the offer,” Oracle’s motion reads.

As America’s technology companies have continued to outpace the Pentagon, the Defense Department has looked to recruit talent from Silicon Valley to help enhance its information technology.

Ubhi is a venture capitalist and technology entrepreneur who worked for Amazon before his time in government. He took a job working on a Defense Department initiative aimed at collaborating with Silicon Valley to modernize the Pentagon’s information technology systems. After working as part of a four-person team to help shape the Pentagon JEDI procurement process, he left the department and returned to Amazon in November 2017.

A spokesperson for Amazon Web Services declined to comment and declined to make Ubhi available for an interview, citing ongoing litigation. Elissa Smith, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense, also told The Intercept that “we don’t comment on pending litigation.”

In a previous court filing, U.S. government lawyers accused Oracle of a “broad fishing expedition primarily [intended] to find support for its claim that the solicitation at issue is tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.”

According to Oracle’s motion on Friday, Ubhi began job negotiations with Amazon in August 2017, while he was working on the early stages of the JEDI program. Oracle claims says that “deep discussions” about employment began in late September and that Ubhi “verbally committed” to take the job on October 4. But according to the filing, Ubhi did not recuse himself until October 31, 2017. Oracle alleges that he continued to influence the program in the meantime.

Under the Procurement Integrity Act, government officials who are “contacted by a [contract] bidder about non-federal employment” have two options: They must either report the contact and reject the offer of employment or promptly recuse themselves from any contract proceedings.

“Contracts should be awarded fairly based on merit,” Mandy Smithberger, director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight, told The Intercept. “The Procurement Integrity Act seeks to ensure that job offers and other financial conflicts of interest don’t influence that process.”

Last year, a Defense Department review found that “there were four instances where [department] individuals with potential financial conflicts of interest” had worked on the JEDI program, according to court records, but the Pentagon concluded that this hadn’t unfairly impacted the contracting process. Two follow-up reviews — one by the GAO in November 2018 and another by the Defense Department in April 2019 — came to similar conclusions.

The second Pentagon review came after the department said that it had received “new information” about Ubhi and would investigate it. According to Oracle’s motion on Friday, the “new information” came from a “belated submission from [Amazon]” to the DOD’s contracting officer that finally acknowledged the monthslong employment talks.

According to Oracle, Ubhi provided a “false narrative” to the contracting officer at the time of his recusal, saying that he was stepping away from the project because Amazon had offered to acquire a company that Ubhi had a stake in. That was a pretext to mask the fact he had been negotiating for months to obtain a job at the company, Oracle’s filing said.

The filing also alleges that between Ubhi’s verbal commitment to accept Amazon’s offer and his recusal from JEDI, he continued to participate in Pentagon meetings about the project’s technical requirements and to receive submissions from Amazon competitors. It also alleges that Ubhi downloaded material from a JEDI project Google Drive to his own laptop.

In its filings, Oracle has argued that Ubhi was instrumental in persuading the Pentagon to seek services from a single vendor — a decision widely seen to improve Amazon’s chances. Oracle cites workplace messages on the platform Slack in which Ubhi tries to persuade his colleagues to come around to that view, but the company does not cite any messages suggesting what his reasons or motive may have been."
"Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Facebook are in the crosshairs of the FTC and DOJ – TechCrunch",https://techcrunch.com,[],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/alphabet-apple-amazon-and-facebook-are-in-the-crosshairs-of-the-ftc-and-doj/,"Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Facebook are in the crosshairs of the FTC and DOJ

A new deal between the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission will see U.S. regulators divide and conquer as they expand their oversight of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook, according to multiple reports.

New details have emerged of an agreement between the two U.S. regulators that would see the Federal Trade Commission take the reins in antitrust investigations of Amazon and Facebook, while the Department of Justice will oversee investigations of Alphabet’s Google business and Apple.

Shares of Apple’s stock tumbled on news of the Justice Department’s role in overseeing the company, which was first reported by Reuters even as the company was in the middle of its developer conference celebrating all things Apple.

Google has been here before. Eight years ago, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Google for antitrust violations, ultimately determining that the company had not violated any antitrust or anti-competitive statutes in its display of search results.

On Friday, The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department was initiating a federal antitrust investigation into Google’s business practices, according to multiple sources.

That report was followed by additional reporting from The Wall Street Journal indicating that Facebook would be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission."
DOJ calls new census allegations a 'baseless attack on the integrity' of department and its employees,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Tammy Kupperman']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/politics/doj-census-allegations/index.html,"(CNN) The Department of Justice on Monday night forcefully disputed an account by the American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause and others that the decision to add a citizenship question to the census was politically motivated.

A Justice Department spokesperson says the allegations that a 2015 study by a Republican redistricting expert played a major role in the request to add a citizenship question to the census are meritless.

In a letter last week, the ACLU, Common Cause and others said they had found ""new evidence"" that the government's true motivation in adding the question was to improve the chances of Republicans.

They pointed to a recently disclosed 2015 study written by Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a Republican redistricting expert, who wrote that using ""citizen voting age"" population as the redistricting population base would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.""

The challengers say the new information shows Hofeller played a more significant role in the decision to add the citizenship question than has been disclosed and that his study reveals the true motive behind the administration's decision to add the question.

The Justice Department ripped the allegations as a ""baseless attack on the integrity of the Department and its employees,"" and a spokesperson said the allegations are based on information the challengers have known for months.

According to the spokesperson, the study by the now-deceased Hofeller ""played no role in the Department of Justice's letter recommending reinstatement of a citizenship question to the Census."" Hofeller died last August.

The Justice Department rebutted the allegations on Monday in a six-page letter, accompanied by multiple exhibits, to a federal judge in New York who has scheduled a hearing on Wednesday.

In the court filings, the department calls the claim that a Justice Department official relied on Hofeller's study ""false.""

In the filing, the Department of Justice said senior official John Gore had never falsely testified and ""the assertion that Gore relied on a private, unpublished study to compile information that is widely known and publicly available is absurd.""

The department accuses the challengers of ""conjuring a conspiracy theory involving a deceased political operative that essentially hinges on wordplay.""

District Judge Jesse Furman, of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled against the administration in January and in April the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case. A decision in one of the most closely anticipated cases of the term is due by the end of June.

The Supreme Court agreed to take up the appeal in an expedited time frame. In court, the conservative justices appeared ready to side with the government and allow the question.

In a letter to Furman, the challengers say the evidence bolsters their argument that while the administration contends the question was added to better comply with federal voting laws, the real reason was to intimidate Hispanic households.

""The new evidence thus not only contradicts testimony in this case, but it shows that those who constructed the VRA (Voting Rights Act) rationale knew that adding a citizenship question would not benefit Latino voters, but rather would facilitate significantly reducing their political power,"" the letter to the judge read.

The lawyers attached a copy of a deposition of A. Mark Neuman, who they say was Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' expert adviser on the matter, in their letter to the judge.

Neuman testified that Hofeller was the ""first person"" who suggested to him to add the citizenship question. Neuman said in the deposition that Hofeller had told him it would help maximize ""Latino representation.""

""But new evidence obtained in discovery in state court ... shows that Dr. Hofeller instead knew that adding a citizenship question would have exactly the opposite effect -- it would disadvantage Latinos and benefit 'Non-Hispanic Whites,' "" the lawyers told the judge.

They also say that Hofeller ""ghostwrote"" a ""substantial part"" of a draft letter that would ultimately become the Department of Justice's official letter requesting that the Commerce Department add the citizenship question.

""This is important because it shows that Hofeller's work formed the basis for DOJ's request to add the citizenship question,"" said ACLU attorney Dale Ho.

""The bottom line is the Trump administration doesn't deny that portions of its first draft of a request to add a citizenship question to the census were written by Thomas Hofeller, who advocated for the question because it would be, in his own words, 'advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' "" Ho said in a statement. ""At this point, does anyone seriously believe that the Trump administration, which hasn't filed a single case under the Voting Rights Act, has gone through all of this trouble so that it can protect voters of color?""

The information came to light after Hofeller had passed away and his estranged daughter collected his belongings. They included a hard drive that turned out to hold some 75,000 files.

The interest group Common Cause was involved in a case concerning gerrymandering in North Carolina and subpoenaed the documents hoping to get a better understanding of Hofeller's work in that area. It then found the documents pertinent to its other case concerning the census.

Richard Hasen, of the University of California Irvine, called the new information ""blockbuster"" but said he doubted the conservative justices on the Supreme Court would agree. He noted that during oral arguments they had accepted at ""face value"" the administration's justification for the law, that the question was ""necessary to protect Hispanic voters."""
Barr’s zealous defense of Trump makes it impossible to trust his legal judgment,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Neal Katyal', 'Neal Katyal Is The Former Acting Solicitor General Of The United States In The Obama Administration', ""The Saunders Professor Of National Security Law At Georgetown University As Well As The Faculty Chair Of Georgetown'S"", 'June At Pm']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/06/03/barrs-zealous-defense-trump-makes-it-impossible-trust-his-legal-judgement/,"

Attorney General William P. Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month. (Susan Walsh/AP)

There are two big questions about the now-completed investigation into President Trump, and the answers will determine what happens next. First, why did special counsel Robert S. Mueller III not render a judgment on whether Trump had obstructed justice? And second, since Attorney General William P. Barr did render such a judgment, why isn’t that the end of the matter?

The public appearances last week of Mueller and Barr answer both questions. We saw a hyper-careful special counsel who bent over backward to be fair to Trump. And we saw an attorney general who was acting as the president’s personal lawyer, not the lawyer for the American people.

Mueller explained in his news conference that he would not answer the obstruction question, just as his report didn’t answer the question except to say he could not clear Trump because the facts would not permit him to. Justice Department guidance held that he could not indict a sitting president, he said, so he did not reach a conclusion as to whether the president committed crimes. He said it would be unfair to attack someone as a criminal without indicting them because there would be no legal process for them to prove the accusations wrong. That didn’t mean Mueller was acting as some “angry Democrat” (a hard thing for a Republican to do, in any event) — it meant he was being careful to protect Trump’s rights.

Barr, by contrast, took the opposite approach. He appeared the next day on CBS News and said, “I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision,” and that “the opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office, but he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity.”

Barr’s statement was news, not only to the American public, but also, I suspect, to Mueller himself. It also should have come as news to someone else: William P. Barr. On the first day of his confirmation hearing nearly five months ago, Barr was asked by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) about former FBI director James B. Comey’s July 2016 news conference on the decision not to indict Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Here is what Barr said in January: “I thought that to the extent [Comey] actually announced a decision was wrong, and the other thing is, if you’re not going to indict someone, then you don’t stand up there and unload negative information about the person. That’s not the way the Department of Justice does business.”

Barr has now directly contradicted what he told the Senate. Why?

[Barr tried to exonerate Trump. That’s not how the special counsel rules work.]

The answer has to do with how Barr backed himself into a corner when he cleared Trump of obstruction of justice. Barr was criticized resoundingly for reaching such a determination within 48 hours of receiving Mueller’s report (which was more than 400 pages long). Barr tried to defend himself by explaining that he had had time to evaluate everything because Mueller had told him in a meeting three weeks beforehand that he wasn’t going to reach a decision on obstruction of justice. This has always been a strange claim — that Barr was evaluating the evidence without the report in his hand — but now it gets absurd.

If Barr thought Mueller could have reached a decision on obstruction of justice, did he tell Mueller that when they met in March? Wouldn’t that have literally been Barr’s job, as the supervisor of the special counsel? Instead, he revealed his views only later — and contradicted his earlier position that prosecutors cannot “unload negative information about a person” and that that is not how the “Department of Justice does business.”

Barr’s position, as he described it on CBS, is absurd on its face. Imagine the outcry if Mueller were to have done what Barr now claims he could have done: Mueller would be labeling Trump a criminal, but Trump would have no legal process to defend himself. Folks — including me — would scream about the unfairness of such an outcome. Mueller was faithful to long-standing Justice Department considerations about being fair to potential defendants; Barr, by contrast, appears to be lurching from one bad position to the next.

Barr has thrown himself in with Trump in ways unbecoming to the nation’s highest legal official. His conduct in trying to clear Trump is of a piece with his baseless attacks on “spying” by the FBI and his defiance of Congress’s subpoenas. The president already has a White House counsel, who defends the institution of the presidency, as well as a private legal team. Unlike other Cabinet officers at the founding who were susceptible to direct presidential control, the attorney general has been understood to serve the interests of the law, not of the president who put him there. But right now, U.S. taxpayers who pay Barr’s salary are also funding Trump’s legal defense team, and they lack a government official who represents them.

[Barr is wrong: Obstruction of justice doesn’t require another underlying crime]

The only way forward is for Congress to carry out a thorough investigation and reach its own conclusions. Call it an impeachment inquiry if you wish; nothing turns on the name. But a Congress that spent years investigating Benghazi surely should spend an equivalent amount of time and energy investigating potential wrongdoing by the president of the United States. Trump and Barr both insist that he has been cleared, but that’s not what more than 1,000 former federal prosecutors who read the Mueller report say: The evidence described in the report would lead to an indictment of anyone else in the country. If that’s right, we simply cannot have a president who remains in office because of a technicality. If that’s wrong, then let’s get the answer and give Trump an opportunity to clear his name.

Barr’s attempt to clear the president is meaningless. It makes him look willing to say anything and do anything to protect his boss. If Barr wants to keep defending Trump, he should take a page from one of his predecessors, Henry Stanbery, who stepped down as attorney general to serve as President Andrew Johnson’s impeachment counsel. Stanbery, notably, tried to come back as attorney general after the impeachment proceedings concluded. The Senate did not confirm him.

The American people deserve an answer about whether the president obstructed justice. Mueller did not answer that question. Barr tried to. While ordinarily the word of an attorney general should carry much weight, it is difficult, if not impossible, to extend those norms to this situation. Barr has shown himself to be an unreliable and unsteady voice, careening from one position to the next, always in favor of protecting his boss. And even had Barr acted without such partisanship, the whole point of the idea that a sitting president cannot be indicted is that there is an alternative forum to review those questions.

Mueller, pointedly, noted in his news conference last week that the Justice Department opinion barring the indictment of a sitting president says that “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.” Everyone knew what other process Mueller meant. Congress is going to have to provide the answers.

"Trump's U.K. visit: What you need to know, from royal ceremony to protests in London",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kim Hjelmgaard', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/06/03/president-trumps-state-visit-britain-queen-elizabeth-ii-royal-family/1284000001/,"LONDON – President Donald Trump arrived in the United Kingdom on Monday for several days of pomp and ceremony. Here's your crib sheet.

What's happening?

Trump is in the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit. A state visit is one that formally comes at the invitation of the British monarch: Queen Elizabeth II. It means that there will be an emphasis on ritualized ceremony, including banquets at the queen’s lavish London pile Buckingham Palace, wreath-laying to honor Britain’s military dead, gun salutes fired from the Tower of London and other grand displays of decorum essentially showing through soft power how Britain can be the host with the most.

Still, while the queen sent the invitation and will feature prominently in the visit along with other members of the royal family, she did so at the request of the British government, meaning it won’t be all testimonial readings and charming musical performances. There will be serious talks on defense, investment, security and trade.

Why does it matter?

For a start, while the queen has hosted 152 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952, and met 11 of 12 sitting U.S. presidents over the last 67 years – her majesty’s royal path never crossed with Lyndon B. Johnson – only two U.S. presidents have made state visits to Britain: George W. Bush in 2003 and Barack Obama in 2011. Trump is being accorded a special honor when he arrives June 3.

However, the visit is important for reasons that go beyond ceremonial affairs. Political scientists say it’s about reaffirming the so-called special relationship between two of the world’s closest allies who have deep cultural, economic and political ties, but who haven’t always seen eye-to-eye since Trump came to power vowing to pursue a more unilateralist foreign policy. Areas of disagreement have included Trump’s Muslim travel ban, his talking down of the NATO military alliance and U.S. exits from the climate and Iran nuclear accords. There's also difference of opinion about China, in particular what type of relationship to maintain with Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Washington thinks the company is a massive national security threat; London has a more relaxed view.

The visit also comes as Britain is mired in a weeks-long process to pick a new prime minister after Theresa May said she would vacate the role on June 7 over her handling of Britain’s impending exit from the European Union, known as Brexit.

Trump 'friend' Boris Johnson: U.S.-born politician favorite to replace Theresa May

""If we get a new prime minister who the president can relate to then things might run more smoothly, especially if May's successor allows us to crash out of the EU and comes begging for a trade deal with the USA,"" said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London, referring to the possibility of a ""no-deal"" Brexit.

Ahead of his arrival, Trump told British tabloid newspaper The Sun that he was backing U.S.-born politician Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister. He also said that his friend Nigel Farage should be involved in negotiations to leave the EU.

Who's coming with Trump?

Aside from the normal retinue of senior advisers and administration officials, a large portion of the Trump family, according to the New York Times. The outlet has reported that along with First Lady Melania Trump, the president will fly over his children, including Donald Jr, 41; Ivanka, 37; Eric, 35; and Tiffany, 25. It is not yet known whether Trump’s youngest son Baron, 13, will also make the transatlantic trip. The White House would not comment on which members of Trump's family would be accompanying him.

Still, if the Trump family does form part of the president's entourage they would be expected to attend the banquet dinner at Buckingham Palace on Monday evening. On the British side, the dinner will be attended by outgoing Prime Minister May, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Prominent British public figures and Americans living in Britain will also be there. The queen and Trump are both expected to make speeches at the start of the banquet.

What will he be doing?

In addition to taking part in bilateral meetings with May, and the dinner banquet, there will be a private lunch with the queen; a visit to an exhibition showcasing items that Britain's foreign office has called of ""historical significance to the United States""; tea with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall; a chance to inspect Britain’s military Guard of Honor; a tour of Westminster Abbey (famous site of many coronations and royal weddings); and a breakfast meeting with senior American and British business leaders.

On Wednesday, Trump will participate in commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. This event will take place in Portsmouth, on Britain’s south coast. It will include a fly-past with 25 modern and historical aircraft. Since Trump is known to like a good parade and military fanfare, Wednesday should be a good day for him.

""I hope President Trump appreciates the full sweep of history when he visits ... Portsmouth ... that European unity is very much an American project; that Europeans' prosperity and security are interlinked with America’s ... and that this is a project that needs America’s support,"" said Heather Conley, an expert on foreign affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

What kind of reception can he expect?

In short: protests.

Over half of Londoners are opposed to Trump's visit to Britain's capital,

according to a recent poll by research firm YouGov and Queen Mary, University of London. Although nationwide: 46% to 40% think the visit should go ahead.

When Trump visited London last year as part of an ordinary working visit an estimated 250,000 people protested on the streets of central London. Anti-Trump activists who oppose his divisive policies from immigration to abortion rights are planning for similar numbers this time. There will be smaller protests around the country.

And remember Trump baby? The phone-wielding, diaper-wearing inflatable that flew above London when Trump visited in July? The team behind it told USA TODAY that the giant orange blimp will again take to the skies, on Tuesday, in Parliament Square.

British media have reported that Trump's three-day visit will cost British police and security services about $23 million to help keep him safe.

Who's giving Trump the cold shoulder?

London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who Trump has clashed with before, was the subject of two disparaging tweets by the U.S. president on Monday. It came after Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, wrote in an op-ed in British newspaper the Observer that it is ""un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump.""

Trump tweeted that Khan was ""a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.""

""Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height,"" Trump added.

.@SadiqKhan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly “nasty” to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

....Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

Prince Harry will meet Trump at one of the planned lunches. But his wife, the Duchess of Sussex (Meghan Markle), will sit it out. Her name is not on any of the official itineraries. Markle may have decided she would rather stay at home with newborn son Archie. Or perhaps it's the man himself. In 2016, she called him ""misogynistic.""

Trump has denied calling Markle ""nasty"" despite an audio recording of his comments.

The president has also not been invited, unlike President Obama, to address Parliament. John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, who makes that decision, has said he is ""strongly opposed"" to Trump addressing British lawmakers.

""Before the imposition of the (Muslim travel ban) I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,"" Bercow told British parliamentarians in 2017. ""After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.""

Bercow said that being invited to address Parliament was ""an earned honor.""

In a speech in Washington last week, Bercow said that over the past two years ""nothing has happened since then to cause me to change my mind.""

What else is the president doing in Europe?

On Wednesday, he will fly to Ireland for a meeting with leader Leo Varadkar. The meeting will take place at Shannon Airport, not Trump's golf club and hotel in Doonbeg, in County Clare, which he will visit later the same day. The White House said that the two leaders will discuss ""a range of bilateral issues"" and ""shared international interests and priorities."" Translation: Trump wants to play golf in his family's ancestral homeland.

The next day, Trump will travel to France for further D-Day commemorations in Normandy. He will visit the Normandy American Cemetery, established by the U.S. First Army in 1944. It is the first American cemetery on European soil and contains the graves of 9,380 American military dead, most of whom lost their lives in D-Day landings.

While in France, Trump will also hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron and Trump have enjoyed a ""bromance"" of sorts, filled with awkward embraces, macho handshake and military parades. They also regularly attack each others' politics – Macron for his centrism, Trump for his nationalism – in tweets and speeches.

Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s presentation last week, although it contained no new information, has renewed pressure to impeach President Trump. You can debate whether impeachment makes sense politically, but there is no doubt that it is justified legally and morally. There is already more than enough evidence for at least seven articles of impeachment – four more than President Richard M. Nixon would have faced had he not resigned in 1974 .

Article 1. Donald J. Trump, in violation of his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has obstructed the administration of justice:

1. He attempted to fire Mueller. The Mueller report found “substantial evidence . . . that the President’s attempts to remove the Special Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel’s oversight of investigations that involved the President’s conduct.”

2. Trump attempted to curtail Mueller’s investigation. Mueller found “that the President’s effort to have [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions limit the scope of the Special Counsel’s investigation to future election interference was intended to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President’s and his campaign’s conduct.”

3. He ordered White House counsel Donald McGahn to falsify the record to conceal his attempts to fire Mueller. Mueller found that Trump “acted . . . in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President’s conduct.”

4. He fired FBI Director James B. Comey, Mueller found, because of “Comey’s unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally under investigation.” Moreover, Mueller wrote, by firing Comey “the President wanted to protect himself from an investigation into his campaign,” because he knew “that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise to personal and political concerns.” Trump showed awareness of guilt by advancing “a pretextual reason to the press and the public for Comey’s termination.”

5. He tried to dissuade Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, and other witnesses from cooperating with the government. The non-cooperation of Manafort and Stone, in particular, made it impossible to establish the exact nature of the relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

Article II. Donald J. Trump, in violation of his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, failed to defend America from foreign election interference. As a candidate, he welcomed Russian intervention in the 2016 election and refused to notify the proper authorities of contacts between his campaign and representatives of Russia and WikiLeaks. As president, he denied that the Russian attack had even occurred, accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin’s false denials of responsibility, and showed no interest in determining the full scale of the attack. He repeatedly called the Russia investigation a “hoax” and a “witch hunt” even though Mueller determined “that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election” and that “the matters we investigated were of paramount importance.”

Article III. Donald J. Trump, in violation of his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, attempted to investigate and prosecute his political opponents. On three occasions, Mueller found, Trump asked the Justice Department to initiate investigations of Hillary Clinton. More recently, Trump and his attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, attempted to initiate an investigation of Joe Biden.

Article IV. Donald J. Trump, in violation of his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, failed to produce papers and testimony as duly directed by Congress. Trump obstructed at least 20 inquiries relating to his taxes, business records, the Mueller investigation and other matters.

Article V. Donald J. Trump, in violation of federal campaign finance laws, conspired with his attorney Michael Cohen in order to conceal alleged relationships with adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy playmate Karen McDougal before the 2016 election.

Article VI. Donald J. Trump, in violation of his oath to uphold Article 1, section 9 of the Constitution (“No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law”), attempted to misuse his emergency powers to spend funds on a border wall that Congress did not appropriate.

Article VII. Donald J. Trump, in violation of his oath to uphold the emoluments clauses (which forbid the president from accepting benefits from foreign and state governments without the permission of Congress) retains ownership of a global business empire which allows him to benefit from dealings with foreign and state governments.

That Trump is guilty of these offenses – and more – is not necessarily an argument for moving forward with impeachment. That could backfire politically if it results, as it surely would, in a failure to convict by the Republican-controlled Senate. But don’t pretend, as do 249 out of 250 Republican members of Congress, that there is insufficient evidence to even open an impeachment inquiry. Trump has committed more criminal and unconstitutional conduct than any previous president in U.S. history. If they refuse to impeach him, members of Congress will violate their own oaths to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

We know Trump isn’t a joke – he is responsible for rampant xenophobia, sexism and transphobia and the creeping rise of far right politics. His climate denial and persistent facilitation of the fossil fuel industry is a death sentence for communities in the global south.

Trump has repeatedly shown that he doesn’t respond to reason, to facts or to science. What he does respond to is humiliation. Our balloon is part of a proud history of political satire in the UK that sends a clear, orange, message to Trump and his politics of hate that they are not welcome here.

Some people have asked whether a personal attack on Trump is fair. The same question that was posed after Tommy Robinson and Nigel Farage were doused in milkshakes during their recent European election campaigns.

The answer is yes. Trump is responsible for thousands of personal attacks and the power and politics of the far right is a dangerous threat to the lives of thousands here and around the world. Every policy signed that removes reproductive rights from women, every detention or deportation that separates a child from a parent, every climate denial shouted into the smoke of a February wildfire is an attack on millions of individuals.

The Stop Trump protests in the UK are about more than a balloon. It’s a gathering of those who want to stand up to Trump’s vile dialogue and politics, standing in solidarity with those most affected by them in the UK. For the thousands of us in the streets, there are thousands more organising and campaigning every day to create a future free from Trump’s hate.

Groups like Sunrise and the UK Student Climate Network who are organising to demand radical economic and environmental reform by calling for a “green new deal”. Planned Parenthood and Sister’s Uncut, fighting for reproductive rights and the safety of women and non-binary people, and Jawaab and United We Dream, groups of young people organising for migrant and racial justice.

For us to fly Trump Baby again, we’re raising 30k for those 6 groups in order to fund their resistance to the violent manifestations of Trump’s politics. Organising for change requires a long game. In the meantime, it’s important to laugh in the face of your enemies, at the same time as recognising the threat they pose and working to fight against it.

After Tuesday, we must continue to resist and undermine Trump and far right politics at every level. Balloons in the air, milkshakes in hand, boots on the ground: we will continue to organise for a radical economic, environmental and social movement that centres justice for everyone.

In letters to Barr and Ross, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings wrote, ""Unfortunately your actions are part of a pattern. The Trump administration has been engaged in one of the most unprecedented cover-ups since Watergate, extending from the White House to multiple federal agencies and department of the government and across numerous investigations.""

""I am writing to inform you that the committee is scheduling a vote to hold you in contempt of Congress as a result of your failure to comply with a bipartisan subpoena issued more than two months ago for documents relating to the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.""

A separate House panel, the Judiciary Committee, has already voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to provide the committee with the full unredacted Mueller report and evidence.

In the letters, Cummings said Monday that he would postpone the committee's contempt vote if the Commerce and the Justice Departments produced the materials the committee had previously requested by Thursday.

2 more Alabama cities selected for Department of Justice violent crime initiative,https://www.al.com,"['Carol Robinson', 'Crobinson Al.Com']",06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/06/2-more-alabama-cities-selected-for-department-of-justice-violent-crime-initiative.html,"Two more Alabama cities have been selected to take part in a Department of Justice initiative aimed at reducing violent crime nationwide.

The National Public Safety Partnership was launched in 2017 in response to President Trump's directive to reduce crime and improve public safety. Then- Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the National Public Safety Partnership, an alliance of local and federal law enforcement agencies coordinating with community organizations to reduce violent crime in areas long plagued by it. The Attorney General selected Birmingham as one of the initial 12 PSP sites.

On Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr announced 10 more cities, including Anniston and Oxford. To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

In addition to Anniston, and Oxford, other sites announced Monday are: Anchorage, Alaska; Davenport, Iowa; Wichita, Kansas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio, Amarillo, Texas and Harris County, Texas.

In a DOJ press release, Barr said the Public Safety Partnership provides a framework for enhancing federal support of state, local and tribal law enforcement officials and prosecutors as they aggressively investigate and pursue violent criminals, specifically those involved in gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence.

“The Public Safety Partnership is a successful program that directs federal law enforcement resources to the cities where they can have the greatest impact,"" Barr said in a prepared statement. ""These resources help police departments to diagnose where crime is highest—and why—and to find, arrest and prosecute criminals. Several participating cities have already seen dramatic reductions in violent crime over the past two years. As we expand this program to 10 more cities across America, we are determined to replicate that success.”

Birmingham's Public Safety Partnership building alliances for safer communities The task force has been instrumental in identifying the worst violent offenders in the area for arrest and prosecution.

Northern District of Alabama U.S. Attorney Jay Town said the partnership provides data-drive resources to assist law enforcement in removing the habitual offenders from the southeast side of the northern district. ““Our collective goal is simply to reduce crime, especially violent crime, in Anniston, Oxford, and surrounding areas. My office, local and federal law enforcement, and the Department of Justice are fully committed to facilitating the strategies, training, and technical assistance to do just that,’’ Town said. “We have prison beds already reserved for the alpha criminals in Calhoun County…and we are coming.”

To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

More than 30 cities have taken part in the Public Safety Partnership. The primary participating Justice Department components include the Office of Justice Programs, Office on Violence Against Women, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, FBI, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Marshals Service.

“We are excited to have the DOJ working with us in conjunction with the East Metro Area Crime Center to reduce gun crimes in our region and to reduce overall crime,’’ said Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge. “This will help the entire region in reducing crime.”"
VA whistleblower says there’s a secret wait list for veterans' care,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues', 'June At Am']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-theres-a-secret-va-wait-list-for-care-the-department-says-thats-not-true/2019/06/01/197e59a2-83df-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html,"President during the swearing-in ceremony for Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie last year. A whistleblower has accused VA of having a secret wait list. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Columnist

Jereme P. Whiteman rose quickly through the Department of Veterans Affairs, reaching the top grade on the main employee classification scale in only seven years.

But his future within VA appears stymied. He’s become a rebel within the department’s establishment — a whistleblower who says the scandals that shamed the department during the Obama administration haven’t stopped.

Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management and a onetime Marine, has accused the department under President Trump of having “a secret VA wait list” for veterans seeking health care.

It’s starkly reminiscent of the tsunami-level scandal that broke in 2014 over the coverup of long patient wait times. That coverup included falsifying records to indicate the wait for medical service was shorter than it really was. Congress went ballistic, and the controversy drove then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, a former Army general and chief of staff, from office.

Whiteman said figures from internal reports indicate the actual number of veterans waiting for VA health care could be much higher than the numbers VA makes publicly available. Whiteman provided copies of the internal reports to The Washington Post.

From May 1, 2018, through May 1, 2019, the monthly average on the department’s public electronic wait list (EWL) was 14,971. During that period, the monthly average on the internal electronic wait list was 44,478.

In an email Wednesday night to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, Whiteman said that “I discovered a secret VA wait list” in September and that “the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.” He warned Wilkie that this could hurt the agency “unless swift actions are taken to properly address my concerns.”

Through its Veterans Health Administration, the department runs 1,250 health-care facilities, serving 9 million veterans annually.

VA press secretary Curt Cashour said Whiteman’s allegations are false. Cashour said VA’s electronic wait list has two components — clinical and administrative.

He said the clinical list — the public list — tracks the number of veterans waiting for medical treatment.

Of the other list, he said that “the administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.”

[VA is gearing up for a massive shift of health care to the private sector. But Democrats are fighting back.]

Cashour said VA does not publicly post the administrative component of the EWL, “because it has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and would only create confusion.”

Whiteman punched back, telling Wilkie that Cashour’s statement to The Post was “incredibly disingenuous.” Whiteman said any veteran waiting for treatment should be included on the public list, including veterans waiting for VA-funded care by private providers or veterans waiting to be transferred to another facility.

Unlike many federal whistleblowers, Whiteman went public while still on the job. Whiteman went through his chain of command months before becoming frustrated and contacting The Post’s Federal Insider.

Whiteman, 39, said he rose to GS-15, the top of the General Schedule, last year after just seven years as a federal civilian, all with VA. The Temple Hills, Md., resident started as a GS-7, doing pharmacy billing.

Before joining VA, he was a Marine for eight years, leaving as a staff sergeant working on jet weapons systems. His pride in that service is evident from his glass-enclosed uniform displayed on his office wall, along with other Marine and family decorations in his windowless spot on the eighth floor of VA’s Central Office, across Lafayette Square from the White House.

In a September email to his boss, Susan Kirsh, the acting assistant deputy undersecretary for health for access to care, and her boss, Steven L. Lieberman, VA’s acting principal deputy undersecretary for health, Whiteman said the discrepancies in public and internal wait-list numbers “could be seen as VA hiding a very large wait list of Veterans waiting extremely long for care.”

Whiteman was so disappointed in the way leadership handled his concerns that he filed a verbal complaint, under oath, about the discrepancies with the department’s Office of the Medical Inspector. He asked the office to investigate circumstances for patients who died while on the wait list to determine whether the deaths were connected to wait times.

Cashour said the medical inspector’s office found the allegations unsubstantiated. In the email to Wilkie, however, Whiteman said the medical inspector never followed up with him beyond his initial statement.

Whiteman has filed official complaints charging VA with retaliation against him because of his whistleblowing.

In an April 27 email, Whiteman told VA’s whistleblower protection office that one example of retribution followed the successful deployment of a text-message reminder system that led to a significant reduction in the number of missed medical appointments, saving an estimated $112 million annually.

“I lead a team of four VA employees on this project,” he wrote in an email to the whistleblower office. “I was the only one of the four who did not get an award for this project. I believe this was retaliation for my Whistleblower activity.”

Cashour said the department does not tolerate retaliation, but he did not comment on this allegation.

[VA security staff compromised safety and Shulkin violated ethics rules, oversight report says]

Whiteman also filed a retaliation complaint in an April 29 email to the Office of Special Counsel. This independent federal office protects federal whistleblowers. Despite the name, it is not led by or related to Robert S. Mueller III, who led a special-counsel investigation of Russia’s actions in support of Trump’s candidacy.

Although Whiteman is a GS-15, his email to the special-counsel office said he was subjected to “numerous undesirable work assignments” from Kirsh, including “reporting to a lower grade GS-11 employee. . . . I find this degrading and humiliating, yet I do the work as directed.”

Cashour said, “Whiteman has always reported to someone above the GS-15 level.” Whiteman said that is on paper, not in reality.

Married and the father of five, Whiteman plans to remain at VA, considering it the best place in the federal government for him as a health-care administrator. But his work life is no longer the same.

“It’s well known within headquarters that I am whistleblowing,” he said. “And I see it when I walk down the halls. People, you know, don’t look at me. They don’t make eye contact with me.”

Because of his disclosures, “there’s no more upward mobility for me at this point.” Whiteman said. “I consider myself probably stalled.”"

""Over the decades that followed, the United States hoped that China’s integration into the international system would lead to a more open, tolerant society. Those hopes have been dashed,"" Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement.

Pompeo's statement calls out China's ""new wave of abuses,"" including the the detention of Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang at so-called re-education camps.

Foreign experts estimate as many as 1 million Muslims have been placed into the programs, which Chinese officials likened to ""boarding schools,"" according to The New York Times.

""Even as the party builds a powerful surveillance state, ordinary Chinese citizens continue to seek to exercise their human rights, organize independent unions, pursue justice through the legal system, and simply express their views, for which many are punished, jailed, and even tortured,"" Pompeo said in his Monday statement.

Pompeo also urged the Chinese government to make a ""full, public accounting"" of those killed or missing.

During the June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, protesters seeking social freedom were forcibly suppressed. Pompeo called the protesters ""heroes"" who inspired future generations to call for freedom and democracy around the world.

""China’s own constitution stipulates that all power belongs to the people. History has shown that nations are stronger when governments are responsive to their citizens, respect the rule of law, and uphold human rights and fundamental freedom,"" Pompeo said."

While Tim Cook and other Apple brass were at WWDC 2019 showing off new iOS 13 features and what's coming to the Apple Watch, the Department of Justice was apparently cooking up other plans for the iPhone maker.

The DOJ reportedly has obtained jurisdiction to potentially investigate Apple over antitrust concerns, according to a Reuters report on Monday. This news came just hours after it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission secured rights to investigate Facebook. And this past Friday, the DOJ reportedly began preparing for an antitrust investigation on Google for its search practices and other business activities.

A spokesperson for the DOJ said it's the agency's policy to not confirm, deny, or otherwise comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.

These moves by the Justice Department and FTC comes as Apple and other Silicon Valley giants face renewed antitrust scrutiny in the United States. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, has made it a key part of her platform to break up the big tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Amazon. Earlier this month, Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, also called for the breakup of the company he helped create.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

State Department now requires U.S. visa applicants to share social media accounts,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-now-requires-us-visa-applicants-to-share-social-media-accounts-2019-06-01/,"The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category.

The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. The department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education, according to an initial notice.

The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form.

In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements."
Prince Harry Appears at Exhibit With Donald Trump After President's 'Nasty' Meghan Markle Comment Controversy,https://www.etonline.com,['Antoinette Bueno'],,,,https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-appears-at-exhibit-with-donald-trump-after-presidents-nasty-meghan-markle-comment,"President Donald Trump's first state visit to the U.K. is officially underway.

Trump arrived in London on Monday with his wife, first lady Melania Trump, and they viewed an exhibit at Buckingham Palace on the first day of their three-day visit. Prince Harry, as well as his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, also attended the exhibit -- which showed items of historical significance to the United States from the Royal Collection -- and Harry was photographed alongside Trump's daughter, Ivanka.

Harry's wife, Meghan Markle, is currently on maternity leave since giving birth to their son, Archie, on May 6.

Of course, POTUS' visit hasn't been without controversy. On Saturday, The Sun published an interview with Trump in which he was asked about Meghan previously saying she would move to Canada if he won the 2016 election. Meghan made the comments during her appearance on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore in May 2016, and she also called him ""divisive"" and ""misogynistic.""

""I didn't know that,"" Trump said when told of the comments. "" ... So, what can I say? I didn't know that she was nasty.""

On Sunday, Trump took to Twitter to deny that he called Meghan ""nasty,"" however, an audio recording of the interview does include his quote, ""I didn't know that she was nasty.""



Still, Trump also did have nice words for Meghan during the interview.

""I hope that she's OK,"" he said when told about her being on maternity leave.

""I think it is nice,"" he added about having an American in the royal family. ""I think it is nice and I'm sure she will do excellently. She'll be very good. I hope she does.""

A source told ET last week that Harry, Queen Elizabeth, Charles, Camila, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton all plan to meet with the U.S. president during his visit from June 3-5, but Meghan will not be in attendance for any of the scheduled events.

Meanwhile, Harry recently adorably met his young look-alike at the Cricket World Cup. Watch the video below for more:

Trump, who met the queen at Windsor Castle last year, is the 12th president she has encountered. The queen did not meet just one since taking the throne in 1952.

Over seven decades, Elizabeth diplomatically thanked a president who cloyingly called her a ""fairy princess"" and danced with another after dinner in the Rose Garden.

Between horseback riding and scone recipes, she also built relationships with Britain's most powerful ally. The following is a look back at some of her encounters.

Harry Truman

Queen Elizabeth's first presidential meeting occurred in October 1951, when she was a 25-year-old princess. The future monarch was greeted at National Airport in Virginia by President Harry Truman, and they shared the back seat of a convertible riding to Washington.

At dinner, Truman offered an awkward compliment. ""When I was a little boy, I read about a fairy princess, and there she is,"" Truman said, gesturing.

Elizabeth graciously responded: ""I thank you very much, Mr. President. I propose a toast to the President of the United States.""

Dwight Eisenhower

Elizabeth became figurehead of the waning British Empire in February 1952. President Eisenhower took office a year later, but they did not meet until his second term.

In 1957, Eisenhower, the former supreme Allied commander in Europe, hosted a state dinner at the White House wearing the British Order of Merit medal presented to him by Elizabeth's father George VI.

After hosting the Eisenhowers at Balmoral Castle in 1959, Elizabeth wrote Eisenhower a note on Buckingham Palace stationery. The 33-year-old mother of two shared her a drop-scone recipe, advising the president she reduced the flour and milk if making fewer servings.

""I have also tried using golden syrup or treacle instead of only sugar and that can be very good, too,"" she wrote.

John F. Kennedy

President Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline had dinner with the queen at Buckingham Palace in June 1961, after a two-day summit in Vienna with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.

A crowd of Londoners broke through a police line following the dinner and surrounded the first lady's car to look at her. The president was traveling in a separate vehicle that departed earlier.

Like Eisenhower, Kennedy had a wartime connection to Britain. His father was U.S. ambassador in London from 1938 to 1940, at first advocating appeasement of the Nazis, before resigning shortly after their occupation of France.

Richard Nixon

President Lyndon B. Johnson never met the queen. But President Nixon met her many times, usually for lunch.

As vice president, Nixon escorted Elizabeth down the U.S. Capitol steps following a 1957 lunch. In 1958, he and the queen chatted during a war memorial in London.

Nixon as president braved anti-Vietnam War protesters to lunch with the queen at Buckingham Palace in 1969, before joining the queen in 1970 for lunch at the more secluded English country house Chequers, north of London.

The queen's meal at Chequers was called ""unprecedented"" by journalists who noted it was the first known meal taken by a king or queen at the rural getaway for prime ministers.

Gerald Ford

Queen Elizabeth visited Washington for the second time as monarch in July 1976, and found herself treated to an outdoor dinner in the Rose Garden, followed by dancing with President Ford in the emptied-out state dining room.

The summer night dinner was described as beautiful, but soured by jokes by Bob Hope, who made the crowd uncomfortable recounting his interaction with a top hat one night in the Lincoln Bedroom.

A columnist speculated, however, that she may have been bored. ""Nobody but the Fords and the Rockefellers would talk to her, and nobody but Jerry Ford would dance with her,"" wrote Sally Quinn in the Washington Post.

The trip apparently irked the queen because the Secret Service forced her to use a specific limo, resulting in graceless flashes of leg as she exited.

Jimmy Carter

President Carter joined a 51-year-old Queen Elizabeth and six other world leaders for dinner in 1977 at Buckingham Palace.

The dinner coincided with the third annual G-7 summit of the world's leading capitalist powers.

Carter, a farmer from Georgia known for his modesty, posed for a photo with the queen and Prince Phillip. Carter wore a clownishly large black bow tie, poorly matching the one worn by the queen's spouse.

During the same visit, Carter breached protocol by kissing the Queen’s mother Elizabeth, widow of George VI, on the lips. The Queen Mother, who died in 2002 aged 101, snapped: ""Nobody has done that since my husband died."" She later commented: ""I took a sharp step backwards – not quite far enough.""

Ronald Reagan

President Reagan and Queen Elizabeth bonded over a love of horseback riding at Windsor Castle in 1982, and the pair had a notably friendly relationship.

During a 1983 trip to the United States, Reagan and the queen stuffed an itinerary with social events. The two rode horses at Reagan's California ranch and first lady Nancy Reagan sailed to San Francisco with the queen. Reagan then hosted a large state dinner. The day after, the queen threw a yacht party to celebrate the Reagans' 31st wedding anniversary.

Reagan would see the queen twice more as president — in 1984 and 1988 — during trips to London.

George H.W. Bush

President Bush visited London three times while in office, and Queen Elizabeth visited Washington once, in 1991.

During a White House state dinner, the queen praised Bush's role in the recently concluded Gulf War, in which a U.S.-led coalition reimposed an absolute monarchy in Kuwait.

""You led not with bombast but with what is called 'three o'clock in the morning courage,'"" the queen told Bush.

Bill Clinton

President Clinton hobnobbed with the queen during several visits to London, but she never paid him a visit in Washington.

Their first meeting came in 1994 — the same year as palace officials denied as ""complete nonsense"" Trump's public claim that the queen's son Prince Charles had joined Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

During Clinton's final meeting with the queen in 2000, Clinton chatted about his time golfing with her other son, Prince Andrew.

On his way back to Washington, Clinton reminisced to reporters aboard Air Force One, saying that the 74-year-old queen's hair had gone white, but she had ""youthful eyes.""

""She has these baby blue eyes — just piercing,"" Clinton recalled.

George W. Bush

President Bush also visited with the queen during several visits to England, and she returned to the U.S. for her most recent official trip in 2007 to mark the 400th anniversary of English colonization.

The gaffe-prone Bush suggested during a welcoming speech that the elderly queen was 230 years old — living at the time of the American Revolution.

""She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child,"" Bush recounted, making light of the slip over dinner.

Barack Obama

President Obama gifted the queen an iPod loaded with audio of his speeches during their first meeting in 2009, drawing widespread mockery. Michelle Obama was criticized for touching the queen on her back.

Obama made a safer choice in 2016, when for the queen's 90th birthday he gave her a photo album documenting her visits with U.S. presidents."

State Department says it is now requiring social media info from 'most' visa applicants,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department has begun requesting ""most"" US visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.

The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.

The State Department statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""

According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President Donald Trump in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the US and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the US for people from several majority-Muslim countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.

CNN previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.

Disabled veteran denied a VA mortgage over his marijuana dispensary job in Massachusetts,https://www.masslive.com,"['Michael Bonner', 'Mbonner Masslive.Com']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.masslive.com/boston/2019/06/disabled-veteran-denied-a-va-mortgage-over-his-marijuana-dispensary-job-in-massachusetts.html,"As a benefit of serving in the military, veterans have access to a low-rate mortgage with no money down. One disabled Massachusetts veteran was denied that benefit, though, due to his legal job in the marijuana industry, according to the Boston Globe.

A 35-year-old veteran spoke to the newspaper anonymously to protect his military relationship, but said he was denied a loan in January because he was an assistant manager of a licensed cannabis store.

“I was actually accomplishing a lifelong goal of mine, and then to have it pulled right out from under you at the 11th hour … I was blown away,” he told the Globe. “It was very frustrating and demoralizing.”

While marijuana is legal and several states, it remains illegal federally. The distinction has created many problems including marijuana companies working with banks to secure loans or establish checking or savings accounts.

Marijuana is legal in Massachusetts, but your boss doesn’t have to allow it -- yet A proposed bill would forbid employers from penalizing or discriminating against an employee for marijuana use outside the office, as long as the employee is not impaired while working.

Acting DHS secretary can’t explain how Trump’s tariffs on Mexico work,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/mcaleenan-trump-mexico-tariffs-c674b6c2d6b6/,"In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday morning, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan wasn’t able to articulate how or when the White House will end its tariffs on Mexican goods.

McAleenan appeared on cable news to defend President Donald Trump’s decision to impose new tariffs on Mexico as a means to address migration to the United States. The longer apprehension rates along the U.S.-Mexico border continue to rise, the higher the tariffs.

As the White House announced last week, a 5% tariff is set to go into effect on June 10 if Mexico does not step up immigration enforcement measures. The tariffs would gradually increase — an additional 5% on the first day of each month for four months — to a maximum of 25% by October, unless “the illegal immigration problem is remedied.”

Tapper asked McAleenan at what point would the administration consider lifting the tariffs, but McAleenan had no concrete response.

“I guess one of the questions I would have is assuming these tariffs go through, and right now it’s just a threat, what specific benchmark are you going to be looking at to see if Mexico is actually doing what you want them to do?” Tapper asked.

“I think what the president said, we need a vast reduction in the numbers crossing,” McAleenan replied.

According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there were roughly 100,000 apprehensions in April — so what would a “vast reduction” look like to the administration? McAleenan couldn’t answer that either.

Instead, McAleenan recommended the administration ask the Mexican government to enforce its own southern border with Guatemala, put an end to the organizations that help transport migrants across Mexico, and work with the United States on creating new asylum policies.

As ThinkProgress has previously reported, however, the Mexican government is already collaborating with the Trump administration on the immigration front, whether by arresting Central American migrants at the southern Mexico border or ordering bus operators to stop transporting migrants across the country.

Considering that the U.S. is one of Mexico’s biggest trade partners and even the preliminary 5% tariff could have devastating effects on the Mexican economy, this question is critical. U.S. imports of goods from Mexico totaled about $346.5 billion in 2018, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Mexico, meanwhile, sends nearly 80% of its exports to the United States. Should tariffs reach the full 25% that Trump has threatened, American exporters of goods to Mexico would also be impacted, likely shoulder the cost of this new policy.

McAleenan also had no answers for how the U.S. would respond if Mexico’s economy took a downturn, causing more people to migrate.

“Bottom line for me is we need [Mexico] at the table looking at new strategies that we can aggressively move out on,” he said."
State Dept. panel to redefine human rights based on 'natural law and natural rights',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is setting up a commission at the State Department to redefine human rights as based on what the department is describing as ""natural law and natural rights.""

Interested in LGBT? Add LGBT as an interest to stay up to date on the latest LGBT news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."

“The media does a disservice to the American public and sound policy making by not informing the progress we’ve made,” Wheeler said Monday at a luncheon at the National Press Club.

Directing his comments specifically to the reporters present, Wheeler a former energy lobbyist who has overseen various regulatory rollbacks at EPA, said it was the press’ responsibility to change the public perception that energy and environment issues were getting worse, not better, across the country.

“Every year since 2001 Gallup has conducted polling on the same question: Do you think the quality of the environment in the country as a whole is getting better or getting worse? Every year since 2001 more people have said, ‘Getting worse than getting better'” Wheeler said. “We need to fix this perception and we need the help of the press. The public needs to know how far we’ve come as a nation protecting the environment.”

He spoke of the agency’s success, since its establishment nearly half a century ago, in lowering particulate matter in the air and reducing CO2 emissions, listing accomplishments achieved under multiple government administrations. The comments came as he defended his own recent decisions, made under President Trump Donald John TrumpHead of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers to depart administration The Guardian editorial board says Trump is 'not welcome' in U.K. ahead of his first state visit Kushner casts doubt on the ability of Palestinians to govern themselves MORE, to lower emissions standards for cars, roll back standards on mercury air pollution, and suggest a standard for perchlorate, a chemical found in rocket fuel, that is 10-50 times higher than scientists suggest.

“Pollution is on the decline,” Wheeler said. “We’ve made tremendous progress since the 1970s, and that needs to be mentioned more often.”

“You may think I ignore our press clippings. But I don’t, I read them every day,” Wheeler told reporters. “I’ve noticed five things...that the press consistently gets wrong about this administration and the EPA in particular.”

Among them, was criticisms of his lobbying title – he represented more than just the coal industry; comments that a key Obama-era power plant emissions rule was rolled back – “It was never implemented,” he said; and the idea that the EPA is at war with its career staff – “We have a long and dedicated history of dedicated career employees,” Wheeler said.

Wheeler’s criticism of the media came the same day Trump slammed CNN and other media outlets for their coverage of his trip to England to meet Queen Elizabeth II, calling reporting “fake news.” The president went as far Monday as calling for a boycott of AT&T, the parent company of CNN, because of its coverage.

The EPA under Trump has similarly had a fraught relationship with the press. Last year, under Pruitt, a number of outlets were barred from attending a key industry meeting on a cancer-linked chemical. One reporter for the Associated Press was forcefully removed from the event."

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico has suggested that Mexico is willing to negotiate over President Trump’s threat to tax all incoming goods from Mexico because Mexico isn’t “doing enough” to stop illegal immigration into the United States. Obrador hinted that his country could tighten migration controls in order to stop Trump from imposing tariffs, first of 5%, then up to 25% by October. Trump made no specific conditions for constitutes “stopping” illegal immigration, so this is all up in the air as to what personally satisfies the Donald. If one didn’t know any better, one would think that the US now has an absolute monarch with absolute power to stop any good from coming into the country by Tweet. Chances are though, now that Mexico wants to talk, Trump will suspend any tariffs from being raised until conclusion of talks, announce the best deal in the history of our local group of galaxies has been made, cancel the tariffs and praise himself for helping the stock market break to new highs. And if that doesn’t happen he’ll blame the Fed.

Gap Gaps Down, Loses GPS

The Gap (NYSE:GPS), agape at its weak Q1 earnings report, gapped down nearly 10% at the end of last week. Same store sales were down 1% at Old Navy, also a Gap brand, and Banana Republic with same store sales down 3%. The Gap itself was the worst performer, same store sales down 10%. Upper management is blaming it on the cold weather in February. Business and traffic picked up in March and April, but February destroyed the quarter according to CEO Art Peck. Gap has gapped down like this before, after the Dot Com bubble burst, and from 2014 to 2016 when it collapsed almost as much as it had in 2000. Is the era of trendy overexpensive teenage clothing gone? Maybe not now that tariffs are all in place on China, so it should be a bit harder ordering cheap clothes from AliExpress.

US Ready To Talk to Iran? So Says Pompeo

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is now saying that President Trump is ready to negotiate with Iran without preconditions, as American weapons and big planes and bombs stream in to Iran’s neighborhood in a show of force that is sure to make them happy. Pompeo may be playing off of Iranian President Rouhani’s call to negotiate with the U.S. without being bullied, which probably means that Rouhani doesn’t quite appreciate the show of force in the Persian Gulf as much as Trump may want him to. Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister has said that talks are not very likely. “We’re prepared to engage in a conversation with no preconditions,” he said. “But the American effort to fundamentally reverse the malign activity of the Islamic Republic, this revolutionary force, is going to continue.” In other words, the “bullying” in Iran’s words, will continue, so looks like no talking here.

Lyft Tempts Drivers With Free Charging In Portland, Land of Charging Ports

Portland, Oregon is truly becoming the land of ports, as in electric charging ports for electric cars driven by Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) drivers. Lyft will be able to charge their electric cars for free in the city, thanks to a partnership with Portland General Electric (NYSE:GE) which is sponsoring the initiative. Hybrid drivers also qualify. We’re proud to fuel Lyft’s mission to minimize its impact on the environment with a robust and healthy EV charging network, as it aligns with our goal to help deploy electric transportation that serves everyone — regardless of how they choose to move throughout our region.” So says Dave Robertson, VP of public policy at Portland General Electric. Don’t let your imagination run wild though. There are a total of 3 public charging stations in Portland. So this isn’t going to be a multimillion dollar partnership or anything. It’s more like passing around a battery-powered tin can. General Electric Portland probably wants people to start using the 3 charging stations so they can get used to them.

Department of Justice to Wants to Make Alphabet Soup Out of Google

The massive fines that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had to deal with in the European Union may be coming to the United States, or worse, Alphabet could be broken up in some way, if the Justice Department is really gunning for it. Google’s parent company is being investigated for antitrust violations for giving search preference to its own businesses. Google has not commented. If Trump indeed wants the stock market to keep rising, then going after tech companies that lead the entire market higher is probably not the best way to do it. Alphabet has been down lately, but not by that much, so the impact of this investigation especially if it leads to fines and/or changes in business practices could bring the stock down significantly, especially if Google has stopped growing since completely taking over the search market.

DHS says citizenship approvals rose in 2018,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/31/dhs-says-citizenship-approvals-rose-2018/,"Homeland Security reached a five-year high in approvals of citizenship applications last year, and swore in more people as naturalized citizens as well, according to the new statistical report released Friday night.

Those numbers contradict the criticisms of congressional Democrats who had complained about backlogs building at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security branch that handles legal immigration.

The new report also suggests that far from a crackdown, the government is processing more asylum-seeker petitions than any of the last four years. That included a 61 percent increase from 2017 to 2018 in affirmative asylum applications — though refugee interviews are down from more than 1250,000 in 2016, the last year under President Barack Obama, to just 26,400 in fiscal year 2018 under President Trump.

Still, when the whole panoply of humanitarian programs is considered — asylum, refugees, crime victim visas, Temporary Protected Status and screening for credible fear or reasonable fear of persecution — the numbers were 32 percent higher than fiscal year 2017. Credible fear and reasonable fear are first steps on the asylum track.

USCIS’s workload has become contentious in recent years, with immigrant-rights groups accusing the Trump administration of building a bureaucratic “wall” to deny people the chance to enter the U.S. legally. The accusation is a play on their disdain for Mr. Trump’s border wall intended to stop illegal immigration.

Hispanic Democrats in Congress say things are so bad that they requested — and have been granted — an investigation to be done by the Government Accountability Office. Rep. Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the case backlog is an example of “President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.”

Yet the backlog in citizenship applications, for example, exploded during the end of the Obama administration. The Washington Times, which tracked the explosion at the time, sought comment from immigrant-rights activists and lawmakers, including Democrats, but didn’t find many who blamed the Obama administration for the slow processing.

The new numbers from USCIS also detail some of the more hidden parts of the agency’s work, such as its efforts to weed out fraud in legal immigration applications.

Experts say fraud is rampant, but the agency has not released any major fraud assessments in years.

Still, the Fraud Detection and National Security division reported 149,3000 investigative leads or actions year — a 14 percent increase over 2017. That included 30,400 tips of fraud, 7,600 national security matters and nearly 17,000 public safety matters.

FDNS also reported screening social media in 11,700 cases.

The Trump Administration Might Be Too Incompetent to Undermine Environmental Regulations,https://slate.com,['Richard L. Revesz'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/trump-administration-cant-actually-undermine-environmental-regulation-too-incompetent.html,"Photo illustration by Slate.

The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection. For the past two-plus years, it has used a retail approach, targeting Obama-era environmental rules one by one, trying to suspend compliance deadlines. This strategy has been met with limited success—more than 90 percent of the administration’s deregulatory efforts are being defeated in court, mostly due to sloppy agency actions. But the Environmental Protection Agency has recently decided it will undertake a new approach in its effort to launch a wholesale attack on environmental regulation—it will change the way it collects and processes data, to provide better justification to dismantle the analytical foundation of its rules. These moves fly in the face of established economics and health sciences, and are inconsistent with the practices of administrations of both parties over four decades. The consequences for the environment and public health could be disastrous. But even as this approach might be more deliberate, these actions are unlikely to survive court challenges as well.

The EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards.

In the coming weeks, the EPA plans to finalize vastly weakened versions of two important climate rules: a regulation controlling greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The draft proposals for the Trump administration’s revisions to each of these rules were rife with analytical problems. In the power plant rule revision, the agency exercised its discretion in a manner that imposed billions of dollars’ worth of net harm on the American public. And the vehicle rule analysis is justified by claims about improved safety that rest on a wholly implausible and discredited economic analysis: It assumes that people will buy more—as opposed to fewer—vehicles as they become more expensive. These failures are likely to reappear in the final rules as well, because the administration would be unable to justify its chosen actions without mangling the underlying analysis. As a result of these analytical failures, the rollbacks will be highly vulnerable to legal challenges and could add to the administration’s string of court losses.

Perhaps sensing urgency as these losses mount and the president’s term slips away, the EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. The agency has taken steps to begin an assault on the core foundations of environmental rulemaking, signaling that it plans to alter the building blocks of the economic analysis that underlies its rules. This new EPA attack features three dirty tricks that would erase the bulk of the benefits of critical environmental policies. These benefits—tens of thousands of averted deaths and hundreds of thousands of averted hospitalizations for strokes, heart attacks, and respiratory ailments—would, of course, still be there. The administration’s analysis would just pretend otherwise.

One EPA method involves calling into question the benefit of reducing pollution below the level of the national ambient air quality standards. Since the late 1970s, every administration—Republican and Democratic—has acknowledged that more stringent standards would provide greater health benefits. But earlier this month, William Wehrum, who oversees air quality for the EPA, brazenly cast doubt on this long-established, science-based approach, telling the New York Times that counting these benefits in regulatory analyses “doesn’t make any sense” because the standards are set at “safe” levels, thereby implying that there can be no benefits at concentrations below the ones that the EPA deems to be “safe.”

The problem with this understanding is that the Supreme Court has made clear that “the word ‘safe’ does not mean ‘risk-free.’ ” And, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears all the challenges to national ambient air quality standards, explained that in setting these standards, EPA must “ ‘select … standard levels that … reduce risks sufficiently to protect public health’ ” even while recognizing that “ ‘a zero-risk standard is [not] possible.’ ”

Wehrum should know better, or at least, he did not too long ago. He had previously served under President George W. Bush in senior positions in EPA’s air office between 2001 and 2007. During that time, in setting national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and for ozone, the EPA acknowledged that significantly higher benefits would accrue to the American people if the agency set the standards at levels more stringent that the ones it ultimately chose. The significant concern with this approach is that it will pave the way for the EPA to support laxer standards without having to acknowledge that there is a cost to human life in doing so.

A second EPA trick involves concealing “co-benefits”—the indirect (and often enormous) benefits that result when a regulation reduces pollutants besides the ones being directly targeted by a particular regulation. EPA has launched an attack on co-benefits most directly as part of a revision to a finding related to a major mercury pollution rule—it’s trying to argue that the $37 billion to $90 billion in health co-benefits resulting from reductions in harmful particulate matter pollution don’t exist. If the administration’s goal is to obscure the value of environmental rules, undermining co-benefits will certainly help.

Co-benefits are so universally accepted as a worthwhile thing to consider that even the Trump EPA’s own handpicked Science Advisory Board recently highlighted the importance of considering them. Furthermore, a landmark guidance document on regulatory analysis issued by the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush explicitly requires the consideration of indirect benefits, though the EPA has consistently taken co-benefits into account since the Reagan administration. Courts have also ruled that the indirect costs of regulations must be considered, so ignoring indirect benefits would create a lopsided and unjustifiable analysis. Indeed, counting indirect effects when they are negative but ignoring them when they are positive is the embodiment of the type of arbitrary and capricious conduct that the law categorically prohibits. But the Trump EPA now wants to make this the norm.

The EPA’s final dirty trick involves questioning foundational scientific studies on the harmful health impacts of particulate pollution. The detrimental health effects of particulate matter emissions are exceptionally well-documented. Two foundational studies performed in the 1990s found that people in cities with the highest levels of these pollutants were dying two years earlier than those in the least-polluted cities. The results were independently verified by two groups of outside researchers, and these studies have helped inform several major air pollution regulations. But an EPA rule proposed last year would bar the consideration of studies like these, even though they are widely regarded as state-of-the-art, because their individual patient health data cannot be shared publicly, because of patient confidentiality rules. The administration’s approach would make it virtually impossible for regulatory policy to rely on epidemiological studies, a science-denying approach that is unlikely to find a receptive ear in the courts.

During the retail phase of the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules, the EPA cut corners, which led to most of its actions being overturned in court. This new wholesale attack on environmental rulemaking is far more pernicious than the last. The Trump administration is actively trying to undermine and minimize science that has served as a universal baseline for decades. But once again, it’s pursuing its case sloppily, which means the courts are likely to still see through these dirty tricks and stop them before they have a massively negative impact on public health."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale of eight F-16 aircraft and related equipment to Bulgaria at an estimated cost of $1.67 billion, a Pentagon agency said on Monday.

The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin Corp, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.

“The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve security of a NATO ally and a key democratic partner of the United States in ensuring peace and stability in this region,” the statement said."
The EPA says a chemical in Monsanto's weed-killer doesn't cause cancer — but there's compelling evidence the agency is wrong,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/glyphosate-cancer-dangers-roundup-epa-2019-5,"Gardeners Alva and Alberta Pilliod say they used Monsanto's Roundup spray to keep weeds off their driveway for more than two decades, applying the herbicide while wearing flip flops, shorts, and tank tops. Now, they both have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). In a lawsuit, they were awarded $2.05 billion in damages in May.

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."
"USTR, Treasury say China pursuing 'blame game' on trade talks breakdown",https://www.reuters.com,"['David Lawder', 'Min Read']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/ustr-treasury-say-china-pursuing-blame-game-on-trade-talks-breakdown-idUSKCN1T42XC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said on Monday that China was pursuing a “blame game” in recent public statements and a weekend white paper that misrepresented the trade negotiations between the world’s two largest economies.

FILE PHOTO: Chinese staffers adjust U.S. and Chinese flags before the opening session of trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Thursday, Feb. 14, 2019. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS

In a joint statement, the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR) office and the U.S. Treasury reiterated their view that China’s negotiators had “backpedaled” on important elements of a deal that had been largely agreed, including on an enforcement provision.

“Our insistence on detailed and enforceable commitments from the Chinese in no way constitutes a threat to Chinese sovereignty,” USTR and the Treasury said. “Rather, the issues discussed are common to trade agreements and are necessary to address the systemic issues that have contributed to persistent and unsustainable trade deficits.”

China on Sunday issued a government policy paper on the U.S.-China trade dispute in which it asserted that the United States bore responsibility for setbacks in the talks, citing three instances in which Washington had backtracked on commitments made during the negotiations.

China’s Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, a prominent member of Beijing’s negotiating team, said in presenting the paper to the media that it would be impossible for the United States to use “extreme pressure” to force concessions from China.

Acrimonious rhetoric between Beijing and Washington has steadily increased since talks broke down in early May over U.S. accusations that Beijing had backtracked on commitments to codify in law changes to its intellectual property and technology transfer practices to address U.S. demands.

President Donald Trump imposed an increase in tariffs to 25% on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods on May 10, saying that China “broke the deal.” His administration later imposed severe sanctions against Huawei Technologies Co, China’s premier telecommunications equipment firm.

“The United States is disappointed that the Chinese have chosen in the ‘White Paper’ issued (on Sunday) and recent public statements to pursue a blame game misrepresenting the nature and history of trade negotiations between the two countries,” USTR and Treasury said in the statement.

The agencies, which have taken the lead in negotiations for the U.S. side, said that the impetus for the negotiations was China’s “long history of unfair trade practices,” and U.S. negotiating positions have been consistent throughout the talks.

There have been no talks scheduled since the last round ended in May, and it remains unclear whether Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet when they both attend the G20 leaders summit later this month in Japan."
"Queen Elizabeth set to fete Trump, as she has so many other US presidents",https://www.cnn.com,['Betsy Klein'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/politics/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-state-visit/index.html,"(CNN) Queen Elizabeth II has met with nearly every American President since Dwight Eisenhower during her more than 67 years on the throne. Next week, she'll welcome President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump back to the United Kingdom, this time for a rare state visit.

Though the Trumps and the Royal Family are expected to adhere to the highest levels of protocol during the visit, Trump's remarks ahead of the trip threaten to damage goodwill with the Queen -- he publicly insulted her grandson's wife on the eve of the visit.

During an interview with The Sun, Trump was asked about comments made by Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, ahead of the 2016 election. Speaking on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" in 2016, Markle called Trump misogynistic and said his politics are divisive, saying she would move to Canada if he won the presidency.

Trump responded, ""I didn't know that she was nasty. I hope she is OK,"" later adding, ""I am sure she will go excellently (as a royal). She will be very good."" Buckingham Palace had no comment on Trump's interview regarding Markle.

The Trumps previously met with the Queen at Windsor Castle last June, a more informal meeting over tea.

The trip comes amid a blitz of foreign travel for the President and will be the Trumps' second state visit in less than two weeks. In May, they were Japanese Emperor Naruhito's first state guests since he ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier that month.

For the Trump's official visit, Buckingham Palace is pulling out all of the Royal stops befitting a world leader. An official state visit requires the formal invitation of the Queen to a head of state ""on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth office,"" per Buckingham Palace , and usually involves a ceremonial welcome, a state banquet, other meetings with British officials and a formal farewell.

Trump, who is known to appreciate pomp and circumstance, is sure to revel in the pageantry. His adult children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump, will also be joining him and the first lady.

Likewise, they ""will have the opportunity to meet some other members of the Royal Family"" during the arrival ceremony, said a senior administration official briefing reporters on the trip. America's own member of the Royal Family, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is not expected to attend, as she has largely remained out of the public spotlight since giving birth in early May.

The 'special relationship'

The ""special relationship"" with the United Kingdom also carries special significance for the President. After their 2018 tea, Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan that he was thinking of his mother when he met the Queen.

""I was thinking about my mother. My mother passed away a while ago and she was a tremendous fan of the Queen. She thought she was a woman of elegance, and my mother felt she was a great woman. I remember even as a little guy, if there was any kind of a ceremony to do with the Queen, my mother would be watching the television -- she wanted to see it,"" Trump said at the time.

Trump recalled: ""I was walking up and I was saying (to Melania), 'Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle.' And it was beautiful, it was really beautiful but the Queen is terrific. She is so sharp, so wise, so beautiful. Up close, you see she's so beautiful. She's a very special person.""

Trump told Morgan that the Queen walked him through all of the presidents she had met.

""Harry Truman was the first president that she got to meet and know, and she went through a whole list. It was a very nice moment, Piers, very nice,"" he said.

The Queen met President Harry Truman when she was still Princess Elizabeth, during a trip to Washington in 1951 at the age of 25. She and Prince Philip stayed at Blair House with Truman and his family since the White House was under a four-year major renovation, according to the White House Historical Association.

State visits

Since then, she's met with every US President, with the one exception of President Lyndon B. Johnson. But this is only the third state visit from a US president during Queen Elizabeth II's reign; the invitation has only been extended to Trump's most recent predecessors -- Barack and Michelle Obama in May 2011 and George W. and Laura Bush in November 2003.

She hosted the Kennedys for a banquet -- not an official state visit -- in 1961, which was recently depicted in the Netflix drama ""The Crown,"" hinting at an icy, if not entirely accurate , relationship between the Queen and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

The Nixons, Carters, and Clintons also met her informally in 1970, 1977, and 1994, respectively, and she hosted a formal dinner honoring the Reagans at Windsor Castle in 1982. Carter drew the Queen Mother's ire during that 1977 visit when he kissed her on the lips.

""Nobody has done that since my husband died,"" she reportedly said.

The Queen has traveled to the United States for informal visits and state visits multiple times during her reign. For her first state visit to the US as Queen in 1957, she and Prince Philip stayed in the same suite in the White House in which her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother, had stayed in 1939, according to the White House Historical Association, and she was greeted with large crowds on her motorcade from the airport.

At the White House

In 1976, President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford hosted her for a state dinner in the Rose Garden. President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan served the Queen enchiladas and chile rellenos when she visited them at their Santa Barbara ranch in 1983, and days later, hosted a State Dinner in her honor at San Francisco's M.H. de Young Memorial Museum.

She rolled up her sleeves -- though not literally -- during an official state visit in 1991, planting a tree on the White House South Lawn alongside President George H. W. Bush, replacing a storm-damaged tree her father planted in 1937. And she attended a white-tie state dinner at the George W. Bush White House in 2007.

She shared a warm relationship with the Obamas, as Michelle Obama recently recalled

""So, I had all this protocol buzzing in my head, and I was like, 'Don't trip down the stairs and don't touch anybody, whatever you do,' "" the former first lady said during a book tour event. ""And so, the Queen says, 'Just get in, sit wherever,' and she's telling you one thing and you're remembering protocol and she says, 'Oh it's all rubbish, just get in.' ""

It remains to be seen whether the Queen shares the same affection for Trump.

Asked if he got the feeling she liked him, Trump told Morgan: ""Well, I don't want to speak for her, but I can tell you I liked her. So, usually that helps. But I liked her a lot."""
Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

(GOOGL - Get Report) shares traded sharply lower Monday as investor trimmed holdings of the Google parent following a weekend issue that caused traffic congestion across key parts of its network and a report that suggested it may face a federal antitrust probe over its search engine.

Google said the network issue, which began around mid-afternoon on Sunday, affected both its Cloud and YouTube offerings and caused severe congestion and user outages in the northeastern United States.

""The network congestion issue in eastern USA, affecting Google Cloud, G Suite, and YouTube has been resolved for all affected users as of 4:00 pm US/Pacific,"" Alphabet said in a statement. ""We will conduct an internal investigation of this issue and make appropriate improvements to our systems to help prevent or minimize future recurrence.""

""We will provide a detailed report of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation,"" the statement added. ""This detailed report will contain information regarding SLA credits.""

Google shares were marked 6.2% lower Monday to change hands at $1,037.11 each, a move that would wipe out all of its year-to-date gain and take the stock to its lowest level since January January 4.

Google's larger market issue Monday, however, centers around multiple media reports from late Friday -- first by the Wall Street Journal --- that suggested the U.S. Department of Justice is preparing a far-reaching probe into the tech giant's sprawling business.

""Potential implications for Google could include new regulations on business practices, or

an antitrust probe leading to a breakup,"" said Bank of America analyst Justin Post. To break up Google (on unfair search practices or too much power to influence opinion on multiple properties?), the DOJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition.""

""It is very rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T as past

examples, though the government tried to break up Microsoft and failed,"" he added, noting a full investigation could take as many as five years to resolve.

Last year, Google was fined a record $5 billion by European antitrust authorities following a lengthy investigation into contracts that tie makers of android-operated smartphones to the exclusive sale of its apps and was hit with a further $1.7 billion penalty in March for unfairly restricting rivals from displaying ads on its platform via third parties using its AdSense tool.

Should Google find itself in the crosshairs of a similar Justice Department probe in the United States, the Mountain View, California-based group could be susceptible to fines and restrictions in its biggest and most import market. It could also, given the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, appear on the forthcoming list of ""Unreliable Entities"" being prepared by the Chinese government in an effort to respond to the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei Technologies last month.

""Foreign enterprises, organizations and individuals that do not comply with market rules, violate the spirit of contract, block or cut supplies to Chinese firms with non-commercial purposes, and seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, will be added to the list of unreliable entities,"" Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Friday."

The El Paso Del Norte Processing Center in West Texas had packed 900 people into a building meant to hold just 125 when the agency’s inspector general made a surprise visit to the facility in early May, according to a report released Friday.

One cell built to hold 12 people contained 76 migrants, forcing detainees to stand on toilets to find room to breathe.

“Border Patrol management on site said there is an ongoing concern that rising tensions among detainees could turn violent,” the report found.

On Wednesday, Border Patrol caught 1,036 migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border near El Paso —largest single group ever."
William Barr just contradicted himself over a key claim he's made about Mueller's obstruction findings,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-contradicted-himself-key-claim-made-mueller-obstruction-findings-2019-5,"Attorney General William Barr contradicted himself in a significant way during an exclusive interview with CBS News, during which he revealed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) ""didn't agree with the legal analysis"" the former special counsel Robert Mueller used in his obstruction-of-justice investigation into President Donald Trump.

The attorney general added during the CBS interview that Mueller's analysis ""did not reflect the views of the department"" and instead represented ""the views of a particular lawyer or lawyers.""

But on May 1, while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barr said the department ""accepted the special counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the special counsel in reaching our conclusion"" in the obstruction case.

During his CBS News interview, Barr told host Jan Crawford that DOJ officials ""applied what we thought was the right law [in the obstruction case], but then we didn't rely on that. We also looked at all the facts, tried to determine whether the government could establish all the elements, and as to each of those episodes, we felt that the evidence was deficient.""

Mueller did not make a ""traditional prosecutorial judgment"" on whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probe. But prosecutors laid out an extensive roadmap of evidence — including 11 potential instances of obstruction — against Trump, many of which appear to meet the legal criteria needed to prove obstruction of justice.

Mueller cited a 1973 Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memo — which says a sitting president cannot be indicted — as the primary reason he didn't make a conclusion one way or another on whether Trump obstructed justice. Many legal experts have said that even if Mueller couldn't indict Trump, he still could have stated that he believed there was enough evidence of criminal activity.

But Mueller said that suggesting Trump should be charged without actually charging him would be unfair because it would deprive the president of the chance to clear his name in a court of law. For that reason, Mueller said he didn't believe he was authorized to make a formal conclusion on the obstruction question.

Prosecutors noted, however, that their report ""does not exonerate"" the president and that if they had confidence Trump did not [emphasis ours] commit a crime, they would have said so.

They also pointed out that a president is not immune from criminal prosecution once he leaves office, and that the Constitution ""requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" which is a reference to impeachment.

One former senior DOJ official who worked closely with Mueller when he was FBI director characterized Mueller's report and his public statement this week to INSIDER as ""Mueller, in his own way and as loudly as he legally could, shouting from the rooftops that Congress needs to act.""

""Mueller isn't [Whitewater independent counsel] Ken Starr,"" the former senior official added. ""He's not a showman, he's a prosecutor. He got the evidence, he laid out all the facts, and he did the heavy lifting. Now, he's basically saying to Congress: the ball's in your court. Start the impeachment process.""

Before Mueller's report was released to the public, the attorney general took the unusual step of releasing a four-page summary of his ""principal conclusions"" of Mueller's findings. Barr said Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence to charge Trump or anyone on his campaign for conspiring with the Russian government during the 2016 election.

In the obstruction case, Barr took it upon himself to conclude that there wasn't enough evidence to accuse Trump of obstructing justice.

Barr told CBS News that Mueller's statement that he could not clear Trump of a crime ""is not the standard we use at the department.""

""We have to determine whether there is clear violation of the law, and so we applied the standards we would normally apply,"" Barr said. ""We analyzed the law and the facts, and a group of us spent a lot of time doing that and determined that, both, as a matter of law, many of the instances would not amount to obstruction.""

Barr's interview comes as he weathers a firestorm of criticism over his handling of Mueller's report. Barr told Congress during his confirmation hearing earlier this year that he would do everything he could to protect the integrity of the FBI's Russia probe and that he did not believe Mueller was on a ""witch hunt,"" as Trump and his allies often claim.

But since taking over as attorney general, Barr has gone to significant lengths to defend the president in ways that many say casts him more as the president's personal defense attorney instead of the nation's chief law enforcement officer.

Barr also skipped a scheduled hearing before the House Judiciary Committee about his oversight of the Russia probe; he launched multiple investigations into the origins of the Russia probe; and he accused the FBI of ""spying"" on the Trump campaign.

This week, during his interview with CBS News, Barr used more inflammatory rhetoric to describe the Russia investigation, saying the bureau crossed "" a serious red line"" by investigating Trump. Seconds later, however, the attorney general admitted he had no clear basis for making the allegation."
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
DOJ rebuffs judge's order to release transcripts of Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian envoy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-rebuffs-judges-order-to-release-transcripts-of-michael-flynns-conversations-with-russian-envoy,"The Justice Department rejected a federal judge's order to release the transcripts of wiretapped conversations retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had with a Russian envoy.

Prosecutors also declined to produced unredacted portions of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report that had to do with Flynn, who assisted Trump's 2016 campaign and briefly served as national security adviser in 2017.

Little explanation was given beyond stating that the materials were not relevant to Flynn's sentencing.

“The government further represents that it is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence, nor are there any other recordings that are part of the sentencing record,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing Friday in response to an order by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan.

Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about his communications with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which were about sanctions during the transition before Trump took office, and reached a plea deal to cooperate with Mueller's team. Flynn has yet to be sentenced and is still working with Justice Department prosecutors in a criminal case against Bijan Kian, his former lobbying partner who worked for the Turkish government.

The Justice Department did comply with Sullivan's order to release a transcript of a Nov. 22, 2017, voicemail that former Trump lawyer John Dowd left for Flynn's lawyer Rob Kelner shortly after Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller."

Rumor: DoJ is going to investigate Google for antitrust violations,https://boingboing.net,[],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://boingboing.net/2019/06/03/reaganomic-implosion.html,"Rumor: DoJ is going to investigate Google for antitrust violations

According to a widely reported rumor -- first published by the WSJ -- the DoJ is preparing to launch an antitrust probe of Google, though it's not clear on what basis such a probe would proceed.

Google is already under a 2013 FTC consent decree for anticompetitive behavior, under whose terms the company is required to fairly license its mobile patents, improve the management tools on its ad platforms, and refrain from using its control over the ad and search platform to prioritize its products and services over those of rivals.

Since the Reagan era, American antitrust regulators have been hamstrung by the ideology of failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, who invented an imaginary legislative history of antitrust law that required that antitrust action only be taken when companies were raising prices for consumers in the short term, and not to prevent monopolies and anticompetitive behavior in general.

This rule has made the wealthiest Americans much wealthier, and in general it's hard to imagine the Trump administration (or any Republican administration) reversing it. However, concentration in the online sector has resulted in widespread ""no-platforming"" of far-right darlings, who are, in turn, just the latest victims of no-platforming (the technique was pioneered on sex worker activists, trans activists, indigenous rights activists, Black Lives Matter activists, etc). This has set up an odd tension within the right: on the one hand, they don't want to stop the gravy train that monopoly profits represent for shareholders, but on the other hand, they're not happy that five or six tech execs can simply banish right wing blowhards from the public discourse.

So within the right, there has emerged a tentative and highly selective enthusiasm for trustbusting (a tendency that includes no less a far-right asshole than Brett Kavanaugh).

I imagine that the FTC's plan represents some expression of this tendency: red meat for conservatives who hate the platforms, a saber rattled at their content moderation execs warning them to stay away from de-platforming Nazis and other right-wing thugs, and a sincere hope that a successful Google prosecution won't set the stage for other antitrust actions.

The U.S. Justice Department is planning an antitrust investigation into Alphabet’s Google subsidiary, according to several reports on Friday. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The report comes amid discussion from politicians and the public about whether large technology companies should be broken up. Government pushback on Alphabet in search could hit at the core one of the most highly valued publicly traded companies in the world.
