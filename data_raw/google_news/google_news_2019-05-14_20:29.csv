Iranian presidential aide says Trump will 'get a war' for listening to 'the mustache' John Bolton,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Lukas Mikelionis', 'Hamid Baeidinejad', 'Lukas Mikelionis Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-president-aide-trump-war-mustache-john-bolton,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s advisor assailed President Trump Tuesday, saying he will get a “war” for listening to National Security Advisor John Bolton, referring to him as “the mustache.”

Hesamoddin Ashena, Rouhani’s key advisor, took to Twitter after U.S. military experts suggested “Iran or its proxies” damaged four commercial ships off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sunday.

“You wanted a better deal with Iran. Looks like you are going to get a war instead. That’s what happens when you listen to the mustache. Good luck in 2020!” Ashena wrote in a tweet.

Ashena's comments were also echoed by Iran's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Hamid Baeidinejad, who warned the U.S. in an interview with Sky News on Tuesday.

“Don't test us,” he said is the Iranian regime’s message to the Trump administration, noting that the Iranian military is “fully ready” for any conflict in the region.

“While we have renounced any escalation in the region, I would assure you that Iranian armed forces are fully ready for any eventuality in the region, so they should not try to test the determination of Iran to confront any escalation in the region,” he said.

Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei however later appeared to downplay any prospect of war between the two countries.Iran's state TV quoted Khamenei on Tuesday as calling negotiations with the U.S. ""poison"" and saying: ""This is not a military confrontation, because no war is going to happen.""

Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, said: ""Neither we, nor they are seeking war, they know that it is not to their benefit.""

Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, also sought to downplay any notion of conflict.

“We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran, we’re looking for the regime to simply stop conducting assassination campaigns throughout Europe,” he said Tuesday in the seaside resort of Sochi, Russia.

His comment follows assertions by Trump administration officials that they have detected signs that Iranian or Iranian-backed proxies were preparing for possible attacks against American interests in the Mideast. The administration cited the threats as the reason for expediting the deployment of an aircraft carrier strike group and other military resources to the region.

“While we have renounced any escalation in the region, I would assure you that Iranian armed forces are fully ready for any eventuality in the region, so they should not try to test the determination of Iran to confront any escalation in the region.” — Hamid Baeidinejad

Iran or Iranian-backed proxies reportedly used explosive charges on the ships, causing a 5-to-10-foot hole in each near or just below the water line.

A Norwegian-flagged vessel, two Saudi oil tankers and a bunkering tanker flagged in Sharjah, one of the UAE's seven emirates, all suffered similar damage Sunday.

Bolton has long been known as an arch critic of the Iranian regime and is deemed a foreign policy hawk in the Trump administration.

Earlier this month, Bolton announced that the U.S. is sending the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the Middle East in order ""to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime.”

TRUMP WARNS IRAN, SAYS COUNTRY WILL 'SUFFER GREATLY' IF IT DOES 'ANYTHING' AMID TENSIONS

Trump warned Iran on Monday afternoon that it will “suffer greatly” if the country does “anything” in the form of an attack.

His warning came just days after Iran warned it easily could destroy a naval fleet sent by the United States in order to ward off a potential threat to U.S. commercial interests.

“Their billion[-dollar] fleet can be destroyed with one missile,” Ayatollah Tabatabai-Nejad said, according to Reuters.

“If they attempt any move, they will ... [face] dozens of missiles because at that time [government] officials won't be in charge to act cautiously, but instead things will be in the hands of our beloved leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,” he warned.

The escalation also follows the increasing diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran, which the U.S. has accused of threatening American interests and allies in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Meanwhile, British Maj. Gen Chris Ghika, a senior coalition officer, said the U.S.-led military coalition combating ISIS has detected no increase threat lately to its troops in Iraq or Syria from Iranian-backed forces.

""No, there's been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria,"" he said. ""We're aware of their presence, clearly, and we monitor them, along with a whole range of others because that's the environment we're in."
Trump pushes for new bailouts for farmers hurt by his trade war,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/14/18622956/trump-trade-war-china-bailout-farmers-socialism,"President Donald Trump is opposed to the government interfering in the market to pick winners and losers — at least when doing so doesn’t directly benefit voters crucial to his reelection prospects.

In recent months, Trump has made his opposition to socialism — a system of government in which the government plays a leading role in distributing goods and services — a regular feature of his speeches.

During his most recent State of the Union address, Trump alluded to rhetoric by Democrats and said, “Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.” At a rally in Wisconsin last month, Trump vowed that America “will never be a socialist country.” He framed the crisis in Venezuela as a failure of socialism and suggested Democrats wanted to use the Mueller investigation to force him out of office and “institute Socialism.”

Life, however, comes at you fast — especially when you launch a trade war with a country that represents the second-largest export market for American agriculture.

During an Oval Office event with Hungary’s far-right leader Viktor Orbán on Monday, Trump outlined a plan to redistribute money from American importers to farmers hurt by his escalating trade war with China that might fall short of socialism, but is certainly a far cry from the values of free markets and free trade traditionally embraced by Republicans.

“Out of the billions of dollars that we’re taking in [from tariffs], a small portion of that will be going to our farmers,” Trump said. “We’re going to take the highest year — the biggest purchase that China has ever made with our farmers, which is about $15 billion — and do something reciprocal to our farmers.”

Because he doesn’t understand how tariffs actually work, Trump seems to believe this plan represents a redistribution from China to American farmers. But China does not in fact pay for the 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods in tariffs Trump reimposed on Chinese goods after months of negotiations failed to bring the two countries into agreement. Those tariffs are paid by American importers, who often pass the cost along to consumers.

So Trump’s plan, as vague as it is, seems to represent a selective protection from the costs of tariffs: All Americans — from those who pay for his tariffs in the checkout line to farmers hurt by the retaliatory tariffs China has placed on their goods — are being asked to absorb some short-term pain for the good of the country. But the federal government is subsidizing that cost for only a select group.

On Tuesday morning, Trump reiterated his plan on Twitter, and referred to farmers are “Our great Patriot Farmers” — a label acknowledging the hardship the trade war is causing.

Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now. Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product, the best, but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2019

Trump’s tariffs subsidy plan — which comes on the heels of a $12 billion program that was available to farmers hurt by retaliatory tariffs last year — represents a sop to his base. More than 75 percent of voters in the Farm Belt voted for him in 2016, yet these same people are being hurt by a self-inflicted trade war as Trump turns his sights to 2020.

“The President of the United States owes farmers like myself some type of plan of action,” John Wesley Boyd Jr., a soybean farmer in Baskerville, Virginia, told CNN on Monday. “Farmers were his base. They helped elect this president ... and now he’s turning his back on America’s farmers when we need him the most.”

Trump’s long-term goal is to force China to agree to a trade deal favorable to the US by inflicting pain upon its economy. But in the meantime, his trade war is causing pain to farmers and the financial markets. And if China follows through on its plan to increase tariffs on $60 billion of American products on June 1, consumers likely will feel the hurt too.

“Americans’ entire shopping cart will get more expensive,” Hun Quach, vice president of international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, told the New York Times.

You don’t have to take Quach’s word for it — during a Fox News interview on Sunday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow admitted that “both sides will suffer” because of Trump’s trade war with China. Kudlow also acknowledged that Trump’s understanding of how tariffs work is flawed. But Axois’s Jonathan Swan, citing a former White House aide, reported on Tuesday that Trump’s false belief about tariffs is “like theology.”

Judge Napolitano: Trump's vow to 'investigate the investigators' is finally going to happen,https://www.foxnews.com,['Anna Hopkins'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-napolitano-trump-barr-investigation-us-attorney,"After news broke on Monday evening that Attorney General William Barr appointed U.S. attorney in Connecticut John Durham to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, Judge Napolitano argued that the move marks the concrete beginning of President Trump's call to ""investigate the investigators.""

During an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday morning, Napolitano discussed the fact that Durham has prosecutorial abilities - which would theoretically allow him to indict individuals if his investigation found sufficient evidence.

""This is the investigation that the president has been calling for and that the president has promised,"" he said. ""Who and how, and under what circumstances, did the whole thing get started?""

DEROY MURDOCK: DEMOCRATS BULLY BARR

Barr has alleged for some time that an investigation would be launched into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and said during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing last month that he believed ""spying"" took place on the Trump campaign on behalf of the FBI.

Napolitano said what comes next will be at Durham's discretion - he could find sufficient evidence that the FISA warrant which permitted the wire-tapping of Carter Page was predicated, or he could determine that it was not.

""In theory, he could also say this was a lie. This was falsified. This was perjury. This was fraud, this was deception. I'm going to indict all these people,"" Napolitano said.

TRUMP SAYS BARR WILL DECIDE IF MUELLER TESTIFIES BEFORE CONGRESS

Should that be the case, Napolitano argued that a statute of limitations will also have to be taken into consideration. The statute of limitation for most federal crimes is five years, he said.

Regardless of the outcome, Napolitano said the investigation is in good hands.

Mitt Romney's vote was just his latest break with the president. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP File Photo Congress Romney rejects Trump judicial pick who smeared Obama

Mitt Romney was the only Republican senator to vote against one of President Donald Trump's judicial nominees on Tuesday. And he did so in part to defend former President Barack Obama.

Romney cast the lone GOP ""no"" vote against Michael Truncale, who was confirmed 49-46 on Tuesday morning to the Eastern District of Texas. Truncale called Obama an ""un-American imposter"" in June 2011, and explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was ""merely expressing frustration by what I perceived as a lack of overt patriotism on behalf of President Obama."" He also said he believed Obama was born in Hawaii and did not subscribe to ""birtherism,"" a racist theory that the president was not an American citizen.

But all that wasn't a good enough explanation for Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee.

""He made particularly disparaging comments about President Obama. And as the Republican nominee for president, I just couldn't subscribe to that in a federal judge,"" Romney said in a brief interview. ""This was not a matter of qualifications or politics. This was something specifically to that issue as a former nominee of our party.""

Romney's vote was just his latest break with the president on everything from his national emergency declaration to his plans to nominate Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve. Though he backs Trump more often than not, he's one of the Republicans most inclined to break with the president.

California files 50th lawsuit against Trump administration in case over union dues,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-files-50th-lawsuit-against-trump-administration-in-case-over-union-dues,"California on Monday filed its 50th lawsuit against the Trump administration in a case challenging a federal rule that bans states from deducting union dues from the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of workers who provide in-home care to low income, disabled and elderly people.

State Attorney General Xavier Becerra argued that the new rule – which puts up barriers for taking employee medical benefits and voluntary union dues out of workers’ paychecks – not only harms the home care workers who have joined a union, but also the people these workers serve.

“With this rule, the Trump administration is not only harming Medicaid-skilled home care workers who have joined unions, but the millions of seniors and people with disabilities who depend on these indispensable workers,” Becerra said in a statement.

CALIFORNIA WORKERS SUE UNION FOR HOLDING THEM 'AGAINST THEIR WILL'

Becerra noted that the new federal rule affects about 500,000 workers in the state, with many of them being members of the Service Employees International Union. Along with California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington also joined in the lawsuit, which – if successful – would affect home care workers across the nation.

The SEIU has also been heavily critical of the Trump administration’s new rule, calling it a “concerted attack against working” against roughly 800,000 home care workers across the country.

“Like so many home care workers across this country, I chose to join my union to have a voice,” Carmen Roberts, a home care worker in California and SEIU member, said in a statement. “This administration’s new rule is a blatant attempt to silence home care workers and to undermine our dignity in the workplace.”

The Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services announced the rule change last week, saying that “nothing in this rule would interfere with an employer’s ability to make payroll deductions that are required by law or voluntary deductions for things like health and life insurance ... and union dues.”

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled union dues for home health care workers had to be voluntary, meaning unions could not deduct dues from employees who were not members yet were still covered under the collective bargaining agreement. That same year, former President Barack Obama’s administration issued a ruling clarifying states could deduct dues from paychecks of home health care workers who volunteered to join the union.

NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA SUE TRUMP ADMIN IN 9TH CIRCUIT OVER NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION

The Trump administration reversed that rule, arguing it violated federal law that bans states from diverting Medicaid money to third parties, with some exceptions. But Becerra and union leaders said it is designed to weaken the finances of unions by making it harder for people to pay their dues.

“It is a shameful political attack on home care providers who are largely women and people of color,” said April Verette, president of SEIU Local 2015, which represents more than 385,000 long-term care workers in California.

Home health care workers are part of Medicaid’s In-Home Supportive Services program. California has the largest IHSS program in the country, with more than 500,000 patients and more than 470,000 workers.

California has become the most vocal opponent of the Trump administration, with Becerra using federal courts to challenge White House policies on everything from tribal lands and pesticides to the border wall and birth control. Since Trump took office in January 2017, Becerra has filed 50 lawsuits against White House policies – surpassing the milestone for most lawsuits leveled against an administration set by Texas when it hit the Obama administration with 48 suits over eight years.

“That’s a lot of lawsuits,” Becerra said Monday, according to the Sacramento Bee. “That’s a lot of wrongdoing and a lot of unlawfulness by the president of the United States. But California is going to stand up. We’re going to protect everything that’s made us a place where people can live in dignity, and number 50 is one of those I absolutely intend to win.”

Judge grills Trump attorney in subpoena case,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney', 'John Bresnahan', 'Brian Faler', 'Aaron Lorenzo']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/trump-subpoena-congress-legal-1318867,"The ruling from Judge Amit Mehta (left) will represent a flashpoint in the myriad disputes between the White House and Congress. | Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Legal Judge grills Trump attorney in subpoena case Democrats are fighting for access to the president's financial records.

A federal judge raised pointed doubts Tuesday about arguments by President Donald Trump’s legal team that a Democratic effort to subpoena Trump’s financial records was an invalid exercise of congressional power.

Amit Mehta, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, indicated that he would have trouble ruling that Congress’ goal in accessing the president’s records was unconstitutional — as Trump’s lawyers have argued — and he underscored that he believes Congress has a significant “informing function” that doesn’t necessarily require an explicit legislative purpose to justify an investigation involving the president.

Story Continued Below

“Does Congress have to do that — do they have to identify a bill in advance? The Supreme Court has said the opposite,” Mehta said during a round of questioning with Trump’s attorney William Consovoy during a hearing.

Consovoy argued throughout Tuesday’s hearing that Congress has no basis for investigating whether Trump’s financial disclosures are accurate, contending that it’s a “law enforcement issue” that’s not tied to a specific legislative agenda.

Mehta cast serious doubt on those claims, suggesting at one point that investigations of such financial violations are “strictly” under Congress’ purview and that the courts have “very little, if any” discretion over Congress’ asks.

“I almost wonder whether I have no role,” Mehta told Consovoy at one point.

Despite Mehta’s apparent skepticism of the Trump team’s legal arguments, the appointee of President Barack Obama declined to issue a ruling from the bench but said he would mull over the arguments in the coming days, calling the nature of the dispute too significant to decide quickly. He gave both sides until the end of the week to submit additional filings and evidence.

If Mehta ultimately rules that the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s subpoena — seeking eight years of Trump’s financial records from the accounting firm Mazars USA — is valid, it would mark a significant victory for House Democrats mounting a slew of inquiries about the president’s financial dealings, each of which have been challenged by Trump. The committee’s demand is part of its investigation into alleged financial crimes committed by Trump, including whether he inaccurately reported his finances.

It would also reinforce a ruling made in 2017 in support of House Republican efforts to obtain private records from Fusion GPS — the firm commissioned by the Democratic Party to conduct opposition research on Trump in 2016.

House General Counsel Douglas Letter, arguing on behalf of the oversight panel, urged Mehta to make a timely ruling on the matter.

“This Congress is limited in time. There’s obviously going to be appeals here. We just do not want there to be any lag in time,” Letter said. “We rushed and we briefed this case. We think it should be decided quickly. … Any delay here undermines the House’s ability to do what the Constitution allows it to do.”

Letter knocked the president in his opening remarks to the judge, contending that the president “has taken the position” that Congress is a “nuisance.”

“The problem with that is this is a total and basic and fundamental misunderstanding of the system that was set up by the Constitution,” Letter said.

Trump filed suit seeking to invalidate the committee’s subpoena three weeks ago — the first of two lawsuits aimed at hobbling House Democrats’ investigations targeting his administration, presidential campaign and business empire.

Mehta’s ruling could provide a blueprint for other judges deciding on Trump’s attempts to thwart congressional investigations. Trump has also filed suit to block the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees from subpoenaing Deutsche Bank and Capital One, where many of his business and personal financial records are housed.

The judge’s ruling will also represent a flashpoint in the myriad disputes between the White House and Congress — marking the first time the judiciary weighs in on Trump’s blanket strategy of refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas and oversight requests from House Democrats.

Mehta spent the early portion of the hearing grilling Consovoy about why Congress' interest in investigating possible foreign payments to the president — known as emoluments — isn't valid and whether Congress has legitimate investigative interest into a president's potential financial conflicts of interest.

“Say for example if a president had a financial interest in a particular piece of legislation that was being considered … in your view Congress could not investigate whether a president has a conflict of interest?” Mehta wondered.

“It would lack legitimate legislative purpose,” replied Consovoy, who argued that any attempt by Congress to determine whether a president was acting outside the law was improper because it's the job of law enforcement, not lawmakers.

Mehta questioned, however, whether the Whitewater investigation of the Clintons or the Watergate investigation of President Richard Nixon would have passed muster under Trump's current legal theory.

Trump's attorney said he was arguing only on the facts of the subpoena case, not previous investigations.

Consovoy urged Mehta to grant Trumps’ legal team “a week or two” to gather documents from the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, that might support their case. Consovoy said he’s particularly interested in obtaining a memorandum of understanding between the Oversight Committee and the Intelligence and Financial Services panels, which he said could support the argument that Democrats are pursuing Trump from a law enforcement — not legislative — perspective.

Consovoy acknowledged that he'd have no authority to compel production of that document from committee Democrats, including Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), but he said Jordan might be willing to provide it voluntarily. Letter told Mehta that the memorandum of understanding has “nothing to do” with the Mazars subpoena but offered to provide it to the court under seal.

Letter said the House’s investigations have been supported by a previous Supreme Court ruling determining that such probes only need to have a conceivable legislative purpose, not necessarily an explicit one.

Mehta asked Letter whether he agreed with the notion that Congress’s legislative role also includes an “informing function” — providing important information to the public. Letter noted that Congress investigated the 9/11 attacks and issues related to the Iraq War, Watergate and Whitewater — primarily to inform the public.

Letter also noted that it’s sometimes impossible to know what legislative remedy might arise from an investigation at the outset. “I’m not a prophet,” he said, “you’re not a prophet.”

When Mehta questioned whether there are any conceivable limits on Congress’ demands for private presidential documents, Letter replied that it’s conceivable but that this case isn’t close.

“I want to see the president’s diary from when he was seven years old or she was 12 years old — that would probably stretch my arguments to the breaking point,” he said.

Cummings issued the so-called friendly subpoena earlier this year to Mazars, which asked for the subpoena so that it could comply with the request. He issued it just days after Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney and fixer, provided documents to the Oversight panel purportedly showing that the president artificially inflated and deflated the value of his assets in order to benefit financially.

Cohen in February disclosed several of Trump’s financial statements which were submitted to Deutsche Bank in 2014 as Trump was seeking a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills NFL team. Cohen told lawmakers that the documents showed that Trump inflated the value of certain assets in order to secure the loan.

The committee says it needs Trump’s financial records from Mazars as part of its efforts to corroborate Cohen’s allegations.

During the hearing, Mehta also asked pointed questions of the House Democratic side. Mehta noted that Cummings suggested at the outset of his subpoena request that he wanted to “determine whether the president may have engaged in illegal conduct” before taking office.

“This is not an impeachment proceeding. What’s the basis to investigate illegal conduct before his tenure in office?” Mehta wondered.

Letter replied hypothetically that there could be significant questions about whether Trump was under the thumb of a foreign power.

“President Trump has conceded, I believe, that he was trying to get a hotel in Moscow. Had he not been elected he would have pursued that,” he said, noting that the president may have taken questionable steps to secure that hotel.

“It may very well be that the Russians know that. It may very well be that the Russian oligarchs know that. We need to know that … Is the president of the United States beholden to foreign interests who can hold certain things over his head?” Letter continued.

Dems ratcheting up demands for answers on the DOJ's hardline ObamaCare position,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-ratcheting-up-demands-for-answers-on-the-dojs-hardline-obamacare-position,"Democratic leaders want to know why the Department of Justice has changed course in its stance on the Affordable Care Act, and are ramping up their efforts to get answers from the Trump administration.

In a pair of letters sent Monday to Attorney General Bill Barr and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md.; Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J.; Richard Neal, D-Mass.; Robert Scott, D-Va.; and Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. demanded details regarding what influence, if any, the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had in the DOJ's position.

BIDEN BACKS HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, SAYS 'WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION' TO PROVIDE IT

""This action could deprive millions of Americans of health insurance coverage, including 133 million people with pre-existing conditions,"" said the letters, obtained by Fox News. The representatives called the DOJ's position a ""sudden and extremely troubling reversal,"" and said the administration has not complied with their requests for documents or testimony from officials.

This comes after a federal judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare, is unconstitutional now that there is no penalty attached to the individual mandate that required people to get insurance coverage. The Supreme Court ruled that ObamaCare was legal because the penalty amounted to a tax, which falls under congressional authority.

That penalty was eliminated after President Trump took office, and 20 states led by Texas argued in a lawsuit that ObamaCare became invalid because there was no longer any Congressional authority behind the mandate. Rather than defend the law that the government passed during the previous administration, the DOJ agreed with the lawsuit's argument and declined to defend ObamaCare.

The Democrats expressed concern that the DOJ took this new position because ""politically-motivated forces inside the White House and the Office of Management and Budget may have brought undue pressure on the Department to reverse its prior legal conclusions, and that this occurred over the objection of Attorney General Barr.""

JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO: IS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT UNCONSTITUTIONAL?

The representatives renewed their request for records and testimony, and asked Cipollone to make OMB Acting Director Russ Vought available for an interview. They threatended additional action if the administration does not comply with a May 27 deadline.

""If we do not receive a response by this date, we will have no choice but to consider alternative means of obtaining compliance,"" the letters said. While the letters did not specify what type of ""alternative means"" they might use, subpoenas could be possible. Fox News reached out to Cummings' office.

House Democrats have recently used subpoenas in their quests to obtain Trump's financial records and an unredacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report."
Barr assigns US attorney in Connecticut to look into government surveillance involving Trump campaign: source,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-us-attorney-connecticut-surveillance-trump-campaign,"Attorney General William Barr has appointed a U.S. attorney to examine the origins of the Russia investigation and determine if intelligence collection efforts targeting the Trump campaign were ""lawful and appropriate,"" a person familiar with the situation told Fox News on Monday evening.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, will conduct the inquiry, the source said. The move comes as the Trump administration has pushed for answers on why federal authorities conducted the surveillance -- as well as whether Democrats were the ones who improperly colluded with foreign actors.

Two sources told Fox News earlier today that Barr was “serious” and had assigned DOJ personnel to the probe. Durham is known as a ""hard-charging, bulldog"" prosecutor, Fox News is told.



Sources familiar with matter say the focus of the probe includes the pre-transition period -- prior to Nov. 7, 2016 -- including the use and initiation of informants, as well as potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses.

An informant working for U.S. intelligence posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 to try extracting any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia from George Papadopoulos, then a Trump foreign policy adviser, it emerged earlier this month. Papadopoulos told Fox News the informant tried to ""seduce"" him as part of the ""bizarre"" episode.

Durham previously has investigated law enforcement corruption, the destruction of CIA videotapes and the Boston FBI office's relationship with mobsters. He is set to continue to serve as the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut.

ROSENSTEIN BLASTS 'ANGRY' COMEY, SAYS HE'S BECOME A DISAPPOINTING PARTISAN HACK

In January, House Republican Reps. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows wrote to Durham seeking a briefing, saying they had ""discovered"" that Durham's office was ""investigating [former FBI General Counsel James Baker"" for unauthorized disclosures to the media.""

Durham's new review would exist alongside the ongoing probe by DOJ Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, who is continuing to review potential surveillance abuses by the FBI -- an investigation that began last March and that Fox News is told is nearing completion.

Republicans also have been looking for answers from U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber, who was appointed a year ago by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review not only surveillance abuses by the FBI and DOJ, but also authorities' handling of the probe into the Clinton Foundation.

Huber, Republicans have cautioned, apparently has made little progress and has spoken to few key witnesses and whistleblowers. But, in January, then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker reportedly indicated at a private meeting that Huber's work was continuing apace.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXTS SHOW DOJ PUSHED BACK ON 'BIAS' IN KEY FBI FISA SOURCE

Durham's appointment comes about a month after Barr told members of Congress he believed ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign in 2016. He later said he didn't mean anything pejorative and was gathering a team to look into the origins of the special counsel's investigation.

Democrats have pummeled Barr in frustration following revelations in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russian actors, despite numerous offers by Russians to assist the campaign. Mueller's final report has led to a bitter D.C. battle over the limited number of redactions in the report, which the DOJ says are legally necessary because they pertain to grand jury matters.

In obtaining a secret FISA warrant to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, the FBI copy-pasted directly from a disputed Washington Post opinion article to suggest the Trump campaign may have been compromised. The bureau also repeatedly assured the court that it ""did not believe"" British ex-spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion.

But, London court records showed that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS -- the opposition research firm behind the dossier. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), a piece of information not stated in the FISA application.

The FISA application cribbed word-for-word from the Washington Post article that claimed the Trump campaign had ""worked behind the scenes"" to ""gut"" the GOP platform on Russia and Ukraine. The FBI apparently did not conduct its own independent assessment of the piece, which was labeled an ""opinion"" column by the Post, and Mueller's probe ultimately found no wrongdoing by the Trump team.

Additionally, internal FBI text messages exclusively obtained by Fox News earlier this year showed that a senior DOJ official raised concerns about the bias in a key FISA warrant, but that FBI officials pressed on.

""There's a document that's classified that I'm gonna try to get unclassified that takes the dossier -- all the pages of it -- and it has verification to one side,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this weekend. ""There really is no verification, other than media reports that were generated by reporters that received the dossier.""

Graham specifically cited the report from The Hill's John Solomon that the FBI was expressly told that Steele, the bureau's confidenial informant, had admitted to a contact at the State Department that he was ""keen"" to leak his discredited dossier for purposes of influencing the 2016 election.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec’s written account of her Oct. 11, 2016, meeting with Steele was apparently sent to the FBI, according to records unearthed in a transparency lawsuit by Citizens United.

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff forced out,https://www.politico.com,['Ian Kullgren'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/labor-chief-of-staff-forced-out-1321669,"Nick Geale, chief of staff for Labor Secretary Alex Acosta (shown), allegedly alienated not only Labor officials but also ""people at the White House."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images employment Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff forced out

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff will be forced out by the end of this month.

A DOL spokesperson confirmed Nick Geale‘s departure but did not provide further details.

Story Continued Below

White House officials instructed Acosta to fire Geale after its review concluded that Geale's interactions with employees were harming DOL morale, according to a former Trump administration official with direct knowledge of the investigation. Geale‘s management style was viewed by many in DOL as abusive, this person said.

“There was an extensive investigation,” the former Trump official said.

A second person with knowledge of the situation said Geale alienated not only DOL officials but also ""people at the White House."" Some White House officials expressed frustration to POLITICO with the slow pace of deregulation at DOL, and blamed that at least in part on Geale.

Acosta’s own proclivity for caution continues to bother Republican allies who expected a more forceful advocate for business.

For instance, DOL has struggled for months to finalize a rule that would privatize some of the agency's apprenticeship training, as it was instructed to do by a 2017 order from President Donald Trump. Enthusiasm for the initiative is tepid inside DOL. “Very few people, if any, in the building think that this will work,” a DOL official said.

News of the dismissal was first reported by Axios.

Geale‘s forced departure is more bad news for Acosta, who has spent the last few months fending off criticism of a 2008 plea deal he reached with billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein when Acosta was a U.S. attorney in Florida. A federal judge in February ruled that the Justice Department’s failure to notify Epstein's victims of the plea deal before it was finalized violated the 2004 Crime Victims' Rights Act.

""In many positions at the Department of Labor, on Capitol Hill, and as a member of the National Mediation Board, Nicholas Geale is a national expert on labor issues,” Acosta said in a statement. “After years of hard work here at the Department, I wish him the best on his future endeavors.”

Former DHS officials ousted over push back on Trump administration's plan to arrest thousands of migrants,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-dhs-officials-ousted-over-push-back-on-trump-administrations-plan-to-arrest-thousands-of-migrants,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a top immigration official challenged a previously secret White House plan to arrest thousands of migrant parents and children in nearly a dozen U.S. cities, Fox News confirmed Monday.

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

State Department: US trying to remove protesters from Venezuelan Embassy in DC,https://www.cnn.com,"['Adrienne Winston', 'Eli Watkins']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/13/politics/venezuelan-embassy-washington-dc/index.html,"(CNN) US law enforcement on Monday started the process of trying to remove protesters from the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, a State Department official said.

The move to evict the protesters from the embassy came after a group of US anti-war activists began moving into the embassy last month

Medea Benjamin, one of the founders of the anti-war group Code Pink, previously told CNN that diplomats from the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had given them access to the embassy before the diplomats left as the standoff unfolded between Maduro and Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido.

Venezuela's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs for North America Carlos Ron denounced the removal of protestors on Monday

""The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not authorized the entry of police officers into the former Embassy building in Washington, DC. This intrusion is yet another violation of international law by US authorities and an aggression against Venezuela,"" Ron, a Maduro official, said on Twitter

"Trump administration breaks campaign promise, purges 200,000 VA healthcare applications",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/trump-administration-breaks-campaign-promise-purges-200-000-va-healthcare-applications,"""The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,” presidential candidate Donald Trump said when speaking at a rally on Oct. 31, 2015, in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Va.

""Over 300,000 — and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now — over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care,"" said Trump.

Trump’s strong condemnation of the Obama administration’s handling of the backlog of hundreds of thousands of veteran benefits claims made him the overwhelming choice for many veteran voters in 2016.

But after two years in the White House, the Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.

In purging this massive backlog of applications, the VA is declaring the applications to be incomplete due to errors by the applicants, despite the OIG findings and in violation of the promise Trump made to fix the system. This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits.

Under the supervision of Dr. Richard Stone, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, VHA managers last November instructed the agency’s IT staff members to purge over 200,000 pending healthcare applications.

Such a profound decision to deny veterans benefits should have to come from someone higher up — the president or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs — not from a career bureaucrat who has not been elected or confirmed by the Senate.

This purge flies in the face of previous guidance provided by lawmakers. On March 3, 2017, Senate and House Veterans Affairs committee members sent a joint letter to the VA, instructing the agency to delay its plans to purge these records. The committees wanted the VA to send new letters to veterans, informing them of their application status and potential equitable relief or financial reimbursement for service-connected health expenses caused by enrollment system errors, as prescribed by law.

Currently, VA is skirting this provision of the law by blaming veteran applicants for the agency’s own mistakes processing health and disability claims. As a result, to win benefits wrongfully denied due to VA’s administrative errors, veterans are forced to go to court and pay legal fees out of whatever benefits they ultimately win.

The Trump administration’s decision opens the door to the agency purging any future backlog of veteran claims for benefits by falsely declaring the applications incomplete due to veteran error.

This is the second time the VA has been caught using its IT department to adjudicate benefits for veterans. In January 2017, the IT department auto-enrolled over 70,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans whose applications had erroneously been held up until they could meet a “means test” — that is, prove their income level. This mass-approval of applications was done in preparation for then-Under Secretary David Shulkin’s confirmation hearing.

They did this without bothering to fix the systemic error that required proof of income from combat veterans, who aren’t required to provide it. As a result, there are still more than 20,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans being denied healthcare benefits due to an erroneous means-test requirement.

Moreover, the means test error in the enrollment system not only affects veteran access to healthcare benefits, but it also causes billing errors for thousands of veterans each year.

The Veterans Health Administration’s Member Services office, which manages the enrollment system, had to reexamine over 6,000 veteran income verification cases, because veterans were overbilled for medical copays ranging from $200 to $3,000. About 1,000 veterans are believed to receive fraudulent bills from the VA every month due to this known system error.

Despite being aware of these systemic issues for years, VA has not initiated an outreach campaign to educate the veteran community about what to do if their application is in a pending status or if they get a fraudulent bill due to missing means-test information.

Instead, the agency has chosen a policy of sending a single notification letter for pending applications, despite knowing that 25% of the letters mailed to veterans are returned or placed on hold due to bad address information in the enrollment system.

Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans routinely have incorrect address information in the enrollment system because they do not have permanent non-military addresses at the time of enrollment during the demobilization process.

The VA could resolve this problem through its data-sharing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration, to get current addresses for veterans in the pending backlog. But unfortunately for veterans, it is the VA’s practice to use information from the IRS and SSA only for the purposes of billing and verifying veterans’ dates of death.

All of these issues could be easily fixed. This is why President Trump’s reversal on this issue is so disappointing to the veteran community. Many veterans are asking why the enrollment system was not included in the President’s VA information technology modernization plan.

As a result, 200,000 applications have been purged, violating Trump’s promise. Currently, over 300,000 additional veteran healthcare applications remain in a pending status and will most likely be purged in the near future.

In the absence of executive leadership from the White House, veterans will continue to be denied access to their healthcare benefits at a rate of nearly 5,000 new pending healthcare applications per month.

"Your daily 6: Puppy forced to drink beer, trash on ocean's bottom and mass arrests of families considered",https://www.stltoday.com,"['Amanda St. Amand', 'Joel Martinez', 'Discovery Five Deeps Expedition', 'Rick Bowmer', 'Steven Senne']",,,,https://www.stltoday.com/news/national/your-daily-puppy-forced-to-drink-beer-trash-on-ocean/collection_e96b4151-5fc4-5df0-854a-e3d2a16186e9.html,"Mass family arrests of immigrants considered by Trump officials Homeland Security officials considered arresting thousands of migrant families who had final deportation orders and removing them from the U.S. in a flashy show of force, but the idea was tabled as the Trump administration grappled with straining resources and a growing number of Central Americans crossing the border. Two Homeland Security officials and two other people familiar with the proposal described it to The Associated Press. They were not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity. The idea was to arrest parents and children in 10 cities with large populations of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, specifically New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, they said, without naming others. The proposal, first reported by The Washington Post, was meant to send a message and possibly deter others from coming across the border, they said. But then-Immigrations and Customs Enforcement head Ron Vitiello and then-Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen put the proposal aside over concerns about diverting resources from the border, a lack of detention space and the possibility of renewed public outrage over treatment of families. The Trump administration separated children from parents at the southern border last summer, a move that prompted mass outrage and criticism that the U.S. was abandoning its humanitarian role and harming children. Immigration experts say the separations, which were halted last June, did little to stop migrant crossings and, in fact, may have prompted more people to come. The number of border crossings has risen dramatically in the past few months to more than 100,000 per month. More than half are families who cannot be easily sent back to their home countries. Border officials say they are out of resources and manpower and can’t keep up. President Donald Trump has railed against the growing numbers and is furious that he has been unable to stem the flow of migrants despite his campaign promise to clamp down on immigration. The White House recently asked Congress for $4.5 billion in supplemental funding, mostly for humanitarian aid and shelter space for migrant children. ICE planes have been used over the past few days to fly migrants to less-crowded locations along the border for processing. The tabled plan — it remains under consideration — included fast-tracking immigration cases to allow judges to order deportations for those who didn’t show up for hearings. It also prioritized the newest cases in order to deport people faster.

Deepest ocean dive ever finds plastic bag at bottom An American undersea explorer has completed what is claimed to be the deepest manned sea dive ever recorded -- returning to the surface with the depressing news that there's plastic trash down there. Victor Vescovo journeyed 35,853 feet to the bottom of the Challenger Deep , the southern end of the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench, as part of a mission to chart the world's deepest underwater places. Making multiple trips nearly 11 kilometers, or seven miles, to the ocean floor -- one of them four hours in duration -- Vescovo set a record for the deepest solo dive in history, his team said. The previous record was held by ""Titanic"" director James Cameron in 2012. As well as four new species that could offer clues about the origins of life on Earth, Vescovo observed a plastic bag and candy wrappers at the deepest point on the planet. Details of the voyage, made May 1, were released for the first time on Monday. Vescovo, a 53-year-old financier with a naval background, tells CNN Travel his journey to the depths was about testing the limits of human endeavor as much as scientific discovery. ""Going to the extremes I believe is a natural inclination of man,"" Vescovo he says. His voyage, in a submersible named The Limiting Factor, is part of a landmark odyssey into the world's watery depths that's being filmed for Discovery Channel -- dubbed the Five Deeps Expedition. The expedition's mission is to conduct detailed, sonar mapping missions at the five deepest spots in our oceans. As well as the Mariana Trench, it's now completed surveys of the Atlantic Ocean's Puerto Rico Trench, the South Atlantic's South Sandwich Trench and the Java Trench in the Indian Ocean.

Fraternity investigated over video of puppy drinking beer A fraternity at Hofstra University is under suspension over a video that shows a puppy being forced to drink beer. The 5-second video clip shows a small dog standing on a table as a voice commands, ""Go."" A man turns holds the dog upside down over a silver keg as another man holds a tap near the dog's mouth and the dog kicks its paws and squirms. A stream of liquid squirts from the tap, hitting the dog in its face. A bystander doubles over and someone else laughs. But the university on Monday confirmed that is suspended its chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi as it investigates the clip that purportedly involves some of the fraternity members. It also was seen by the Nassau County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which said it would do its own investigation. The clip was shared to social media and had been seen more than 100,000 times on Twitter. “It was very wrong on so many levels‚” Gary Rogers, a spokesman for the Nassau County SPCA, told The Washington Post. “I’m sure it wasn’t the dog’s idea, ‘Hey, I want some beer.’ Animals don’t make that choice.” The dog, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel believed to be between 5 and 10 months old, was living in a house associated with the fraternity, but is now in the SPCA’s care, Rogers said. The puppy belongs to a 21-year-old senior at Hofstra, who was one of the people in the video, he said. “Our paramount concern is the safety of the dog,"" Rogers said. ""The dog is no longer in that environment.” He added that when investigators visited the house on Monday, the canine “appeared to be in good condition” and had food, water and a bed. The video featuring the puppy was reportedly taken at an off-campus fraternity house in Hempstead, N.Y., on Saturday and shared to Snapchat, according to NBC News. In the background of the clip, people could be seen standing around in a yard. In a statement to The Post, Hofstra said the behavior in the video is “unacceptable” and “in violation of the University’s Code of Community Standards.” The university said it has been in contact with Alpha Epsilon Pi’s international headquarters as well as chapter members.

Mormon church joins opposition to LGBT nondiscrimination bill The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced its opposition Monday to a comprehensive nondiscrimination bill that faces long odds in Congress, saying the legislation doesn't ""meet the standard of fairness for all,"" contending it would strip key religious freedom protections. The faith said in a statement that the Equality Act would ""threaten religious employment standards, devastate religious education, defund numerous religious charities."" The church pointed out the importance of religions and religious schools having the right to create faith-based employment and admissions standards. The Southern Baptist Convention and the Roman Catholic Church are among others that oppose the measure. ""While providing extremely broad protections for LGBT rights, the Equality Act provides no protections for religious freedom,"" the statement said. The legislation would add gender identity and sexual orientation to existing federal nondiscrimination laws covering such things as employment, housing, education, and public spaces and services. The bill has widespread Democratic backing and seems certain to pass the House, but the chances appear slim in the Republican-controlled Senate. The Utah-based faith, widely known as the Mormon church, said it favors ""reasonable"" measures to protect LGBT people's access to housing, employment and public accommodations, but that such efforts shouldn't erode the right for people to live and speak freely about their religious beliefs. The religion has tried to stake out a more compassionate stance on LGBTQ people, while sticking firmly to its doctrinal opposition to gay marriage and same-sex intimacy. The church points to a 2015 Utah anti-discrimination law it backed. That measure made it illegal to base employment and housing decisions on sexual orientation or gender identity, while also creating exemptions for religious organizations and protecting religious speech in the workplace. The faith said the federal Equality Act doesn't strike the right balance. It expressed concern ""that the ongoing conflicts between religious liberty and LGBT rights is poisoning our civil discourse, eroding the free exercise of religion and preventing diverse Americans of good will from living together in respect and peace.""

Officer shoots and kills woman during arrest as she uses cop's Taser on him A Texas police officer shot and killed a woman Monday night while trying to arrest her, after police said she grabbed his Taser and used it on him. The unnamed officer in Baytown, Texas, apparently recognized the woman, 45, from previous encounters and knew she had ""outstanding warrants,"" said Lt. Steve Dorris of the Baytown Police Department. He said when the officer tried to arrest her, they began to struggle and the officer got his Taser.But as he tried to handcuff her, she used it on him and he drew his gun and fired multiple round at the woman. Dorris said she was pronounced dead at the scene. Police haven't released the woman's name or specified what warrants had been issued for her arrest. Houston television station KHOU-TV reported the incident was caught on social media and in the video, the woman can be heard shouting ""I'm pregnant"" multiple times before she is shot.."

A local company that once helped the West Virginia town of Minden thrive had for for decades dumped untold amounts of industrial chemicals nearby. Years after that coal-equipment manufacturer shuttered and the rest of the local coal economy fell into decline, those toxic chemicals remained.

Now the federal government is saying it will make cleaning up Minden a priority. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency finally added a site in the tiny town of 250 people to its national priority list for contaminated Superfund sites. The government says it prioritize cleaning up a former manufacturing site for Shaffer Equipment Co. and nearby areas around Arbuckle Creek, where the company used polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which had been added to oil used by electrical equipment until 1984.

For years, Minden residents said they were being overlooked by federal authorities, even as many of them were diagnosed with an alarming number of cancers and other health issues. Local activists told The Post's Brady Dennis for a profile he wrote of the community they found about a third of Minden residents have died of or been diagnosed with cancer in recent years.

They suspected the cause was PCBs. Yet testing by state and federal officials was not able to definitively establish that link. Still, residents pressed their case with the Trump administration, which proposed last September to add the Minden site to the Superfund list.

West Virginia politicians praised the move on Monday, which open remediation of the site up to an injection of new federal funding through the Superfund program. “This is such an important day because the great people of Minden have been hurting for too long and they’ve been waiting on this level of help for decades,” Gov. Jim Justice (R) said.

So too did local leaders, such as Ayne Amjad, a doctor who helped research the health problems and spent years trying to raise the profile of the town. “So to get so much national support and to see it come to this is such a great feeling,” she said Monday, adding that activists will turn now to relocation efforts for Minden residents living near the toxic site.

In a sign of how intractable some pollutants are, though, the EPA has already undertaken several rounds of cleanups in Minden since 1984, removing dozens of PCB-laced drums buried underground and hauling away nearly 5,000 tons of soil.

The listing is a small part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to revitalize the nearly 40-year-old Superfund program, designed to clean up more than 1,300 hazardous sites across the country. Compelling companies to pay up for cleanup efforts has proved to be one of the few issues on which the EPA has been willing to side with environmental groups during the Trump administration.

LIVE from Howard University in Washington DC the last #Road2GND tour stop.comment ""debate"" on this livestream to get involved via facebook messenger. Posted by Sunrise Movement on Monday, May 13, 2019

— A Green New Deal rally in Washington: Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) headlined a rally Monday at Howard University, continuing to call for a Green New Deal after a recent legislative defeat in the Senate. The event, organized by youth climate activist group Sunrise Movement, was the last stop on the group’s “Road to the Green New Deal tour,” which aimed to tout the proposal, even after it failed in a March vote in the Senate.

Next steps: The Sunrise Movement laid out its plans for the next several months, which include giving 2020 candidates until the end of July to sign a no-fossil-fuel-money pledge and to promise to make the Green New Deal a ""Day 1"" priority in the White House.

No ""middle ground"": Audience members booed several times at mentions of finding a ""middle ground"" on climate change, a reference to a recent Reuters article that describes former vice president Joe Biden's yet-to-be-released position on climate change.

Meanwhile in New Hampshire: Biden tried to hammer home to Democratic voters in the early-primary state that he is serious about climate change. “I said, we have an existential threat, we are in a situation where, if we don’t act quickly, we’re going to basically lose almost everything we have,"" he said, according to The New York Times.

President Trump wrote on Twitter last week that he opposed a House bill that would help a Massachusetts Indian tribe build a casino. (Evan Vucci/AP)

— Why did the president tweet about an obscure House bill? Last week, Trump tweeted to express opposition to House Resolution 312, which would grant a Massachusetts Indian tribe control of 321 acres of land for a casino. He wrote on Twitter it was “unfair and doesn’t treat Native Americans equally!” But the tribe’s site is about 18 miles from Rhode Island, where state politicians ""aren’t keen to have a new competitor go up against their two casinos, both of which are run by Twin River Worldwide Holdings, a public company with strong Trump ties,"" The Post’s Marc Fisher reports.

Flashback to 1993: The president has a long history of criticizing casinos built Native Americans as fraudulent. More than two decades ago, Trump the casino owner urged a House committee to assess whether tribe members operating the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut were really Native Americans. “They don’t look like Indians to me,” Trump said back then.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)

— The latest on the impasse over disaster funding: The Senate is looking to vote on a much-anticipated but not-yet-finalized disaster-aid package next week, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hoped to approve a deal ahead of the Memorial Day recess, Politico reports.

McConnell called on lawmakers in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle to “identify our common ground and produce an outcome for the American people” on the measure meant to provide aid for communities recovering from natural disasters. “Next week is the week before a big break,” said Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) “I can’t predict what will happen, but I think something is either going to hit the floor dealing with that, or maybe we’ll all come to an agreement.”

Meanwhile: McConnell is looking to use the sweeping disaster aid bill to add protections for hemp farmers, according to a draft provision reviewed by The Post. “Now, with a $17 billion disaster bill stalled on Capitol Hill amid a series of political skirmishes, McConnell is trying to add language to the legislation to ensure hemp will be eligible for federal crop insurance,” The Post’s Erica Werner reports. “It was not immediately clear what impact McConnell’s hemp language might have on larger negotiations over the bill, which have been hung up for months in a fight between congressional Democrats and President Trump over aid to Puerto Rico.”

— “Watergate this was not”: When he looked to get in touch with the state’s ornithologist regarding a story about birds, the Boston Globe’s David Abel writes he wasn’t granted access to Andrew Vitz, who works for the state’s Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Instead, he was sent a bulleted list of background responses, only one of which answered a question he had asked.

Abel described a back-and-forth between himself and a press secretary at the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who he said he doesn't blame for the stone-walling. “It’s the policy from her bosses that’s the problem. They have made it clear that they won’t allow me, or many of my colleagues, to speak directly with the experts in government who can often best answer our questions — even when it’s a story about birds,"" he writes of a problem that has become ""not unusual"" since Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) was elected.

— Here’s what you can do now to save species: Save water, buy fewer products encased in plastic, revamp your front lawn.

These are a few things experts say Americans can do each day as a first step to helping save the plant and animal species facing extinction, according to The Post’s Darryl Fears. For example, grass yards, which use up 9 billion gallons of water per day, are the largest irrigated crop in the country. Collin O’Mara, president and chief executive of the National Wildlife Foundation, called lawns “basically biodiversity wastelands” and recommends making space for “milkweed and flowers can support numerous species of butterflies and moths. A single ginkgo tree will support numerous species of caterpillars,” Fears writes.

— “We don’t know a planet like this”: There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at any point since the evolution of humans, according to data from the Muana Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The concentration of CO2 levels in the atmosphere has surpassed 415 parts per million, according to a Friday reading. “CO2 levels millions of years ago were higher than 2019 levels, but Earth's temperatures were also much higher,” USA Today reports. “In the 800,000 years before the Industrial Revolution, CO2 levels didn't surpass 300 ppm.”

The reaction from meteorologist Eric Holthaus:

This is the first time in human history our planet's atmosphere has had more than 415ppm CO2.

— Bill Nye pulls no punches: On a segment Sunday of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver”, the bow-tied science advocate was enlisted by Oliver to talk through the Green New Deal, explain how carbon pricing could be used to combat global warming, and to deliver a no-nonsense warning about the severity of climate change: “By the end of this century, if emissions keep rising, the average temperature on Earth could go up another four to eight degrees…What I’m saying is: The planet’s on fire,” Nye said, inserting some profanity to punctuate his point, as The Post’s Reis Thebault writes."
Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: DOJ inspector general FISA probe will find 'mistakes',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-doj-inspector-general-will-find-mistakes-in-fisa-probe,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Monday he expects the Justice Department inspector general to find ""mistakes"" committed by the bureau in its handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Baker, who admitted last week the inspector general makes him ""nervous,"" said the government watchdog will probably find some errors.

""The inspector general is looking at everything we did,"" Baker said on CNN. ""If the IG usually finds mistakes that we made, so I expect him to find mistakes this time.""

Baker said last week at an event in Washington, D.C., that he took a leading role in overseeing the FISA warrant applications to obtain the authority to spy on Page. Baker said on Monday he does not believe there was any intent from the people he worked with to do ""anything wrong or illegal,"" including politically motivated spying.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

Attorney General William Barr has said he expects Horowitz to complete his investigation in late May or June. A particular issue in the investigation is the FBI's reliance on an unverified dossier in the FISA warrant application process."
Pompeo shares details on 'escalating' Iran threats in Brussels: U.S. State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-pompeo/pompeo-shared-details-on-iran-threats-with-nato-state-department-idUSKCN1SJ1XN,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shared information on “escalating” threats from Iran with European allies and NATO officials during meetings in Brussels on Monday, the U.S. special representative for Iran said.

“Iran is an escalating threat and this seemed like a timely visit on his way to Sochi,” Brian Hook told reporters, referring to Pompeo’s planned visit to Russia on Tuesday for meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Pompeo canceled a visit to Moscow on Monday and stopped in Brussels instead, en route to Sochi.

“The secretary wanted to share some details behind what we have been saying publicly,” Hook said. “We believe that Iran should try talks instead of threats. They have chosen poorly by focusing on threats.”

Hook said Pompeo, while in Brussels, also discussed reported attacks on several oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

Asked if Pompeo was blaming Iran for the attacks, Hook said: “We discussed ... what seemed to be attacks on commercial vessels that were anchored off Fujairah ... we have been requested by the UAE to provide assistance in the investigation, which we are very glad to do.”

Asked if he himself believed there was the possibility of an Iranian role, Hook had no comment.

The UAE said on Sunday that four commercial vessels were sabotaged near Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs lying just outside the Strait of Hormuz. It did not describe the nature of the attack or say who was behind it.

Saudi Arabia said Monday that two of its oil tankers were among those attacked and described it as an attempt to undermine the security of crude supplies amid tensions between the United States and Iran.

The UAE on Monday identified the vessels as very large crude carrier (VLCC) tanker Amjad and crude tanker Al Marzoqah, both owned by Saudi shipping firm Bahri. The other two were UAE-flagged fuel bunker barge A. Michel and Norwegian-registered oil products tanker MT Andrew Victory."
VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.

Marco Rubio Urges DOJ to Investigate John Kerry's Meetings With Iranian Officials,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Jack Crowe', 'David French', 'John Fund', 'Jim Geraghty', 'Michael W.

(David Mdzinarishvili/Reuters)

Senator Marco Rubio sent a letter Monday to Attorney General William Barr asking him to investigate whether former secretary of state John Kerry violated federal law by continuing to meet with Iranian officials after leaving office.

“The Department of Justice should therefore make a determination on whether or not former Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s recent actions related to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran potentially violate the Logan Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” Rubio wrote.

The letter, Rubio’s second urging an investigation into Kerry’s conduct, comes after President Trump suggested that Kerry should be prosecuted under the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without the permission of U.S. officials.

“What I’d like to see with Iran, I’d like to see them call me,” Trump told reporters last week. “John Kerry speaks to them a lot, and John Kerry tells them not to call. That’s a violation of the Logan Act, and frankly he should be prosecuted on that.”

Kerry’s camp pushed back on Trump’s assertion in a statement provided to CNN.

“Everything President Trump said today is simply wrong, end of story,” a spokesperson for Kerry told CNN. “He’s wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he’s been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe.”

Rubio sent his first letter on the subject to then-attorney general Jeff Sessions in September 2018, after the Boston Globe reported that Kerry was “quietly seeking to salvage the Iran deal he helped craft” by engaging “in some unusual shadow diplomacy” with Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. Though he would not comment on what was discussed, Kerry did admit to meeting with Zarif “three or four” times since Trump took office. The Globe further reported that Kerry formed a team “of officials who were his top advisers at the State Department” to shape media coverage of Trump’s departure from the Iran deal."

(Susan Walsh/AP)

A top U.S. arms control official and prominent Iran hawk has resigned from the State Department after serving just over a year in the position, said U.S. officials and congressional aides familiar with the decision.

The State Department on Monday did not offer a statement explaining the planned departure of Yleem Poblete, the assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance.

Her departure, which is expected to take effect in the coming weeks, creates a vacancy as the Trump administration faces major new threats and challenges specifically related to arms control.

Iran recently threatened to resume production of nuclear centrifuges in response to President Trump’s decision last year to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose economic sanctions. Trump has also ordered his top aides to make a new push for a historic trilateral arms control agreement involving Russia and China, something Beijing has long dismissed.

During her tenure, Poblete clashed with her boss, Undersecretary of State Andrea Thompson, Vice President Pence’s former national security adviser, said the officials and aides familiar with the infighting.

In particular, disagreements surfaced over the State Department’s report on international compliance with arms control accords, the people said.

“The tension over the compliance report has been very real, and [Thompson’s office] is now demanding sign-off much earlier in the clearance process,” said one State Department official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel moves.

In April, Reuters reported that some U.S. officials were concerned that the compliance report politicized and slanted assessments about Iran, which the Trump administration has singled out as the country’s principal foe.

Poblete, whose views on arms control were more aligned with national security adviser John Bolton rather than Thompson’s, previously served as the chief of staff of the House Foreign Affairs Committee among other jobs.

As her confirmation process for the senior arms control job dragged on, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders excoriated Democrats and emphasized the importance of the position.

“It has been almost 150 days since Dr. Poblete was nominated,” Sanders said. “Senator Schumer is holding her up, putting the safety and security of the American people and, frankly, the entire world in danger.”

Poblete was a favorite among hard-line anti-Iran groups such as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which hosted her for a speech in July 2018 in which Poblete praised the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran deal.

“The JCPOA was flawed at both the technical and political levels, and at the practical level,” she said in the speech, referring to the acronym for the 2015 deal.

Nonproliferation experts who supported the Iran deal viewed her departure with ambivalence.

“While the State Department can hardly afford to lose another senior leader, it is not clear that Assistant Secretary Poblete was contributing to the advancement of arms control in a helpful or substantive way,” said Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and nonproliferation and a former Obama administration official. “The recent debacle involving the sloppy and politically charged summary of the unclassified 2019 Compliance Report is an example of that.”

“The Trump administration should immediately move to appoint a qualified, seasoned expert to the position,” she added.

Liberal watchdog group sues Commerce Department over Census citizenship question,https://www.politico.com,"['Caitlin Oprysko', 'Ted Hesson', 'Anita Kumar']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/13/census-citizenship-question-lawsuit-1318698,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testifies on the census during a House Oversight Committee hearing on March 14. | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo Legal Liberal watchdog group sues Commerce Department over Census citizenship question

A liberal watchdog group said Monday it plans to sue the Commerce Department to obtain records relating to Secretary Wilbur Ross’ “lies” about his decision to add a citizenship question to next year’s Census questionnaire.

Restore Public Trust said in a complaint filed Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it has filed several requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act that call into question Ross' justification for adding the citizenship question to the Census, and the group is demanding the release of those documents.

Story Continued Below

The question, which the Trump administration plans to include for the first time since 1950, is at the center of a legal battle that last month reached the Supreme Court. Civil rights groups and several local and state governments have sued the administration to have the question struck from next year’s survey, which is used to apportion congressional seats, Electoral College votes and billions in federal funding.

Restore Public Trust is suing for the release of a tranche of documents that the group says will show Ross was misleading in congressional testimony over how the question came to be added to the Census. Ross has said he added the question “solely” at the request of the Justice Department, which said in a memo that the question would help it better enforce parts of the Voting Rights Act.

But emails turned over as part of the lawsuits have showed that Ross was in contact with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach about the question, and he had asked the Justice Department to request the question. The Commerce Department has defended Ross' testimony, arguing that the new communications only supplement the record.

The Commerce Department declined to comment Monday, citing pending litigation.

Researchers at the Census Bureau have said adding the question could result in depressed response rates among the Hispanic residents, a demographic that already sees lower rates of response to the decennial survey. Critics of the question have argued that the question is aimed at diluting the political power of Democratic-leaning areas home to Hispanic communities. Separately, Commerce has been accused of violating administrative procedure and adding the question without proper vetting of its potential effect on Census responses.

The lawsuit filed Monday cites three FOIA requests submitted by the group last December and on April 12 seeking communications regarding the Census, including emails sent or received by Ross and some of his top current and former aides, as well as Kobach and Census Bureau and DOJ officials, relating to the Census.

According to the group, they have received no communication from the Commerce Department concerning their requests, even though FOIA requires agencies to respond within 20 days or provide notice that their response will be delayed. The document requests are likely to overlap with those the House Oversight Committee voted last month to subpoena from the Commerce Department.

“The American people have a right to know what Secretary Ross and the rest of Trump’s political appointees discussed behind closed doors as they devised a scheme to make the census less representative for all Americans,” said Kyle Herrig, senior adviser to Restore Public Trust. “Even more disturbing than Secretary Ross’s attempts to avoid public scrutiny is his apparent lies to Congress and evasion of Congressional oversight.”

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case last month and appears poised to side with Ross, overturning the ruling of lower courts and letting the citizenship question stand. DOJ has said in court filings that the Census Bureau must finalize printed questionnaires by the end of next month to meet production deadlines.

Amid the legal drama over the citizenship question last month, Ross also caught flak for rejecting two invitations from House and Senate appropriators to testify before their committees about his agency's budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, saying his appearance would be a distraction and offering to send other officials from the department.

EPA orders river excavation near polluted Wolverine tannery,https://www.mlive.com,"['Garret Ellison', 'Gellison Mlive.Com']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/05/epa-orders-river-excavation-near-polluted-wolverine-tannery.html,"ROCKFORD, MI — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has ordered Wolverine World Wide to dig contaminated sediment from the Rogue River and excavate soils along the White Pine Trail in Rockford, where the shoemaker formerly operated a century-old leather tannery.

The EPA listed the actions among several public health-driven cleanup steps federal regulators want Wolverine to take this summer in a letter on April 29. The order follows test results that show high levels of pollutants like chromium, mercury, and PFAS befoul the site.

“There may be exposure risks that can’t necessarily wait for an overall plan to address the entire site,” said Jeff Kimble, a Region 5 EPA on-scene coordinator who is supervising Wolverine’s former tannery and dump site investigations in Kent County.

By the end of May, the EPA says Wolverine must begin placing signs and kiosks near river access points which note potential hazards nearby and the proper hygiene for dealing with them.

The EPA wants the site work to happen this summer. Wolverine said it is “reviewing” the letter and “looks forward to continuing its work with the agency to develop next steps.""

The EPA began supervising an investigation into contamination at the tannery and Wolverine’s House Street sludge dump in Belmont last year. The tannery, which was razed in 2009, drew federal scrutiny after the discovery of per-fluorinated compounds called PFAS at the former factory grounds and Wolverine’s nearby waste dumps.

In Belmont, the EPA wants interior fencing around the “entire contaminated portion” of the House Street dump and further testing of wetlands to the west. The 76-acre site where Wolverine dumped 3M Scotchgard waste in the 1960s has spawned a PFAS plume moving southeast through an area where thousands of people rely on groundwater for drinking.

An investigation report for House Street similar to that which sparked cleanup work in Rockford is pending final EPA final approval, Kimble said.

DEQ ignored crucial warning on Wolverine dump plume FOIA emails illuminate early House Street PFAS investigation.

In Rockford, toxic substances like mercury, chromium and lead are confirmed at high levels in the groundwater and in sediment near spots where people regularly launch canoes and kayaks alongside a heavily-used White Pine Trail stretch.

Kimble ordered Wolverine to either dredge or de-water and excavate those areas. He said the company proposed placing gravel and matting over contamination, but “based on the data we have, I think it’s more prudent to remove some of those sediments and then place that mat-and-gravel material.”

Kimble said cleanup work may close parts of the trail this summer. Users will also find more information about potential health risks at canoe launches and river access points.

Existing handwashing stations and signs placed last year are inadequate, Kimble said. The signs face away from the trail and tell people to “wash hands” when exiting the river with no explanation.

A sign tells people to ""wash hands"" upon exiting the river at the White Pine Trail in Rockford on May 6, 2019 near the former Wolverine World Wide tannery site.

“It should be more than just ‘wash your hands,'"" Kimble said. “Kindergarteners are told to wash their hands. They probably need to know why.”

”The signs need to be informative and cautionary, but also not unduly alarm people.""

Thad Beard, Rockford city manager, said that, while enhanced signage isn’t necessarily a great image for the city, it’s an important part of public communication.

“The reality is that we’re dealing with an environmental cleanup here and it’s important that is known to the public,” Beard said.

As in years past, Beard said the city will use part of the tannery site for its Start of Summer festival, June 13-16. Beard said Rockford checked with EPA to ensure the site of a city parking lot under construction on the property’s south end “wasn’t an area of high concentration of anything.”

The EPA-ordered work is happening parallel to Wolverine’s plan to stem the flow of groundwater contaminated with PFAS into the river, where the so-called “forever chemicals” are causing surface water foam to gather at the Rockford dam.

Beard said concern about the river foam has spiked recently following the state health department warning to avoid touching it.

Wolverine installed pump-and-treat wells at the site this winter as part of a plan to filter groundwater through a granular activated carbon (GAC) system to remove PFAS before sending treated effluent to the North Kent Sewer Authority wastewater plant. The sewer board should decide whether it will accept Wolverine’s cleanup water this summer.

Toxic pollution at Wolverine tannery is extensive, new report shows The study is the first comprehensive account of pollution at the former Wolverine World Wide tannery.

"Trump welcomes Viktor Orban, Hungary's far-right nationalist prime minister, after past presidents shunned him",https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Liptak'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/13/politics/trump-hungary-viktor-orban/index.html,"Washington (CNN) He's rolled back democratic checks on his power, mused about creating a European ethnostate and erected a razor-wire fence to keep migrants out , angering the rest of the European Union.

So why was Hungary's far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Monday?

""I know he's a tough man but he's a respected man,"" Trump said during a friendly photo-op at the start of the talks on Monday. ""Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that's OK. That's OK.""

Administration officials say the invitation to the White House for talks — the first for a Hungarian prime minister in years — is part of a concerted strategy to re-engage Central European nations as Russia and China seek to exert influence in the region.

But the visit is raising questions about which leaders Trump is looking to cultivate — including a long list of global strongmen — at the expense of more traditional US allies.

Orbán was largely iced out during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both concerned about the steps he took to consolidate power and block independent media. He last visited the White House for one-on-one meetings in 2001, during his first stint as prime minister, but was refused an Oval Office meeting with Bush.

Since then, he's adopted a more stridently nationalist tone — including calls to create in Hungary a homogenous society that blocks asylum seekers or other refugees.

""We must state that we do not want to be diverse,"" he said in a 2018 speech. ""We do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others.""

Trump has closely monitored Orbán during his time in office — and particularly his anti-migration stance, which mirrors Trump's own. Other European leaders shunned Orbán's decision to block migrants from entering his country with a fence, but Trump has advocated his own border wall. Steve Bannon, once Trump's senior adviser, once deemed Orbán ""Trump before Trump.""

""We are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal immigration, on terrorism and to protect and help the Christian communities around the world,"" Orban said in short remarks from the Oval Office.

Orbán isn't exactly being welcomed back to Washington with open arms. He was the first foreign leader to endorse Trump in his presidential bid, and has lobbied intensely for a meeting, but it took more than two years to secure a White House invite — the last of the major Central European nations to come for talks.

The delay reflected American officials' desire to discourage Hungary from further eroding democratic values. It's an issue they've raised at lower-level meetings, including when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Budapest in February.

A bipartisan group of senators wrote Trump on Friday to ""express concern about Hungary's downward democratic trajectory and the implications for US interests in Central Europe,"" imploring him to raise the issues during his meeting.

Yet when they sit for talks in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon, officials said the President was expected to focus on arms sales and energy independence — and not the concerning practices that have earned Orbán his strongman reputation.

""I can assure you that all of these issues have been well covered with all of our Hungarian counterparts,"" said one senior administration official. ""The point of this meeting is simply to reinforce the strategic relationship between NATO allies, the US and Hungary, not necessarily to thrash out every issue on the bilateral agenda, which we have been doing constantly for the last two years.""

Several advisers have cautioned Trump about appearing overly chummy with his counterpart, believing a warm embrace could hamper the administration's efforts to keep Orbán at arms-length.

Already, however, Trump's ambassador to Hungary has created waves by suggesting the limits Orbán has placed on challenges to his power are something Trump himself would embrace.

""I can tell you, knowing the President for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orbán has, but he doesn't,"" David Cornstein told The Atlantic last week

The comment caught the attention of officials at the White House, who later claimed it was taken out of context. But it nevertheless illustrated the potential pitfalls of inviting a problematic pro-Trump leader the US is wary of elevating.

Trump announced during his meeting with Orbán that he would use next month's Group of 20 summit in Japan for meetings with both Putin and Xi.

The migration issue, along with Orbán's moves to consolidate control of the country's judiciary and threaten the independence of the media, has caused deep rifts with the European Union. Orbán's party was suspended in March from the EU's largest political coalition.

Trump has generated his own tiffs with the EU, namely over trade. He faces a mid-May deadline on imposing new tariffs on European autos.

This story has been updated with additional developments on Monday.

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify that Orbán was refused an Oval Office meeting with President George W. Bush."
Six Chinese entities banned from exporting sensitive U.S. goods,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-exports/six-chinese-firms-banned-from-exporting-sensitive-us-goods-idUSKCN1SJ1HP,"FILE PHOTO: Containers and cargo vessels are seen at sunset at a port in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China March 12, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it banned six Chinese technology entities, one Pakistani firm and five based in the United Arab Emirates from exporting sensitive U.S. technologies and other goods.

In a statement, the Commerce Department said four of the Chinese firms, also with offices in Hong Kong, attempted to procure U.S.-origin commodities that would have supported Iran’s weapons of mass destruction and military programs in violation of U.S. export controls.

The Commerce Department said two other Chinese firms were added to the banned “Entities List” because they participated in the export of controlled technology, which was then supplied to organizations affiliated with the People’s Liberation Army.

The export bans come as the United States and China have escalated their trade war following difficult negotiations last week. The United States has increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent, while China has raised tariffs on a target list of $60 billion in U.S. imports

The banned Chinese entities are Avin Electronics Technology Co Ltd, based in Shenzhen; Longkui Qu of Linhai, Zhejiang province; Multi-Mart Electronics Technology Co of Nanhai, Guangdong province; Taizhou CBM-Future New Material Science and Technology Co Ltd of Linhai, Zhejiang province; Tenco Technology Co Ltd, Shenzhen; and Yutron Technology Co Ltd of Shenzhen.

Avin, Mult-Mart, Tenco and Yutron all have offices in Hong Kong, Commerce said.

“We are putting individuals, businesses, and organizations across the world on notice that they will be held accountable for supporting Iran’s WMD activities and other illicit schemes,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. “Moreover, we cannot allow China’s civil-military integration strategy to undermine U.S. national security through prohibited technology transfer plots orchestrated by state actors.”"
DOJ tries to disqualify ex-Obama official from defending China’s Huawei,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Bebeto Matthews'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-tries-to-disqualify-ex-obama-official-from-defending-chinas-huawei,"The Justice Department is working to disqualify top Obama department official James Cole from defending the Chinese technology firm Huawei in a high-profile criminal case, according to a new heavily redacted federal court filing on Friday.

The Justice Department unsealed an indictment against Huawei in January 2019 which charged the company with bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to commit money laundering, obstruction of justice, illegal actions related to dodging Iran sanctions, and more. Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2011 to 2015, has been representing Huawei in this matter since 2017, but the Justice Department’s motion is an attempt to convince the court that Cole’s previous experiences investigating Huawei-related matters while at the department should disqualify him.

Cole held the second-highest position in the Obama Justice Department for five years, where he worked with Attorney General Eric Holder, oversaw the day-to-day operations of the department, and represented the department on the National Security Council. He brought those experiences to Sidley, one of the largest law firms in the country, where he is the global co-lead of their White Collar: Government Litigation and Investigations practice and where he has defended Huawei for the past couple years.

Justice Department attorneys told the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York that “Cole should be disqualified from representing Huawei Tech and Huawei USA in this case because of two different conflicts.” The details the department provided on the first conflict were heavily redacted. The agency said that “having represented the government in his role as DAG in the DOJ's [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED], Cole should not now be allowed to represent the defendants in a [REDACTED] matter brought by the DOJ that is substantially related in multiple respects to that [REDACTED] investigation.” Therefore, the department said that “Cole should be disqualified because he was personally and substantially involved in a [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED] that exposed him to relevant, privileged factual information [REDACTED] and strategic information about that investigation.”

The Justice Department did not specify those prior investigations.

The agency said the second conflict is that “Cole's representation of the defendants jeopardizes the government's interest in having a fair trial and obtaining a conviction that can sustain appeal and collateral attack.” Their claim was that, due to Cole’s past involvement in Justice Department investigations related to the Huawei case, he would not be able to provide Huawei with a proper defense and that “any representation by Cole would taint the trial process and any ultimate conviction.”

The Justice Department met with Cole related to his alleged conflict of interest multiple times in January and February 2019. Cole declined to recuse himself in March 2019, stating, “We have carefully considered the material you showed us and were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified based on that information.”

For its part, Huawei released a statement saying the Justice Department “has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter” and that its motion “makes a mockery of the adversarial process.” Huawei says that this is an attempt by the department “to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice … while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The Justice Department has been increasing its scrutiny of China’s activities in recent years, launching a ""China Initiative"" in 2018 and charging an increased number of people in China-related espionage cases, cracking down on China-based hacking schemes, prosecuting Chinese efforts to steal trade secrets, and more. The department has turned its sights on Huawei’s alleged criminality: Aside from charging the company and its connected entities, the U.S. government is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer Wanzhou Meng, who the U.S. believes was involved in the criminal conspiracy.

The U.S. government widely suspects that the Chinese-based Huawei, a technology firm that is a global leader in telecommunications and in 5G, is working hand in hand with the Chinese government, giving China's surveillance state access to hardware and networks around the world. Discussing the U.S.’s intelligence-sharing relationships with the United Kingdom and other European allies who are considering the use of Huawei’s 5G technology, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently warned, “We don’t believe you can have those technologies in your systems and still have a trusted network. We’re happy to continue to look at technology and see ways we might achieve that, but the United States for its part will only participate in trusted networks. We will only share America’s information with those networks that we are confident aren’t under the control of China or China’s government.”

The Department of Defense’s annual report to Congress on China, released in May, stressed that China is a growing threat not just in terms of hard power military capabilities but also in terms of cyberattacks, espionage, and infiltration. The Defense Department pointed out that China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law “requires Chinese companies, such as Huawei and ZTE, to support, provide assistance, and cooperate in China’s national intelligence work, wherever they operate.”

Cole is not the only former high-ranking Obama official representing China-based Huawei’s interests. Samir Jain, who was the senior director for cybersecurity policy for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, registered as a lobbyist for Huawei earlier this year.

EPA moves to ease water-quality standards in Washington state; Inslee and Ferguson say that’s illegal,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/inslee-ferguson-denounce-epa-move-to-ease-water-standards-for-washington-state/,"The Environmental Protection Agency proposes to ease Washington water-quality standards for chemicals discharged into state waterways, a move embraced by industry groups that sought the change and denounced as “illegal” by Gov. Jay Inslee and state Attorney General Bob Ferguson.

The action, disclosed Friday, reverses a 2016 decision by the EPA under the Obama administration that required the state to toughen the water-quality standard.

Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, said his agency had “inherent authority” to reconsider the 2016 decision, according to a letter Hladick sent Friday to Maia Bellon, the director of the state Ecology Department.

Ferguson and Inslee, in a joint statement, said “by taking this unilateral action, the EPA will risk almost certain litigation and cause uncertainty for Washington businesses.”

A major point of contention is the water-quality standard for PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), a group of chemicals considered to be probable carcinogens. PCBs can be found in dyes, paint, building materials, coolants and other products. In trace amounts, they often are present in industry wastewater discharges as well as municipal utility plants that treat stormwater runoff. Once in Puget Sound and freshwater drainage, they accumulate in fish and shellfish, so ingesting this food in large volumes can increase cancer risks.

In Washington, the PCBs water standard has been subject of years of intense scrutiny.

Tribal leaders pressed for tighter pollution limits to protect their members, who may eat far more fish and shellfish than other Washington residents. They were dismayed by the Trump administration’s EPA decision, which they said was done without the consultation required by the federal government’s treaties and trust responsibilities to tribes.

“This action is outrageous,” said Lorraine Loomis, chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. “Like all federal agencies, the EPA has a legally binding trust responsibility to the tribes that requires government-to-government consultation and the protection of tribal treaty rights and resources. They are not living up to this responsibility that is rooted in the U.S. Constitution.”

Paper and pulp manufacturers and other industry groups applauded the Trump administration decision.

They had opposed the Obama administration standard, saying that there was no technology available to bring wastewater discharge of PCBs to the low levels that were required. In a written statement, Donna Harmon, president of the American Forest & Paper Association, said, “The earlier EPA rule represented costly and ineffective regulatory overreach — plain and simple.”

The clash over PCB standards has unfolded under the umbrella of the federal Clean Water Act, which creates a partnership between the state and federal government to protect and when necessary restore the nation’s waterways.

Under the act, states have authority to develop water-quality standards, and the EPA the power of review.

During the Obama administration, the EPA partially disapproved of a state standard — developed by the Washington Department of Ecology while Inslee was governor. The EPA ruled the state standard for PCBs — 170 parts per quadrillion in wastewater discharges — did not go far enough in protecting the health of heavy consumers of Washington fish. Instead, the EPA sent a standard of 7 parts per quadrillion.

In February 2017, after the Trump administration took office, industry and water utility groups filed a petition to the EPA arguing that the action under the Obama administration unjustly overturned the state standard and that it should be pulled back.

Meanwhile, state officials accepted the EPA decision and went to work with stakeholders, including tribes and industry representatives, to find ways to implement new standards.

Colleen Keltz, an Ecology Department spokeswoman, acknowledged that the 7 parts per quadrillion standard may not be obtainable with current technology. But she said that the state is working under a new system that allows permitted discharges to have a variance that allows higher levels of discharges until technology is available to meet the standard.

But the EPA, under the Trump administration, dismissed the need to try to reach the lower standard. In a 32-page document released Friday, the EPA said the earlier state PCBs standard of 170 parts per quadrillion should be restored, saying that that standard was based on sound science.

Hladick’s criticisms of the 2016 EPA PCBs decision were rejected by Dennis McLerran, who served as regional administrator for the EPA under President Barack Obama. McLerran acknowledged that some standards are “aspirational” but said the earlier EPA action was based on the best science available and that the rule allowed for flexibility when dischargers could not meet the standard.

McLerran said it was “very unusual and inappropriate” to pull it back without first consulting with tribes and state officials.

“I think it is a very unfortunate thing. The state had made it clear that it was implementing the standards, and found them to be correct,” McLerran said.

State Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, disagrees with McLerran.

In a note sent this week to Ecology Department Director Bellon, Ericksen wrote that the initial state water-quality rule was the product of years of work by legislators, state officials and stakeholders. Ericksen said he was confused why Bellon would now oppose efforts to restore that rule, and urged that she reconsider that position."

The UAE did not describe the nature of the attack or say who was behind it.

“The Department is monitoring the oil markets, and is confident they remain well-supplied,” Hynes said after the attack which did not cause any casualties, or an oil spill, but resulted in significant damage to the ships."
DOJ celebrates judge ruling radio station must register under FARA as Russian agent,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-celebrates-judge-ruling-radio-station-must-register-under-fara-as-russian-agent,"The Justice Department celebrated on Monday a federal judge’s decision which found that a Washington, D.C., radio station, operated by RM Broadcasting, had been acting as an agent of a foreign power, Russia, and must therefore register as such under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Assistant Attorney General John Demers touted the decision, saying that “the American people have a right to know if a foreign flag waves behind speech broadcast in the United States.”

Since 2017, RM Broadcasting had been using AM radio channel 1390 WZHF to rebroadcast Russia’s Sputnik radio programs in D.C., and so the Justice Department was able to convince a district judge in southern Florida, where RM Broadcasting is based, that the company was acting as a foreign agent on Russia’s behalf. Last week, Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that RM Broadcasting was working on behalf of the federal state unitary enterprise Rossiya Segodnya, an international information agency, which the Justice Department contends is “a Russian state-owned media enterprise created by Vladimir Putin to advance Russian interests abroad.”

The Justice Department highlighted the decision as an example of its commitment to stepping up Foreign Agents Registration Act enforcement. “Our concern is not the content of the speech but providing transparency about the true identity of the speaker,” Demers said. “This case shows that the Department can and will utilize all of its tools to bring transparency to efforts by foreign entities to influence the American public and our government, and demonstrates our renewed effort to enforce FARA rigorously.”

The Justice Department said its court win over RM Broadcasting “marked the first FARA civil enforcement action since 1991.”

The foreign agents registration law requires anyone who is working on behalf of a foreign government — lobbyists, businesses, newspapers, think tanks, media outlets, and radio stations — to disclose their foreign relationship by registering with the Justice Department.

The Justice Department contended that Russia’s “control” over RM Broadcasting’s activity “was absolute with respect to broadcast content.” The department said that RM Broadcasting was being used by Russia as a U.S.-based middle man to attempt an end run around the law and told the court that “allowing foreign principals to circumvent FARA simply by operating in the U.S. through contractual intermediaries would render FARA ineffectual with respect to its purpose of informing the public of the foreign source of information.” The judge agreed, saying that RM Broadcasting “is an agent of a foreign principal and is required to register pursuant to FARA.”

Originally passed during the World War II era to combat Nazi propaganda efforts, the rarely prosecuted FARA law gained new attention after special counsel Robert Mueller secured convictions under the statute against Trump associates, including Paul Manafort and Rick Gates during his investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 campaign. Brandon Van Grack, who spent a year and a half working for Mueller, was put in charge of the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act unit earlier this year as the department promised to step up enforcement.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Adam Hickey told the Washington Examiner that the department now believes that the foreign agents law “is a sufficiently high priority and there are enough cases to warrant having a deputy chief responsible for the malign influence work generally, just like we have a deputy chief for export control and sanctions, cyber, and economic espionage.”

RM Broadcasting joins better-known Russia-backed outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik in being forced to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act in recent years. The U.S. has also stepped up the pressure on Chinese state media operating in the U.S. The China Global Television Network registered in 2019, but Xinhua News Agency has thus far declined to do so."

"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve",https://www.npr.org,['Tim Mak'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721763041/exclusive-documents-detail-meetings-of-russians-with-treasury-federal-reserve,"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pavel Ptitsin/AP Pavel Ptitsin/AP

Newly obtained documents describe what happened when two now-infamous Russians took their outreach campaign into the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2015.

Alexander Torshin, then a Russian central banker, brought his protégée, Maria Butina, for meetings with senior officials and even sought another with the then-chair of the Fed, the documents confirm.

Agency officials described what happened before and since in internal materials obtained by NPR under the Freedom of Information Act. The fact of the meetings has previously been reported, but their contents have not been fully described until now.

Torshin has since been sanctioned by the Treasury Department and cannot return to the United States.

Butina, meanwhile, has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to serve as a Russian agent and has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.

In an interview with NPR on Thursday, Butina called her meetings with government officials, politicians and the National Rifle Association ""civil diplomacy, this unofficial channel of diplomacy"" and said it was meant to build relationships between the U.S. and Russian governments — and ultimately to promote peace.

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department declined to comment for this story.

The 'gun fanatic'

Torshin and Butina sought to build bridges between the Russian government and influential Americans via their enthusiasm for gun rights. Both had life memberships in the National Rifle Association.

At the same time, Russia was stepping up its broader campaign of influence against the United States.

So in 2015, after the chill in relations between Washington and Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Torshin sought to take advantage of his connection to Russia's central bank.

Paul Saunders, who was then the executive director of a D.C.-based think tank called the Center for the National Interest, reached out to officials with the Treasury and the Fed to help organize meetings.

""Because we were about a year into U.S. sanctions on Russia following their annexation of Crimea, we thought it would be interesting for Americans to hear from a Russian central bank official about the status of the Russian financial system,"" Saunders told NPR. ""We were certainly not at that time aware of any derogatory information about Torshin.""

Saunders helped broker a meeting for Torshin and Butina with Nathan Sheets, then the undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs.

Treasury aide Erik Woodhouse consulted with a number of officials inside its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the White House's National Security Council, but no red flags were raised about the meeting, which ultimately took place on April 7, 2015.

A few years later, after Butina was arrested, a Treasury Department staffer wrote about what took place.

According to that newly revealed account, the discussion wasn't so much about banking as about denying Russia's involvement in the shoot-down of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner and amplifying Torshin's support for guns.

""The meeting was supposed to be about economics, but the guy just went on and on about how the Russians didn't shoot down MH17 for an hour or so,"" the Treasury Department official wrote, referring to the Malaysia Airlines flight.

""The guy was also a gun fanatic and said he was a 'life member of the NRA.' In fact I think he was even in town for personal business tied to the NRA.""

Saunders also reached out to request a meeting between then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Torshin in March 2015.

Yellen's office passed on the meeting and suggested that Torshin instead meet with Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer. Following the approval of an adviser, Fischer took the meeting on April 8, 2015, without further investigation into Torshin's background.

""They are in the United States to attend the NRA's annual meeting,"" the meeting's official notes read. Both Russians pointed out, as part of their introduction, that they were ""life members"" of the NRA.

This meeting did turn to economic issues, including discussions about Russian credit and inflation.

Butina, now in custody at a detention center in Alexandria, Va., said the meetings were unremarkable.

Of her meeting with Fischer, she said: ""Torshin put it straight: that he is here as an NRA member and he's just interested in meeting similar-minded people. ... I don't remember, even, the details of this conversation, because it wasn't significant at all.""

The sanctions

After months of investigations and headlines about Russia's influence campaign against the United States, Torshin was placed under sanction by the U.S. government in 2018.

In the evidentiary package that designated Torshin as a target for U.S. sanctions — also obtained by NPR — the Treasury Department established that Torshin was a Russian government official who could be targeted under existing sanctions authorities.

But the package also highlighted Torshin's alleged links with Russian organized crime.

Citing public sources such as Crime Russia, a news website focusing on Russian corruption, and El País, a Spanish newspaper, the document noted that Torshin was in ""frequent contact"" with Alexander Romanov, who heads the Taganskaya organized crime group, between August 2012 to May 2013.

""Torshin may have personally given instructions to members of the Taganskaya on money laundering methods using Spanish bank accounts and real estate,"" the evidentiary package reads.

The package cites no classified or governmental sources, but experts say the inclusion of references to Torshin's alleged organized crime links suggests the U.S. government had reason to believe the allegation was truthful.

""There's a whole process that is used for determining what is included in an evidentiary package. By including it, they view it as credible and relevant to designating him with sanctions,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, who formerly served as a senior adviser to the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

""This information is strictly ancillary to the legal authorities needed to sanction Torshin, but they want to put it out there for government officials to be aware of.""

Butina told NPR that she once asked Torshin about these alleged links, but she said she didn't believe they were true.

""I have no knowledge about this, absolutely none. ... One time I asked him about it, and he denied it ... a couple of years ago,"" she said. ""I don't believe he has this type of personality."""

""I can't prove that Trump's pressure was the reason — that there's a direct causal relationship between all of these things,"" Risen, national security correspondent for The Intercept, told Hill.TV's Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti on ""Rising.""

""But I think it's fairly obvious that a climate was created by Trump that put Mueller in a box, and made the clock running in his head, where 'I've got to finish this,'"" he continued.

Risen characterized the final Mueller report as ""hesitant"" and ""tentative.""

""There's many points throughout in which Mueller backs away from the logic of his own investigation, and there are points at which he doesn't pursue obvious questions, both in terms of contacts between the Russians and the Trump organization, and in terms of obstruction of justice,"" he said.

""I come away thinking, OK, why was he so tentative? Why was he not willing to pursue obvious questions? ... Why did he take such a narrow framing of what his mandate was?"" he continued.

Risen argued in a recent piece for The Intercept that Trump put pressure on the Justice Department during the Mueller probe, and now has a ""willing lackey in Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrBarr names Connecticut prosecutor to investigate Russia probe's origins: report Rubio asks Barr to investigate Kerry over Iran meetings Rosenstein quotes Mueller in commencement address MORE.""

Democrats have slammed Barr's handling of the release of the Mueller report, saying his summary and subsequent press conference about the investigation did not capture the full context of Mueller's conclusions.

Barr, in a memo he released days after receiving Mueller's final report, emphasized that the special counsel did find enough evidence to accuse the Trump campaign of conspiracy with Moscow, but critics say he failed to mention the multiple instances of possible obstruction of justice the report details.

President Trump’s penchant for secrecy is about to be tested in court,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'May At Pm']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-penchant-for-secrecy-is-about-to-be-tested-in-court/2019/05/12/bf604b4e-71c6-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html,"AMONG THE mysteries surrounding President Trump’s conduct, one of the strangest is his penchant for meeting President Vladimir Putin of Russia without aides or interpreters, contrary to the practice of past presidents. The Post’s Greg Miller has quoted U.S. officials as saying there is no detailed record, even in classified files, of Mr. Trump’s face-to-face interactions with the Russian leader at five locations over the past two years, and in one case, Mr. Trump seized the notes made by an interpreter who was present.

This peculiar behavior is about to be tested in court. Three groups have brought a lawsuit seeking to force Mr. Trump and his advisers to follow the laws that govern presidential and federal agency records. So far, they allege, the president has failed to do so.

At issue are the Presidential Records Act, which covers Mr. Trump’s activities, and the Federal Records Act, which covers agencies such as the State Department. In normal procedure, State provides interpreters for such meetings. The presidential records law was passed by Congress in 1978, after Richard M. Nixon’s resignation, to prevent Nixon from destroying or otherwise disposing of his records and secretly recorded White House conversations. The law established that records of the presidency relating to duties of the office are the property of the American people, and it ended the previous tradition of presidential records belonging to former presidents. Importantly, the law also demands that the president take care to ensure his activities are documented and preserved for eventual access by the public — a vital form of accountability. Likewise, the Federal Records Act requires government officials to document their activities and preserve their history.

The three organizations questioning Mr. Trump’s adherence to the law are Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit government accountability group; the National Security Archive, a leading nonprofit research group at George Washington University that uses the Freedom of Information Act extensively; and the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, which represents scholars seeking to document U.S. diplomacy. In addition to Mr. Trump’s meetings with Mr. Putin, the groups question in their lawsuit whether an adequate record exists of the president’s conversations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, or of senior White House aide Jared Kushner’s meetings with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The failure to document these meetings is not only about compliance with the law. Mr. Trump’s secrecy deprives his own advisers of knowledge about what is going on and thus harms their ability to give him good advice. It will blast a huge crater in the work of historians who attempt to piece together what transpired in Mr. Trump’s presidency. It also deprives the American people of a basic method of holding Mr. Trump accountable for his performance. No doubt he likes it that way. But the courts must insist that no president is above the law, including the law for keeping honest and full records of the presidency."
Collusion: How the State Department tried to save Voice of America from Soviet influence in WWII,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/collusion-how-the-state-department-tried-to-save-voice-of-america-from-soviet-influence-in-wwii,"Last week, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, marked World Press Freedom Day with an excellent speech. Amid powerful remarks in defense of press freedom, Cruz recounted how the U.S. State Department had tried several times to censor out President Reagan’s famous words, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,” from his 1987 address at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

Three times, State Department staff had tried to delete this now-famous phrase, objecting that it was too belligerent. Three times, Reagan put it back in. As Cruz told the story, Reagan finally explained to them: ""You don’t understand. This is the whole point of the speech.""

I was in charge of the Voice of America Polish Service when Reagan delivered his Berlin Wall address. We reported on it, of course, but I remember that unlike refugee VOA journalists like myself, many VOA English newsroom reporters at that time were horrified by Ronald Reagan.

To many of my VOA newsroom colleagues, he was a dangerous warmonger. Fortunately, their view was not shared by most VOA journalists in the East European foreign language services. They admired Reagan’s courage, as did dissidents and most people in countries behind the Iron Curtain.

Voice of America did not report on Sen. Cruz’s speech and its fascinating details about the Cold War. This is interesting, because he gave it at the invitation of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which manages VOA. The agency streamed the speech live on Facebook, but this dysfunctional and obscure bureaucratic agency was only able to get five live viewers.

I think I know why VOA ignored Sen. Cruz’s speech. It’s not because his speech was not newsworthy. The answer lies within the ideologically-driven activism of some VOA officials and journalists, combined with their willingness to censor facts and viewpoints they don't like while promoting their own left-wing political causes on the taxpayer's dime.

Two years ago, reporters and editors in today’s VOA English newsroom had no problem playing a monologue video of American communist and Lenin Peace Prize winner Angela Davis. They presented her as a champion of human rights, failing to disclose her former support for the Soviet Union and Communist Party membership.

The State Department does not have a monopoly on poor political judgment. When one looks at the history of U.S. international broadcasting, left-wing Voice of America journalists were more eager supporters of Stalin and state socialism than most U.S. diplomats. In April 1943, the State Department intervened twice to save VOA, then in the Office of War Information, from the influence of pro-Soviet officials and VOA broadcasters. This included VOA’s first director, John Houseman, and VOA’s first chief news writer and news director, Communist author Howard Fast. After Fast was forced to resign from VOA in 1944 due to pressure from the State Department and the FBI, he was honored in 1953 with the Stalin Peace Prize, worth about $235,000 in today’s dollars.

Houseman, a Hollywood actor, was also forced to resign from his position as VOA director after Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles sent a secret memo to Franklin Roosevelt's White House warning against Soviet influence over the Office of War Information’s domestic and foreign propaganda programs. The State Department refused to give Houseman and Fast U.S. passports for government travel abroad.

But the State Department’s behind-the-scenes intervention against collusion with Soviet Russia at VOA was only partially successful. Also in 1943, Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle and other State Department diplomats tried to warn VOA not to embrace the Soviet propaganda lie about the Katyn massacre of thousands of Polish officers by the Soviet NKVD secret police. Their advice was ignored by OWI’s leadership. The FDR White House was not interested in countering this particular Soviet propaganda message, but when pro-Soviet VOA broadcasts started to threaten the lives of American soldiers by criticizing U.S. deals with Vichy France and Italy, FDR sided with the State Department and Gen. Dwight Eisenhower against the Office of War Information. Eisenhower later accused VOA’s communist sympathizers of “insubordination” against their own president.

During World War II, U.S. diplomats were not fully successful in eliminating foreign ideological influence over VOA broadcasts. The process of getting rid of pro-Soviet VOA journalists continued after the Office of War Information was abolished by President Harry Truman and VOA was moved to the State Department in 1945. Management reforms and the hires of new broadcasters who were opposed to communism were not completed at VOA until about 1952.

Contrary to conventional wisdom that journalists always seek the truth and cherish freedom, some of the best educated and experienced State Department diplomats were less fooled by Soviet propaganda during World War II than were Voice of America's officials and broadcasters. World War II VOA programs were mostly designed to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany and Japan, but U.S. government broadcasters also started to present the Soviet Union and Stalin as champions of freedom and human progress.

In later years some VOA officials and journalists participated in the cover-up of VOA’s early love affair with Stalin and Soviet communism. They misled Americans about VOA’s history of initially supporting Stalin’s takeover of Eastern Europe with Soviet-generated propaganda and disinformation. Eventually, pressure from Congress and public opinion turned VOA into a relatively successful voice in support of freedom during the later years of the Cold War, but the early history of VOA’s cheering for Stalin and socialism in Eastern Europe has been covered up and forgotten.

The danger of the Voice of America becoming a tool of foreign propaganda — be it Russian, Iranian or Chinese — and a tool of domestic partisan and ideological activism, reemerged in the last several years under the hapless Obama-era holdover management team in charge of the United States Agency for Global Media. Independent studies have shown pro-Putin, pro-Iranian regime, and pro-communist China bias in VOA programs, as well as illegal targeting of American audiences through Facebook ads.

Responding to media reports of internal scandals not only at VOA but also at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently called for getting a new CEO to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Pompeo said that the agency in charge of foreign media outreach must have “the right leadership so they can do the traditional mission — perhaps in a different information environment than we did back in the Cold War, but can perform its function in a way that is important and noble, and reflects the enormous resources that are — that American taxpayers have put towards that.”

“I’m very concerned about it,” Secretary Pompeo added.

More Americans should be concerned. Their tax money might be going to foreign propaganda, as some VOA officials and some (not all) U.S. government-hired journalists allow ideology and foreign influence to take precedence over the journalistic requirements of the VOA congressional charter: accuracy, balance, and nonpartisanship in Voice of America programs.

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as “preliminary,” after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat — these findings and conclusions are “preliminary” and have “not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.”

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: “The findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.”

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a “welcome” change.

“The previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‘preliminary’ would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,” Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. “It is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.”

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: “Many journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.”

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that “removing ‘preliminary’ from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.”

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have “agency-specific policies” that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department’s internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several “flags” that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of “prominent issues,” include “significant” scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request “corrections” and “changes,” if the scientific publication falls under the category of “prominent issues” or policy implications.

“It is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,” Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal “stakeholders” request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return “the REVISED PUBLICATION” for “ACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,” the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA’s scientific integrity rules and “helps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.”

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review “into a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.” Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, “just about any output” from that agency could be flagged, she said.

USDA’s “interests apparently concern consistency with prevailing policy,” Offutt said, “not the public’s access to the best, unbiased science and analysis.”

"After reports of record falsification, Department of Justice investigating Connections prison services",https://www.delawareonline.com,"['Christina Jedra', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2019/05/13/doj-investigating-connections-prison-services/1187333001/,"CLOSE A former employee at Connections CSP says she was told to falsify dozens of female patient records at Crest South. 5/10/19 Jerry Habraken and Damian Giletto, Delaware News Journal

The Delaware Department of Justice said on Monday it is investigating Connections Community Support Programs, the private contractor that provides physical and mental health services to all inmates in state correctional facilities.

News of the probe comes after The News Journal published an investigation into reports that the contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment at Crest South, a taxpayer-funded substance abuse program for drug offenders in Georgetown.

Over a dozen inmates at Crest South said they received little or no individual counseling during their stay. Four former Crest counselors said the program supervisor instructed subordinates to falsify and backdate records to indicate clients had received counseling and treatment plans when in fact they did not. The supervisor denies this.

One former counselor, Shannon Lasek, admitted to falsifying at least 30 records.

""DOJ’s Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust is aware of issues regarding Connections’ contract and work with the Department of Correction, and is conducting an investigation,"" said DOJ Communications Director Mat Marshall.

Marshall would not comment further on the substance of the investigation but said that people with information about ""Connections' record-keeping practices"" should contact publictrust@delaware.gov.

Connections CEO Cathy McKay did not make herself available to The News Journal for interviews but issued a statement on Monday.

""We welcome any objective investigation into our programs and are confident any investigation will work to restore a level of trust in the community,"" she said.

The organization investigated its own records after Lasek said in her December resignation letter that she was forced to falsify documents. McKay said officials ""were satisfied that this did not occur.""

The Department of Correction, which paid Connections $15 million for its mental health and substance abuse services last year, said it did ""a quick search"" of electronic records in December that showed no evidence of falsification but it is conducting a deeper investigation now.

According to McKay, Connections' electronic record-keeping system cannot be backdated and ""clearly shows that individuals did receive services they claimed in print did not happen.""

Lasek said it's true that the electronic system automatically timestamps new inputs. She said when she falsified records, she published notes in the computer system that referred to paper charts. The electronic marker would show the current date, according to Lasek, but the paper file would have the older date the treatment plan was due.

Connections Board Chairman Bob Byrd said he had nothing to add to McKay's statement.

READ THE FULL INVESTIGATION: Prison contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment, sources say

A spokesman for Gov. John Carney called the allegations of record falsification a ""clearly troubling"" situation that deserves the attention of prosecutors.

""We will not solve our addiction crisis without addressing addiction in our prisons, where 46 percent of inmates on any given day are facing challenges with substance use,"" said Jonathan Starkey, the governor's communications director.

""We need to make sure that inmates have real access to treatment so they have a chance of success when they leave prison and re-enter their communities. Addiction affects every corner of our state, and this is too important an issue to not get right.""

The DOC said in a statement that it appreciates The News Journal bringing ""more detailed information and in-person accounts"" to its attention.

""Should the allegations be substantiated, the Department of Correction will take appropriate corrective action,"" the agency said. ""The DOC remains committed to providing quality care to the individuals entrusted into its custody.""

MaryBeth Cichocki, a Delaware addiction treatment advocate, has heard complaints about the quality of Connections services for years. In response to reports of falsification, she said she was ""not surprised.""

""Connections needs to be kicked out of Delaware, and we need to start a new program with people who really care about the outcomes of the people they’re treating,"" said Cichocki, who lost her son to an overdose in 2015. ""From what I’ve seen of Connections, all they care about is making money.""

The state, which paid Connections more than $72 million in state contracts last year, needs to reconsider its service delivery, Cichocki said.



""Connections has taken over the state and there is no competition anymore,"" she said. ""I really think the state is at a loss for what to do so they keep funding Connections.""

The Department of Correction recently extended Connections' mental health contract through mid-2020 and said the allegations of fraud will ""absolutely not"" get in the way of that agreement.

""That’s pretty sad if Connections is all we have and these things are happening and they’re continuing to ignore it,"" Cichocki said.

Lasek hopes the Department of Justice investigation is more thorough than the probes done by Connections and the DOC, neither of which interviewed her.

""They need to listen to the counselors and past clients,"" she said. ""We know there is a big problem. Let's all care enough to do something about it. Let's care more about the harm being done to people than their need to look good.""

This isn't the first time a Delaware health care contractor has been accused of falsifying records.

In 1994, St. Louis-based Correctional Medical Services lost its license for faulty record-keeping at a Gander Hill substance abuse program. Documents showed months of treatment plans, program notes and clinical supervision records were missing from client files, the News Journal reported at the time.

One inmate said he was instructed to sign a blank form or be expelled from the program. Another prisoner filed a complaint after he was directed to sign eight months' worth of progress reports in one session, the Journal reported.

In 2005, a former Correctional Medical Services drug and alcohol counselor said she was ordered to falsify documents from 1999 to 2002 so state inspectors wouldn't pull the program's license, the News Journal reported.

""I received a chart that wasn't touched for four months,"" said former counselor Denise Rodriguez. ""I was told to 'catch the chart up' using previous statements from the client.""

About 20 years later, Lasek reported a very similar experience with Connections.

Also in 2005, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice opened a ""formal inquiry"" into medical care and other systemic issues inside Delaware prisons.

The inquiry followed a six-month investigation by The News Journal highlighting AIDS-related inmate deaths and suicides over four years; allegations by inmates of poor medical treatment for cancer, meningitis and hepatitis; and a no-bid $25.9 million contract awarded to Correctional Medical Services to manage health care in the state's prisons.

The U.S. Department of Justice found ""substantial civil rights violations"" inside Delaware's prisons. Federal officials reached a settlement with the DOC despite protests from state officials and even a letter from then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner to then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales attempting to derail the nine-month federal investigation.

Federal regulators identified a host of problems inside the prisons, including inadequate screening and health assessments, inadequate treatment of inmates with infectious diseases, inadequate treatment of inmates with serious mental illness and deficiencies in the state's suicide-prevention measures.

The state signed an 87-point agreement promising to correct the deficiencies and ""meet generally accepted professional standards.""

After six years of working to improve inmate health, the DOC was released from the imposed agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice on the final day of 2012.

U.S. says Huawei lawyer's prior work at Justice Department poses conflicts,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-huawei-tech/u-s-says-huawei-lawyers-prior-work-at-justice-department-poses-conflicts-idUSKCN1SG2GU,"(Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd lawyer James Cole’s prior work at the U.S. Department of Justice created conflicts of interest that should disqualify him from defending the Chinese company in a case of alleged bank fraud and sanctions violations, U.S. prosecutors said in a filing on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign board of Huawei at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) Asia 2018 in Shanghai, China June 14, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo

Last week, the prosecutors filed a motion to disqualify Cole, who served as deputy attorney general, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, between 2011 and 2015. But the motion was sealed and classified, and prosecutors did not make public the reasons behind the move.

“There is a ‘substantial risk’ that Cole could use ‘confidential factual information’ obtained while serving as DAG to ‘materially advance’ Huawei’s current defense strategy,” the prosecutors said, according to a redacted copy of the U.S. motion filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.

Cole was not immediately available for comment. But in a statement Huawei said the U.S. wants to strip the company of counsel of its choice while concealing the facts on why.

“The Justice Department’s motion to disqualify Jim Cole makes a mockery of the adversarial process,” the statement said.

“The government has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter. Now, two years later, not only does the Justice Department seek to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice, but it does so while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The case against Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has ratcheted up tensions between Beijing and Washington as the world’s top two economic powers try to negotiate a trade deal.

The company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in December at the behest of U.S. authorities for her role in the alleged fraud. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.

In Friday’s filing, U.S. prosecutors said Cole’s representation of Huawei poses “irresolvable conflicts of interest.”

As deputy attorney general, Cole “personally supervised and participated in aspects of” an investigation that caused the conflicts, the prosecutors said in the filing.

Details of that probe were redacted, but the filing said the Huawei prosecution is “substantially related” to the matter.

The prosecutors said Cole possessed information from his government work related to his Huawei representation that he could not reveal, and this created the risk he would rely on the information in breach his duties to the Justice Department.

Secondly, because the nature of the conflict is classified, the prosecutors said, Huawei cannot obtain enough information for them to waive any conflict.

The case against Huawei and Meng accuses them of conspiring to defraud HSBC Holdings Plc and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a company that operated in Iran, putting the banks at risk of penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions laws.

Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner. The United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei’s Iran business.

U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system.

Last month, prosecutors said they planned to use information about Huawei in the case that was obtained through secret surveillance.

Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in Brooklyn on March 14."

Updated at 7:56 p.m. ET

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the — 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""
"EPA fails to communicate risks of Franklin contamination, leaves families exposed to toxic chemicals",https://www.indystar.com,"['Sarah Bowman', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2019/05/14/epa-under-review-see-if-left-franklin-families-risk-pollution/1187723001/,"CLOSE Franklin residents concerned about environmental pollution and toxic vapors entering their homes met with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Inspector General to share their concerns about cancer. Dwight Adams, dwight.adams@indystar.com

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discovered cancer-causing chemicals in the ground and sewers down the street from Kathy and David Carlson's Franklin house in the 1980s, but the Carlsons weren't informed of the risk for nearly 30 years.

And it wasn’t by the EPA. It was from a nonprofit started by parents.

“We didn’t put all this stuff together and we are still putting it together, but not because of anything the EPA has done — absolutely nothing,” said Kathy Carlson, a professor at Franklin College. The Carlsons have now learned enough that when David was diagnosed with cancer last year, their stomachs twisted into knots.

“We live less than a mile away,” she added, “and we have been utterly in the dark.”

Now the EPA Office of Inspector General is studying whether the agency is doing an adequate job of ""risk communication,"" or informing residents when environmental risks are discovered in their neighborhoods. Its study will examine eight sites, including the one near the Carlsons in Franklin.

And an IndyStar review of EPA communication guidelines suggests several reasons for concern in the agency’s handling of the contamination in Franklin:

The EPA stated publicly that the contamination was “under control” without any scientific testing to back it up.

The EPA didn’t inform residents about upcoming testing, leading to confusion, which may have caused some in the community to decline sampling.

The EPA didn’t involve the community as an active participant in making decisions about the site.

Similar to the Carlsons, numerous Franklin residents credit their knowledge of the city’s pollution problems to the local nonprofit known as If It Was Your Child. Stacie Davidson and Kari Rhinehart co-founded the group in 2014 to raise awareness and share information about contamination in their community — a job they said the EPA should have been doing.

The OIG traveled to Franklin last Wednesday to hear from residents. The government watchdog is visiting four of the eight sites as part of its review of the EPA’s communication efforts and if it shares information in a way that allows families to take steps to protect themselves.

The EPA did not answer IndyStar’s questions, but sent a statement via email saying it welcomed the opportunity to meet with the OIG to help with its audit.

“Properly communicating risk to the public is a fundamental part of EPA’s mission,” the statement read. “[EPA] Administrator [Andrew] Wheeler has placed a renewed emphasis on this aspect of our job and we welcome the OIG review and look forward to working with them and the community on this effort.”

Davidson and Rhinehart, along with New Jersey-based environmental nonprofit Edison Wetlands Association, sent a letter in January to the Inspector General demanding an investigation into why toxic contamination at the former Amphenol site in Franklin persists.

As part of the OIG’s review, project manager Jill Trynosky said they will examine how closely the EPA has followed its guidelines on risk communication. IndyStar found and examined the EPA’s risk communication workbook for its own analysis.

Two of the key “Do’s and Don’ts” listed are to be honest and open and to not speak in absolutes.

But last year, around the time of the EPA's first community meeting in Franklin, EPA and state officials maintained that everything was “under control” and that the contamination had not moved or spread — despite having not completed updated testing to support that statement.

An IndyStar review of thousands pages of documents had found that the city’s contamination problem went back decades, and that serious data gaps existed as to the extent of the contamination. Questions emerged about whether the treatment system in place was actually removing the toxic metals.

“The city, state and EPA were so quick to try to get out in front of this and discredit it from the get go,” Rhinehart said, “instead of acknowledging it and saying ‘we have to work together to get this fixed.’”

When that testing was in fact completed and shared in November, it showed the toxic chemicals had actually spread and were under residential areas in Franklin, exactly as risk assessment models from the '90s predicted it would.

“That was a very reckless statement and very confusing for people,” Davidson said. “To say it’s not widespread, people want to believe that and they should be able to believe that from the EPA.”

The EPA’s workbook says it is important that the agency “earn trust and establish credibility” and “listen to community fears” to be able to effectively communicate.

And still the agency did not inform residents that it had hired an environmental consultant to do contamination testing inside their homes. Seeing a name they didn’t recognize, most residents declined the testing.

“There were a lot of steps that were not taken and a lot of steps that were taken were missteps,” Davidson told IndyStar, “and I think it put our community back.”

The EPA is also supposed to involve the community. The guidelines suggest setting up mailing lists, telephone conference calls or hotlines, or a workshop, among several other tools.

But the EPA dismissed Franklin residents' request to establish a Community Advisory Group to discuss their concerns and to participate in the EPA’s decisions about site clean-up. Instead it established an email update list — to which zero emails have been sent, Rhinehart said.

The OIG has said it plans to focus on recent communications in its audit, but the If It Was Your Child leaders said that would provide an incomplete picture.

“This goes back decades, when no one knew this site was in their own backyards producing contamination at levels high enough it could have been a Superfund,” Davidson said. “Because no one told us.”

Community can't minimize exposure

Kathy Carlson said that she never heard or saw anything over the years after the contamination was found, including when a treatment system was installed in the '90s or when the nearby wells supplying the city's water were shut down for contamination risks in the 2000s.

""I read the news and stay up on what's going on,"" she said, ""and I would have been on that like a bulldog.""

Actually, it wasn’t until just five years ago that her family finally learned of the cancer-causing chemicals in the city. And it was just last year that her 71-year-old husband was diagnosed with plasmacytoma, a type of blood cancer.

When David received his diagnosis, the doctor told them that they didn’t have to worry about it being passed down to their children — this cancer was from the environment.

He has received radiation and is doing well, but the Carlson family is not alone.

If It Was Your Child has documented at least 58 cases of childhood cancer — often rare forms of blood and brain cancer — in Franklin and surrounding towns since 2008. Both co-founders have had children with cancer — Davidson's stepson Zane, 14, is now in remission after a three-year battle with a rare form of leukemia. Rhinehart lost her 13-year-old daughter, Emma Grace Findley, in 2014 from a rare brain tumor.

The group is just now beginning to track adult cancers such as David Carlson’s.

“We have not even touched the surface of what issues and illnesses may have been caused by this,” said Dr. Mary Beth Hensley, a Franklin physician who is now being mindful of patients' diagnoses and to what they may have been exposed.

The main contaminants are trichloroethylene, or TCE, and tetrachloroethylene, or PCE — both of which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists as known carcinogens, meaning they can cause cancer in humans.

Agency officials and the health department have continued to emphasize that it is unknown what is causing children in Johnson County and Franklin to get cancer, or if any specific environmental cause can be identified.

Rhinehart, who is in the medical field along with Davidson, said she doesn’t accept that.

“We are willing to call something a carcinogen, but then because there is not an overwhelming amount of scientific proof, we can’t connect it to cancer,” Rhinehart said. “But no one is going to hand a kid or adult a glass of TCE to see what happens.”

Still, because these contaminants have that potential — and they have been detected in Franklin's sewers and even in some houses — Hensley said precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause-and-effect relationships aren't fully established scientifically.

It is unacceptable, Hensley added, that she as a doctor had not been contacted by the EPA about the potential effects and to be watching for certain cancer diagnoses. The Carlsons' oncologist also had no idea or been contacted, they said.

Kathy Carlson said there are numerous things her family might have done if they had been told sooner: They could have had their basement sealed to minimize vapors coming in, as well as installed water and air filtration systems for the whole house. Many parents said they would not have let their kids play in the creek, or they would have had their house tested years ago, or they might have even moved.

Regardless, Rhinehart said, they would have had information to make their own decisions to minimize their risk and help find solutions.

“Maybe we would have had people paying attention a long time ago,” she said. “And maybe could have saved years before getting to this point and saved some lives.”

Begging for better

The OIG's audit director of land cleanup, Tina Lovingood, and Trynosky said they heard a number of items at Wednesday’s community meeting they could take back to the EPA immediately with some suggestions, particularly around how the community perceives the agency.

Trynosky said that “some comments tonight were concerning,” but she added it is important to hear from EPA officials about why they made the decisions they did.

In its statement, the EPA said it has provided the OIG with data, files and other information about its technical work, community involvement program and communications.

Rhinehart and Davidson both said they are excited that the OIG is looking into the situation in Franklin and feel that someone is finally listening to them.

“They were the game changer in Flint — there are officials being prosecuted from there on a federal level now,” Rhinehart said, referring to the OIG’s investigation of the government’s slow response to Flint, Michigan’s water crisis. “Most people don’t understand the full impact of what this could mean, but I do.”

Both women said they are frustrated that the OIG is looking only into potential failures in communication, and not whether the EPA actually failed in its response and efforts to clean up the contamination.

Lovingood said the OIG does sometimes audit actual clean-up efforts, but “this particular job is not that.”

The OIG hopes to finalize its report by the end of the year.If the watchdog arm finds areas where the EPA has failed to effectively communicate risk, it will make recommendations on how it can improve.

Beyond suggestions for how the EPA could better follow its guidelines, Trynosky said the OIG will look to see if any policies or standards need to be changed or strengthened, as well as review the training on them.

The next EPA community meeting is scheduled for June 5, and Davidson said that will be a real litmus test for how the clean-up will progress going forward.

“To date, if we’re talking about basic guidelines of communication, EPA has fallen short,” she said. “We want it to be stricter so people aren’t waiting years or decades for responses and information.”

“So we hope they come in with a plan for communication with the communities going forward,” Davidson added. “That’s what we’ve been asking for and hoping for and begging for all along.”

Trump: It would be 'appropriate' for me to talk to DOJ about investigating Biden,https://thehill.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/443234-trump-it-would-be-appropriate-for-me-to-talk-to-doj-about-investigating,"President Trump Donald John TrumpLawsuit alleges Trump campaign paid women less than men Graham encourages Donald Trump Jr. to plead the 5th Crunch time for Senate disaster aid talks MORE said Friday it would be ""appropriate"" for him to discuss opening an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joseph (Joe) Robinette BidenSanders and Ocasio-Cortez join up to preach Green New Deal, take jabs at Biden Biden says he'd be open to breaking up Facebook MSNBC to host Harris town hall this month MORE and his family with Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrBarr names Connecticut prosecutor to investigate Russia probe's origins: report Rubio asks Barr to investigate Kerry over Iran meetings Rosenstein quotes Mueller in commencement address MORE.

Trump told Politico in an interview Friday that he hasn’t talked with Barr about investigating Biden and his family's business dealings but said ""certainly it would be an appropriate thing"" to bring up with the attorney general.

""Certainly it is a very big issue and we’ll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven’t thought of that. I mean, you’re asking me a question I just haven’t thought of,"" he told the outlet.

The president noted that it could be ""a very big situation"" for Biden, who has led the Democratic presidential primary field in polling since he launched his campaign last month.

""Because he’s a Democrat it’s about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican, it would be a lot bigger,"" Trump alleged.

Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last week called for an investigation into Biden for his previous ties to Ukraine after The New York Times reported that while Biden was vice president in 2016, he allegedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor. The prosecutor, who had been accused of ignoring corruption in his own office, was later voted out.

Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of an energy company that the prosecutor had been looking into, according to the newspaper.

Giuliani initially planned to travel to Ukraine to encourage Ukraine's president-elect to launch investigations into Biden and the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE's Russia investigation.

However, Giuliani changed course late Friday, announcing that he had canceled his trip. The reversal came after Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of seeking aid from a foreign government.

Biden, the front-runner among a crowded field of Democrats vying for the White House in 2020, had a 32-point lead over his competitors in a Hill-HarrisX poll released earlier this week.

Biden also surpassed Trump by six points in the first poll published after the former vice president officially announced his candidacy in April."
US DoJ Charges Group of Individuals Who Stole $2.5 Mln in Crypto Via SIM Swapping,https://cointelegraph.com,['Ana Berman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-charges-group-of-individuals-who-stole-25-mln-in-crypto-via-sim-swapping,"The United States Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment on May 9 that charges a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider and his colleague from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Angie Salazar announced the charges in the Eastern District of Michigan. Per Salazar, the investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations on two continents.

According to the indictment, five Americans and an Irishman are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Another three, who reportedly are the former employees of mobile phone providers, are charged in a criminal complaint with the wire fraud related to “The Community.”

As described in the document, the hacking group used SIM swapping — a type of identity theft attack that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication. The perpetrator usually gains control of a target's mobile phone by convincing or bribing the employee of the mobile provider to swap the phone number to a SIM card controlled by the hackers.

After successfully swapping the numbers of their victims, “The Community” managed to gain access to their various online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets. As a result of fraud, approximately $2.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to wallets controlled by the hacking group. Attorney Schneider clarified that in this case, three mobile phone service provider employees purportedly helped swappers to steal money.

The charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison each. Meanwhile, a conviction of aggravated identity theft could add up to two years in prison for the defendants .

According to Irish news website The Journal, a 20-year-old man from Dublin was arrested in Ireland upon the request of the U.S. authorities and is currently awaiting extradition.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in November 2018, a law enforcement group dedicated to fighting cybercrime released a report on SIM swapping, stating that it had become increasingly popular in California.

Meanwhile, in January, a 21-year old American was accused of stealing almost $24 million in crypto via SIM swapping. And in February, a New York resident was indicted in what constituted the jurisdiction’s first SIM-swapping prosecution."

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)

The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Trump’s plans to expand fossil-

fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior’s Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking in as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico’s Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

“So, that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,” he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. “What I hope is, as an organization, we learn from any error we make.”

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee this week, to factor climate change into the department’s decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation’s carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

“The law requires us to analyze those things,” he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. “It doesn’t say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.”

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president’s order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said that the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said he expected to get a briefing on last week’s U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world’s plants and animals are at risk of extinction but added that the Interior and Commerce departments still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

“We didn’t start doing them to not do them,” he said.

As he pursues the administration’s agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on the Interior Department.

“We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,” McCollum said. “Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what’s the bare minimum.”

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

“You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,” he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary’s office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska’s Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

“I’m not somebody who would put somebody else’s stuff up,” Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose’s entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. “His neck meat alone was 135 pounds.”"
DOJ charges Chinese man over 'one of the worst data breaches in history' which took 79 million people’s personal data from Anthem health insurers,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Bill Bostock'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-hacker-stole-data-78-million-anthem-doj-say-2019-5,"A Chinese national has been charged with orchestrating the biggest data hack in US healthcare history, in which 79 million people had their personal information stolen.

Wang Fujie, 32, was charged with hacking US health insurance giant Anthem, and three other unnamed US businesses, between February 2014 and January 2015, a Department of Justice press (DOJ) release said Thursday.

In the four-count indictment cited by the DOJ, Wang, who also goes by Dennis Wang, is said to have ""used sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses without authorization.""

He was charged alongside another man, referred to in the indictment as John Doe.

The men are then accused of installing malware and seeking out the personal information of 79 million Anthem customers, as well as their ""confidential business information.""

They were detected in January 2015, the indictment said.

The stolen data included names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information, and income data, the indictment said.

Anthem paid the US government $16 million as a result of the privacy violation in October 2018.

One of the techniques Wang is said to have used was a ""spearfishing"" email, a targeted message designed to trick the recipient into treating it as legitimate.

Emails with hyperlinks were sent to employees of the four companies, the DOJ said. If they clicked on the link it installed malware which opened a back door to the company's computer server, the indictment said.

Wang and the other man were both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.

In a statement, DOJ assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski said: ""The allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history.""

""These defendants allegedly attacked US businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII (personally identifiable information).""

In February 2015, Bloomberg reported that the FBI believes the hack was sponsored by the Chinese government.

An Anthem spokeswoman told Business Insider in an emailed statement:

""We are grateful for the support and partnership of the FBI and extended law enforcement team in investigating the sophisticated cyber-attack that Anthem was a victim of in February 2015, and are pleased with the action taken today.""

""There is no evidence that information obtained through the 2015 cyber-attack targeting Anthem has resulted in fraud."""
Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A decision on where in the West — possibly Utah — to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it’s moving. I can’t tell you where it’s going, but it’s moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they’ll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That’s an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that’s consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you’re only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don’t know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That’s why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain’t there in the first place,"" he said. ""There’s coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn’t exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We’re going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don’t have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don’t have? You don’t have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We’re trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."
