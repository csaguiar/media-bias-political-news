NBC News analysis declares Donald Trump the winner of first Democratic debate,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/donald-trump-winner-of-first-democratic-debate,"An NBC News analyst declared President Trump the winner of the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 election cycle.

Author and reporter Jonathan Allen expressed surprise that Trump emerged ""largely unscathed"" as the field of 10 candidates mostly avoided direct attacks on him.

Allen said the Democrats seemed more focused on positioning themselves furthest to the left to win over primary voters, rather than appealing to the swing voters that decided the 2016 election.

""For long stretches, it seemed, they completely forgot about the man who has been at the center of pretty much every discussion among Democrats for the last two-plus years — the man they're competing to take on next year. The obvious reason: The motivation to beat each other was, on this night, more urgent than defeating Trump — a life-or-death moment for some of their campaigns. Trump was the chief beneficiary of that dynamic,"" Allen wrote.

MSNBC HOSTS CLASH AFTER ONE SAYS NOBODY ON STAGE COULD BEAT TRUMP

He noted that after the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., argued that ignoring Trump was intentional because ""he’s an old show that people are getting tired of.”

Allen argued that by doing so, Democrats could allow Trump ""to exploit their divisions and position himself for re-election"" and ""he was one step closer to that after Wednesday's debate.""

The sentiment was shared by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, who said it was “a missed opportunity” for Democrats to not go after frontrunner Joe Biden or President Trump. Another MSNBC commentator, Donny Deutsch declared confidently after the debate that none of the 10 candidates on the stage could defeat Trump next year, including Warren.

Meantime, New York Post columnist John Podhoretz saw things similarly, taking particular issue with the candidates' far-left push on immigration. He said the candidates ""spent far more time talking about how they would help illegal immigrants than about how they would help the voters they most need to win over"" and that will benefit Trump.

""If I were Brad Parscale, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, I would be dancing a jig — because if this is the way the Democrats and the media want to discuss the economy and immigration, he is going to have a field day with the quotes they will generate from now until the election,"" he wrote."
Twitter says it will label tweets from Trump and other leaders that break its rules,https://www.cnn.com,"[""Donie O'Sullivan"", 'Cnn Business']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/tech/twitter-trump-rules/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Twitter plans to place a disclaimer on future tweets from world leaders that break its rules but which Twitter decides are in the ""public interest,"" the company said in a blog post Thursday.

This policy change could face its most prominent test in President Trump. Trump has repeatedly tested Twitter's community standards with his regular tirades on the platform and some of the president's tweets have run afoul of Twitter's rules.

has in the past allowed tweets from Trump and other world leaders to remain online, even though they broke the company's rules, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business, because it believes the tweets are in the public interest.

But putting a disclaimer on one of Trump's tweets would almost certainly bring a firestorm of criticism down on Twitter's head. Republicans in Washington, including Trump, often claim without real evidence that technology companies are biased against conservatives . Such a disclaimer on a Trump tweet, even if he had clearly violated Twitter's rules, would provoke a new cycle of such complaints at a time when Washington is increasingly investigating Big Tech over concerns about antitrust and privacy.

""This is not about perceived bias but about providing more clarity if our rules have been broken,"" a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business.

The disclaimer Twitter will place on tweets that break its rules but it decides to keep on the platform.

Asked by CNN Business, Twitter would not provide examples of tweets that it had previously kept up as being in the public interest despite rule violations.

The new feature will make clear when Twitter makes that call in the future.

""The Twitter Rules about abusive behavior apply to this Tweet,"" the disclaimer will read. ""However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain available.""

There are some exceptions, however. ""[D]irect threats of violence or calls to commit violence against an individual"" are ""unlikely to be considered in the public interest,"" Twitter said in the blog post.

Twitter said a ""cross-functional"" team, including representatives from its trust and safety, legal, and public policy teams will decide if a tweet is in the public interest.

The company provided a list of criteria that would inform this decision, including ""Whether preserving a Tweet will allow others to hold the government official, candidate for public office, or appointee accountable for their statements.""

""When a Tweet has this notice placed on it, it will feature less prominently on Twitter,"" the company said, adding that such tweets will not appear in Twitter's algorithmically generated ""Top Tweets,"" its live event pages, and some other features.

The new feature will apply to verified government officials, political candidates and people who are being considered for a government position and who have more than 100,000 followers, Twitter said."
"Why E. Jean Carroll, ‘the Anti-Victim,’ Spoke Up About Trump",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Jessica Bennett', 'Megan Twohey', 'Alexandra Alter']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/jean-carroll-trump-sexual-assault.html,"Ms. Carroll told two women that Donald Trump sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. The women went public for the first time with Megan Twohey, a New York Times reporter.

Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Annie Brown, Theo Balcomb, Luke Vander Ploeg and Eric Krupke, and edited by Lisa Tobin and Larissa Anderson

michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Last week, E. Jean Carroll came forward with the most serious allegation yet of sexual assault by the president. Today, the two women in whom she privately confided after the alleged attack go on the record for the first time with my colleague Megan Twohey. It’s Thursday, June 27. Can I ask you, Megan, are all your various phones on silent mode?

megan twohey Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on.

michael barbaro It’s so good to have you back.

megan twohey Oh, my goodness.

michael barbaro It’s been almost a — at least a year.

megan twohey Yeah. I think — I don’t think I’ve been on since the Weinstein story broke. I think I was actually wearing the same outfit.

michael barbaro Oh, actually, I think you were! I think you were, because I took a photograph of it.

megan twohey Oh, my God. I’ve been in, like, the book-leave, living-in-sweatpants mode.

michael barbaro [CHUCKLES] That sound okay?

megan twohey Yeah.

michael barbaro O.K.

megan twohey Sure.

michael barbaro Megan, can you take us back to last Friday, when New York magazine published an article about E. Jean Carroll?

megan twohey So, E. Jean Carroll is a longtime advice columnist for Elle magazine. And last Friday —

archived recording There is more breaking news tonight. In an interview published in the latest edition of New York magazine, a woman claims that President Trump assaulted her 23 years ago in an upscale New York City department store.

megan twohey She published what amounted to a rape allegation against Donald Trump.

archived recording Today, the president of the United States was accused of rape.

megan twohey She has a book that’s coming out on Tuesday, July 2. And this was sort of a condensed excerpt of a chapter in the book, in which she describes an encounter with Donald Trump at Bergdorf’s here in New York. The idea for this book came to her around 2017. As she tells it, she’s going to set off on a road trip across the country. She’s going to go to towns named after women, and she’s going to get out of her car in all of these towns and ask women, stop women on the streets and say, why do we need men? And basically, as soon as she’s hit the road, it’s October 2017, and the Harvey Weinstein story breaks. And —

michael barbaro Your story. The one you and Jodi Kantor wrote.

megan twohey Yes. So as E. Jean tells it, she is spending her days on the streets of these towns interviewing women about their experiences with men. And then at night, she’s going home and she’s fielding these — a flood of emails that are coming in to her advice column, all different types of women who are being sort of swept up into the #MeToo moment and are turning to her for advice. And so in this moment, she really kind of pauses and says, I think I have to have my own personal reckoning here before I can really wade into all of these messages that I’m getting, and all this sort of help that people are turning to me for. And so, for her, the sort of personal reckoning ended up in the form of a list that she called the “hideous men list.” She says that she suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a young boy when they were both children. She talks about an encounter with a camp counselor that she says groped her. She talks about an encounter that she had in college when somebody basically held a knife to her — a date ended up holding a knife to her. It kind of continues up into adulthood. Her first boss. And number 20 is Donald Trump. So the book sells, and it’s now scheduled to come out on July 2. And in the lead-up to that, there’s this excerpt that runs in New York magazine that I and many, many, many, many other people end up reading on Friday. And for me, one of the things that I was drawn to, that I immediately went to in this account, was —

archived recording Now, E. Jean Carroll never reported her alleged sexual assault to police. But she did tell two friends about it at the time, and those friends have confirmed that to New York magazine.

megan twohey She told two friends at the time of the alleged attack. They have not elaborated. They have not gone on the record. They have not revealed who they are. They have not shared their perspectives.

michael barbaro They have not told their stories.

megan twohey They have not told their stories. And here at The New York Times, I think there was agreement that if we could get these women to go on the record, to use their names, to tell us about their recollections of this particular moment in time, that it would help people assess the credibility of this very serious allegation against the president of the United States.

michael barbaro It might change how they view it.

megan twohey It’s just more information with which to assess this very serious allegation.

michael barbaro So what happens?

megan twohey So starting last weekend, I set about trying to convince these two women to sit down with me, and share their perspectives, and go on the record. And that involved phone calls, text messages. Both of them were pretty reluctant. They didn’t want to necessarily be pulled into the spotlight. But ultimately, today, on Wednesday, I finally had the opportunity to sit down with E. Jean and these two women that she had told her story to 20 years ago.

megan twohey Yeah. Well, thank you guys for your trust, and for this. I think it’s — I think it’s really important. I think it’s —

michael barbaro So how did this conversation start?

megan twohey Tell me a little bit about yourself, and you know, can you just sort of give me your full name and a little bit of your background, and how you guys met? carol martin Carol Martin, C-A-R-O-L-M-A-R-T-I-N. And I have been living in New York about 45 years, I think, now. It’s hard to believe. I came here in —

megan twohey So this conversation started really as kind of a trip down memory lane.

[music]

archived recording Wonderful studio audience today. Thanks, everybody, for being with us here on Martin Luther King Day.

megan twohey These are three women who’ve worked in the New York media world for decades. And —

e. jean carroll They gave you your own show. carol martin Yeah, well, also you, too, duh.

megan twohey One was a longtime TV anchor, Carol Martin.

archived recording Of course, we want to hear from you in the next hour. We’ve got some interesting topics, and you can probably —

megan twohey At the time of the alleged attack, she and E. Jean were both hosting shows on the same network.

archived recording Hi, E. Jean. How are you doing? archived recording (e. jean carroll) Hey man, that is a cool car.

megan twohey Carol Martin, she had a show, like, a health and wellness show. E. Jean had an advice show.

carol martin Your show, for all of us, anyway, was sort of the front runner. e. jean carroll And they let us do whatever we wanted. They just gave us these shows, it was nuts. megan twohey And did you guys hit it off right away? e. jean carroll Yeah, we did. carol martin But yeah, we did.

megan twohey The other woman, Lisa Birnbach —

lisa birnbach Mostly, I was a contributing editor of Parade.

megan twohey She’s an author. She wrote the “Preppy Handbook.”

lisa birnbach I wrote for everybody at least once or twice.

megan twohey She worked for a Spy magazine. She’s written pieces for all the glossy magazines.

lisa birnbach Remember her? She was on “Merv Griffin” all the time. She was the —

megan twohey So they just swapping stories of the people that they covered. And —

lisa birnbach — comedy writer. He wrote “The Dick Van Dyke Show.”

megan twohey — the circles that they moved in with TV writers, and other journalists. And —

carol martin You know, Chris Matthews had a show on there.

megan twohey They were just dropping names left and right.

e. jean carroll You came to his birthday party. carol martin Oh lord, thank you. Thank you. e. jean carroll 1987. carol martin This is all true.

megan twohey You almost felt like you were kind of stepping back in time.

carol martin It was a glorious experience, in its own way, that little patch of time. You know?

megan twohey When the New York media world was just kind of at its peak.

michael barbaro And if this is the heyday of the New York media world, we know that Donald Trump very much figures into it.

megan twohey He does. In fact, they all had Trump stories.

carol martin She actually did a story on Donald Trump. I didn’t know this.

megan twohey Lisa had actually written a story about Donald Trump in 1996.

lisa birnbach He did call me regularly. His assistant, Norma, would make the call, and say Donald Trump is on the phone. Are you still into it? Because I said it would be a cover story.

megan twohey She had gone down to Florida with him, and done a big story for New York magazine about Mar-a-Lago.

lisa birnbach I think my story is one of the reasons you thought to call me. e. jean carroll That is a high possibility. But I don’t remember it. I just called — that — you were the one.

megan twohey It really started to segue into the phone call that she had received from E. Jean that same year.

megan twohey — after, can you, I know you’ve discussed this before. But can you walk us through what happened this particular day? You were — had been at the studio where you and Carol worked. e. jean carroll Yes. And I wanted to shop for something. I can’t remember what it was. Drove across the George Washington Bridge, came up the West Side Highway, parked across the street from Bergdorf’s. Shopped for whatever it was, didn’t find it, because I didn’t have bags.

megan twohey So the conversation then takes a more serious turn, where E. Jean then starts walking us through, kind of beat by beat, what happened the moment of the alleged attack.

e. jean carroll Was on the point of leaving the 58th Street entrance. He was standing outside, and it was dark. So it must have been 6:30, maybe 7:00. He went like this when he saw me through the door. Like, stand there and stopped me. megan twohey Made a gesture? Like, held up his hand? e. jean carroll Yeah, held his hand like that. And he came through the door, and he said, you’re that advice lady. And I said, you’re that real estate mogul. He said, come advise me. I want to get a gift. I was like, this is charming. Oh, boy. I said yes. I asked him who it was for. He said, a girl. And I am just having such an engaging time, because I have Donald Trump in tow, and he is asking for my advice. I’m, like, thrilled that this is happening. megan twohey Why are you so thrilled? e. jean carroll Because it’s Donald Trump, and I’ve got — it’s a thing. It is a thing. It’s like — it’s just delicious, because he’s stopping. He asked me for my advice. It’s for a girl, right up my alley. I’m just thinking, this is it. And at that point he said, lingerie. Or maybe he said panties, he may have said underwear. But I had the impression, and we started to go up the escalator. We went to whatever floor the lingerie was on, and we walked in, there was a counter on the left. And there was nobody there. And there was a — it looked like a filmy, sort of see-through — great. And when he picked it up, I could see it was a bodysuit. He said, go put this on. I thought, you put it on! And then to see him really sort of — I’m thinking, this is terrific. This is terrific. carol martin It’s a little — e. jean carroll He says, it looks like it would fit you. I said no, it goes with your eyes. And he — there was a little bit of banter back and forth, which I was loving, and I was laughing, and he went like this towards the dressing room. And I’m thinking, I am actually laughing out loud, thinking, I’m going to make him put this bodysuit over his pants. That is the scheme. And I’m thinking, it’s going to be the funniest thing I have ever seen in my — I have got a picture in my head as we’re walking, him going like this and putting it on. That’s what I’m thinking. And we walk in the dressing room. I’m in front of it. I pass in front of him. He shuts the door, and just pushes me against the wall, boom. And kissed me. And I was continuing to laugh. And that’s when I started to push him back, and that’s when he started to lean forward. And that’s when he put his weight against me. And I must have started to stamp at this time. And he has two free hands, because his shoulder is here. megan twohey His shoulder is leaning into you? e. jean carroll Yeah. Holding me against the thing. And one of his hands went under in between the flaps my coat, and pulled down my tights, not off, but way down. And he ran his fingers around, looking. Anyway, whatever he was doing, he was looking for my vagina, I guess. And it hurt. And so it had to be with the other hand, as he held me, he unzipped his pants. Now, he could have unbuckled them, I don’t know. He could have unbuttoned them. But pretty soon, he had the tights down, his penis in this hand, and inserted it briefly. I don’t think it was all the way. I don’t. And it was not long. Let’s not put a time limit on it. I’m struggling. How long could it have been? Couldn’t be long. megan twohey And what did you do next? e. jean carroll I may have tried to hit him with my purse, I don’t know. I don’t know what I did with his hand. I have no idea. The thing I clearly remember is this. [STAMPING FEET] That’s what I clearly remember. megan twohey Trying to stomp his feet? e. jean carroll Well, I have to get my knee up to get him off. Right? I got this knee up, just slightly enough to back up. lisa birnbach Were you talking? Was he talking? e. jean carroll No, I didn’t say a word. Anyway. So push him up, backed up. And then I just went down, out. Either went in the escalator, or the elevator. I don’t know. Got to the ground floor.

megan twohey E. Jean describes running out of the department store onto the street.

e. jean carroll Went out through the building, got to Fifth Avenue, had my purse, because I picked up my phone.

megan twohey Reaching into her purse, picking up her phone, and calling Lisa.

megan twohey And Lisa, what do you remember about this moment? lisa birnbach Well, in 1996 —

megan twohey And that’s where Lisa’s account of that night begins.

[music]

michael barbaro We’ll be right back.

megan twohey Let’s start at the beginning. So you go out. You run out of the store. You stop. You reach into your purse. You pull out your phone. e. jean carroll That’s — yeah. megan twohey And you say, I’m going to call? e. jean carroll Lisa.

michael barbaro And what does Lisa say?

megan twohey Lisa is home. She’s on the Upper East Side.

lisa birnbach That would have been dinnertime for me.

megan twohey She’s home alone with her two children.

lisa birnbach I had a 6-year-old and a 3-year-old.

megan twohey And she says that at first, both women sort of describe this phone call starting with E. Jean laughing.

lisa birnbach She’s breathless, and laughing.

michael barbaro Why laughing?

e. jean carroll This is going to be the funniest thing I’ve ever thought up. This is hilarious. So I came out with this — I got to tell somebody. So I told Lisa.

megan twohey You know, she had adrenaline coursing through her body. She was just looking for a release from what had just happened. And in her mind, as she tells it, she’d gone into this exchange with Trump sort of seeing it as, like, good material. Like, a great story.

lisa birnbach I remember her saying repeatedly, he pulled down my tights.

megan twohey As Lisa tells it, she, at first, was laughing along.

lisa birnbach He pulled down my tights, which got me to think that was as far as it went.

megan twohey But as the story continued, she stopped laughing, and started to realize that what E. Jean was describing sounded to her like rape.

lisa birnbach Honestly, you did say, he put his penis in me. And I said — my face just did it. What? He raped you? And you said, eh. He kept pulling down — he pulled down my tights. He pulled down my tights.

megan twohey And Lisa was emphatic. She said what you’re describing is a rape, and you should go to the police.

lisa birnbach It just — it was horrible. We fought. And I said, let’s go to the police. No. Come to my house. No. I want to go home. I’ll take you to the police. No. It was 15 minutes of my life, it’s over. Don’t ever tell anybody. I just had to tell you.

megan twohey E. Jean, while, I think, at this point, had stopped laughing, was not seeing this within a criminal framework.

e. jean carroll It was an episode. It was an action. It was a fight. It was not a crime. It was, I had a struggle with a guy. lisa birnbach Well, you felt — e. jean carroll It’s happened to me before. lisa birnbach You felt you encouraged it, probably. e. jean carroll Oh, yeah. I know I did. I know I did. Oh, advise you? Fabulous. Lingerie? Great. The story, it was getting better and better. It was getting better and better. megan twohey So you felt responsibility for what had happened? e. jean carroll 100 percent.

michael barbaro So what does E. Jean do after getting off the phone with Lisa?

megan twohey As she tells it, she drove home.

e. jean carroll I had a big yellow Cadillac convertible, gorgeous, 1964. And I drove home.

megan twohey And crawled into bed.

michael barbaro And at what point does she tell her other friend, Carol, about this experience?

megan twohey So they can’t be sure of the exact timing of that conversation. E. Jean has described it as, like, between one and three days after the alleged attack.

e. jean carroll We sat in the kitchen. carol martin We sat in the kitchen, that I remember.

michael barbaro And what is the conversation?

carol martin From what I could sense of you, you were, A, you were handling it, as you handle things. She doesn’t break down easily on anything. And there was none of that, as you told me. It wasn’t like she started crying, or nothing that was a frantic kind of response to it. It was like, I can’t believe this happened.

megan twohey As they tell it at that point, E. Jean is not laughing anymore about this. And she’s piecing it together. It’s kind of slowly sinking in what she’s describing. And Carol ultimately had a different response than Lisa.

carol martin I said, don’t tell anybody. I wouldn’t tell anybody this.

megan twohey Her instinct was to say, listen, Donald Trump is a powerful man. He’s got numerous lawyers. I would not tell anybody about this.

michael barbaro And whose advice does E. Jean take?

megan twohey As they tell it, after these two separate conversations, these women never spoke of the alleged attack again. They kind of went on with their lives and their friendships. And even during the presidential race, when these women were coming forward, and the “Access Hollywood” tape is coming out, as she tells it, she does not feel compelled to talk about this either publicly, or even privately.

megan twohey I mean, a question would be why you chose not to say something in 2016? e. jean carroll Shocking as it sounds, I thought it would help him. And shocking as it sounds, I was correct. megan twohey Why did you think it would help him, the women coming forward with allegations of groping? e. jean carroll Because it is a masculine, powerful, leader-like thing to do to take what you want, to have as many women for your own pleasure as you can take.

michael barbaro So for 20 years, E. Jean does not talk about this allegation, with either of these two friends, who she told right away, or with the public. Not through the campaign, not after the campaign. Just now, in a book form. I wonder if that’s raising some skepticism because she is now selling a book.

megan twohey Sure. I think people are entitled to skepticism. But I think that if you sort of step back and dissect this a little bit more, you’re looking at somebody who got, as we understand it, a very modest advance for this book. I don’t think that the people who are involved in it were expecting it to be a big seller. Otherwise, they probably would have paid her more money. This is not, like, a tell-all book about her experience with Trump. Her account of this alleged attack takes place within a sort of 11-page chapter in a book that weaves together the stories of many men she’s encountered over the years, and the voices of other women. And she also, if this was designed to be a big, public, hard swing against the president, it was packaged in a really unconventional way. Because for all of this kind of vivid description that she provides of this alleged attack, she doesn’t call it rape.

megan twohey It is pretty well established, at least under criminal law, that forced penetration without consent is considered rape. And yet you yourself, even all these many years later, after you’ve chosen to finally come forward with this account of what happened, and write about it in your book, that you yourself have not used the term that Lisa used back in ‘96, when she first heard your story. That you, even now, will not describe it, or don’t consider it rape? Or — e. jean carroll Every woman gets to choose her word. Every woman gets to choose how she describes it. This is my way of saying it. This is my word. My word is fight. My word is not the victim word. I am not — I have not been raped. Something has not been done to me. I fought. That’s the thing. It’s —

megan twohey So I actually really tried to press her on this.

megan twohey In addition to sort of writing a good book and having your own personal reckoning over these incidents that you’ve experienced, was there a broader reason now to put this, specifically this allegation against Trump out into the world, at this moment in time? Did you have any intention — any other intentions, in terms of going public with this particular account at this particular moment in time? Do you want or expect it to have an impact? And if so, what would that be? e. jean carroll I had no expectations. None. I’ve learned as a woman of 76 years to have absolutely no expectations. Because if you have even a half an expectation, you will be disappointed. So I have no expectation.

[music]

michael barbaro Megan, I’ve been thinking as you’ve been talking about another woman who came forward just before the 2016 election with an allegation against the president, Jessica Leeds. You and I ended up both meeting her in our reporting in 2016. And I wonder if you’ve also been thinking about her, too, in relation to this story.

megan twohey She was one of the first people who came to mind, and she actually sent me an email this week because she’s tracked the various allegations that have come out since she went on the record, in a story in The New York Times with us. And it’s interesting. I heard echoes of Jessica Leeds in my conversations with E. Jean. She and E. Jean Carroll are around the same age. I mean, their stories are different. Jessica Leeds describes a moment when she happened to sit next to Donald Trump on an airplane, and him reaching over, and as she tells it, groping her during the course of the flight. But you can hear echoes in the way that they talk about these encounters. These two women, being working women of an earlier era, and which, as they’ve described it, their encounters with Trump were among many encounters of bad behavior that they experienced at the hands of men.

e. jean carroll For somebody who was born during World War II, I don’t think it’s that unusual.

megan twohey Just kind of being out in the world, and that their encounters with Trump, they didn’t forget them, but they kind of got woven into the fabric and experience of being a working woman out in the world in these earlier years.

e. jean carroll If you think all the men that a woman can encounter in 76 years on a planet that has men everywhere, and when you think of all the men who grab you, pinch you, pummel you, throw you down, roger you, the amazing fact about the book is that there are 21. And the surprising thing is that there are not double or triple that.

megan twohey And yet, if you look at what E. Jean is describing, this is by far the most serious allegation that’s been made against the president ever.

megan twohey So I know that the way that you describe this, the sort of clever idea for getting rid of men is a clever idea, in many ways a clever story. Is there something about this particular book, and these particular allegations, at this particular moment, that go beyond a good story? Or do you still see it in the context of that? e. jean carroll I see it in the context. I had this list. You dropped the Weinstein bomb, and the memories started coming back. I hadn’t remembered being raped as a five-year-old girl until this trip. I hadn’t remembered the babysitter. And boy, when I got this list, that list just took over the book. It just took over the book, and I was driven to get this book down. He was just a part of that. Just a part. O.K. A big, golden, shiny part, but just a part.

[music]

michael barbaro Megan, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

megan twohey Thanks so much for having me.

michael barbaro Later today, Megan Twohey and our colleagues Jessica Bennett and Alexandra Alter will be publishing a profile of E. Jean Carroll and her allegation against the president. We’ll be right back.

[music]

michael barbaro Here’s what else you need to know today.

‘It makes me angry’: Tillerson vents frustrations with Kushner,https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/tillerson-kushner-exit-interview-1385305,"Alex Wong/Getty Images Foreign Policy ‘It makes me angry’: Tillerson vents frustrations with Kushner In a six-hour conversation with Capitol Hill aides, Rex Tillerson recounted his rocky tenure at the State Department.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was having dinner at a local restaurant when the owner came over to tell him that Mexico’s foreign secretary happened to be eating at the same place. Would he like to say hello?

Tillerson was surprised, he recently recounted to congressional aides, because he hadn’t been informed that his Mexican counterpart, Luis Videgaray Caso, was in Washington, D.C. He walked over to find that Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, was dining with the foreign diplomat.

Story Continued Below

“I could see the color go out of the face of the foreign secretary of Mexico as I very — I smiled big, and I said: ‘Welcome to Washington,’” Tillerson told the staffers. “And I said: ‘I don’t want to interrupt what y’all are doing.’ I said: ‘Give me a call next time you’re coming to town.’ And I left it at that.”

According to Tillerson, the Mexican diplomat had thought that the secretary of State was fully aware that he was meeting with Kushner. Apparently, however, Kushner hadn’t looped in the State Department.

The anecdote was one of the most vivid that Tillerson shared with bipartisan representatives of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on May 21, according to a partially redacted transcript of the private conversation released Thursday.

The former secretary of State, whom Trump fired in March 2018 after just 14 months on the job, painted a portrait of a presidential administration lacking in internal coordination and cohesion. The discussion touched on everything from Tillerson’s struggle to convince the White House to let him hire people, to his “realist” view of human rights. Tillerson frequently answered questions by saying he couldn’t recall, but overall it was his most extensive personal account to date of his time spent as America’s chief diplomat.

The conversation — which lasted more than six hours, including breaks — occurred with committee staffers. Tillerson also met for about 90 minutes with House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel and ranking member Rep. Mike McCaul. That conversation was not included in the transcript.

Some snippets of the conversation already have been reported, such as Tillerson’s comments that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had out-prepared Trump for meetings, and whether the Russians had manipulated Trump and Tillerson in such sessions. Those earlier reports infuriated Trump, who lashed out on Twitter, calling Tillerson “dumb as a rock.”

Tillerson spoke very cautiously about Trump himself, avoiding direct criticism. But he effectively confirmed past reports of his tensions with Kushner. He expressed disdain, even anger, toward Kushner and his peripatetic role in crafting U.S. foreign policy, especially when he wouldn’t coordinate with the State Department.

From the start, it was unclear what role Kushner as well his wife, Ivanka — Trump’s daughter — would play in policy making, Tillerson said. That “made it challenging for everyone, I think, in terms of how to deal with any activities that might be undertaken by others that were not defined within the national security process itself,” he said.

Kushner, who has pitched in on everything from U.S. trade policy with Mexico to trying to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, would sometimes travel abroad and not coordinate with the U.S. Embassy where he was going. Tillerson said he raised such issues with Kushner, who promised to “do better.”

“Not much changed,” Tillerson said.

Kushner’s relationship with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates at times hampered Tillerson’s ability to calm tensions in the Middle East, the former diplomat indicated. That was especially the case in June 2017, when those and other Arab countries decided to sever diplomatic ties with Qatar, a tiny, wealthy Arab state home to a key U.S. military facility.

The moves against Qatar, which eventually bloomed into a full-on economic blockade, surprised Tillerson and other top U.S. officials. But committee staffers told Tillerson they’d been informed that the Saudis and the Emiratis had laid out their plans for Qatar to Kushner and another Trump aide, Steve Bannon, at a dinner weeks earlier, on May 20, 2017.

Tillerson said he’d not heard about that dinner until the committee staffers told him. When asked how that felt, he said: “It makes me angry … because I didn’t have a say. The State Department’s views were never expressed.”

On Russia, Tillerson said he agreed with Trump’s general view that the U.S. needed to improve its relationship with Moscow, and that he tried to convey the need for Moscow and Washington to find some common ground when he met with Putin and other Russian officials.

Although he avoided delving into details about those conversations, and often said he didn’t remember much of what happened, Tillerson insisted that he was up front with Putin about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, which he said he stated as a fact.

“There were a list of obstacles we went through; but, yes, the election interference was specifically mentioned as creating huge challenges for us here in Washington,” he said, adding later: “I said it just has to stop.”

Putin denied the interference had occurred, Tillerson said.

Tillerson said the White House did not tell him in advance how to frame that issue. Asked about Trump’s general knowledge of Russia, Tillerson said “he was having to learn along the way.”

The former secretary of State also said he did not remember an incident recounted in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

While Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia, his lengthy report said Kushner gave Tillerson a copy of a plan for U.S.-Russian reconciliation that had been authored in part by Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.

“I don’t recall ever receiving any such report as described in the Mueller report or any other,” Tillerson said.

Tillerson stood by his past description of Trump as “a man who is pretty undisciplined, doesn’t like to read things, doesn’t read briefing reports, doesn’t like to get into the details of lots of things.” Trump also often had a pre-set stance on issues, and he indicated to aides that they would have to convince him he was wrong but that they were not likely to succeed, Tillerson said.

The former diplomat said he wasn’t speaking pejoratively of Trump when he described him in such a manner, but that he realized he had to adjust to the president’s “style.”

That meant being extremely concise in presenting information to Trump. Still, it “never deterred me or anyone at the State Department, to my knowledge, from putting forth the best view we thought we could put together,” he said.

Tillerson also clarified earlier public comments he’d made about how Trump would often seek solutions to policy problems that were legally problematic.

“The president never asked me to violate the law,” he told the committee representatives, adding that Trump was simply on a steep learning curve. “He was very action oriented: Get it done, get it done, get it done. And so just sometimes you had to say: ‘We can’t do that.’”

Trump never referred to his personal or family business in relation to foreign policy, nor did he give indications that those were factors in his thinking on such matters, Tillerson said. He answered several questions about other characters in the Trump orbit whose business activities and overseas links have raised suspicions, such as Elliott Broidy, by saying he didn’t know them.

The former secretary repeatedly sidestepped questions about Trump’s apparent affinity for authoritarian leaders such as Putin. He also declined to discuss reports that he’d once called Trump a “moron” behind his back. He’s never denied doing so, however.

Pressed on why the Trump administration seemed often absent on promoting human rights and democracy, Tillerson argued that it really acted no differently that previous presidential administration. He described himself as a “realist” on human rights — he believes in their importance but doesn’t think harping on the topic always advances the cause long-term.

“Sometimes going in and just pounding the table over that issue, [other countries] just shut down. They just ignore you. They say ‘Just go away. You are of no use to me,’” he said.

Asked if he could describe Trump’s value system, Tillerson said “No, I can’t.” One of his lawyers then shifted the conversation away from further questioning on that point.

A State Department lawyer was present during the interview with the House committee staffers — the department requested a presence and Tillerson said he was amenable to the idea. Tillerson brought at least two attorneys of his own. The committee’s lawyers noted that he was required by law to answer the questions truthfully. The redacted portions of the transcript were done so at either State or Tillerson's request.

Engel, the committee chairman, has previously described Tillerson’s meeting with him and McCaul as “heartening” given Trump’s efforts to prevent other aides and former aides from talking to lawmakers trying to investigate the president.

Tillerson told the committee representatives that he had been looking forward to retiring from ExxonMobil and spending time with his grandchildren when Trump offered him the chance to serve as secretary of State. He met with Trump about the role after initially ignoring calls from the then-president-elect’s transition staffers in the weeks after the 2016 election.

He agreed to see Trump only hearing from Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect. “I said: ‘Well, I will take that call,’” Tillerson told the committee. Pence told him that, because of his relationships with many heads of state due to his role at ExxonMobil, Trump wanted to talk to him about global affairs.

Tillerson, who had met with past presidents to talk about such issues, agreed to meet Trump if he could do so discreetly. He refused to go “through the gold-gilded lobby of the Trump Tower because that was the revolving door of everybody that was interviewing for a job. … So I went up through a residential entrance.”

Kushner and two other Trump aides, Bannon and Reince Priebus, sat in on Tillerson’s meeting with Trump, which he recalled as being in early December 2016. During the session, Tillerson walked Trump through major world regions and spoke about U.S. challenges in each.

One example he mentioned raising with Trump was the effect international sanctions on Russia — he appeared to be alluding to penalties imposed after Moscow invaded Ukraine — were having on other countries who did business there.

“We talked about the challenges that had been created by the Russian sanctions for the Europeans because it was — it had had a greater effect on them than it had on most American businesses,” he said.

Neither Trump nor the president-elect’s aides asked many questions during the meeting, Tillerson said. But in the latter stages, Trump “went into a bit of a sales pitch and asked me to be the secretary of State, and I was stunned.”

Tillerson indicated that he had thought Trump had other people in mind for the role. He asked Trump for a few days to talk to ExxonMobil and his family, and before agreeing to take the job, he met with Trump again in person to ask three questions. He declined to tell the committee representatives what those questions or Trump’s answers were, however.

Tillerson had a rocky tenure at State. He disagreed with Trump on major issues, such as how to deal with Iran. Tillerson also alienated many U.S. diplomats by shutting them out of the decision-making process, imposing a hiring freeze and trying to push through a redesign of the department.

Tillerson said he grew frustrated with the White House for blocking him from naming certain people to top spots at State for reasons he felt were not satisfactory. He had thought he’d had more freedom to pick his aides. But months went on and numerous positions were left open.

“If people signed the ‘Never Trump’ letter, that would oftentimes disqualify them,” he recalled. “If they had tweeted something or retweeted something that the White House office thought was inappropriate, then that might disqualify them. If they had a spouse that might have supported the other candidate, that would disqualify them.”

The process “never did work smoothly,” he said.

He also said he tried to prevent the White House from proposing massive cuts to the State Department’s budget, although he said that he would have liked to see some significant budget reductions because he thought the existing spending was too bloated.

Asked about his attempt to redesign the State Department, Tillerson said the biggest obstacle to the largely unsuccessful effort were older, senior-level staffers who “don’t want anybody moving their cheese.” Tillerson also said it was his decision to dramatically reduce media access to the department, including cutting down the number of press briefings.

Tillerson told his interviewers that he was grateful to Trump for the opportunity to serve as secretary of State, and he repeatedly praised the career diplomats who work at State. He also sounded a note of modesty.

“In retrospect, the experience was both humbling and inspiring, and it will always be the great honor of my life,” he said."
New leaders installed at top immigration agencies amid questions over DHS secretary’s future,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-leaders-installed-at-top-immigration-agencies-amid-questions-over-dhs-secretarys-future,"The Trump administration named new leaders Thursday to top immigration agencies amid a deepening crisis at the border -- and swirling speculation over the future of the Homeland Security secretary who oversees it all after he was accused of leaking a highly sensitive operation.

Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday announced that Mark Morgan, who was serving as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be shifted over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to replace former Commissioner John Sanders, who abruptly resigned from his post this week. ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence was tapped to replace Morgan at that agency.

But bigger questions now surround McAleenan himself.

Two senior administration officials told Fox News that high-level discussions were underway with top administration and White House officials regarding McAleenan’s future in light of the accusations against him -- which the secretary strongly denies. The officials said there is uncertainty as to how much longer the secretary could remain in his post.

A White House official declined to comment on these claims when asked by Fox News.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

McAleenan had come under fire after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

One senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday that after the alleged leak, ""He’s lost the confidence and trust of both the workforce and his superiors, with no viable path to proceed with any confidence and credibility.""

The official lamented the state of morale at the department, saying: “DHS has devolved into chaos and employee morale is abysmal.”

Another senior administration official also told Fox News Thursday that McAleenan has “completely lost his credibility leading the Department.”

“I can’t imagine the White House has an interest in keeping him in place much longer when they know he opposes most of their immigration policies,” the official said.

McAleenan, though, has adamantly denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

Meanwhile, one of the officials told Fox News that McAleenan spent several days in Guatemala this week for multilateral meetings with Central American allies, while other top administration officials negotiated on Capitol Hill for additional funding for the agencies as part of a major piece of legislation -- which has not yet cleared Congress.

The official told Fox News that “support for a spending package vital to the department coalesced, was debated, and voted on in his absence.” That official also said that McAleenan has been “cut out of the process.”

Another administration official noted that McAleenan was slated to host a press conference on Thursday afternoon on the supplemental spending bill. “It’s interesting that he is standing alone. This is him trying to save his job, and taking a victory lap on the supplemental bill when he has been absent for the last few days.”

The event, though, was later canceled."
‘Angry’ Rex Tillerson Says Jared Kushner Hijacked U.S. Foreign Policy,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'Asawin Suebsaeng', 'National Security Reporter', 'White House Reporter']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/rex-tillerson-jared-kushner-hijacked-us-foreign-policy-angry-former-secretary-of-state-says?source=articles&via=rss,"Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson claims the State Department was kept in the dark about key U.S. foreign-policy decisions during his time in the Trump administration because the president’s son-in-law had effectively set up his own shadow operation.

Jared Kushner was privately working on strategic partnerships with foreign countries and meeting discreetly with world leaders outside the formal structures of the U.S. government, according to Tillerson, who told the House Foreign Affairs Committee behind closed doors last month that he was left “angry” by one situation in particular. Because Kushner at times went around Tillerson and his staff, the State Department was not able to efficiently manage U.S. diplomacy.

A transcript of the interview obtained by The Daily Beast covers his time working with President Trump and his views on how the administration approached its relationships with officials in countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia.

In one extended portion of the interview, Tillerson was grilled by committee staff about his strained professional relationship with Kushner, Trump’s senior White House adviser. At several points, Trump’s ousted secretary of state vented his frustrations with being repeatedly undercut and left in the dark by Ivanka’s husband.

“One of the challenges I think that everyone had… to learn to deal with was the role, the unique situation with the president’s son-in-law [Kushner] and daughter [Ivanka] being part of the White House advisory team,” Tillerson said, according to the transcript The Daily Beast obtained. “There was not a real clear understanding of the role, responsibilities, authorities… which made it challenging for everyone, I think, in terms of how to deal with activities that might be undertaken by others that were not defined within the national-security process itself.”

When asked for comment on this story, a senior State Department official told The Daily Beast: “Secretary Pompeo and Mr. Kushner have a strong working relationship and coordinate quite closely.”

A representative for Tillerson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

When asked if there was a particularly memorable example of getting caught off-guard by one of Kushner’s secret meetings or conversations, Tillerson recalled that “Mexico was a situation that occurred on a number of occasions.”

The former chairman and CEO of Exxon said that on one ludicrous occasion he had bumped into his Mexican counterpart in Washington, D.C. purely by chance—when the official had come to see Kushner without even informing the State Department that he was in the country.

“The [Mexican] foreign secretary came to town—unbeknownst to me—and I happened to be having a business dinner at a restaurant in town,” Tillerson said. “And the owner of the restaurant, proprietor of the restaurant, came around and said, ‘Oh, Mr. Secretary, you might be interested to know the foreign secretary of Mexico is seated at a table near the back and in case you want to go by and say hello to him.’ Very innocent on his part.”

So, Tillerson said, he walked over to the table to meet a stunned foreign secretary.

“I could see the color go out of the face of the foreign secretary of Mexico as I very—I smiled big, and I said, ‘Welcome to Washington,’ and I said, ‘I don’t want to interrupt what y’all are doing.’ I said, ‘Give me a call next time you’re coming to town. And I left it at that,” he said.

“ I could see the color go out of the face of the foreign secretary of Mexico as I very—I smiled big, and I said, ‘Welcome to Washington,’ and I said, ‘I don’t want to interrupt what y’all are doing. ” — Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state

According to Tillerson, the Mexican foreign secretary told him he was “operating on the assumption that everything he was talking to Mr. Kushner about had been run through the State Department and that I was fully on board with it.”

Tillerson said the senior official was “rather shocked” to discover that Kushner was essentially running his own shadow State Department.

“Jared and the WH were coordinating with the State Department, the problem is that Rex Tillerson couldn’t figure out how to coordinate with the State Department,” an administration official said.

The confusion about Kushner’s role began right from the start of Tillerson’s time in government. The former secretary of state said that when he entered office, he knew the president’s son-in-law was a senior adviser to the president but that “no one really described what he was going to be doing.”

This disconnect even continued during major international crises. In the congressional interview, it emerged that Kushner had failed to inform Tillerson and his staff at State that the Gulf Cooperation Council was starting a blockade of Qatar in the spring of 2017.

“ At the time, I think both Secretary Mattis and I both felt… that someone would have called us and told us. ” — Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state

Tillerson told committee staff that even though he had forged close relationships with officials in the Middle East, he was unaware of the plans for the blockade. “I was surprised,” Tillerson said, adding that he only learned of the news when his adviser passed him a note during a meeting in Australia, which also included former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.

“Someone slipped me a message, and it just was a very short note… and I slipped it to Secretary Mattis,” Tillerson said. “We waited for the next scheduled break and then we went out and made some calls to find out what was going on. At the time, I think both Secretary Mattis and I both felt… that someone would have called us and told us.”

Tillerson told the panel that he was forced to manage the fallout of the blockade, working overtime to ask all parties to refrain from escalating tensions. At the same time, though, he said, he was keep tensions in neutral while blindsided. “I didn’t have enough information to know if something had really set this off or an event that hadn’t been reported,” he said.

At one point during the interview, congressional committee staff alerted Tillerson that they had since learned of a private dinner, between Kushner and former Chief of Staff Steve Bannon in which plans of the blockade were communicated to them. The dinner, according to the committee, took place just before a meeting between GCC in May 2017.

Asked of his reaction: “It makes me angry,” Tillerson said. “I didn’t have a say. The State Department’s views were never expressed.”

“The president and I had many conversations about the allegations that were being made about Qatar and how to substantiate those allegations,” Tillerson said. “And because my own early assessment was... I understood what was behind the allegation, but the characterization of it and the actual actions that were behind it were very different from what had been said to others, to the president in particular.”

Tillerson said he understood Kushner’s position was that “the blockading countries had... a good reason to do what they were doing.”

It wasn’t just the Qatar crisis that showed the State Department’s difficulty in maintaining control on foreign policy. Tillerson also said Kushner’s relationship with Saudi Arabia created anxiety within the agency.

According to Tillerson, Kushner worked on a “comprehensive document” with the Saudis in the leadup to President Trump’s visit to the kingdom in the spring of 2017. The economic and defense roadmap laid out a plan for a strategic relationship between Washington and Riyadh, according to Tillerson. The former secretary said he was not originally aware that Kushner and his Saudi counterparts had been working on the joint project.

“As I understood it, Mr. Kushner had started working on sometime back… with the president’s knowledge, and it was all kind of... supposed to culminate in this trip by the president,” Tillerson said, referencing the president’s visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017.

Kushner went on to meet with his Saudi counterparts, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, several times in Riyadh.

“On occasion the president’s senior adviser would make trips abroad and usually, you know, kind of was in charge of his own agenda,” Tillerson said, referring to Kushner. “And typically not a lot of coordination with the embassy.”

The Daily Beast previously reported that American embassy staffers in Saudi Arabia have grown increasingly frustrated with Kushner and his team during their visits to the kingdom, claiming that on a recent visit they did not include them in their meetings with the Saudi royal court.

Tillerson said during his interview with congressional staffers that he raised the issue of the White House going around the State Department on these visits with Kushner during his time in the administration. “He [Kushner] said he would try to do better,” Tillerson said. But ultimately, the former secretary of state said, “not much changed.”"
"VA ordered fake appointments to cut waiting list, whistleblower says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues', 'June At Am']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-va-ordered-fake-appointments-to-cut-waiting-list/2019/06/26/97e50648-9856-11e9-a027-c571fd3d394d_story.html,"Columnist

One day before Minu Aghevli testified at a House committee hearing about official Department of Veterans Affairs misconduct, she received a thick packet of documents that shook her life.

It amounted to a pink slip more than 170 pages long, including about 140 pages outlining reasons VA plans to fire her, according to Kevin Owen, her lawyer. The packet arrived on Monday. She testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli, 42, is a District native who has spent her entire 20-year career with VA. She is a clinical psychologist with a department opioid treatment program in Baltimore.

But the moniker that matters now for her is VA whistleblower. Aghevli has made disclosures that she said led department officials to dismiss her, despite her Gold VA Pins for excellent customer service.

Aghevli’s allegations are serious. They include phony-wait-list assertions of the type that have bedeviled VA since it was consumed by a scandal that broke in 2014. She also accused department officials of lying to Congress.

“In order to reduce the wait list, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic wait list by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,” she told the House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations. “This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits. . . . The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.” Aghevli said she protested and did not do as instructed.

Other actions to seemingly reduce the number of veterans awaiting care, she said, included coding indigent patients as “care no longer needed” without confirming that.

When lawmakers demanded information about VA wait lists in September 2015, she said, “the VA deliberately sent these incorrect numbers to Congress.”

A VA statement said Aghevli’s proposed firing “is in no way related to any whistleblower activity. Rather, it is due to a number of serious clinical practice allegations against the employee.”

The Office of Special Counsel has moved to block Aghevli’ s firing while it reviews her case. This special counsel protects federal whistleblowers and is not related a better-known special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who led a probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.

Aghevli is not alone in making recent allegations about VA misconduct. At the House Veterans’ Affairs oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing, Chairman Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) said the panel is investigating secret-wait-list charges made in a Federal Insider column last month by Jereme Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management.

Only whistleblowers and their advocates testified at the hearing. Pappas said VA officials would be invited to a later session.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie in a letter to the panel expressed disappointment that officials were not included this week. “When the committee holds a hearing to air criticisms of the Department, while simultaneously preventing the Department from participating to offer context and defend itself,” he wrote, “the Committee’s efforts risk appearing more like a political news conference than a hearing aimed at a balanced look at serious issues.”

Jeffery Dettbarn, an Iowa City VA Medical Center employee, said he had an “unblemished record before blowing the whistle on the improper mass cancellation of what turned out to be tens of thousands of radiology orders.”

The retaliation against him, he said, is a “banishment” from patient care as a radiologic technologist that began in July 2017 and continues. “My current situation is unbearable. . . . I am forced to forgo about one-third of my salary” because he no longer gets on-call pay. “But worst of all,” he added, “the VA won’t let me care for veterans.”

Dettbarn said VA has attempted to fire him and also filed “bogus complaints to my licensing agencies. . . . All these allegations were unfounded, but these attacks are incredibly damaging and threaten my professional livelihood.”

VA said complaints about his clinical performance were raised by other VA whistleblowers and the decision regarding his disciplinary action was made before his disclosures.

Charges like these led Tom Devine, legal director of the advocacy group Government Accountability Project, to tell the panel that VA “remains a free-speech Death Valley for government witnesses. . . . Retaliation is ingrained in the culture” of the department. Forty percent of the 25 whistleblowers he represents are VA clients, he said, “an extraordinary number for an agency that comprises less than 20 percent of the executive branch workforce.”

A a department statement said “there is no other agency in the federal government that puts more of a focus on the importance of protecting whistleblowers.”

Aghevli said the retaliation against her caused episodes of severe panic and prolonged tachycardia, an abnormally rapid heart rate. She is on medical leave. Testifying for the first time before Congress was nerve wracking. “I felt both horrified and heartbroken, but also relieved,” she said, to have told her story.

Getting a notice of proposed termination the day before her testimony, when she told her office about it weeks before, was “deliberately intimidating towards me,” she said in an interview, and an effort to frighten other whistleblowers.

Aghevli said she was removed from patient care in April, a few weeks after her complaint about a patient safety issue. She is eager to return to “my veterans.”

“I love my job and the veterans that I treat,” she told the subcommittee. “I can’t imagine any job I’d rather do.”

She might have to start thinking about that. VA doesn’t want her anymore.

"In New Turf War, Treasury Dept. Seeks Control of Secret Service",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/secret-service-treasury.html,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is seeking to wrest control of the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security and has been lobbying President Trump to back such a move, according to administration officials.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

"U.S. Supreme Court rules against Argus Leader, says some government spending not subject to open records laws",https://www.inforum.com,['Sarah Mearhoff'],,,,https://www.inforum.com/news/government-and-politics/2728060-U.S.-Supreme-Court-rules-against-Argus-Leader-says-some-government-spending-not-subject-to-open-records-laws,"RAPID CITY, S.D. — In a blow to South Dakota's largest newspaper and investigative journalists, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that some ""confidential"" information about Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program redemption is not subject to open records laws.

The court on Monday, June 24, issued its 6-3 majority opinion in favor of the Food Marketing Institute, a trade group representing food retailers, wholesalers and marketers. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the majority opinion, and Justice Stephen Breyer the dissenting.

The case began when the Sioux Falls Argus Leader in 2011 filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the names and addresses of area food retail stores that participate in SNAP and the stores' annual SNAP redemption data between 2005 and 2010. In an April editorial, the Argus Leader said they were ""probing issues of potential food stamp fraud while also examining rural communities’ access to affordable and nutritious food.""

The USDA denied the request, citing FOIA's Exemption 4, which is meant to protect “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,"" according to Gorsuch's ruling.

The Argus Leader sued in pursuit of the information, arguing that SNAP is a public program funded by tax dollars, and its financials are of public interest. Gorsuch wrote that lawyers representing the USDA argued that disclosing store-level SNAP data would ""threaten stores’ competitive positions"" because such data is used ""help choose new store locations and to plan sales strategies.""

After a district court sided with the Argus Leader, the Food Marketing Institute intervened, appealing several decisions in favor of the newspaper, up to the nation's highest court.

Gorsuch wrote in Monday's majority opinion that, ""At least where commercial or financial information is both customarily and actually treated as private by its owner and provided to the government under an assurance of privacy, the information (requested by the Argus Leader) is 'confidential' within the meaning of Exemption 4.""

Joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, Breyer authored the dissenting opinion, writing that ""the whole point of FOIA is to give the public access to information it cannot otherwise obtain.""

""Given the temptation, common across the private and public sectors, to regard as secret all information that need not be disclosed, I fear the majority's reading will deprive the public of information for reasons no better than convenience, skittishness, or bureaucratic inertia,"" Breyer wrote.

In its April editorial, the Argus Leader wrote that, ""a ruling for FMI would mean a drastic narrowing of information that is currently available to the public.""

""We see this publicly funded process as clearly in need of sunlight,"" the paper said."
Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/736290295/top-clean-air-official-plans-to-step-down-from-epa-post-amid-ethics-probe,"Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty Images Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty Images

Bill Wehrum is stepping down as the Environmental Protection Agency's chief air quality official at the end of the month, amid mounting scrutiny over possible ethics violations.

EPA Administrator Andrew Andrew Wheeler said Wednesday that Wehrum's departure as the head of the agency's Office of Air and Radiation is both voluntary and expected.

""While I have known of Bill's desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,"" Wheeler said in a statement.

Wehrum was confirmed to the EPA post in November of 2017. Since then, he has been regarded as the architect of some of the Trump administration's most controversial climate policies, overseeing efforts to roll back regulations that limit air pollution. One casualty was the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which just last week was replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy regulation — new rules that allow more greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

""I applaud Bill and his team for finalizing the Affordable Clean Energy regulation last week and for the tremendous progress he has made in so many other regulatory initiatives,"" Wheeler said.

Wehrum also crafted a proposal that would weaken future fuel economy standards for cars and trucks.

""Bill Wehrum oversaw the most relentless rollback of clean air, climate and health safeguards in EPA's history,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council's John Walke, who is the clean air director of the group's climate and clean energy program. He called on the agency to ""return to its mission to protect Americans' health and air quality, and take strong climate action.""

Allegations of ethical violations dogged Wehrum throughout his EPA tenure, related to his former work as a lawyer and lobbyist for a number of the same companies the agency regulates — including some of the country's largest coal, oil and petrochemical companies.

Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched a probe into Wehrum's conduct in April, seeking to find out if he or his deputy, fellow former lobbyist David Harlow, may have loosened air pollution rules to help their former clients in the energy sector.

In a letter to eight utility companies and Wehrum's former lobbying firm, House Democrats on the Energy Committee said they were concerned that ""the Office of Air and Radiation's agenda appears remarkably similar to the substantive agenda"" of the firm's utilities clients. They added, ""These allegations have raised substantial questions regarding whether Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow are properly carrying out the [Clean Air Act] as directed by Congress or instead changing agency policies to benefit former clients.""

Wehrum is the latest Trump administration official to leave the environmental agency under a cloud of scrutiny. Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who resigned after reports that he misused his power and spent far more taxpayer money than his predecessors had on travel and security expenses.

With Wehrum's exit, his deputy, Anne Idsal, will take over his responsibilities."
Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign,https://www.politico.com,"['Ted Hesson', 'Nancy Cook']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/26/dhs-chief-immigration-1557047,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo employment & immigration Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

""This has nothing to do with who’s in office. Things got worse two years ago because the media's attention turned off whistleblowers and turned on to politics and other things,"" she said Tuesday.

""It has nothing to do with who's in the president's office or who controls Congress. This is a malignant leadership culture that will outlast us all unless someone has the courage to break rank in leadership and finally change it."""

Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/24/735525569/treasury-department-launches-investigation-into-delays-behind-harriet-tubman-20-,"Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."

‘A Constant Game of Musical Chairs’ Amid Another Homeland Security Shake-Up,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/mark-morgan-ice-cbp.html,"In an interview on Tuesday for a coming book about the president’s immigration policies, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tumult among his top immigration officials.

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

In 2017, shortly after he took office, Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Morgan as Border Patrol chief. But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

“Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful,” Mr. Sanders, a former chief technology officer at the Transportation Security Administration who helped spearhead the agency’s PreCheck program, wrote, “I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of C.B.P. has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”"
FedEx sues US Commerce Department over export restrictions that affect Huawei,https://www.cnn.com,"['Sherisse Pham', 'Cnn Business']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/business/fedex-lawsuit-intl-hnk-huawei/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) US delivery company FedEx has filed a lawsuit against the US government, arguing that it should not be required to enforce federal government export bans.

The move comes after FedEx mishandled a couple of deliveries for Huawei , and failed to deliver a Huawei smartphone shipped from Britain to the United States.

Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 smartphone brand. The Trump administration added Huawei to a trade blacklist last month , barring US companies from selling or exporting technology and components to the Chinese tech firm without first obtaining a US government license.

The restrictions have disrupted Huawei's global supply chain, and left companies like Alphabet-ownedandscrambling to figure out what they can and cannot sell to Huawei.

said in a statement Monday that the US Export Administration Regulations ""violate common carriers' rights"" by making delivery companies liable for shipments that may violate US restrictions. ""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" the statement said.

The regulations ""essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally,"" the company said in its lawsuit

""We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting US national security,"" a Commerce Department spokesperson said Tuesday.

FedEx under fire in China

Beijing launched an investigation into FedEx earlier this month, after Huawei said the delivery company diverted to the United States two packages intended for the company's offices in China.

""FedEx, as a large multinational corporation, should offer the public a reasonable explanation. And they should also take responsibility for their actions,"" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Geng Shuang said Monday, in reference to Huawei's dispute with FedEx.

On Friday, PCMag reported that FedEx ""refused"" to deliver a Huawei smartphone sent by one of its UK writers to the magazine's New York office. It was returned to sender, with a label attached saying ""parcel returned by FedEx, due to US government issue"" with Huawei and the Chinese government, according to PCMag.

""The package in question was mistakenly returned to the shipper, and we apologize for this operational error,"" FedEx spokesperson Maury Donahue said in a statement to CNN Business.

She added that the company is trying to minimize disruptions to customers as ""we adjust operations to comply with a dynamic US regulatory environment.""

Asked about the botched deliveries in an interview with Fox News on Monday, FedEx CEO Fred Smith said ""Huawei is just emblematic of this problem.""

FedEx contacted the Department of Commerce and told them that ""the increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden on FedEx and common carriers,"" Smith said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would be interested in attending the Presidents Cup in Melbourne, ahead of a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on the sidelines of the G20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan.

Asked by a reporter if he would go to the premier golfing event, Trump, an avid golfer, said he wanted to but was noncommittal.

“I’ll tell you what - I’d like to,” Trump said. “It might not be easy, but I’d like to.”

Morrison offered Trump a “warm invitation” to the major golfing event, scheduled in early December.

The two leaders spoke ahead of a dinner meeting in Osaka."
NYT: Mnuchin wants Secret Service back under the Treasury Department,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/politics/steven-mnuchin-wants-secret-service-under-treasury-department/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing to move the US Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security back under his department's control, according to The New York Times.

Citing administration officials, the Times reported that Mnuchin has been lobbying President Donald Trump, who has signaled that he supports the idea of handing control of the agency back to Treasury.

Mnuchin held talks this month about the move with senior Secret Service agents at the Treasury Department, the Times reported.

Mnuchin has been interested in the agency's cybersecurity and anticounterfeiting work, according to the Times.

Some senior DHS officials oppose the move, concerned about losing an agency with those components, the Times reports.

William Barr pipes in talk of national priorities at the DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bill-barr-pipes-in-talk-of-national-priorities-at-doj,"Attorney General William Barr surprised the crowd gathered at the Justice Department on Wednesday when he jumped out of his seat and grabbed a set of bagpipes to join the Emerald Society Pipe Band in a rousing rendition of Scotland the Brave.



Attorney General Barr speaks to gathering of U.S. attorneys at the @TheJusticeDept.



When the @NYPDnews Bagpipe Band is playing, you can see Barr sneak off stage.

It was a moment of levity for the controversial attorney general as he kicked off the U.S. Attorneys' Conference.

When Barr got up to the podium, he briefly diverted from his prepared remarks, saying that his colleagues at the DOJ had tried to surprise him with bagpipers, but that he'd figured it out. ""But as you know, I’m very proficient at, dare I say the word, spying,” Barr said. “And I discovered the plot. So this was my counter surprise.”

Barr famously told a Senate committee earlier this year that referred to some of the surveillance actions taken by the U.S. government during the Trump-Russia investigation as “spying did occur” while speaking in front of a Senate committee in April, and despite criticism from many Democrats, Barr has repeatedly defended his use of the term since then, calling it “a good English word.”

Barr said today was the first time he’d played the bagpipes since performing at his daughter’s wedding late last year.

He recounted that Trump called him up in early December, saying Trump told him that he was about to jump on a helicopter and wanted to move up the announcement of his appointment as attorney general on a whim so he could tell the reporters on the way out.

“So sure enough, as my first out-of-body experience, and there have been a lot since then, but I turn on the TV and there he is announcing me as attorney general,” Barr said.

The attorney general also talked about the challenges the DOJ faces.

“On the one hand, the department’s law enforcement efforts are at their all-time best,"" Barr said. ""On the other hand, the threats we face are greater and more complex than ever.”

Barr said that he was particularly focused on violent crimes, dangers posed to federal law enforcement officials, transnational gangs, national security threats, and the crisis on the southern border.

Barr also said he was worried about hate crimes, saying he was “deeply concerned” about the “rise that we have seen over the past decade” and made it clear that we “must have zero tolerance for violence that is motivated by hatred against their fellow citizens, whether on the basis of their racial, religious, or sexual characteristics.”

Barr pointed to illegal drugs as another growing threat, knocking the Obama administration for not being aggressive enough and saying that “a tsunami was allowed to build up which is now hitting the country.” Barr said that “when I look at the overdose deaths, the blighted lives, and the families and communities broken by drug addiction, it reminds me why we cannot surrender.”

And Barr weighed in on the immigration controversy, saying that “a lasting solution will involve changing our laws, but in the meanwhile we must do all we can to support DHS.” Barr also said that “even if we devoted every AUSA in the country to those cases, we could not solve the crisis on the southern border through prosecutions alone” and said he hoped that more immigration judges and Trump’s recent agreement with Mexico would help solve the issue.

“Much of what we’re trying to do is make up ground that we’ve lost as a result of inattention in the past,” Barr told the crowd. “And I assure you with sustained efforts and firm resolve we will make up this ground and surmount these challenges.”

Barr did not comment on Robert Mueller agreeing to testify in July nor did he mention his ongoing investigation into the origin of the Trump-Russia probe."
Student loan borrowers who say they were defrauded sue Betsy DeVos for failing to cancel their debt,https://www.cnbc.com,['Annie Nova'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/student-loan-borrowers-who-say-they-were-defrauded-sue-betsy-devos.html,"More than 150,000 former students of for-profit colleges filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday, claiming the agency is depriving them of the student debt relief to which they're legally entitled.

The plaintiffs, represented by Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates, accuse the Department of Education under DeVos of failing to implement an Obama-era regulation known as ""borrower defense, "" which allows students to have their federal student loans cancelled if their school misled them or engaged in other misconduct.

""The law is clear: Students who experienced fraud should not be required to pay back federal loans that should never have been made by the Department in the first place,"" said Toby Merrill, director of Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending.

Around 160,000 people have filed claims with the government that their school defrauded them, and new applications continue to pour in. Almost all of these complaints concern for-profit schools, of which there are some 7,000 around the country and which take in around 15% of government financial aid.

However, student loan borrowers have found themselves waiting without answers. The Department of Education hasn't approved or denied a borrower defense claim since June 2018.

An audit in 2017 by the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General found that government staff working on borrower defense claims had been instructed not to submit any additional applications for approval."

Mnuchin: 'We were about 90% of the way' on China trade deal and there's a 'path to complete this',https://www.cnbc.com,['Holly Ellyatt'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/mnuchin-says-us-china-trade-deal-was-90-percent-complete.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday the U.S. and China were close to a trade deal, and he's optimistic that progress can be made during weekend talks between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. ""We were about 90% of the way there [with a deal] and I think there's a path to complete this,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Manama, Bahrain. He said he's confident Trump and the Chinese president can make progress in stalled trade talks at the Group of 20 meeting. ""The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship."" He did not provide any detail on what the final 10% of an agreement might entail, or what the sticking points are to completing a deal.

Trump is meeting his Chinese counterpart on Saturday at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The outcome of the meeting could be pivotal for the global economy and financial markets, which has been rattled by 18 months of trade tensions between the economic giants and an escalation of tariffs on each other's imports. Officials have yet to negotiate a breakthrough, but there are hopes that a meeting between the two presidents could help the discussions. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of investors found that about two-thirds expect no deal this weekend, but there would be no new tariffs either. ""I'm hopeful that we can move forward with a plan,"" Mnuchin told CNBC. ""President Trump and President Xi have a very close working relationship. We had a productive meeting at the last G-20."" At their meeting in December at the G-20 in Buenos Aires, Trump and Xi reached a truce in the trade war, but talks in May broke down, and the countries added additional tariffs. Mnuchin said he was hopeful a deal could be struck by the end of the year but said ""there needs to be the right efforts in place."" Dow futures jumped after Mnuchin's comments and signaled a higher open for Wall Street Wednesday.

Slowing growth

Talks between the U.S. and China broke down in May because China reportedly did not want to commit to changes in its laws to help allay U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and currency manipulation. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has previously played down hopes for a Trump-Xi breakthrough this weekend, saying in mid-June that ""the most that will come out of the G-20 might be an agreement to actively resume talks."" The trade war has impacted the Chinese and U.S. economies, despite both presidents insisting otherwise. In April, the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3%, down from an earlier forecast of 3.5%, citing ongoing global trade tensions as the rationale for the downgrade."
Commerce Dept. ordered ex-official not to answer House panel questions,https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Desiderio'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/commerce-house-panel-questions-1380209,"James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (pictured), was instructed not to answer questions from the House Oversight and Reform Committee. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images congress Commerce Dept. ordered ex-official not to answer House panel questions

A former senior Commerce Department official refused to answer more than 100 questions during an interview with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that centered on the Trump administration’s controversial decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, according to a transcript released Tuesday.

Commerce Department lawyers instructed James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Secretary Wilbur Ross, not to answer the committee’s questions about his contacts with the White House and his conversations with Ross.

Story Continued Below

Uthmeier was also directed not to discuss the contents of a memo he wrote to a senior Justice Department official, John Gore, that purportedly outlines legal arguments surrounding the addition of a citizenship question to the census. On several occasions, Uthmeier was also blocked from disclosing details about his own conversations with Gore.

The Trump administration has sought to block several witnesses from cooperating with House Democrats’ investigations, including the Oversight Committee’s investigation of the census and the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. In both cases, the Trump administration has asserted that current and former officials are immune from testifying about their conversations with the president and their tenure in the administration.

Earlier this month, the Oversight Committee voted to hold Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents about the citizenship question and the Justice and Commerce departments’ coordination in creating it. The vote came after Trump asserted executive privilege over all of the documents.

Late Monday night, the committee officially filed its contempt report.

Uthmeier, who worked at a law firm that counted Trump’s presidential campaign as a client, told the committee during his June 11 interview that he “spoke with White House personnel” about the citizenship question, but Commerce Department lawyers blocked him from stating the names of those White House officials. Uthmeier also acquiesced to the department’s demands that he refuse to answer questions about his conversations with Ross.

But Uthmeier did tell the committee that both Ross and Earl Comstock, Ross’ policy chief, asked him to look into the legal arguments about a citizenship question in early 2017. Commerce Department lawyers objected to every follow-up question seeking more details about those conversations, but Democrats said Uthmeier’s response showed that Ross lied to Congress about the true origins of the citizenship question when he said it was added to the census “solely” at the request of the Justice Department.

Uthmeier delivered his memo analyzing those legal questions to Gore, who then formally asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question.

Administration officials have said that the citizenship question was added to the 2020 census in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have been skeptical of that claim. Uthmeier did not answer a question about whether the memo he wrote for Gore discusses the Voting Rights Act.

When asked why he wrote the memo, Uthmeier said: “In my research, the Voting Rights Act came up, and I am not very familiar with the Voting Rights Act and all of its nuances, and thus, I was hoping John [Gore] would provide legal advice that dealt with the memo and the topics that I was investigating.” Uthmeier did not answer follow-up questions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the committee, said in a statement: “Official after official appearing before the committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-whites. The census is the foundation of our democracy, and our committee will continue doing everything in its power to ensure that it counts every single person in the United States.”

The committee has made the census probe — and the reasons a citizenship question was added — a central focus in its various investigations, which are also targeting Trump’s personal finances and the White House security clearance process.

Democrats say they’ve uncovered evidence supporting their claim that the Trump administration added the citizenship question in order to boost Republicans in future elections. Excluding noncitizens from the official census count, they say, would lead to redrawn congressional districts that favor Republicans.

Their investigation has revealed that administration officials spoke with immigration hard-liners known for their views on the citizenship question, including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, now-deceased GOP operative Thomas Hofeller, and John Baker, a law professor.

The White House blocked Kobach from answering the committee’s questions about his conversations with Trump and other senior officials, arguing that they are privileged. Hofeller opined frequently about how Republicans would benefit from a citizenship question. And Uthmeier told the committee that Baker, who espoused similar views, was a “long-time mentor.”"
"DHS boss McAleenan accused of opposing, leaking planned ICE raids",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-accused-leaking-ice-raids,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April—prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello’s departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up—and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

“He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,” the source told Fox News. “He has been fighting this operation since its inception.”

On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.

Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue.”

He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""

The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.

“To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger—that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,” the source told Fox News, noting that “you can’t go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.”

Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.

A spokesperson in McAleenan's office denied the allegations, telling ""Fox & Friends"" that he's never leaked anything in his entire career.

Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that “due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.”

ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants “who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.”

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON EXPECTED ICE RAID AMID PUSHBACK FROM LOCAL DEM POLITICIANS

By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.

The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would “begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.”

On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' “Justice with Judge Jeanine,” Morgan said the postponement of the raids would “give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.”

He added: “I’ve got the green light to, anyone that’s here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.”

Instances of similar behavior have increased in recent years, to the point that Americans need more information about how the White House weighing in on DOJ matters affects the impartiality of law enforcement.

The logs would be shared with Congress. Justice Department ombudsmen would also review the information every six months and notify Congress if any of it raises concerns about political interference.

This would strengthen a historical norm without unduly constraining whoever holds the office of president. The legislation recognizes the propriety of communications about policy, legislation, appointments, personnel, and other non-legal matters, and it respects executive privilege by not requiring disclosure of proper top-level contacts between the White House and the Department of Justice, except to DOJ’s own oversight agencies.

It should get bipartisan support today, as well — just like it enjoys from a broad, bipartisan coalition that includes our two organizations.

Take the public’s perspective: Its confidence in government institutions, including law enforcement, has dwindled during this century. The Whitehouse bill could help restore some faith in the system by giving Americans more insight into how officials entrusted with enforcing the law conduct themselves. The bill would deter bad behavior by those officials. It also would shine a light on the relationship between the White House and the Department of Justice, allowing Congress to ensure that investigation, prosecution, and enforcement decisions are free from improper influence.

The New York Times reported last month that Justice Department officials had held numerous conversations with White House lawyers prior to the public release of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerTop Republican considered Mueller subpoena to box in Democrats Kamala Harris says her Justice Dept would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump for obstruction Dem committees win new powers to investigate Trump MORE’s conclusions.

This issue isn’t just about politics. When it comes to the economy, the White House (like any federal agency) shouldn’t be picking winners and losers. It was reported that President Trump directed his top economic aide to find a way to block the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner — months before the Justice Department eventually filed suit to do so. We don’t know what happened in the time between — whether word of the president’s wishes made its way to DOJ lawyers and influenced the Department’s consideration of a significant deal.

Whitehouse’s legislation would answer these sorts of questions. While it applies only to the Department of Justice as currently written, it could do even more: Its disclosure requirement should also apply to more law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service, and independent agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Election Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission. We encourage senators to include these agencies in the legislation.

The relationship between the White House and the Department of Justice rarely has been such a major and sensitive issue in political discourse. It’s even become a hot topic in the 2020 presidential campaign, as some candidates have made comments suggesting that they, too, might be tempted to put a finger on the scales of DOJ’s decision-making. Congress should act now to reinforce the norm of DOJ independence — for this president and his successors.

New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450169-new-epa-rule-would-allow-more-administration-officials-to-weigh-in-on-foia-requests,"More political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could soon have the authority to weigh in on public information requests.

The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as Wednesday and will not allow for a public comment period.

ADVERTISEMENT

According to the new language in the FOIA rule signed by EPA chief Andrew Wheeler last week, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle FOIA requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

“It’s allowing political appointees to make the decision that records someone has presumably identified as being responsive are not actually responsive. That theoretically would allow sensitive documents, that the agency doesn't want to send you, to withhold those records -- and that should shake out eventually in a lawsuit if that's what's happening,” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights.

EPA strongly disputed that interpretation, saying the new rule does not grant appointees the ability to label responsive documents as non-responsive.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” said Michael Abboud, EPA spokesman.

Topic, who reviewed the text of the rule, said it’s common for FOIA officers at government agencies to initially find responsive documents to requests that other officials later dispute in terms of qualifying for public release.

He said the new language in the EPA rule suggests officials may have the opportunity to prevent release of the documents on the basis that they don’t meet the criteria, and are therefore non-responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” he said. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

EPA officials who would be authorized to make that decision include the administrator, deputy administrators, assistant administrators, deputy assistant administrators, regional administrators, deputy regional administrators, general counsel, deputy general counsels, regional counsels, deputy regional counsels and the inspector general or delegates of those individuals, according to the final rule.

The latest version differs from the previous rule, which granted the same rights to the “head of an office, or that individual's designee.”

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“It’s exceptionally difficult to litigate on the ‘basis of responsiveness.’ There is no record,” said Kevin Bell, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “FOIA litigation is always pretty one-sided, there is no discovery … now they are just saying, ‘Oh, it’s not responsive. Oh, we don’t have to tell you.’”

Bell equated EPA’s new FOIA rule to a similar regulatory action unveiled earlier this year at the Interior Department, called an “awareness review,” which allows political appointees 72 hours to review documents that mention them by name prior to release.

“It seems like EPA is doing about the same thing,” he said. “On the ‘basis of responsiveness’ and ‘no records responses’ are both things that we've seen in the environmental FOIA community time and again.""

EPA officials characterized the rule change as a much-needed update to regulations as stipulated by 2007, 2009 and 2016 congressional updates to FOIA processing. The Obama administration failed to change its FOIA regulations as charged by Congress, and the new rule brings EPA into compliance.

“The changes in today’s rule bring EPA’s regulations into compliance with non-discretionary provisions of the amended statute and reflect changes in the agency’s organization, procedure, or practice,” said a senior career EPA official who helped devise the regulation.

Critics argue the new rule specifically bestows more powers on political appointees to weigh in on specific FOIA cases.

“This new notice turns that upside down by substituting a wide array of political appointees for the career officials that heretofore have responded to FOIA requests for records in the possession of their offices,” said John Walke, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The rule changes, for the first time, place an army of EPA political appointees as the gatekeepers for determining whether Americans receive responsive government records in response to FOIA requests.”

The EPA official said the change to the “final determinations” authority in EPA’s new rule largely combines two previous FOIA rules and is not a significant change.

“This provision is not intended to be broader than the old regulations, which covered the subject in several provisions,” the official said.

“The old regulations state that ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of that office or other agency records when appropriate.’ All positions listed in the updated regulations fall within the ordinary meaning of ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee,’” the official added.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” according to a statement provided by EPA on the rule change.

The agency official described the change as a way to align regional office FOIA responses with the national office.

“We took a look across the agency and saw there were different practices as to how they reached out to requesters in the first instance after a request has come in. We saw an opportunity to create greater uniformity. One of the practices we’ll be adopting as this goes into effect is reaching out consistently to FOIA requesters with an initial letter,” the official said.

Bell warned that the new order could allow EPA political appointees to better control the documents ultimately released by regional offices. He said regional offices often have less political pressure to withhold more responsive materials.

“This is just making sure that every FOIA request that gets reviewed gets taken down the hall or next door to Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe | Critics slam EPA for rolling back union protections | Trump officials open door to controversial Alaska mining project Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe Trump pick brings scrutiny to 'revolving door' between Pentagon, industry MORE's office,” Bell said. “Basically, anytime a FOIA request goes up to the administration you can extend however long it will take and reduce what you get back.”

The EPA official said the changes would neither speed up nor slow down the FOIA process. Under President Trump Donald John TrumpDalai Lama talks Trump, says European migrants should return to 'their own land' McConnell pledges to work with Democratic president on Supreme Court vacancy Trump campaign official: Democratic debate a 'two-hour infomercial' for president's reelection MORE, the agency has experienced a huge uptick in FOIA requests and major backlog in processing, which has been exacerbated in some instances by a lack of funding to hire new staff to help with those requests.

“I don’t think this will change the speed or response at all. We’re trying to be consistent with outreach to requesters and not anticipating this will slow down our response,” the senior official said. “Our aspiration is to come into compliance with the statue, in the most straight and most direct way possible, without coming into any discretionary changes with the statue.”

The EPA has come under criticism for its handling of FOIA requests under Trump’s presidency. Last fall, agency heads clashed with top Democratic lawmakers over an admittance by then acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s chief of staff to investigators with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that certain FOIA requests were put under more intense scrutiny because they were “politically charged.”

In a letter to lawmakers at the time, Kevin Minoli, the EPA’s principal deputy general counsel, defended the EPA’s decision to notify senior officials throughout the FOIA process regarding high-profile requests.

“This ‘awareness review’ process does not itself violate FOIA and can be completed without causing undue delay,” Minoli said.

Northern Dynasty: US Environmental Protection Agency Re-Starts Process to Withdraw Obama-Era 'Proposed Determination',https://finance.yahoo.com,[],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-dynasty-us-environmental-protection-002700383.html,"VANCOUVER, June 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ - Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (TSX: NDM; NYSE American: NAK) (""Northern Dynasty"" or the ""Company"") reports the US Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has announced it will re-start the process to withdraw a Proposed Determination initiated by the Obama Administration in 2014 under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act (""CWA"") in an unprecedented attempt to pre-emptively veto southwest Alaska's Pebble Project before it received an objective, scientific regulatory review under the National Environmental Policy Act (""NEPA"").

In May 2017, Northern Dynasty's 100%-owned US subsidiary Pebble Limited Partnership (""Pebble Partnership"" or ""PLP"") entered into a settlement agreement with EPA that allowed the Pebble Project to proceed into normal course permitting under the CWA and NEPA. EPA further agreed to initiate a process to propose to withdraw its Proposed Determination, a process that was subsequently suspended by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in January 2018.

Pebble Partnership CEO Tom Collier said the pre-emptive regulatory action initiated by the Obama-era EPA in 2014 represents a dangerous precedent and poor public policy that threatens investment in responsible resource development throughout the United States.

""The idea that development projects can be vetoed before they are even proposed or a comprehensive, permitting process has been undertaken is one that should not take root in this country,"" Collier said. ""It is wholly inconsistent with the rule of law and a serious deterrent to resource investment and industrial development, and it is for those reasons that we expect the Proposed Determination to be withdrawn by this Administration.""

Meanwhile, the Environmental Impact Statement (""EIS"") and federal permitting process for Pebble under NEPA being led by the US Army Corps of Engineers (the ""Corps"") continues to advance. The Corps has published a timeline at www.pebbleprojecteis.com that indicates it expects to finalize the Pebble Project EIS in early 2020 and issue a final Record of Decision by the middle of next year.

""We have every confidence that the Pebble Project as proposed will meet the rigorous environmental standards enforced in Alaska and the US, and that the EIS permitting process now underway will demonstrate that compliance through an open, objective, transparent and science-driven review,"" Collier said.

Forward Looking Information and other Cautionary Factors

This release includes certain statements that may be deemed ""forward-looking statements"". All statements in this release, other than statements of historical facts, that address exploration drilling, exploitation activities and events or developments that the Company expects are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes the expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements should not be in any way construed as guarantees of the ultimate size, quality or commercial feasibility of the Pebble Project or of the Company's future performance or the outcome of litigation.

Assumptions used by the Company to develop forward-looking statements include the following: the Pebble Project will obtain all required environmental and other permits and all land use and other licenses, studies and development of the Pebble Project will continue to be positive, and no geological or technical problems will occur. The likelihood of future mining at the Pebble Project is subject to a large number of risks and will require achievement of a number of technical, economic and legal objectives, including obtaining necessary mining and construction permits, approvals, licenses and title on a timely basis and delays due to third party opposition, changes in government policies regarding mining and natural resource exploration and exploitation, the final outcome of any litigation, completion of pre-feasibility and final feasibility studies, preparation of all necessary engineering for surface or underground mining and processing facilities as well as receipt of significant additional financing to fund these objectives as well as funding mine construction. Such funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or on any terms at all. There is no known ore at the Pebble Project and there is no assurance that the mineralization at the Pebble Project will ever be classified as ore. The need for compliance with extensive environmental and socio-economic rules and practices and the requirement for the Company to obtain government permitting can cause a delay or even abandonment of a mineral project. The Company is also subject to the specific risks inherent in the mining business as well as general economic and business conditions.

House Dems Stiff-Arm DHS on Domestic Terror Funds,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'National Security Reporter', 'Political Reporter']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-dems-stiff-arm-dhs-on-domestic-terror-funds,"As white supremacist terror attacks have left dozens dead around the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has faced blistering criticism for its approach to the threat. Earlier this year, however, congressional Democrats declined to make more money available for the department’s efforts to thwart domestic terrorist attacks.

Their reason, in part: concern the Trump administration could use new money to target American Muslims instead of white supremacists.

It’s a complex episode of a messy fight between Trump’s Department of Homeland Security and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives—a fight with tens of millions of dollars at stake. And it didn’t have to happen.

When Trump came into office, his Office of Management and Budget didn’t ask Congress for money for a small grant program DHS used to fund efforts to counter domestic terrorism. A source familiar with the department’s efforts said there were concerns that some of the grants provided by DHS at the end of the Obama administration to help prevent attacks by homegrown violent extremists were inefficient and failed to address the threats adequately.

After two years without funding, DHS officials decided to go straight to congressional appropriators to request the money instead of going through the White House. Per one congressional source familiar with the request, they asked for more than $17 million—$10 million to offset the grant money that existed under the Obama administration, plus about $7 million more. They made the ask in recent weeks.

But House appropriators didn’t bite, and declined to include that money in a recent funding bill. They worried, according to half a dozen sources familiar with the talks, that DHS doesn’t have a cohesive strategy for fighting domestic terror—a concern a DHS official said is unwarranted. And the White House has yet to release a clear strategy document on the growing threat, instead just having officials characterize it in speeches and congressional testimony. Four of those sources specifically said that concerns about potential anti-Muslim programs informed Democrats’ reticence to provide the new funds.

And the request’s timing didn’t help. One Democratic aide said the committee had already written a bill funding the department for 2020 by the time the request came in. DHS submitted its request in the spring, the aide said.

“The department requested funding for these grants under the Obama administration, but there was a [concern] that under Trump [the grants] would be used in the new administration to fuel anti-Muslim programming and rhetoric,” a House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast.

“ The Trump administration’s emphasis has been placed on addressing the potential for violence by immigrants... But the primary threat facing us comes from people here who become radicalized by what they see online. ” — former DHS official John Cohen

A DHS official strongly disagreed with this characterization. “DHS is committed to protecting the homeland by working to prevent all types of violent extremism,” this official told The Daily Beast. “The department rejects the premise that its prevention programs have or would target Muslims.”

In testimony in front of Congress in June, Elizabeth Neumann, the assistant secretary for Threat Prevention and Security Policy, the division that oversees programs to prevent domestic terrorist attacks, said the tactics used by homegrown violent extremists make it “extremely difficult for law enforcement to detect and thwart potential attacks.”

The DHS request came as the Trump administration began to push a new strategy regarding security at the southern border. Over the past year, the White House and DHS have pushed for more resources to try to slow an influx of Central American migrants.

In May, the White House requested $4.5 billion in emergency border funding from Congress, more than $3 billion of which would go to humanitarian efforts. President Trump reportedly requested the additional funding for the border because the money the administration previously received from the Department of Defense came with several restrictions and limitations. The House voted Tuesday to approve the supplemental funding.

And over the weekend, Trump postponed nationwide raids to deport undocumented families after threatening to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents out on the streets if Democrats on Capitol Hill did not agree to changes in asylum law.

Meanwhile, Homeland Security has drawn criticism for its handling of election security and domestic terrorism issues. The Daily Beast reported the department this year shuttered a group within its intelligence arm focused on analysis of domestic terrorism. It also gutted two task forces focused on election security and foreign interference.

On top of that, headquarters has asked each Homeland Security component to send volunteers away from their day jobs and to the border. The department’s agency responsible for protecting America’s vital infrastructure—including election systems—struggled to initially fulfill the request and had to send out more than one request for volunteers. Democrats and other outside observers say the White House’s decision to prioritize border security over other core DHS missions leaves the country at risk.

“The Trump administration’s emphasis has been placed on addressing the potential for violence by immigrants and others outside of this country,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “ But the primary threat facing us comes from people here who become radicalized by what they see online. So, any effort to protect this nation has to focus on the domestic environment as opposed to being obsessed by that potential violence that feeds the administration’s anti-immigration agenda.”"

Veuer’s Justin Kircher has the details. Buzz60

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Omarosa Manigault Newman alleging that the former ""Apprentice"" star who served as an adviser to President Donald Trump before becoming a prominent critic of his administration failed to file a financial disclosure report after she was fired from the White House.

In a civil complaint filed in federal court in Washington, the department said Manigault Newman failed to file the report despite several emails reminding her to do so. Such a report is required of employees who leave government jobs. The Justice Department is seeking a $50,000 penalty against Manigault Newman.

Manigault Newman was unavailable for comment. Her attorney, John Phillips, accused the White House of using the Justice Department to retaliate against Manigault Newman and said allegations that she ""knowingly and willfully"" did not file the disclosure report is untrue.

Phillips said the White House is still in possession of documents that Manigault Newman needed to file the report. He said Manigault Newman repeatedly requested these files from the White House, and told staffers in ""several calls and emails"" that she needed the contents of ""seven boxes"" of documents that were seized after her firing. The White House agreed to provide the documents on May 10, months after the deadline to file the report, but Phillips said Manigault Newman has not received any of the files.

Manigault Newman was assistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison at the White House. Her annual salary was $179,700 a year, the top pay allowed by law for White House aides. Former chief of staff John Kelly fired her in December 2017 after less than a year on the job.

Manigault Newman later published a tell-all book describing the Trump White House as ""the most chaotic, outrageous"" in history. She also revealed that she had secretly recorded a Situation Room conversation in which Kelly fired her, as well as another conversation with Trump afterward.

The former ""Apprentice"" star, who said she worked closely with Trump for more than 15 years before he became president, has since been the subject of presidential insults on Twitter.

Trump tweeted in August 2018 that ""Wacky Omarosa"" ""begged"" him for a job and that White House staffers hated her.

NOW WEHRUM WON'T HAVE TO HEAR 'EM: The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) air policy chief is leaving amid ethics concerns.

The agency on Wednesday announced that Bill Wehrum, the head of EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, will leave by the end of June.

The announcement comes a few months after lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched an investigation into whether Wehrum and his deputy improperly aided former energy industry clients after joining the EPA.

Wehrum, along with the office's senior counsel, David Harlow, formerly worked at the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, where he represented Utility Air Regulatory Group. The group represents a number of power plant operators that EPA regulates.

The lawmakers wrote an April later to Wehrum's former employer saying they were ""deeply troubled by several reports of unethical behavior by EPA officials, particularly in the Office of Air and Radiation.""

Wehrum specifically was an integral player in relaxing a number of Obama-era pollution rules, including Tuesday's finalized repeal of the ""once in, always in"" regulation for sources of air pollution at ""major"" industrial power plants.

Wehrum has led the EPA's efforts to repeal and replace the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, rolling out a final rule earlier this month to ease restrictions on coal fired power plants, called the American Clean Energy (ACE) rule. That rule is likely to face a court battle.

The head of EPA's air pollution department has also played a role in shaping the new federal vehicle emissions standards, which critics argue will allow more pollution from tailpipe emissions.

""I would like to thank Assistant Administrator Bill Wehrum for his service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship,"" Wheeler wrote.

CRITICS SAY EPA SCALED BACK UNION PROTECTIONS: Critics are pushing back after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced this week that it is rolling back the union protections offered to its employees.

In an email sent to agency staff earlier this week and obtained by The Hill late Tuesday, the agency announced it will implement a new contract that remains unsigned by the union itself.

""It's styled as a collective bargaining agreement, but there's no agreement. It's imposed as an order, a dictate,"" said Jeff Ruch, pacific director for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), adding that the contract would dramatically reduce the assistance the union can offer EPA employees.

The details: Under the contract, union employees would have to give up office space within the EPA offices and union leaders would not be able to use the intranet or agency billboards to communicate with members. It would also limit the amount of time union leaders could spend helping rank-and-file employees with labor disputes and other issues by 75 percent.

PEER leaders said numerous EPA employees had reached out to them with concerns following the move.

The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against the EPA to stop the seven-year contract from taking effect July 9.

A long fight: EPA and the AFGE, the largest union representing EPA employees, have struggled for years to negotiate a new contract for employees.

EPA officials said they put the contract in place after the union walked away from negotiations that had been dragging on since 2010. The two sides have long disagreed over how much of the union contract is up for review.

""As a practical matter, if EPA decided to lay off one-third of its employees as the Trump administration has been proposing for [the] last couple of years, the union ability to block that or even intercede is severely weakened,"" Ruch said.

EPA officials claim the new contract was designed for efficiency and effectiveness.

A career EPA employee said ""there are certain limitations within the arbitration provision"" that apply to employees who are being disciplined or fired.

But the agency argued that disputes were being handled in too many ways.

""If you already have other avenues of redress, then giving people multiple avenues for redress doesn't make sense, especially when you have employees file in more than one place -- it's ineffective at a certain point,"" the agency said.

PEER called the move ""mean-spirited and petty.""

EPA FLIPS ON PEBBLE MINE: The Trump administration is again opening the door to the controversial Pebble Mine project in Alaska.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will restart consideration of the mining project, which was previously promised by former EPA head Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittTrump administration to reconsider allowing controversial Alaska mining project Top EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests MORE but paused.

""Today's step is a move toward good government decision making, which we owe under the law to both the public and project proponents,"" EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said in a statement.

The memo, signed by Leopold, means the Trump administration is looking into pulling the 2014 Obama administration proposal to block Pebble Mine. The EPA at the time said it would be too harmful to streams that flow into Bristol Bay, which hosts the largest Salmon fishery in the world, among other ecologically important features.

In January 2018, Pruitt made a surprising announcement that the EPA would not pursue its plans to do away with the Obama-era proposal to restrict the mining located nearly 200 miles from Anchorage. Pruitt had previously moved in May 2018 to withdraw the Obama administration's proposal to block the mine under the Clean Water Act.

Instead in a statement, Pruitt warned mining in the region would ""likely pose a risk to the abundant natural resources that exist there.""

Several Democrats criticized Monday the Trump administration after POLITICO reported the Agriculture Department has largely stopped promoting its own climate science.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who's also running for president, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue expressing ""deep concern and alarm"" over the report. The Minnesota Democrat asked the department to explain its justification for not publicizing certain studies and to immediately release ""any [Agricultural Research Service] study related to climate science that was ignored, downplayed, or its findings held back.""

""When federally-funded scientific research is curtailed or withheld because of its attention to the consequences of climate change, farmers are cut out of participating in climate solutions and, at worst, unable to effectively mitigate and adapt their operations and infrastructure to its effects,"" she wrote.

Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) tweeted the story, calling it ""outrageous.""

""Climate change is an urgent threat to our farmers,"" she said. ""The Administration should not be burying vital research that will help us understand and combat the effects of climate change.""

Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, also took to Twitter to criticize the department. The Vermont Democrat said USDA scientists lead the world in studying the effects of climate change.

""While our farmers fight against #ClimateChange, #USDA is shamefully fighting against #science,"" he wrote.

In addition to Klobuchar, two other 2020 contenders logged their disapproval. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) tweeted about the story twice today and issued a statement.

During his visit to Green Bay earlier this week, Ross made it clear he is worried about the aging workforce within the water industry, calling it ‘daunting.’

Action 2 News toured Green Bay Water Utility’s filter plant on Wednesday and most of the workers have been in the business for decades.

Ross said the filter plant technicians and the water quality managers are the true environmental heroes.

“They are protecting our public health every single day,” said Ross. “We don’t talk about them enough and if we don’t start talking about them, we are not going to have them around to protect our public health 10-15 years from now.”

Ross said there’s a water workforce problem across the country. The Green Bay Water Utility has witnessed this first hand.

“It took us 6 months to hire a filter plant operator recently, so we need to be out there,” said Nancy Quirk, general manager for the Green Bay Water Utility. Quirk said the person they hired just graduated from college last month. He is replacing an employee that was there for 40 years.

“We did an engagement survey with our employees we look at how to make our workforce better, we are also working on doing some recruitment,” said Quirk. “We are doing a market study on salaries so we can be competitive in the market place as well.”

Meanwhile, UW-Green Bay is doing what it can to fill the future gap with skilled workers.

“We’ve got our new environmental engineering technology program which would certainly provide students with skills and capabilities to work in some of these position,” said John Katers, Dean of the College of Science, Engineering and Technology (CSET) at UW-Green Bay. “As of this coming fall, we will be starting a brand new program in water science which will be focused on some of these issues as well.”

Katers also mentioned the importance of helping out local water treatment facilities.

“Having the right people and having trained professionals is obviously vitally important to maintaining infrastructure for our community,” said Katers.

“The money we throw in to build infrastructure, if you don’t have the workforce to run it, you are not protecting those tax-payer investments,” said Ross.

10-year Treasury yield falls below 2% after weak consumer confidence data,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/us-treasury-yields-lower-ahead-of-powells-speech.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% on Tuesday as investors looked for safety following the release of much weaker-than-expected confidence data.

Short-term rates rose off their lows, however, following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard and Chairman Jerome Powell.

The yield traded at 1.994% as of 3:33 p.m. ET. The 2-year rate held steady at 1.736% while the 30-year bond yield declined to 2.52%.

Bullard said Tuesday he doesn't believe the U.S. central bank needs to lower borrowing costs by 50 basis points at its next meeting despite his push to cut rates last week.

""Just sitting here today, I think 50 basis points would be overdone,"" Bullard told Bloomberg News. ""I don't think the situation really calls for that, but I would be willing to go 25 (basis points).""

In a speech in New York, Powell reiterated that inflation — or how much prices rise throughout the economy — continues to run below the central bank's 2% objective.

""The crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments,"" he said at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The central bank leader also said in prepared remarks that the Fed ""is insulated from short-term political pressures — what is often referred to as our 'independence.'""

""Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence,"" he added.

Those comments may allude to President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Fed and its monetary policies, which he believes are preventing stronger economic growth and keeping a lid on the stock market. Trump has also said the central bank's interest rate strategy undermines the administration's negotiating position in trade deliberations with China.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 121.5 in June, reaching its lowest level since September 2017. Conference Board senior director Lynn Franco said escalating trade fears appear to have ""shaken consumers' confidence.""

""Those survey readings of higher consumer confidence were just a lot of hot air as it turns out,"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note. ""If the Fed had had this almost ten point drop in the confidence number last week it may well have tipped the scale and led them to cut interest rates."""

The Cuyahoga River caught fire 50 years ago. These stomach-churning photos highlight why the EPA exists.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-photos-of-cuyahoga-river-on-fire-before-epa-2019-6,"Fifty years ago, on June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire.

At the time, the river was one of the most polluted in the US. Journalists filled glasses with pitch-black river water, while politicians dipped cloth into the waves that came up oil-soaked.

The river fire lasted roughly 20 minutes, but it sparked public outrage that in part led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office tasked with making sure ""Americans have clean air, land, and water.""

Take a look at what the Cuyahoga River — and other waters around the US — looked like before the EPA existed."
