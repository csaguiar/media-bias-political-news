The Trump administration is considering changing the way the government measures poverty, which has anti-poverty groups worried that many low-income individuals will be pushed off assistance programs such as food stamps, Medicaid and Head Start.

The possible change would involve adjusting the poverty line annually using a different inflation measure, one that would result in a slower increase over time.

Arloc Sherman of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says this change would mean that millions of people eventually could see their benefits either reduced or eliminated because they would no longer be considered poor.

""They have a goal, and the goal is to cut people of low or moderate income off of government assistance,"" Sherman said of the administration. He noted that the idea is being floated at the same time that the White House is proposing work requirements and steep budget cuts for safety net programs.

The administration raised the possibility of changing the poverty calculation in a notice published this week in the Federal Register. It seeks public comment on which measure of inflation should be used but does not state a preference.

The current poverty line for a family of four is about $26,000. Each year, the government adjusts the line for inflation based on the consumer price index. Among the options that the administration is considering is whether to use a version called the ""chained CPI,"" which is lower than the rate currently used. The chained CPI assumes that as the prices of goods go up, individuals substitute less expensive items, thereby reducing their overall expenses.

Some economists argue that this is a more accurate way to measure inflation, and both Barack Obama's and George W. Bush's administrations tried, without success, to introduce the use of the chained CPI in federal programs.

""It went nowhere,"" recalls Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was chief economist in the Council of Economic Advisers under Bush. Holtz-Eakin says he understands why the proposal would be controversial among anti-poverty advocates. But if they're worried about cuts in government aid, he says, it would be better to change the programs themselves rather than continue using an inaccurate measure of inflation.

""If we're going to have federal programs indexed to inflation, and we have many — we have the tax code, we have Social Security, we have the poverty index, all sorts of things — then it's important to measure inflation as correctly as possible,"" he says. Holtz-Eakin, who is president of the right-leaning American Action Forum, notes that the 2017 tax law requires that the chained CPI now be used for adjusting income tax brackets.

Still, he thinks there's less than a 50-50 chance that the change will happen because of the fierce opposition expected from those who believe they would be harmed.

Anti-poverty groups are already gearing up to block any such change, portraying it as part of a broader administration attack on the safety net. They are also fighting efforts to impose stricter work requirements on food stamp recipients and efforts to restrict housing and other aid for immigrants.

""This is a cynical attempt to squeeze working-class people. Their incomes will STILL be too low to make ends meet, but Trump's decree would make it harder for them to qualify for help,"" tweeted Melissa Boteach, of the National Women's Law Center.

She and others say the existing poverty measure is already inadequate for the needs of low-income families because it's based on a 1960s formula that assumes the average family spends about one-third of its income on food, something that is no longer the case.

The government recently began producing a supplemental poverty measure that most experts think is more accurate. It takes into account such things as medical and child care expenses, geographic differences in the cost of housing and the value of benefits such as food stamps and tax credits. But that measure is not used when determining eligibility for government programs.

Sherman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says the administration should look at the overall impact of the current poverty measure rather than cherry-pick one part that would lead to reducing benefits for low-income families.

The administration is accepting comments on the poverty calculation until June 21."
He Founded ‘Students for Trump.’ Now He Could Face Jail Time for Impersonating a Lawyer.,https://www.politico.com,['Ben Schreckinger'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/09/trump-john-lambert-students-lawsuit-jail-226802,"Ben Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.

On the eve of the last presidential election, NBC’s “Nightly News” broadcast featured two skinny college students in jackets and ties, discussing the future of American politics. They were co-founders of Students for Trump, a grassroots group that had tapped the social media power of Donald Trump’s populist movement — and of photos of bikini-clad women in MAGA hats — to become the real estate mogul’s standard-bearer on college campuses around the country.

“I see Donald Trump as reviving the Republican Party,” one of them, John Lambert, declared confidently.

Story Continued Below

Last month, Lambert, now 23, showed up in the news again. This time, he had been arrested in Tennessee on charges of wire fraud. According to the federal government, at the same time he was building a nationwide political network and serving as one of the most visible young faces of Trump’s populist movement, Lambert was also posing online as a high-powered New York lawyer, eventually making off with tens of thousands of dollars in fees he stole from unwitting clients seeking legal services.

Lambert’s rise to prominence and recent indictment offer a cautionary tale of an ambitious young man caught up in Trump’s allure — a get-rich-quick fantasy of the American dream — who allegedly managed to create his own reality on the internet, only to have the real world come barging in.

It also shines a spotlight on the chaos and confusion of Trump’s ramshackle 2016 campaign, and the cast of characters who sought fame and fortune by riding in his slipstream. Trump ran as a “law and order” candidate. But time and again, the mogul has drawn outlaws and alleged outlaws into his fold, from former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and personal fixer Michael Cohen all the way down. Though he may be the youngest, Lambert is not the first prominent Trump partisan to spend 2016 taunting Hillary Clinton about her supposed criminality, only to end up facing prison time himself instead.



***

During the 2016, Lambert was everywhere—pumping Trump on television, at campaign rallies and on campuses. Since his arrest and indictment on April 16, he has gone silent. He not yet entered a plea or spoken publicly about the charges. He did not respond to emails, and calls to a cell phone number provided by a friend returned an error message. Calls and messages to numbers for Lambert’s mother went unreturned. The only lawyer listed for Lambert in court records, public defender Julia Gatto, said she represented Lambert only for his bail hearing and was no longer in touch with him.

What happened? Part of the story of John Lambert is splashed across public records, social media posts and news reports. For the rest, POLITICO tracked down people who have known him over the years, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want their names associated with fraud charges.

Growing up in eastern Tennessee, Lambert enjoyed the trappings of a comfortable American childhood. According to friends, he was close with his mother and stepfather, and regularly accompanied his grandmother to church. His online biography frames his early life in terms that echo with country-club Republican decency. “At a young age his parents taught values of morality and deep fiscal responsibility to him,” according to the bio that was originally posted on the Students for Trump website. “He comes from a family of multigenerational business owners who helped to build the infrastructure of America.”

Lambert was also entrepreneurial. He started a social media management business while still in high school, and friends remember him voraciously watching the movie “The Wolf of Wall Street.” The 2013 flick dramatizes hard-charging investor Jordan Belfort’s rise from obscurity to riches. It ends with Belfort’s descent into infamy for masterminding a securities fraud scheme.

The film is a morality play—the lesson being that cheaters eventually get caught. But his indictment suggests that Lambert took it as an inspiration. Friends say he loved the lavish lifestyle that Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, achieved before going to prison. “It motivated him,” a friend of Lambert’s from that time said of the film.

Lambert was into cars, and when he was old enough to drive, a friend recalls, his mother bought him a brand-new BMW. He also spent countless hours playing video games, forging close friendships with boys outside his hometown, meeting them online and forming clans to play games like “Arma,” a tactical first-person shooter.

Another favorite game was “LCPDFR,” a modified version of the popular “Grand Theft Auto” franchise that allowed users to play as members of the Liberty City Police Department. The boys would split into teams to play cops and robbers. “He was always on the law enforcement side,” recalled the friend. “He didn’t really like to be on the other side.”

For college, Lambert headed off to neighboring North Carolina, to attend Campbell University, 30 miles south of Raleigh. There, he majored in Trust and Wealth Management, joined the college Republicans and aspired to go on to law school.

It was during the fall of his sophomore year that he joined forces with a fellow member of the campus GOP, freshman Ryan Fournier, to start the organization that would launch him into the news. Fournier had started a pro-Trump Twitter account that was taking off, and he enlisted Lambert’s help, making Lambert co-founder and vice chairman of Students for Trump. Lambert also served as the group’s treasurer.

As the president’s campaign gained momentum, their efforts took off with it. Students from around the country began sending photos of themselves decked out in pro-Trump gear.

The group began growing its leadership ranks and founding chapters at what would become hundreds of campuses around the U.S. “We’ve been told that we’re more organized than the actual Trump campaign,” Lambert boasted to the Chronicle of Higher Education.

Like so many other tentacles of Trump’s chaotic grassroots movement, the group was not an official part of the campaign, but it did engage in ad hoc coordination with people on, and close to, Trump’s official operation.

Guido Lombardi, a friend and neighbor of Trump’s from New York, was among the first in the mogul’s orbit to engage with the group. Lombardi, an Italian-born Mar-a-Lago member and Trump Tower resident, set up hundreds of Facebook affinity groups — with names like “Bikers for Trump” and “Latinos for Trump” — at the outset of the campaign. When the “Students for Trump” Twitter account created by Lambert and Fournier began to take off, the pair became the natural choices to take over the “Students for Trump” Facebook page Lombardi had already created.

A Trump campaign intern, in consultation with Lombardi, made the Campbell students administrators of the Facebook group. An early version of the Students for Trump website lists Lombardi, then in his mid-60s, as the group’s national director. Letterhead used by the group bears Trump Tower’s Manhattan address.

In February 2016, the group published an open letter stating that Fournier and Lambert had recently “met with Mr. Trump and top campaign officials to discuss what lies ahead for our organization. They expressed how proud they were of our efforts and members getting involved in the campaign.” One of the group’s leaders from that time said the meeting took place backstage at Trump’s February 5 rally in Florence, South Carolina.

Trump’s 2020 campaign disputes that there was any substantive relationship. “The Trump campaign did not coordinate or affiliate with Students for Trump in the 2016 campaign,” said Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications for Trump’s reelection campaign, in a statement. “In fact, the campaign sent cease and desist letters to Fournier and Lombardo that specifically disavowed their deceptive activities and demanded that they stop presenting themselves as official representatives of the campaign. They may have attended campaign events, but only in their personal capacities.”

In an interview, Lombardi — who more recently has acted as a liaison between Trump and leaders of the European far right — also distanced himself from Students for Trump, saying he stepped away not long after the students took over the Facebook group. Lombardi also criticized the group’s leadership. “It was clear to me already that some of the people in the organization were not necessarily there to promote the president, as much as to promote themselves,” Lombardi said. “There is only one superstar—his name is Trump. Donald doesn’t like to have prima donnas in the campaign.”

And Lombardi said he disapproved of one of the group’s attention-getting tactics: Its use of photos featuring college-aged women in skimpy outfits. “I understand it works, but it wasn’t really the message I was trying to convey to the students,” Lombardi said.

Fournier did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A statement on the Students for Trump website issued in response to Lambert’s indictment condemns Lambert and states that he cut ties with the group following Trump’s election.



***

The group had a flair for self-promotion that dovetailed nicely with a provocative candidate who once owned the Miss Universe pageant. Pictures of young women in Trump gear were a top draw for the social-media driven group. One photo — of twin sisters standing outside in several inches of snow, sporting American flag bikinis, one of them wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat — earned news coverage as far away as Australia.

One of those sisters, Sarah Hagmayer, served as the group’s national spokeswoman, and an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education described her as Lambert’s girlfriend, the pair having met through the group. Hagmayer did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Another viral success was “the Chalkening,” a call by the group in spring 2016, as Trump was clinching the nomination, for students to cover their campuses in pro-Trump messages written in chalk. Some of the resulting messages, such as “Fuck Mexicans” and “#StopIslam,” prompted fear and outrage on campuses across the country. But the Trump campaign approved. Dan Scavino, Trump’s former golf caddy and the campaign’s director of social media, promoted the Chalkening on Twitter.

While Lambert and Fournier were causing stirs nationwide, their digital escapades barely registered at their own school. On Campbell University's sleepy campus of 3,000 undergrads, administrators hadn't noticed that their students were becoming players in a presidential campaign until it was already a big story. “All of a sudden these kids are appearing on the news, and none of us really knew them,” recalled Britt Davis, Campbell’s vice president for institutional advancement.

As the group grew, there was drama. Andrew Nixon, a friend of Lambert’s since adolescence who had become the group’s national field director, had gone in with Lambert on a venture to produce Students for Trump merchandise. But the pair had a falling out over money, with Nixon confronting Lambert in front of other group leaders, according to a person present. Nixon was purged from the group, along with his deputy, and replaced with James Allsup, a student at Washington State University who would go on to speak at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in the summer of 2017.

The influx of merchandising money did not last long. The Trump campaign sent the group cease-and-desist letters, according to a former group leader, demanding that it stop using Trump’s name on its products. The group’s website now links to Trump’s official campaign store. (Don McGahn, who served as the Trump campaign’s counsel, did not respond to requests for comment.)

In May 2016, the group posted a photo of Lambert shaking hands with early Trump endorser Jeff Sessions, then a Republican senator from Alabama, at a campaign event. In it, the college sophomore enthusiastically points with his left hand toward the future attorney general and appears to tower over him.

According to the federal government, Lambert had another gig of sorts that summer. It was around August 2016, prosecutors say, that Lambert began setting into motion a highly profitable scheme.

Along with an unnamed co-conspirator, Lambert allegedly created a business called “Headline Consulting” to offer legal services over the internet and proceeded to create a profile on a freelancing platform under the alias Eric Pope, who was initially described as a legal consultant. Later, Lambert allegedly changed the profile to describe Pope as an attorney.

Despite this alleged undertaking, Lambert did not neglect the presidential campaign, continuing to pump Trump on social media and at campaign events. Hillary Clinton’s supposed criminality was an ongoing theme. That same month, August, Lambert tweeted, “#WheresHillary - Drumming up lies to answer questions about her server. Amazing how a federal judge can ruin your day right @HillaryClinton.”

In October, Lambert headlined a “Millennials for Trump” rally at Georgia State University alongside Milo Yiannopoulos, a protege of Trump campaign chairman Steve Bannon and the then-tech editor of Breitbart News. At the event, Lambert, speaking with a slight twang and wearing an oversized watch on his left wrist, played a game with the audience called, “Jail or White House?” In leading language, he described attributes of the presidential candidates and asked the crowd to shout out whether they deserved to be sent to jail or to the White House.

“Someone who thought it was a good idea to keep over 30,000 emails on a private server in a bathroom in New York state, and thought somehow that was legal. Jail, or White House?” Lambert asked.

“Jail!” the crowd shouted back.

“Someone who has provided over 30,000 jobs for Americans, no matter sex, gender, color, nothing. Provided nothing but jobs. Jail or White House?""

“White House!” the crowd shouted.

Clinton did not go to jail, but Trump did go to the White House. Lambert, Fournier and a few of the group’s other top leaders attended Trump’s invite-only election night party at the Midtown Hilton.

After that, Lambert left the group. He also left Campbell University. The school says he was last enrolled in 2016, and that he did not graduate.

But he allegedly kept himself busy, according to the indictment. Using the Pope alias and another, Lambert and his co-conspirator — who has been cooperating with the government — allegedly began roping in clients. Though prosecutors say he was operating out of North Carolina, Lambert allegedly used phone spoofing services to list number with New York area codes in order to further the perception he was operating out of Manhattan.

Meanwhile, the alleged scheme grew more elaborate. At some point, prosecutors say, Lambert created a website for a fictional New York law firm, Pope & Dunn. The fake firm’s slick site lists an address in New York’s financial district and declares, “Pope & Dunn have been known as a leading firm for innovation and traditional efficiency for decades.” It also lists a stable of fake attorneys with credentials from top schools. Like the real Donald Trump, the fake Eric Pope attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Pope also attended New York University’s law school, the website claims, boasting: “He is sought after for his experience with financial and corporate matters due to his ability to mitigate legal scenarios while keeping the growth of his clients’ business a focal point.”

Some of the fake attorney bios appear to have been copied and pasted directly from those of real lawyers on the website for Cravath, Swain & Moore, a top-flight New York law firm, according to New York Law Journal.

Around the summer of 2017, Lambert allegedly landed a client who was having problems with a credit reporting agency. Over the next several months, the government says, the client drained their retirement savings account to pay Lambert fees totaling more than $10,000, only to have Lambert stop responding to the client’s emails. Another client allegedly paid Lambert $1,500 for help drafting a will. Lambert also allegedly bilked money from an accountant working on behalf of an IT company in Texas, from a skincare company and from a printing company. All told, the government says, the PayPal account used by Lambert in the scheme took in more than $50,000.

Meanwhile, Students for Trump was being scrutinized by the Federal Election Commission. As of last February, the FEC had sent the group nine letters seeking financial information the group was legally required to report, according to the Daily Beast. The group blamed Lambert for the lapse.

“As you will see, all records are under John Lambert, who is no longer with SFT and hasn’t been with us for some time,” a spokeswoman told the Daily Beast at the time. Last April, the FEC shut down the group’s committee, though Students for Trump continues to operate as a grassroots group on social media.

In the years since the election, Lambert stayed in touch with friends. They were under the impression he was working at a law firm or doing some sort of business consulting — at least, until last month. As late as Monday, April 15, one longtime friend said he exchanged text messages with Lambert and got no indication that anything was amiss. The next day, Lambert was arrested.

When Lambert stopped responding to communications, friends became worried. They learned of his arrest by googling his name and finding a New York Law Journal article about it.

""He’s been a good friend to me, and I think overall he’s a nice guy,” said the friend who texted with Lambert the day before his arrest. “It kind of shocked me when I heard about this.”

Lambert appeared in court in New York in late April and was released on $20,000 bail. He stands charged of one count of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, each of which carries up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted, though the maximum sentence is rarely imposed. He is scheduled to appear for a preliminary hearing on May 29.

In the meantime, those who rode the Trump train alongside him are sorting through their confusion — wondering how someone they admired and believed in ended up the target of a federal indictment.

“The John I knew — this is just out of character for him. He cares deeply about his friends and his family,” said Abbie Green, a friend of Lambert’s who served as Students for Trump's national recruitment director. “He was maybe caught up with the wrong people and distracted by the glamour of a legal career. He’s very smart, he has the skills, so I’m just surprised he would take a shortcut to pursue his dreams.”

Green predicted that Lambert would bounce back. “I think he’ll definitely learn from this experience,” she said. “He was never one to make the same mistake twice.”

Despite Lambert’s personal problems, and the campaign’s disavowal, the group he launched continues to enjoy the president’s seal of approval. On Saturday, Trump retweeted a message from Students for Trump to his 60 million followers. “With President Trump leading us,” it said, “America is a BETTER and SAFER place.”"
Trump turns shooting migrants into a punchline at Florida rally,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/9/18538124/trump-panama-city-beach-rally-shooting-migrants,"With an assist from one of his fans, President Donald Trump turned the idea of shooting migrants and asylum seekers who try to cross the southern border into a punchline during his campaign speech on Wednesday evening in Panama City Beach, Florida.

Referring to border agents who deal with undocumented border crossers, Trump brought up the possibility of using deadly force, but quickly ruled out the idea, saying he “would never do that.”

“And don’t forget — we don’t let them and we can’t let them use weapons. We can’t,” Trump said. “Other countries do. We can’t. I would never do that. But how do you stop these people? You can’t. There’s—”

Before Trump could finish his thought, a woman in the audience yelled out. While it was unclear exactly what she said during television coverage of the event, numerous eyewitnesses reported she said, “Shoot them!”

Trump apparently found the suggestion amusing. He gestured at the person who yelled and said, “That’s only in the Panhandle, you can get away with that statement. Only in the Panhandle!”

Watch:

Trump’s latest rally came just a day after Ken Klippenstein of the Young Turks published information from a Freedom of Information Act request indicating that a border militia member said of migrants, “Why are we just apprehending them and not lining them up and shooting them. ... We have to go back to Hitler days and put them all in a gas chamber.”

Trump may have laughed off the suggestion at his rally, but he has earnestly raised the possibility of shooting migrants in the past. During a news conference in November, he said of clashes along the border, “I will tell you this, anybody throwing stones, rocks ... we will consider that a firearm, because there’s not much difference when you get hit in the face with a rock.” Trump’s comments on that occasion were widely criticized, and he tried to walk them back the next day.

Trump’s latest rally was an ugly scene

Trump also explicitly mocked asylum seekers and their lawyers, who he ominously claimed are “paid by somebody that’s not exactly friendly to this crowd.”

He pushed a conspiracy theory about migrants representing an “invasion” of the country — the same notion that motivated a gunman to open fire at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October, killing 11. He suggested, without evidence, that migrants avoid crossing the border at ports of entry because they have women tied up in their cars.

Trump also spread his now-familiar lie about abortion — that Democrats and health care providers support legislation that would legalize the murder of babies.

In short, the president’s 2020 campaign is shaping up to be extremely ugly. And his fans mostly continue to eat it up with resounding “lock her up!” chants and shouted comments that only reinforce Trump’s darkest instincts.

The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday recommended holding Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to provide an unredacted version of the special counsel’s report and its underlying evidence to Congress.

The 24-to-16 vote, along party lines, came hours after President Trump asserted executive privilege to shield the report. The Justice Department, which asked the president to step in, called the vote “politically motivated and unnecessary.”

Last year, when Pompeo was tapped for secretary of state, Senator Jeff Merkley declared, “A vote for Mr. Pompeo is a vote for Trump’s War Cabinet, and for that reason, I will fiercely oppose his nomination.” Today, there are even more reasons to fear additional war-making, and, as ever, reasons to fear the ability of the commander in chief to resolve a conflict.

Nothing since World War II has damaged America more than ill-conceived wars of choice.

Yet the grassroots anti-war movement that filled the streets prior to the invasion of Iraq has all but disappeared, Congress seems content to allow Trump to defy even the explicit resolution it passed against war in Yemen, and Senator Lindsey Graham, who urged the United States into several foreign-policy debacles, is openly stating, “I don’t care about voting on the use of force.”

Nadler made the claim during a fiery interview on Wednesday night.

“This is a lawless administration. It is denying the American people the information they need by defying all subpoenas,” he told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, after his committee voted to hold the attorney general in contempt for defying a subpoena for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted Russia report and underlying documents.

“It's the first administration you've ever seen where they say we'll deny all subpoenas from Congress whether it's on the mole investigation or on security clearances or in anything else they defy the law.

NADLER DECLARES 'CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS' AFTER CONTEMPT VOTE, ACCUSES TRUMP OF ATTACKING 'ESSENCE OF OUR DEMOCRACY'

“The law very clearly says that upon request by the ways and means committee that the IRS should turn over anybody's taxes. They're simply ignoring that. So they're ignoring the law and they're stonewalling and hoping that they can get away with it we cannot have a situation where the president becomes a king or a dictator.”

He continued: “The American people understand that no. Nobody. Not the president, nobody may be above the law. And we have to enforce that.”

The explosive assessment came after Nadler earlier told reporters the country has reached a “constitutional crisis”.

""We've talked for a long time about approaching a constitutional crisis. We are now in it,"" Nadler told the press on Wednesday. Although he pushed back on impeachment as an option, he indicated that the United States was at a critical time of testing whether it could stay a republic or transition into a tyrannical form government.

TRUMP INVOKES EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER MUELLER REPORT: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS

Nadler's committee voted along partisan lines to hold Barr in contempt on Wednesday and angered the White House by not delaying the vote. At the same time, the president invoked executive privilege — refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas.

Nadler also compared Trump to former President Richard Nixon in that both refused to release information by citing executive privilege.

Nadler recalled the Supreme Court decision forcing Nixon to hand over tapes of his private conversations with advisers, which he said were the ""most sensitive to executive privilege.""

""The Supreme Court ruled eight to nothing that the interests of the public in justice and in accountability outweighed the interest of the president in privacy,"" he said.

The White House, in asserting executive privilege, accused Nadler of engaging in a ""blatant abuse of power.""

“Unfortunately, rather than allowing negotiations to continue, you scheduled an unnecessary contempt vote, which you refused to postpone to allow additional time for compromise,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote to the committee."

Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over Robert S. Mueller III’s unredacted report, hours after President Trump asserted executive privilege to shield the full report and underlying evidence from Congress.

The committee’s 24-to-16 contempt vote, taken after hours of debate over the future of American democracy, was the first official House action to punish a government official in the standoff over the Mueller report. The Justice Department denounced the move as unnecessary and intended to stoke a fight.

After the vote, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, swatted away questions about possible impeachment, but added, “We are now in a constitutional crisis.”

The contempt vote raised the stakes in the battle over evidence and witnesses as Democrats investigate Mr. Trump over behavior detailed by Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, in his report into Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice. By the day’s end, it seemed all but inevitable that the competing claims would have to be settled in the nation’s courts rather than on Capitol Hill."

And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

Suicides on VA properties sound the alarm on veteran care,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Dean Reynolds'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-military-veteran-suicides-on-veterans-affairs-properties-sound-the-alarm-on-veteran-care/,"Veterans can talk with a trained counselor through the Veterans Crisis Line.

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Justin Miller Miller family

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."
"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"
Settlement in Fast and Furious executive privilege lawsuit between DOJ and the House,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/fast-and-furious-settlement-doj-house/index.html,"(CNN) Amid the contempt and privilege fight over the Mueller report in Congress on Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Justice Department are trying to end another major battle over executive privilege that has lasted years.

The Democrat-led House and the Justice Department announced to a federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday that they had reached a settlement in the Operation Fast and Furious court case, which began as an Obama-era privilege standoff over a subpoena from Congress.

It led to the then-Republican-controlled House holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012, yet the litigation dragged on. A previous attempt last year to end the court fight was stopped by a trial-court judge, after the two sides sought to throw out her opinions in the case because of how they could play into future privilege fights.

The long-running case was a persistent reminder in recent years of how long a court fight over privilege can take -- especially on the same day a congressional committee voted to approve holding now-Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to turn over the full unredacted Mueller report, and the White House asserted executive privilege over the report's entirety to stymie Congress. The Mueller report clash appears to be headed for court.

In the Fast and Furious case, the House was seeking documents in response to a subpoena regarding an ill-fated program that sought to track guns that federal agents allowed into Mexico. The Justice Department initially asserted privilege over all the documents, and even after years of litigation still refused to give Congress some information about the program.

Justice Department charges Deep Dot Web administrators with money laundering – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/doj-deep-dot-web-indictment/,"U.S. prosecutors have formally brought charges against the alleged co-owners and administrators of Deep Dot Web, who were arrested Tuesday.

Tal Prihar, 37, and Michael Phan, 34 — both Israeli citizens — were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to a newly unsealed indictment.

Prihar, who resided in Brazil, was arrested by French police in Paris on Monday, while Phan was arrested by Israeli police in a simultaneous raid.

The two are accused of making millions of dollars in commission from Deep Dot Web, a website featuring news, reviews and information about dark web sites and marketplaces. Prosecutors said the administrators made their commission by linking to marketplaces on the dark web — only accessible through Tor, an encrypted anonymity network.

Many of the dark web marketplaces sold drugs, weapons and stolen data, which hackers could use to break into online accounts.

A staffer at Deep Dot Web said in a Medium post following the arrests that Deep Dot Web would generate a slice of the revenue from purchases made on dark web marketplaces, said to be as much as 4%. Brazil’s federal police said in a statement the site made millions in dollars in cryptocurrency from referral sales from more than 15,000 dark web users.

Following the arrests, the FBI seized Deep Dot Web’s website.

“It was truly a 50:50 partnership between the two defendants,” said Scott Brady, U.S. attorney for Western Philadelphia, in a press conference in Pittsburgh on Wednesday announcing the charges.

According to the district attorney, more than 23% of all transactions made on AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace taken down by authorities in 2017, were associated with a referral link from Deep Dot Web. The indictment also said Deep Dot Web referred more than 198,000 users to Hansa, another defunct market, accounting for nearly half of the site’s users, of which Deep Dot Web “received a commission on all of those users’ purchases.”

The indictment said Prihar and Phan made about 8,155 bitcoins in total — almost half of which was collected from AlphaBay. Prosecutors said at its peak, the bitcoins were worth more than $15.4 million.

“This is the single most significant law enforcement disruption of the dark net to date,” said Brady."
State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"
"Opinion | Sorry, Steve Mnuchin. Congress Has a Right to See Trump’s Tax Returns.",https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/opinion/trump-tax-returns-congress.html,"As to whether Congress may obtain a president’s tax returns, there is no ambiguity : Federal law empowers the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to submit a written request to the Treasury Department , which oversees the Internal Revenue Service, for “any return or return information.” The Treasury secretary then “shall furnish” the requested information to the committee so that it may conduct its legislative functions.

Perhaps that statute is not clear enough for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The secretary on Monday rebuffed just such a request from Representative Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. In April, Mr. Neal requested six years’ worth of federal tax returns for President Trump and several of his companies.

The purpose of the request was not “harassment” of the president, as Mr. Trump and his defenders have branded efforts by Democratic House members to perform legitimate oversight functions. Rather, as Mr. Neal told the I.R.S., the committee “is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our federal tax laws, including, but not limited to, the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president.”

In a letter responding to Mr. Neal on Monday, Mr. Mnuchin said he consulted with the Justice Department and determined that the chairman’s request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and that the Treasury Department “may not lawfully fulfill the committee’s request.”"
DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI’s use of unverified Steele dossier,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-homing-in-on-fbis-use-of-unverified-steele-dossier,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating the FBI’s reliance on the unverified dossier produced by British ex-spy Christopher Steele in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate “despite questions about [Steele’s] credibility.""

Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reports Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele, described as a “key source”, who was used to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants against former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

This is part of Horowitz’s broad investigation into alleged FISA abuse and more.

Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS, which had reached out to and contracted Steele.

The new Wall Street Journal report says the inspector general’s office “has been asking why the FBI continued to cite Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications.” And a specific focus of Horowitz’s team is apparently “a news report cited extensively in the [FISA] applications that appeared to bolster Steele’s credibility… [which] said U.S. intelligence officials were investigating allegations similar to those Steele had raised.”

The “news report” was written by Yahoo News journalist Michael Isikoff, who said he was stunned when he learned that his September 2016 article for Yahoo News was used in the FISA applications targeting Carter Page to bolster Steele’s credibility, despite his source being Steele himself. Iskoff said “it’s self-referential” and “it seems a little odd that they would cite the Yahoo News story about the matter they are investigating themselves based on the same material that had been separately presented to the FBI.”

Isikoff personally met with Steele in person in September 2016. Also at the meeting was Isikoff’s “old friend” Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS. The three of them talked about Trump and Russia and Steele provided him with some of his research.

Isikoff now admits that everyone should have been more cautious about Steele’s information. “I think it’s fair to say that all of us should have approached this, in retrospect, with more skepticism, particularly when we didn’t know where it was coming from,” Isikoff said. “We knew that Steele compiled it, but that Steele did not hear these allegations himself. Somebody else heard them from others and then passed them along. That’s thirdhand stuff, which is not usually the kind you want for publishing.”

In the FISA renewal applications, which spanned until June 2017, the FBI continued to insist that it didn’t think Steele was Isikoff’s source even though Steele himself had said that he was by the spring of 2017.

The Wall Street Journal report says “investigators have also asked about an internal FBI evaluation of Steele’s credibility that found his reporting had been ‘minimally corroborated’ even as it also said he had provided information ‘of value’ to the U.S. intelligence community.” The report says “the evaluation was reflected in a ‘human source validation report’ written by a unit of the FBI after the bureau cut off its relationship with Steele in October 2016… because of his disclosures to the media about his work for the FBI.”

Heavily redacted FBI records unearthed through Freedom of Information Act litigation in 2018 show that Steele was cut off as a confidential human source because of his improper disclosures to third parties and that his “handling agent advised [Steele] that [Confidential Human Source] was not to operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the FBI.”

According to a New York Times report from April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

For its part, Fusion GPS told the Washington Examiner that it stands by Steele’s dossier, claiming that “to our knowledge, nothing in the Steele memoranda has been disproven.”

Journalist Bob Woodward has been calling Steele’s dossier “garbage” for more than two years. And former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman said: “I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago… It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.” A number of Steele’s biggest claims — including its allegation from ""Kremlin insiders"" that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers — were knocked down by special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Attorney General William Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the DOJ and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

Barr has said Horowitz’s investigation should be completed in either May or June."
Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

Presidents have used executive privilege to withhold information from Congress, the courts or the public and have sparked major controversies in the past.

Here are five recent examples and their outcomes.

Richard Nixon

Nixon invoked executive privilege six times during his presidency, mostly related to the Watergate break-in that led to his resignation.

In the 1974 case United States v. Nixon, he asserted his right to withhold information in response to a demand by special prosecutor Leon Jaworski that he surrender tape recordings made in the Oval Office.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously on July 24 against Nixon’s argument that under executive privilege, he had the right to withhold sensitive information from other branches of government.

While the Court noted there were cases when executive privilege was necessary to protect confidential communications, Nixon’s rejection of the subpoena did not fit the bill.

“We conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice,” Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote. “The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.”

Nixon resigned weeks later.

Ronald Reagan

Reagan invoked executive privilege on three occasions, most notably in 1986 during the confirmation process for Associate Justice William Rehnquist, his nominee for chief justice of the Supreme Court.

Reagan used the privilege to prevent the release of memos Rehnquist wrote when he was an adviser to former Attorney General John Mitchell. The memos covered 1969 to 1971 and included material on the killing of four Kent State University students by members of the Ohio National Guard in 1970 and an attempt by Nixon’s so-called plumbers to steal the psychiatric records of whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.

Within a week, the White House reached an agreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee to turn over the documents, largely brokered by former Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), a close ally of Reagan’s.

Rehnquist went on to be confirmed 65-33.

Bill Clinton

Clinton asserted executive privilege 14 times, some of them not in writing, but in 1998 became the first president since Nixon to have his use of the power struck down in court.

Clinton sought to invoke executive privilege to bar independent counsel Kenneth Starr from questioning aides, including deputy counsel Bruce R. Lindsey and communications adviser Sidney Blumenthal, in connection with Clinton’s relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that Starr’s need to collect evidence trumped Clinton’s interest in keeping the conversations confidential, echoing the rationale in U.S. v. Nixon.

George W. Bush

The Bush administration invoked executive privilege six times, four of them in the summer of 2007. Notably, in August 2007, Bush invoked executive privilege to shield White House adviser Karl Rove from a Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena relating to the firing of nine U.S. attorneys.

Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy Patrick Joseph LeahyFive times presidents sparked controversy using executive privilege McConnell eyes end-of-month deadline as disaster aid hits new 'obstacles' Schumer blasts Trump over Puerto Rico aid MORE (D-Vt.) pushed back, saying that Bush was not involved in the firings and as such could not invoke executive privilege.

When a House panel subpoenaed Rove on the same issue in 2008, he claimed to be exempt under the same assertion of executive privilege.

The House Judiciary Committee voted 20-14 to hold Rove in contempt of Congress. The full House never took up the contempt citation against Rove.

Rove eventually testified before the panel behind closed doors in March 2009.

Barack Obama

The Obama administration asserted executive privilege in June 2012 in response to a House investigation of Operation Fast and Furious, a controversial “gunwalking” operation in which the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed the running of guns in hopes that they could be tracked to Mexican drug cartel figures.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa Darrell Edward IssaFive times presidents sparked controversy using executive privilege GOP plots comeback in Orange County The Hill's Morning Report — Shutdown fallout — economic distress MORE (R-Calif.) demanded documents relating to the Justice Department’s response to the operation, which Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderHouse panel votes to hold Barr in contempt Five times presidents sparked controversy using executive privilege House subpoena fights imperil interbranch comity MORE refused to provide.

The committee voted 23-17 to hold Holder in contempt of Congress for his failure to release the documents, with the full chamber voting in favor of contempt 255-67.

The Justice Department cited executive privilege again to decline to prosecute him on the contempt charge.

Nearly four years later, District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled against Obama’s assertion of executive privilege, writing that existing disclosures relating to the operation cast doubt on the idea that the documents at issue must remain confidential.

""The Department itself has already publicly revealed the sum and substance of the very material it is now seeking to withhold,” she wrote. “Since any harm that would flow from the disclosures sought here would be merely incremental, the records must be produced.""

The administration turned over the records in April 2016."

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

Labor Dispute Opens New Front in Fight to Privatize the VA,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/labor-dispute-veterans-affairs-privatization.html,"Robert Wilkie. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn’t privatize the VA’s health-care services. He’s since repeated that promise to veterans themselves. “The private sector cannot replicate VA’s expertise in things like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, rehabilitative services, prosthetics, audiology, services for the blind, suicide prevention,” he told members of the American Legion in 2018.

But Wilkie was nominated by President Trump, who has surrounded himself with advocates for the privatization of the VA since taking office. His decision to fire Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin, an Obama appointee who opposed privatization, may not have had as much to do with Shulkin’s alleged spending improprieties as it did with months of sustained lobbying against the secretary from allies of Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-backed advocacy group supports an expansion of private-sector care for veterans — and Wilkie, since his confirmation, has deviated little from that goal.

On Wilkie’s watch, the VA has begun to shrink. (The VA reached out following publication to dispute this, stating: ‘Since last quarter, VA achieved a net increase of 3,043 employees and maintained a vacancy rate of approximately 11 percent.”) The department, which provides free or low-cost health care to around 9 million enrolled veterans as part of its mission to support former service members, has nearly 49,000 unfilled vacancies. Meanwhile, the Mission Act, which will expand the VA’s privatized community-care network for eligible veterans, is scheduled to take effect in June.

Now, a nascent contract dispute between the VA and the American Federation of Government Employees may bolster fears that Wilkie’s reforms are privatization in all but name. On Thursday, the VA submitted a proposal to renegotiate its collective-bargaining agreement with the AFGE, which represents around 250,000 department employees. The department’s proposals would drastically reduce the amount of time employees are allowed to spend on union business during the workday, among other changes. In a press release, the VA said it hoped to reduce staffers’ union time from 1 million hours per year to around 10,000, a change that would, it claimed, direct “more than $48 million per year” back to aiding veterans. The press release was otherwise light on detail, though in it, Secretary Wilkie described this as “a reset” of the VA’s relationship with the AFGE. “With VA facing thousands of vacancies, these proposals could add more than 1 million man-hours per year back into our work force — a vital influx of resources that would make an almost immediate difference for veterans and the employees who care for them,” Wilkie said.

These restrictions on union time would make it difficult, if not quite impossible, for staff to conduct legally permissible union business during work hours. And the VA’s plan goes even further. According to a copy of the proposal package provided by the union, the VA wants to eliminate 28 provisions of the department’s current collective-bargaining agreement. Union representatives would lose their offices inside VA facilities, and could no longer use VA equipment to carry out their duties. The department’s new contract with AFGE would last for ten years, but only the VA could make changes to it during that time; the union would be prohibited from doing the same. The VA seeks to weaken the grievance procedures set out in its previous agreement with AFGE. Communication between the union and the department would have to take place entirely at the national level. Employees who need to file grievances, for example, would no longer be able to do so at the local level. The union believes this could create a bottleneck that would slow the processing of employee grievances. The union also alleges that at least two of the VA’s proposals — to require the union to pay for the time management spends on union business, and to pay attorneys’ fees to the VA — would violate existing labor law.

Contacted for comment, VA press secretary Curt Cashour directed New York to a May 2 editorial published by Wilkie on InsideSources.com. In it, the secretary said that the department’s reforms would “make sure that the contract does not interfere with the department’s ability to take action against poor performers” and eliminate language in the previous agreement that “has effectively allowed the union to co-manage the VA.”

Asked specifically about the union’s claim that some of the proposals are illegal, Cashour said, “When department employees and attorneys — at the demand of the union — are required to cease providing medical care and support for veteran services, to prepare for and engage in union-demanded activities such as grievances, disciplinary appeals, or arbitration, it’s only fair for the union to reimburse taxpayers for this time spent not taking care of veterans.”

David Cann, AFGE’s director of field services and education, told New York on Monday that the VA’s proposals “are unique.” He added, “What I’m seeing out of the VA is the most both-barrels anti-union effort that I’ve seen in my time with AFGE.” The VA’s proposals resemble executive orders that Trump signed last May. One would have significantly reduced the amount of time that federal workers are allowed to spend on union business. AFGE sued the administration and won an injunction in August that blocked certain provisions of the orders from going forward. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, and the case is ongoing. “For whatever reason, the VA is acting in contravention of that injunction, and proposing limitations on the rights of members that are exactly the same as what the court has said they’re not allowed to do,” Cann said.

The VA’s proposal package seems to be “a clear case of failing to bargain in good faith, which is an unfair labor practice under the relevant statute,” Joseph Slater, the Eugene M. Balk professor of law and values at the University of Toledo, told New York in an email. Slater, who has reviewed a summary of the VA’s proposals, added that provisions “strike me as illegal bargaining proposals on their own,” including the provision that would allow only the VA to make changes to the contract once it’s in place. “The ten-year duration is clearly trying to lock in extreme terms for an unusually long time, which is commonly held to be bargaining in bad faith. Eliminating procedures and appropriate arrangements generally seems legally dicey to me too, as those are statutory rights,” he continued.

“I could go on,” he concluded, “but this is a set of radical, unworkable proposals that no union would agree to.”

The VA isn’t the first federal agency to call for a draconian renegotiation of its collective-bargaining agreement with AFGE. The Social Security Administration has proposed similar changes to its union contract, down to the removal of union representatives from their offices inside SSA buildings. Contract negotiations with AFGE may become not just a backdoor for the Trump administration to get around the injunction, but the locus at which its antipathy to the federal workforce meets its hostility toward unions.

The first two years of Trump’s presidency have already been difficult for the federal workforce. One of Trump’s first actions as president was to implement a temporary federal hiring freeze. He’s overseen two significant government shutdowns, the most recent of which lasted for five weeks and cost federal employees two pay periods. (Though federal workers received back pay after the government reopened, many federal contractors did not.) The VA isn’t the only federal agency facing a staffing crisis, either. Though the status of the VA’s workforce has a clear, disproportionate effect on veterans, so too does the state of the federal workforce at large. A third of federal employees are veterans. Cann told New York that AFGE believes that figure is even higher for employees of the VA.

But the fact that Wilkie is pursuing certain conflict with AFGE, instead of filling his department’s vacancies, kindles a fear specific to the VA: that the secretary intends to let the VA atrophy and funnel more and more veterans into private medical care. “If we really want to fix the VA so badly, let’s start hiring, and fill up some of those 49,000 [staff] vacancies,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town hall co-sponsored by National Nurses United and CommonDefense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group.

There’s no question that the VA suffers from systemic problems. Twenty-four veterans have died by suicide on VA campuses during the last 18 months, the Military Times reported in April. The department’s tech problems are so pronounced that implementation of the Mission Act may prove disastrous. According to ProPublica, a planned tool to help determine which veterans are eligible for private community care is so unreliable that “it threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.” Nevertheless, a joint study from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the White River Junction VA Medical Center found that VA medical facilities achieve health-care outcomes that are consistently as good as, or even better than, private alternatives in 121 regional markets. In polling, veterans themselves reliably oppose privatization, though they’re less hostile to the notion of some community-based choices as a supplement to the VA’s public services. The American Legion, like every other major veterans’ service organization, opposes privatization of the VA.

Alexander McCoy, the political director of Common Defense and a former Marine, told New York that his organization is watching the labor dispute closely. “The secretary of Veterans Affairs and Trump are trying to use veterans as props for union-busting,” he said. “This isn’t about improving our health care or fixing problems with the VA. They’re punishing workers for their own campaign to starve the VA.”

Kate Hoit, an Army veteran affiliated with VoteVets, a progressive organization that has repeatedly sued the Trump administration for its handling of the VA, agreed. “First and foremost, our concerns rest in the fact that the changes in the collective bargaining agreement will make the VA a worse place to work and therefore result in worse care for veterans,” Hoit said in a statement to New York.

Private-sector unions, too, worry that the VA’s contract proposals belie its commitment to privatization. Sara Nelson, who heads the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and called for a general strike in response to the latest government shutdown, said that it’s “no surprise” that the Trump administration would target AFGE’s VA members, who have traditionally enjoyed a robust contract. “It’s all a direct attack on VA workers and their union,” Nelson said in a statement to New York. “Why? Because they are the ones demanding accountability at the VA, they are the ones blowing the whistle on waste and fraud, they are the ones standing in the way of privatization. That’s the ultimate goal: privatize the VA so the giant health care corporations can reap the billions spent on caring for our veterans, ignoring the fact that veterans overwhelmingly prefer the VA to private healthcare.”

AFGE will likely need all the support it can get. Slater, the law professor, cautioned that if the union wanted to file an unfair labor practices charge against the VA, it may have difficulty finding relief. Trump took until March of this year to nominate a general counsel to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the body responsible for addressing labor grievances against federal agencies. Unions have already criticized Trump’s FLRA pick, Catherine Bird. National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon told Bloomberg Law that Bird, who formerly worked in the office of general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services, was “directly involved in the agency’s bad faith bargaining last year.” Reardon added that his union has filed four grievances against HHS for unfair labor practices. Even if Bird is confirmed, Bloomberg Law said she’ll have to process an extensive backlog of cases because the office has been vacant for two years.

Federal law also prohibits VA employees from going on strike, which further restricts AFGE’s options as it navigates contract negotiations. But Cann said that the union is considering other forms of direct action. “Getting people involved, doing petitions, doing informational rallies, applying pressure on the agency by pointing out their hypocrisy and their anti-union animus, reaching out to the handful of friends we have on the Hill, we plan on doing all of that,” he said, adding, “We’re counting on employees who care so much about the work they do as caregivers to veterans to be willing to stand up, and get involved in this campaign, and object to having their voices silenced.”

"Top US general: Pentagon, DHS working on 'multiyear plan' for border",https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/442758-top-us-general-pentagon-dhs-working-on-multi-year-plan-for-border,"The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday said that the Pentagon is working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a “multiyear plan"" for the border, suggesting that active duty and National Guard troops will be deployed to the southern border for the remainder of President’s Trump's first term.

“What we’re hopeful to do is to have, in fairly short order, for the secretary of Homeland Security, a much more predictable, comprehensive plan for the next couple years,” Gen. Joseph Dunford said during a Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee hearing.

The Defense Department has provided a two-star general “plus a number of planners” to DHS “to “lay out the next couple of years.”

Dunford said the so-called interagency planning team will prepare around the number of migrants expected to come to the southern U.S. border, the capacity of DHS to handle the migrants and the expected support DHS will need from the rest of the government.

“Although the commitment to the border hasn’t impacted our preparedness for other missions at this point, what we wanted to do is get into a more predictable mode of the requirements that the Department of Homeland Security has and do better at integrating across the government,” Dunford said.

There are now about 4,364 U.S. service member at the border, a mix of active-duty and National Guard members, according to acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who testified alongside Dunford.

About 1,167 of the service members are performing the primary role of monitoring and detection, but a broader set of missions range from logistical support to aviation support to food service.

The administration has said troops will stay at such posts until DHS “no longer requires [Department of Defense] support to secure the southern border.”

As of last month, the deployment is expected to cost at least $534 million by the end of the fiscal year in September.

Late last month, Shanahan approved a DHS request to send about 320 more military personnel to help with handling migrants entering the United States, easing restrictions on troops interacting with migrants.

In addition, the Army Corps of Engineer is currently on contract to build about 256 miles of barrier.

“How you will see this materialize in the next six months is about 63 new miles of wall will come online, so about half a mile a day will be produced,” Shanahan said."

The House Judiciary Committee will proceed with a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday, Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) confirmed late Monday, as the Justice Department attempts to fend off the effort ahead of a negotiating session with the Democratic-led committee on Tuesday.

Nadler's firm stance comes as he seeks punitive actions against the attorney general for defying a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report on the Russia investigation and its underlying evidence. It also comes hours after the Justice Department put forward a last-ditch plea to negotiate with the panel, offering a Wednesday meeting but later agreeing to Nadler’s demand for a Tuesday sit-down.

“At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand,” Nadler said in a statement. “My hope is that we make concrete progress at tomorrow’s meeting towards resolving this dispute. The committee remains committed to finding a reasonable accommodation.”

In a letter to Nadler earlier Monday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd invited the chairman to a negotiation session on Wednesday to discuss an “acceptable accommodation” that would potentially give more lawmakers access to a less-redacted version of the report, in addition to “possible disclosure of certain materials” cited in Mueller’s report.

Boyd’s letter came hours after the committee took its first formal step toward holding Barr in contempt of Congress for defying the panel’s subpoena for Mueller's unredacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, when Nadler announced that it planned to consider a contempt citation against Barr on Wednesday morning.

A vote of approval from the Democrat-led committee would send the measure to the full House for consideration later this month. Nadler said he would put the contempt proceedings on hold if the Justice Department engages in a “good-faith” effort to give Democrats access to the requested information.

“The attorney general’s failure to comply with our subpoena, after extensive accommodation efforts, leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings in order to enforce the subpoena and access the full, unredacted report,” Nadler said in a statement before the DOJ released its letter.

Democrats have argued that the redacted version Barr made public last month is insufficient to consider a potential congressional response to Mueller's findings, particularly his evidence that President Donald Trump attempted to thwart the investigation.

The committee launched its own obstruction of justice investigation against the president earlier this year. The contempt citation explicitly mentions that probe, which is also centered on allegations of “public corruption and other abuses of power” by the president.

“Attorney General Barr failed to comply with the committee’s request for these documents and thereby has hindered the committee’s constitutional, oversight, and legislative functions,” the citation states.

The contempt citation also references the Justice Department’s long-standing policy against indicting a sitting president, noting that Mueller accepted those guidelines in declining to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.

“Congress is therefore the only body able to hold the president to account for improper conduct in our tripartite system, and urgently requires the subpoenaed material to determine whether and how to proceed with its constitutional duty to provide checks and balances on the president and executive branch,” the citation states. “Otherwise, the president remains insulated from legal consequences and sits above the law.”

The Justice Department said last week it would not comply with the committee’s subpoena for the unredacted report and the underlying evidence, arguing that it amounts to illegitimate congressional oversight. Nadler gave Barr until Monday morning to respond to an augmented offer; the Justice Department did not respond to that offer, and has maintained that it would be violating the law if it complied with the Democrats’ request.

Boyd slammed Nadler for refusing to view the less-redacted version of Mueller’s report, which still includes redactions of grand-jury information. Boyd said Nadler’s refusal “naturally raises questions about the sincerity of the committee’s interest in and purported need for the redacted material.”

All six House and Senate Democrats declined to read the less-redacted version of the report offered to a select group of senior lawmakers, arguing that the offer should have included dozens more members of the committees investigating matters connected to Mueller's findings.

In response to the formal contempt notice on Monday, the committee’s top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, called Nadler’s move “illogical and disingenuous” because the Justice Department is still negotiating with the panel.

“Democrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,” Collins said in a statement.

Democrats have been demanding Mueller's complete report and underlying evidence for months, a call that intensified after Mueller submitted his findings to Barr in late March. But Barr held on to the report for a month while he reviewed and redacted it for several categories of sensitive information. The public version of the report he released contained limited redactions but included none of Mueller's underlying material — evidence Democrats say they need to determine whether Trump committed impeachable offenses.

Though Mueller concluded that he lacked sufficient evidence to prove any Americans aided the vast Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 election, he described repeated efforts by Trump to sideline the investigation altogether and to encourage witnesses to refrain from full cooperation.

Mueller did not formally conclude that Trump obstructed justice — a determination he said was largely a result of the DOJ restrictions against indicting a sitting president — but Barr has since used Mueller's evidence to absolve Trump of the potential crime.

Barr testified for five hours to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and described sharp disagreements with the legal theories undergirding Mueller's findings — including whether Trump's tweets can be persuasive evidence of obstruction and suggesting Mueller told him privately, despite not indicating it in his report, that his obstruction decision was not based on the longstanding DOJ restriction.

Barr skipped a hearing House Democrats had called last Thursday after his aides objected to Democrats' request to allow committee lawyers from both parties to question Barr for 30 minutes each. Democrats previously authorized Nadler to subpoena Barr a second time to compel his appearance before their committee, though he hasn't issued it yet.

The impact of a contempt citation could be simply symbolic. Republicans held Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents. Some Democrats have floated the possibility of using punitive enforcement mechanisms against Barr for defying their subpoena, including levying fines against the attorney general.

California moves to ban farm pesticide that Trump's EPA has defended,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Jeff Daniels', 'Damian Dovarganes']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/california-moves-to-ban-farm-pesticide-that-trumps-epa-has-defended.html,"LOS ANGELES — California regulators moved Wednesday to ban chlorpyrifos, a controversial pesticide used on almond, citrus and grape crops in the nation's largest agricultural state.

California's planned ban follows Hawaii and New York announcing similar moves against chlorpyrifos, a widely used chemical in farming that environmentalists claim is harmful to children and farmworkers.

Chlorpyrifos is manufactured by DowDuPont, which has insisted the pesticide is safe. Dow has lobbied the Trump administration to keep chlorpyrifos available for crops.

California plans to phase out the use of the pesticide statewide in a process that could take up to two years. New York lawmakers approved a ban April 30 that would end the use of chlorpyrifos in the state by 2021, while Hawaii's ban, announced last year, won't take effect until late 2022.

""California's action to cancel the registration of chlorpyrifos is needed to prevent the significant harm this pesticide causes children, farm workers and vulnerable communities,"" Jared Blumenfeld, secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, or CalEPA, said in a statement. ""This action also represents a historic opportunity for California to develop a new framework for alternative pest management practices.""

According to CalEPA, ""the decision to ban chlorpyrifos follows mounting evidence, including recent findings by the state's independent Scientific Review Panel on Toxic Air Contaminants, that the pesticide causes serious health effects in children and other sensitive populations at lower levels of exposure than previously understood. These effects include impaired brain and neurological development.""

In April, CalEPA regulators formally listed chlorpyrifos as a ""toxic air contaminant,"" meaning the state believed it ""may pose a present or potential hazard to human health."" It said the move was done ""to protect the health of farm workers and others living and working near where the pesticide is used.""

CalEPA said Wednesday that chlorpyrifos use has declined in California in the past decade as farmers ""have shifted to safer alternatives."" It said use of the pesticide dropped more than 50% from 2 million pounds in 2005 to just over 900,000 pounds in 2016.

In March 2017, the Trump administration moved to show its support for chlorpyrifos. Then-U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt rejected an attempt to ban the pesticide for use on food crops such as fruits, vegetables and nuts.

The largest agricultural market currently for chlorpyrifos is corn, according to the agency.

In 2016 the federal EPA, under President Barack Obama, moved to restrict use of chlorpyrifos after being petitioned by several environmental groups. Dow challenged the agency, saying its ""assessment lacks scientific vigor.""

In supporting chlorpyrifos, Dow previously has said ""growers face limited or no viable alternatives to chlorpyrifos. When an outbreak of a new pest occurs, growers look to chlorpyrifos as a proven first-line of defense.""

DowDuPont did not immediately reply to CNBC's request for comment Wednesday.

Chlorpyrifos is used in more than 90 countries. Most household uses of the chemical ended in 2000, but it has remained popular in farming."
Reality Check: Can You Be Too Old To Be President? – WCCO,https://minnesota.cbslocal.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/05/08/reality-check-can-you-be-too-old-to-be-president/,"



— There’s a wide open field of new, young presidential candidates for 2020. But the current frontrunners are the oldest candidates in the race.

The United States Constitution requires presidents to be at least 35 years old, but there is no top age limit.

“I’m so young, I can’t believe it. I’m the youngest person. I am a young, vibrant man,” said President Donald Trump.

The three oldest candidates in the race are living in their eighth decade. President Trump (72), Joe Biden (76) and Bernie Sanders (77). It is sparking old-age jokes on late night TV.

“But I’ve already gotten support from Metamucil, white untouched sneakers, and those tennis balls you put on the bottom of walkers,” said “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon as Bernie Sanders.

It’s a common political question: How old is too old? A recent Wall Street Journal poll found voters rank older candidates very low on the list of people they’re comfortable voting for.

In top to bottom order, voters are most comfortable with a candidate who is:

A white man (86%)

A woman (84%)

Gay or lesbian (68%)

A business executive (56%)

A Muslim (49%)

Someone over 75 years old (37%)

Age and mental fitness was a campaign issue in 1984, when 73-year-old Ronald Reagan ran for a second term against his 56-year-old Democratic challenger, Walter Mondale.

“I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience,” Reagan said.

In fact, it is against the law to discriminate against hiring or firing workers because of age. But most Americans think age 70 is too old to work, and 75 is too old to be president. But it’s false that septuagenarian cognitive abilities are diminished.

Trump is the oldest president to assume office at the age of 70. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest, at age 42."
Obama DHS secretary pulls out of commencement speech after opposition to immigration policies: report,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/latino/442682-obama-dhs-secretary-pulls-out-of-usc-commencement-speech-after-opposition-to,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has reportedly withdrawn as commencement speaker for the University of Southern California’s (USC) law school, citing concerns about his enforcement of the Obama administration’s immigration policy.

""I informed Secretary Johnson that some faculty and students have raised concerns about the immigration policies of the Obama administration and, therefore, about having him as our commencement speaker,” Dean Andrew Guzman said in an email to faculty and staff, according to Inside Higher Ed. “Secretary Johnson shared with me that he believes that graduations should be free of tension and political controversy and for this reason has decided not to speak.”

Johnson served as head of the Department of Homeland Security from December 2013 through the end of former President Obama’s second term.

In April, two Chicano professors at USC's Gould School of Law wrote to express disappointment with Johnson’s invitation, noting his part in the detention of migrants fleeing an uptick in violence in Central America in 2014, as well as his arguments against judicial review of “kill lists” of combatants when he served as general counsel for the Department of Defense.

""USC’s choice to invite Secretary Johnson to speak normalizes illegal state violence. Inviting him to speak to the graduating class legitimates what federal courts and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have recognized as a fundamental betrayal of core values,” wrote professors Daria Roithmayr and David B. Cruz. “Johnson has repeatedly failed to respect legal and moral limits on the use of government-sponsored coercive force, particularly against children, and has demonstrated a morally repugnant willingness to use those who are most vulnerable among us as means to an end."""
VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas,https://www.politico.com,['Lorraine Woellert'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/va-mortgage-lenders-federal-subpoenas-1414318,"Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo defense VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas

Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to several mortgage lenders that make loans to military veterans, seeking information on delinquencies and payments.

The investigation is being led by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General in cooperation with the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, according to four people with knowledge of the subpoenas.

Story Continued Below

At least eight lenders, and likely more, have been asked to turn over hundreds of files on VA home loans made between 2013 and 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the request.

The requests include questions about quality control and loan audits.

Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. One VA program in particular — the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, or IRRRL — allows lenders to put existing VA borrowers into new loans without an appraisal or underwriting and was ripe for abuse.

Michael Nacincik, a spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Both said they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.

Jeffrey London, executive director of the VA’s Loan Guaranty Service, did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Ginnie Mae said it was weighing whether to exclude some of those VA loans from its pooled securities in an effort to tackle a wave of rapid-fire mortgage refinancings that have left some military service members deeper in debt.

In a 14-page request for input, the government mortgage agency called the practice, known as churning, “unhealthy” for the agency.

The loan documents requested by investigators weren’t limited to IRRRLs, according to one person with knowledge of the subpoenas.

The VA subpoenas are landing as HUD is taking steps to rein in the prosecution of lenders who sell mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

Many of the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, stopped offering FHA loans after the government, under former President Barack Obama, used the False Claims Act to extract billions of dollars in settlements from dozens of big lenders.

FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery, an appointee of President Donald Trump, has said those cases went too far and that the Trump administration is working with the DOJ to change how the False Claims Act is used against lenders."
DOJ to Ask White House to Invoke Privilege Over Entire Mueller Report,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Erin Banco'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/doj-to-ask-white-house-to-invoke-privilege-over-entire-mueller-report,"The House Judiciary Committee still plans to hold a markup session Wednesday morning to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for ignoring a subpoena to release to members the full, unredacted Mueller report, according to a senior Democratic aide.

The Department of Justice plans to ask the White House to invoke privilege over the report if the committee moves forward with the markup session , that aide said.

The news comes after staffers with the department and the committee met Tuesday afternoon in an attempt to come to an agreement about the release of the redacted report. But the two sides, after weeks of negotiations, have once again failed to come to an understanding.

“Tonight, in the middle of good faith negotiations with the Attorney General, the Department abruptly announced that it would instead ask President Trump to invoke executive privilege on all of the materials subject to our subpoena,"" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said in a statement. “This kind of obstruction is dangerous. The Department’s decision reflects President Trump’s blanket defiance of Congress’s constitutionally mandated duties. In the coming days, I expect that Congress will have no choice but to confront the behavior of this lawless Administration.”

In a letter to the committee, the DOJ said that it had offered the committee multiple accommodations throughout Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Despite those accommodations, the committee has responded with “unreasonable demands and scheduling a committee vote to recommend that the Attorney General be held in contempt of Congress,” the letter said.

“In the face of the Committee’s threatened contempt vote, the Attorney General will be compelled to request that the President invoke executive privilege with respect to the materials subject to the subpoena.”

The DOJ asked the committee to delay any vote on whether to recommend a citation of contempt for noncompliance with the subpoena.

But the judiciary committee still plans to move forward with the markup session, raising the chances that the fighting between DOJ and the Hill over the report will turn into an all-out brawl.

Barr also failed to show up for a hearing in front of the committee last week. The DOJ said the committee had made unreasonable demands about the format of the hearing, including that staff attorneys question Barr.

In the meeting between the two sides Wednesday afternoon, the DOJ said it would give more committee members the chance to view a less-redacted version of the now public Mueller report. But judiciary said that all members should have access to that version and each side of the committee should also be able to share it with three staffers. The Judiciary also asked that the DOJ either work with the committee on going to court or to not oppose it going to court to seek grand jury material related to the Mueller report."
The Energy 202: Interior secretary blames Congress for lack of action on climate change,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/08/the-energy-202-interior-secretary-blames-congress-for-lack-of-action-on-climate-change/5cd1f58ca7a0a46cfe152c79/,"THE LIGHTBULB

David Bernhardt listens during a White House meeting in April. (Chris Kleponis/Pool via Bloomberg)

He acknowledged climate change is real. He acknowledged that humans are contributing to it.

So why, Democratic lawmakers asked David Bernhardt, isn't he doing more to address global warming?

Apparently, because Congress hasn't told him to.

During his first testimony to Congress since becoming interior secretary, Bernhardt said it is up to lawmakers to direct bureaucrats like himself to address the causes and effects of warming globally.

The punt back to lawmakers is likely to frustrate House Democrats who are trying to hold the administration's feet to the fire on climate change, since they know that any significant climate-related legislation to emerge from their chamber is likely to be rejected by either the president or the GOP-controlled Senate. At the same time, Democrats have only passed a single climate bill — one keeping the United States in the Paris climate accord — since taking the the majority.

The exchange came when Democrats on the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing the Interior Department's budget pressed the Trump Cabinet official about why his department isn't doing more to assess and mitigate the effects of warming temperatures, acidifying oceans and other effects of climate change over the vast lands and waters stewarded by the Interior Department.

“Isn’t this really your job?” asked Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine).

Bernhardt pushed back against the assertion, arguing he has no legal obligation to act in response to climate change. ""My perspective on this is probably a little different than yours,"" he said.

He noted that of more than 600 instances in the law mandating the interior secretary to take some action, none tell him that he ""shall,"" as is the legal parlance, manage federal lands to stop global warming.

""There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said. ""You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

Pingee responded by asking Bernhardt to identify any legal barriers to acting on climate change. ""If there’s something legally stopping you, then we’re Congress,” she said. ""We make the laws.""

It is a lawyerly defense Bernhardt has turned to before, including in an interview last year with The Washington Post. Yet law or no law, climate change remains a threat to the land the Interior Department is tasked with overseeing.

In the national park system alone, warming temperatures threaten to undermine the very nature of many popular tourist spots, such as by melting the glaciers of Montana's Glacier National Park and imperilling the iconic Joshua trees of California's Joshua Tree National Park.

And the department holds considerable sway of the United States' overall contributions to climate change. A U.S. Geological Survey study published last year found that a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

Yet in the more than two years Donald Trump has been president, the Interior Department has sought to undo much of the previous administration's efforts to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere undergirding that change.

Its action include rolling back rules designed to reduce the release of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, from oil and natural gas wells and lifting a moratorium on new coal leasing on public lands.

During the hearing, Bernhardt said his department does not plan on easing up on oil and gas drilling on public lands when asked by Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), the subcommittee’s chairwoman, if a recent United Nations report on the possible extinction of up to 1 million species worldwide gives him pause.

""Are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report? The answer to that is no,"" he said, again noting it is up to Congress to decide what the government does or does not allow on federal lands.

But when it came to the issue of drilling for oil and gas off the coasts of states outside the Gulf of Mexico, Bernhardt suggested he would give deference to local leaders.

""I’m not aware of a single lease that was ever developed over the opposition of a state,” he said.

The department has put on pause plans to expand offshore drilling across the U.S. continental shelf after a recent federal court ruled against the Trump administration's effort to lift a current drilling ban in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. That decision came amid stiff opposition to offshore drilling from both Democratic and Republican politicians along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

POWER PLAYS

— More Interior Department drama: House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent letters urging a group of current and former Trump administration officials to provide information to the committee related to ongoing investigations, threatening to withhold salaries from anyone who seeks to hamper investigations. One letter threatened the salaries of any Interior officials that try to stop lawmakers from interviewing agency staff about whether Bernhardt complied with federal record-keeping laws.

— Fed prepares for climate risks to banks: Federal Reserve Jerome Powell told lawmakers in a letter last month the central bank has aimed to “prepare financial institutions for severe weather events,” to make sure banks are resilient to climate-related risks, the Wall Street Journal reports. That echoes comments the central banker made while testifying before Congress in late February, in which he said climate-risks are mostly a matter of bank supervision and not actual monetary policy.

— EPA must enforce Obama-era methane regulations, judge says: A federal judge in California has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to begin enforcing methane gas emission regulations that were established in 2016, E&E News reports. U.S . District Judge Haywood Gilliam of Oakland ruled the Trump administration has been illegally delaying action to limit pollutants emitted from landfills across the country, in violation of the Clean Air Act.

Who's winning in California vs. Trump? Gilliam’s ruling is just the latest in a slew of environmental cases California has brought against the administration. And the Los Angeles Times reports the state is winning in nearly all of its efforts.

— The stalemate over Puerto Rico disaster funding gets worse: And it's because of the border wall. The Trump administration is looking to add emergency border funding to a disaster aid bill, a new obstacle that has further complicated ongoing negotiations over the multibillion-dollar disaster legislation, The Post’s Erica Werner reports. An ongoing feud between the president and congressional Democrats over Puerto Rico spending has already stalled negotiations. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) made a plea this week to Vice President Pence, who joined Senate Republicans for a closed-door lunch to talk about the disaster bill, that the introduction of a new spending element could tangle negotiations further.

The above graphic shows how that shakes out.

By contrast, Republican mentions of the “Green New Deal” outweigh those by Democrats, as Bump notes numerous Republican statements have been made to “express skepticism about the need to address the problem.”

— Starups targeting climate change struggle to rake in funding: The founder of the digital thermostat company Nest has met some obstacles in his mission to invest in start-up companies looking to tackle climate change. For one, the New York Times reports, not many venture capitalists have joined him in his quest to support such companies. Canadian company Carbon Engineering, which has been moving forward with carbon capture technology, is one company that has had success in raising money. But the Times writes the “current wave of internet-focused start-ups going public, and reaping billions of dollars for investors, has hardened the bias against so-called hard technology…In the time it took Carbon Engineering to raise one round of $68 million, Slack, a messaging company founded the same year, has raised more than 10 times as much and is now preparing for an initial public offering that could value it at nearly $20 billion.”

— Trump’s steel tariffs cost U.S. consumers $900,000 for every job created: That's according to an analysis by experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The reason it’s so high is that steel is a very capital-intensive industry. There are not many workers,” Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who did the cost calculation, told The Post’s Heather Long. Some Republicans and business leaders had hoped the president would have already removed the tariffs, and congressional Republicans have continued to pressure the administration to remove them “at least on Canada and Mexico, which are major feeders of metals to the United States,” Long adds.

On Tuesday, Volkswagen’s Porsche division announced it agreed to a 535 million euro, or $600 million, fine after German officials accused the car maker of selling almost 100,000 diesel SUVs with software meant to conceal excess emissions. Just a few months before, Kappanna, whose most recent role at G.M. was to communicate with the EPA about the company’s emissions technology, was called into a conference room to be let go. He received a severance package with two months of pay and a one-way ticket to India, where he returned soon after because he couldn’t find work before his 60-day grace period expired.

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also is a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."
Shareholders Demand To Know How Northrop Grumman Will Protect Human Rights While Building Massive DHS Database,https://www.eff.org,"['Jason Kelley', 'Jyoti Panday']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/05/shareholders-northrop-grumman-demand-know-how-company-will-protect-human-rights,"Over the next few years, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to implement an enormous biometric collection program which will endanger the rights of citizens and foreigners alike. The agency intends to collect at least seven types of biometric identifiers, including face and voice data, DNA, scars, and tattoos, often from questionable sources, and from innocent people.

But DHS isn’t building all of the technology: Northrop Grumman, a defense contractor, won the nearly 100 million-dollar, 42-month contract to “develop increments one and two” of the project, named HART (Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology). Now, a group of concerned investors are demanding that the Board of Directors of the company explain how they will protect human rights while building the tech behind the massive, privacy-invasive database.

It’s unsurprising that shareholders are recognizing the serious harm to civil and human rights the company will be linked to through its work on this project.

The Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment (Tri-CRI) filed the shareholder resolution in November after discussions with company management failed. The resolution asks the board to explain how the company will abide by its human rights policy, which reflects the U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, while building a database that will greatly expand DHS’s ability to surveil innocent people. Their fears are well-founded: as EFF reported, HART will chill and deter people from exercising their First Amendment protected rights to speak, assemble, and associate—all rights also recognized under the UN’s Declaration of Human Rights, and presumably, by Northrop Grumman’s policy. If it is serious about its commitment to human rights, the shareholders say, the company must step up and explain how it squares that commitment with the harms inherent in this project. Voting on the resolution will take place May 15.

According to Northrop Grumman’s press release, “HART will offer a more accurate, robust way to identify adversaries” using “advanced, proven technologies.” But far from being proven or accurate, face recognition—one of the first components of HART to be built, and which DHS intends to rely on to identify people across a variety of its mission areas—has a high rate of inaccuracy, even according to DHS’s tests of its own systems, and is known to misidentify people of color and women at higher rates than others. In their shareholder resolution, Tri-CRI lay this out in addition to other harms posed by the technology:

There are concerns that the algorithms used to identify facial images that may be stored in the database have inherent racial bias. The HART database will amplify the surveillance capabilities of government agencies, presenting risks to privacy and First Amendment rights and causing harm to immigrant communities. Through the provision of services through the DHS contract, Northrop Grumman may be linked or contribute to these adverse human rights impacts.

Shareholders aren’t alone in their concerns with this technology: a coalition of over 85 groups across a spectrum of civil society recently demanded that other companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google halt all governmental sales of face recognition technology. Amazon faces similar shareholder action later this month. And the pushback isn’t just coming from advocacy groups. Senators have asked DHS to pause at least one aspect of the HART program—the use of facial recognition in airports—until a proper rulemaking. The OIG is investigating the proposal as well, to “assess whether biometric data collected at pilot locations has improved DHS's ability to verify departures.” The Government Accountability Office has criticized the reliability of DHS’s data, and Congress even withheld funds in previous years from DHS’s Office of Biometric Identity Management. Even major cities, including San Francisco and Oakland, are considering permanent bans on any city department utilizing facial recognition technology—an indicator of how dangerous the technology is.

Facial recognition isn’t the only problem with HART. EFF filed comments criticizing DHS’s plan to collect, store, and share the biometric and biographic records it receives from external agencies, and to exempt this information from the federal Privacy Act, making it difficult if not impossible for individuals to review the data collected. In addition, the broad, vague scope of DHS’s proposal makes it exceedingly difficult for the American public to track and comment on the over-collection and overuse of biometric data.

Other data DHS is planning to collect—including information about people’s “relationship patterns” and from officer “encounters” with the public—can be used to identify political affiliations, religious activities, and familial and friendly relationships. These data points are also frequently colored by conjecture and bias. This, combined with the fact that the biometric data will be shared with federal agencies outside of DHS, as well as state and local law enforcement and foreign governments, poses a very real threat to First Amendment-protected activities. DHS must do more to minimize the threats to privacy and civil liberties posed by this vast new trove of highly sensitive personal data—and Northrop Grumman should look carefully at these and other criticisms when responding to shareholders’ concerns.

DHS’s legacy IDENT fingerprint database, which HART builds off of, contains information on 220-million unique individuals—an enormous increase from 20 years ago when IDENT only contained information on 1.8-million people. Between IDENT and other DHS-managed databases, the agency already manages over 10-billion biographic records and adds 10-15 million more each week. Northrop Grumman is set to help the agency—which includes the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—expand the scope of this unimaginably vast data trove exponentially, with new, questionable data sources gathered from ineffective and dangerous technology.

Private companies aren’t subject to the same pressure as elected officials and government agencies, but it’s unsurprising that shareholders are recognizing the serious harm to civil and human rights the company will be linked to through its work on this project. Transparency is often the first step towards accountability, and we are glad to see shareholders holding the company to account, and pressing it to publicly report how it applies its human rights policy to its work building technology that endangers human rights.

Atheist group sues over Bible display at VA hospital in New Hampshire,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Caleb Parke', 'Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com. You Can Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values/atheist-group-sues-over-bible-display-at-va-hospital-in-new-hampshire,"An atheist group filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the Department of Veterans Affairs over a Bible displayed at a VA facility in New Hampshire.

The group called the Bible's presence in the missing veterans and POWs memorial unconstitutional and an “outrage,” but the VA says it won't be ""bullied"" into removing the Bible from the display.

THE UNIVERSITY KILLED THE BIBLE. IT'S NOW 'THE STUPIDEST PLACE IN AMERICA:' DENNIS PRAGER

The Bible was donated to Manchester VA Medical Center by former U.S. Army Air Corps Technical Sergeant (TSgt) Herman ""Herk"" Streitburger, of Bedford, who was held captive in a German Prisoner of War camp during World War II.

The Military Religious Freedom Foundation said it filed the lawsuit on behalf of a New Hampshire veteran.

PORTLAND GIVES ATHEISTS CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION

“That is stamping it with the approval of raising one faith over all the others,” Mikey Weinstein, the founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, told USA Today. “From our perspective, it’s a repugnant example of fundamentalist Christian triumphalism, exceptionalism, superiority, and domination, and it cannot stand.”

Department of Veteran Affair Press Secretary Curt Cashour told Fox News the Bible, although incorrectly moved earlier this year, stays.

CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION CLOSE TO 'GENOCIDE LEVELS,' LARGELY IGNORED DUE TO 'POLITICAL CORRECTNESS': REPORT

""This lawsuit – backed by a group known for questionable practices and unsuccessful lawsuits – is nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America’s POW/MIA community,"" Cashour said. ""Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue.""

The VA briefly removed the Bible from the display case when MRFF initially complained about it, but put it back following an outpouring of complaints from veterans groups and religious liberty groups, including the First Liberty Institute, the same law firm that argued on behalf of the Bladensburg ""Peace Cross"" memorial in front of the Supreme Court earlier this year.

AINSLEY EARHARDT OPENS UP ABOUT HER MISCARRIAGE AND EMOTIONAL JOURNEY TO MOTHERHOOD

The MRFF lawsuit described the New Hampshire veteran, James Chamberlain, as a “devout Christian” who wants the Bible removed from the display.

“As a Christian, he respects and loves all his military brothers and sisters and does not want to be exclusionary by placement of the Christian Bible,” the complaint says.

The lawsuit seeks an injunction requiring that the Bible be removed from the display.

Those in favor of keeping the Bible on display said the lawsuit is frivolous.

“POW/MIA Remembrance displays have a long, cherished history in our nation,” said Mike Berry, chief of staff at the First Liberty Institute. “Veterans organizations like the Northeast POW/MIA Network should be able to honor and remember those killed, captured or missing with a display that includes a Bible donated by a WWII veteran that represents the strength through faith necessary for American service members to survive.”"
"In Rare Bipartisan Move, Reps.

In a letter dated April 25, Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-CA) wrote to Attorney General Bill Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray to complain that the “Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee ‘fully and currently informed’” of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information obtained in the course of Mueller’s investigation. Schiff and Nunes expressed concerns that the Department and Bureau also failed to the address the committee’s prior request for Mueller to testify before the committee.

“In addition to the complete unredacted report, the Committee’s request includes all classified and unclassified evidence and information obtained or generated by the Special Counsel’s Office that may relate to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence matters,” the letter states.

The request also includes information regarding “efforts by the Russian government to contact Americans in furtherance of Russian intelligence objectives,” and says it is “unique and distinct from the House Judiciary Committee’s independent interest in obtaining the unredacted report and underlying evidence.”

Schiff and Nunes set a May 2 deadline, warning that “the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee’s request” if the deadline is not met.

Reached by phone on Tuesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) told The Daily Beast that the committee has now started to proceed through the compulsory part of the process. “The extraordinary thing is that it’s bipartisan,” Khanna said.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) told The Daily Beast the House committee’s letter was necessary because “we need to know if there’s an ongoing threat to our national security.”

“The Mueller Report found 200 pages of contacts between Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians. But not once did it say these disturbing contacts ceased,” he said."
US Dept. of Energy Announces Frontier Supercomputer: Cray and AMD to Build 1.5 Exaflop Machine,https://www.anandtech.com,['Ryan Smith'],,,,https://www.anandtech.com/show/14302/us-dept-of-energy-announces-frontier-supercomputer-cray-and-amd-1-5-exaflops,"The history of the computing industry is one of constant progress. Processors get faster, storage gets cheaper, and memory gets denser. We see the repercussions of this advancement through all aspects of society, and that extends to the top as well, where national governments continue to invest in bigger and better supercomputers. One part technological necessity and one part technological race, the exascale era of supercomputers is about to begin, as orders for the first exaFLOP-capable are now going out. It’s only fitting then that this morning the United States Department of Energy is announcing the contract for their fastest supercomputer yet, the Frontier system, which will be built by Cray and AMD.

Frontier is planned for delivery in 2021, and when it’s activated it will become the second and most powerful of the US DOE’s two planned 2021 exascale systems, with performance expected to reach 1.5 exaFLOPS. The ambitious system won’t come cheaply, however; with a price tag of over 500 million dollars for the system alone – and another 100 million dollars for R&D – Frontier is among the most expensive supercomputers ever ordered by the US Department of Energy.

The new supercomputer is being built as part of the US DOE’s CORAL-2 program for supercomputers, with Frontier scheduled to replace Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s current Summit supercomputer. Summit is the current reigning champion in the supercomputer world, with 200 petaFLOPS of performance, and accordingly the US DOE and Oak Ridge are aiming to significantly improve on its performance for the new computer. All told, Frontier should be able to deliver over 7x the performance of Summit, and is expected to be the fastest supercomputer in the world once it’s activated.

Like Summit (and Titan before it), Frontier is an open science system, meaning that it’s available to academic researchers to run simulations and experiments on. Accordingly, the lab is expecting the supercomputer to be used for a wide range of projects across numerous disciplines, including not only traditional modeling and simulation tasks, but also more data-driven techniques for artificial intelligence and data analytics. In fact the latter is a bit of new ground for the lab and the system’s eventual users; just as we’ve seen in the enterprise space over the past few years, neural network-based AI is becoming an increasingly popular technique to solve problems and extract analysis from large datasets, and now researchers are looking at how to refine those techniques from the current-generation systems and apply them to exascale-level projects.

Frontier: Powered by Cray & AMD

Officially, the prime contractor for Frontier will be Cray. But looking at the specifications, you could be excused for thinking it was AMD. Cray for its part is partnering with the chipmaker for the system, and as a result AMD is providing most of the core hardware for the new supercomputer. Designed as a next-generation CPU + accelerator system, with a mix of CPUs and GPUs doing the heavy compute work, AMD will be supplying both the CPUs and GPUs for Frontier. And as the principle processor provider, AMD will also be taking on a lot of the responsibility for developing the software stack as well, with the company working with Cray to develop an enhanced version of their ROCm environment to best extract performance from the massive cluster of CPUs and GPUs.

On the CPU side of matters, AMD will be supplying a customized next-generation EPYC CPU. AMD has confirmed that it’s going to be using a future generation of their Zen CPU cores, and given the timing of the project, we’re almost certainly looking at a Zen 3 or Zen 4 design here. Just how custom AMD’s CPU is remains to be seen, but their announcement has revealed that Frontier’s CPUs will include new instructions for the optimization of AI and supercomputing workloads.

Meanwhile on the GPU side of matters, AMD and Cray are holding their cards a little closer. Rather than naming any architecture or architectural generation, AMD is only saying that the GPUs are “based on the Radeon Instinct family” and have “yet to be announced.” AMD’s current public roadmap goes out to “Next Gen” in 2020, and with GPU development cycles averaging 2 years, this may be the architecture we see. But with the particular needs for a supercomputer, AMD may have something slightly more bespoke.

What the company is confirming for now is that they aren’t holding back on features. The HPC-focused GPU is being designed with Frontier in mind and will incorporate mixed precision compute support. Feeding the beast will be HBM memory, and AMD will be tapping a version of Infinity Fabric to connect the CPUs and GPUs.

In fact while AMD has kept the details on the technology light, it sounds like this version of IF will be the most advanced version yet. AMD is specifically noting that it’s an “incredibly” coherent fabric, calling it the first fully optimized CPU + GPU design for supercomputing. AMD’s GPUs and CPUs will be arranged in a 4-to-1 ratio, with 4 GPUs for each EPYC CPU. It’s worth noting that AMD’s slide shows a mesh with every GPU connected to the CPU and two other GPUs, but I’m not reading too much into this quite yet, as AMD hasn’t disclosed any other details on the IF setup.

With AMD going up to the blade level, tying together all of these nodes will be Cray’s job. For Frontier the supercomputer vendor is launching their new Slingshot interconnect, an equally ambitious interconnect that will support adaptive routing, congestion management, and quality-of-service features. Slingshot is capable of 200Gb/sec per port, with individual blades incorporating a port for each GPU in the blade so that other nodes can directly read and write data to a GPU’s memory. As a result Frontier will have a significant amount of interconnect bandwidth, which is all but necessary in order to allow the system to scale to exaFLOP levels.

Overall, Frontier will be organized into over 100 Cray Shasta cabinets. And while Cray has not announced a specific power consumption figure for Frontier, with each cabinet rated for 300KW, this would put the complete system at over 30MW. Which to put things in context, this is over twice the power consumption of the 13MW Summit. So while Frontier is a significantly faster system than the supercomputer it replaces, Cray, AMD, and the US DOE are all feeling the pinch of Dennard scaling slowing down, as power efficiency gains get harder to achieve. All told, in a passing comment made in the press briefing, it sounds like Oak Ridge will be installing a total of 40MW of capacity for Frontier, which is a significant amount of power to say the least.

Along with furthering the US’s own supercomputing leadership goals, securing the Frontier contract also represents big wins for Cray and AMD. Cray is now involved in both 2021 exascale systems, reinforcing their own place in the supercomputing world. Meanwhile for AMD, who is spending this current generation from the outside looking in, they have now secured a major and prestigious win for both their CPU and GPU divisions.

In fact it’s interesting to note that of the two 2021 exascale systems being ordered, both are coming from full-service processor vendors that supply both CPUs and GPUs. Current-generation systems like Summit use mixed vendors – e.g. IBM + NVIDIA – so the move to integrated vendors is a big shift for these CPU + accelerator systems. Clearly there are technological and procurement benefits to using a single vendor for all of the processors, which benefits both AMD and Intel. Though it’s worth noting that the CORAL-2 program requires the DOE to buy systems based on two different architectures, so if the future is integrated systems, then AMD and Intel are the logical choices.

At any rate, with the contract placed for Frontier, the job is only half-done. AMD and Cray will need to continue developing their hardware and software for the system, not to mention locking down the specific specifications for the finished supercomputer. So expect to continue to hear news about Frontier trickle out over the next couple of years, leading up to its installation in 2021."

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has postponed his visit to Greenland because he needs to return to Washington, the State Department said on Thursday.

“Secretary Pompeo must postpone his visit to Greenland due to a need for the secretary to be in Washington, D.C., today,” spokeswoman Mortgan Ortagus said.

Pompeo had been due to visit Greenland on Thursday, but left London bound for Washington instead.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, targeting revenue from its exports of industrial metals, the latest salvo in tensions between Washington and Tehran over a 2015 international accord curbing the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program.

Pompeo told Britain on Wednesday it needed to change its attitude towards China and telecoms company Huawei, casting the world’s second largest economy as a threat to the West similar to that once posed by the Soviet Union."
Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442716-dems-want-asbestos-ban-now-epa-says-it-needs-more-time,"House Democrats hope to sidestep the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a bill that would ban asbestos within a year.

In a Wednesday hearing before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, Democrats grilled EPA chemical staff on why the agency hasn’t taken more restrictive actions on the harmful substance three years after passing a law to give the agency more authority to regulate dangerous chemicals.

“I wish today’s hearing wasn’t necessary and this bill wasn't necessary, but asbestos is still being imported into the U.S. and still being used in this country, and still killing about 40,000 Americans every year,” said committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. Frank Joseph PalloneOvernight Energy: Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban | California moves to ban brain-damaging pesticide | Researchers tout new plastic as 'Holy Grail' of recycling Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban Dem senators call for probe into EPA officials over memo language MORE (D-N.J.). ADVERTISEMENT

The EPA has been under heavy criticism for its latest action on asbestos, something the agency argues will limit the use of asbestos in the U.S. but critics say could reintroduce some asbestos products to the market.

The agency has resisted calls to ban the cancer-causing substance outright, even against the wishes of some of its staff, arguing it must continue to go through its risk evaluation process, even if lengthier than some might prefer.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that senior EPA officials ignored the advice of scientists and lawyers in restricting rather than banning asbestos.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote in a memo from August.

The memo alarmed subcommittee Chairman Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban | California moves to ban brain-damaging pesticide | Researchers tout new plastic as 'Holy Grail' of recycling Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban House votes to block Trump from exiting Paris climate accord MORE (D-N.Y.).

“Based on some of these communications it seems clear that numerous EPA career staff believe the agency is not fully pursuing efforts to reduce asbestos exposure, and I hope these expert voices have a role as the process moves forward,” he said.

Asbestos is still sometimes used in the construction of roads and production of chlorine, among other products, but more than 60 countries have banned the use of the substance or products that contain it.

“The U.S. must do the same,” argued Tonko, but “I have little confidence that EPA will move forward on a reasonable timeline with the only acceptable outcome: a complete asbestos ban.”

Congress banned asbestos in 1989 but a court overturned that law in 1991, allowing limited uses of asbestos to continue.

Committee Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the issue, trying to sidestep a science-based EPA process that could help the agency avoid future litigation.

“Let me be honest here. If a Democrat was in the White House right now, my Democratic colleagues would be very skeptical of me trying to overturn a chemical review,” said ranking member John Shimkus John Mondy ShimkusDems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban House votes to block Trump from exiting Paris climate accord A conservative climate plan will build on personal responsibility while reducing emissions MORE (R-Ill.).

“I’m concerned about the immediate loss of 36 percent — that’s over one third — of our national chlorine production” and the risk that would pose to hospitals and drinking water supplies, he said.

For its part, the EPA continues to stress that its rule is the first meaningful action on asbestos in 30 years.

Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, told the committee the rule is an “aggressive and critical step” in addressing asbestos, stressing the need to go through a measured process in considering the risk factors associated with asbestos.

Dunn told The Hill in April that the agency may eventually ban asbestos.

Committee Democrats made clear they have lost faith in Dunn’s office under the Trump administration.

“Unfortunately, it’s now clear that despite the best efforts of our committee the Trump EPA is not using the tools we gave it to regulate dangerous chemicals,” Pallone Jr. said, adding that EPA’s actions “have been so legally suspect we need to pass this bill regardless of whether EPA were to announce it’s moving forward with a full ban of asbestos.”"
"Kellyanne Conway on investigating FBI, DOJ leaks: 'What is everyone afraid of?'",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kellyanne-conway-on-investigating-fbi-doj-leaks-what-is-everyone-afraid-of,"White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday taunted top-level officials in former President Barack Obama’s FBI and CIA Monday, asking why they'd be nervous about President Trump’s Justice Department investigating leaks they made to media in an attempt to hurt Trump.

“What is everyone afraid of?” Conway quipped during an appearance on ""Fox and Friends."" “What do you have to hide? How did this all start? Bill Barr, the attorney general, made clear that perhaps there is an investigation into at least eight of these leaks.”

The “leaks” Conway are referring to are alleged communications between top Obama-era intelligence officials and members of the press during the 2016 presidential election and first year of Trump’s presidency.

In 2017, Trump famously fired former FBI Director James Comey — today a prominent anti-Trump figure who the president has dismissed as a “liar” and a “leaker.”

The same year, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was forced to resign from the department after it was discovered he leaked information to the press about former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

During a congressional testimony last week, Attorney General William Barr sent Republicans into a frenzy by citing spying on Trump’s 2016 campaign.

Barr’s statement gave fuel to an already red-hot narrative spun by the White House and leading Republicans who have railed against an anti-Trump bias at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and criminal intelligence agencies.

After Mueller found no collusion between the president and Russia, Trump encouraged his allies on Capitol Hill and Barr to “investigate the investigators.”

“Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction,” Trump tweeted last month. “These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!”

Now that scrutiny has shifted in part to how the Mueller probe began, Conway smirked at the thought of anti-Trump figures shaking in their boots.

“I, for one, as a citizen of this country, want to know if intelligence officers were leaking information to the press,” Conway said. “I think a few of them look a little nervous these days.”"
Microsoft and VA team up to help disabled veterans play video games,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com,['Joshua Axelrod'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com/news/transition/2019/05/08/microsoft-and-va-team-up-to-help-disabled-veterans-play-video-games/,"Disabled veteran gamers are in for a treat thanks to a recent partnership between Microsoft and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Xbox adaptive controller was created so veterans with disabilities and others can play “Halo,” “Kingdom Hearts 3” or whatever games they’re into just as everyone else can.

“It’s a very different approach to a game controller from what I think people conceptualize a game controller to be,” said Bryce Johnson, the inclusive lead at Microsoft Devices. “This is not one-size fits all; this is the opposite of that. You can use this thing to adapt to you.”

Rebootcamp Recommendations

While the controller is currently available to buy, Microsoft donated controllers, consoles, games and other adaptive gaming equipment to 22 VA rehab centers around the country. Veterans can use the controllers for free at facilities in Washington, D.C., Texas, Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, Minnesota, Virginia, Missouri, Florida, Colorado, New York and California.

The idea for the adaptive controller was born during the 2015 edition of Microsoft’s annual hackathon, according to Johnson. That’s when Johnson and his Microsoft colleagues met Sgt. Josh Price, who had lost his right arm from his elbow down.

Johnson recalled watching Price use a customized Xbox controller created by Ken Jones, founder of the nonprofit Warfighter Engaged, which is dedicated to coming up with innovative ways for the disabled to enjoy gaming.

“It was super important for us to see it because we had to recognize what people were going through to play games and how much they were willing to do,” Johnson said.

After developing their own adaptive controller, Microsoft approached the VA to make sure veterans had access to it at their facilities.

“The options for video-gaming have been relatively limited,” said Dr. Leif Nelson, the VA’s director of national veterans sports programs and special events. “That’s what’s exciting about this: It’s another option for us to open up the world of esports.”

Jones has been working in adaptive gaming since 2012, when he began to use his engineering skills to create custom controllers for specific disabilities upon request. He eventually turned those projects into Warfighter Engaged, and he was delighted to work with Microsoft on their Xbox adaptive controller.

He said that Xbox controllers can be modified to “do just about anything,” which makes adapting them for veterans’ individual needs fairly simple.

“So it’s about as universal as you’re possibly going to get,” Jones said. “It’s basically a dream come true for people who modify controllers and for people who need it.”

Gaming is also a therapeutic tool for veterans, both physically and mentally, Jones said. That’s why making it easier for veterans to play, through innovations like the Xbox adaptive controller, is a big deal.

“There is some physical therapy going on there,” he said. “It’s moving your muscles around. But a lot of it is cognitive therapy decision-making. It’s just a way of relaxing and doing something that you wanted to do before.”

Nelson, who is a doctor of physical therapy, said gaming can also help veterans avoid isolation.

“It’s a community now and a way to socially engage and interact,” Nelson said. “And that’s what we’re trying to do with our veterans.”

That element of gaming was vital for Dave Crouse, a Marine Corps veteran and director of veterans services at video-game nonprofit Stack Up. He said that the military lifestyle while deployed is a lot of “hurry up and wait,” and many of those extra hours are spent playing video games.

Crouse served from 2003 to 2014 and specialized in explosive ordnance disposal. He lost his left hand and left eye during an operation in Cambodia in 2013, so he knows exactly how crucial video games can be for a veteran’s recovery and how useful something like the Xbox adaptive controller can be for that purpose.

”For me, it is the perfect form of escapism,” he said. “It engages me mentally and physically, and it gives me this cool escape, whether it’s just to decompress or to put some distance between me and the challenges I’m facing.”

There are many ways for veterans to deal with the lingering effects of PTSD, from motorcycle-riding to extreme sports. The best method for Crouse has been playing video games, and products like the Xbox adaptive controller give him and many others the means to continue participating in an activity they love."
U.S. Department of Labor cites Spirit Aerosystems for exposing employees to carcinogen,https://www.ksn.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.ksn.com/news/kansas/us-department-of-labor-cites-spirit-aerosystems-for-exposing-employees-to-carcinogen/1989850964,"WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) - The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited Spirit Aerosystems for exposing employees to carcinogen hazards. The company faces penalties of $193,218 for two repeated and four serious violations.

OSHA alleges the company failed to implement feasible engineering controls to limit employee exposure to hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, and conduct periodic monitoring of employee exposure. OSHA also alleges the company failed to establish protocols to ensure that employees remove contaminated personal protective equipment and clothing before leaving the work area.

OSHA also alleges the company failed to prevent exposure to hexavalent chromium during aircraft painting and allowed the accumulation of hexavalent chromium on surfaces and failed to ensure that employee respirators fit properly.

""Inhaling excessive levels of hexavalent chromium can cause asthma, and damage to the kidneys, liver, and respiratory system,"" said OSHA Wichita Acting Area Office Director Ryan Hodge. ""It is important for employers to take the appropriate steps necessary to prevent excessive exposure.""

The list includes the exotic -- Romania gold coin, a dozen small gold-covered Zodiac figurines -- as well as the more quotidian -- an assortment of books, 24 avocados, a box of dates, some pens and bath soaps.

Ross, who has been caught napping during the president's speeches and during meetings, also received three bottles of instant coffee. And he's been presented with a ""giant-print"" reference Bible. Another gift giver settled on the classic choice of champagne - a 2006 bottle of Dom Perignon (which can be found online for about $130 to $150).

The gift list reveals hints of who, at home and abroad, may be trying to curry favor with Ross, who took office in February 2017.

The Commerce Department provided few details about who sent the gifts and their value, but some descriptions point to foreign governments in China, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Ghana, Uzbekistan, Japan, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates.

Other gifts include an AmCham (American Chamber of Commerce) crystal business card holder, and a ""thumb drive with Secretary Ross speech and some other ceremony highlights from Tenaris Day."" Tenaris is a pipe supplier for oil and gas companies.

As Commerce Secretary, Ross plays a key role in crafting U.S. trade policy and amplifying American products and industries.

""Any of the gifts that indicate that they are made of gold or silver--that would suggest that they have some significant and intrinsic value,"" said Virginia Cantor, chief ethics counsel for the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""You definitely need transparency in order to be able to determine whether it would present a potential conflict of interest.""

A Commerce Department spokesperson tells CBS News high-value gifts are appraised and sold, according to federal regulations on gifting limits.

Ross has previously faced criticism for financial disclosure inaccuracies and concerns about his compliance with conflict of interest laws.

The 81-year-old investor, known as the ""king of bankruptcy"" for his predilection for buying bankrupt companies, has also been lampooned as financially out-of-touch with most Americans, after suggesting in January furloughed federal workers should take out bank loans to pay their bills.

Though Ross has claimed he's a billionaire, Forbes removed him in 2017 from its list of billionaires after it said financial disclosure forms showed he had less than $700 million in assets."

The USDA Loaned Millions to Five Vermont Colleges.

Green Mountain College

Vermont's ailing higher education sector has gotten a cash injection from an unlikely source: the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has approved low-interest loans of $94.2 million to five private schools during the past six years.

The money doesn't guarantee a school's survival. Two colleges that received loans are shutting down, and it's unclear whether they'll repay Uncle Sam. The College of St. Joseph in Rutland, set to close this month, borrowed $2.4 million and still owes $1 million. Green Mountain College in Poultney, which will cease to operate shortly after its final commencement May 19, owes $19.5 million. The school's administration put its $20 million campus up as collateral for the loan.

Vermont Law School in South Royalton owes $17.7 million that it borrowed in 2018, the same year it slashed salaries and eliminated tenure for most of its professors in a bid to erase fiscal deficits.

Goddard College in Plainfield borrowed $2.1 million in 2016. The school's financial problems prompted its accreditor to put it on probation last fall.

Bennington College obtained the largest loan approval since 2013, a package worth more than $50 million.

The schools borrowed through the USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Programs, which have quietly become a national resource for financially stressed colleges. The USDA has awarded roughly $1.7 billion in the past three years in low-interest loans and grants to help rural schools improve facilities and reconsolidate higher-interest debt.

Paul Costello, executive director of the Vermont Council on Rural Development, said colleges bring multiple benefits to rural areas, and government support such as the USDA loans is important.

""A college brings youth, energy and vitality,"" he said. ""It brings well-educated faculty and staff ... and relatively good paying jobs. It brings street traffic in the downtown. It brings people interested in nightlife and entertainment, so it really lifts the spirits.""

But the loans have critics — especially among conservatives.

""The USDA should not be the lender of last resort, and that's kind of what's happening,"" said Daren Bakst, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. ""It's not the taxpayers' role to serve as a bailout to small, struggling colleges.""

Green Mountain College's situation shows that ""clearly the USDA did not do a very good job in determining whether or not this was a wise loan in the first place,"" Bakst added.

Green Mountain College announced in January that it would close. The disclosure came only nine months after it received cash from the loan, most of which was immediately used to pay off higher-interest debts. The infusion was meant to pull the school out of a financial tailspin, said Bob Allen, president of the college. Allen arrived at Green Mountain College in 2016 after a long career in business, including 25 years as a senior executive at the Vermont Country Store.

""I really thought I could be instrumental in turning this place around,"" Allen said glumly during an interview in his office on April 29.

At Vermont Law School, a USDA loan has helped right the ship, at least for now. Its president, Tom McHenry, said Vermont's only law school used its federal loan to pay off higher-interest debt to reduce payments. He expects the school to be in the black next year. ""The loan helped us tremendously,"" he told Seven Days. ""We are having no problem making the payments and, given our recent restructuring, we are in a much, much stronger financial situation.""

Bennington College, a small private institution with about 735 students, qualified in 2017 for financing totaling $52.6 million — a $47.6 million direct loan from USDA and a $5 million USDA-guaranteed loan through TD Bank. It, too, sought funds to pay off higher-interest debt; it also wanted to finance renovation of its centerpiece building, the Commons, in a bid to attract more students.

The USDA's agreement with Bennington calls for the feds to hand over the $47.6 million upon completion of the Commons project, scheduled for later this year. In the meantime, the college obtained bridge financing from the Vermont Economic Development Authority, its 2018 audit shows.

Bennington College president Mariko Silver would not comment on the loan or the health of the college. She announced on April 22 that she plans to leave the school in July to become president and CEO of the Henry Luce Foundation.

Jennifer Scott, president of the College of St. Joseph, did not return messages seeking comment, nor did Goddard College president Bernard Bull.

They chose not to answer the question: Should taxpayer money be used to underwrite these loans?

Borrowers do get vetted, first by USDA officials in Vermont, and then by their bosses in Washington, D.C., who make the final call. Vermont's congressional delegation cheers on some applications.

In 2017 for instance, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) signed a letter assuring U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue that Green Mountain College ""is an important educational institution and local employer in our state."" They explained that the loan it sought would consolidate its debts and save on interest.

Leahy deferred a request for comment to his spokesperson David Carle.

Carle noted via email that the loan was for refinancing. The USDA did not add to the school's debt and is attempting to help colleges deal with rising costs and declining student populations, he wrote.

But even with the financial restructuring, Green Mountain College remained in the red. Last month banners on campus still proclaimed that it's one of the top schools for sustainability programs.

""Calling yourself first in sustainability and then shutting down — how ironic,"" said sophomore Chriss Davis, a 21-year-old from Delaware, as she dismounted from a bicycle that pulled a trailer full of recycling and compost buckets, which she distributes for her campus work-study job.

Most of the 427 undergrads at the private college must transfer to new schools.

They'll have fewer choices in Vermont. In addition to Green Mountain College and the College of St. Joseph, Southern Vermont College in Bennington is shuttering. The closings will reduce the tally of Vermont colleges from 21 to 18.

That underscores a trend that imperils the state's higher education sector, which accounts for a sizable portion of the Vermont economy. A 2017 report from the Vermont Higher Education Council said colleges drew $1 billion in tuition annually, employed 11,000 people and boasted a payroll of $588 million. A declining number of high school grads in the Northeast has translated to steadily declining enrollment and deficits at numerous Vermont colleges.

College closures worry local officials, particularly in Poultney, where the impact could be economically ""devastating,"" Costello said. ""People are deeply concerned.""

Green Mountain College employs 150 people and has an annual $6.8 million payroll. The future of its campus — 22 buildings, including the prominent Ames Hall with its white pillared portico, as well 155 acres of land complete with a goat yard, pigpen and chicken coops — is not known.

Would the USDA foreclose on a small private college such as Green Mountain?

Jon Muise, Vermont area director for the USDA Rural Development program, would not comment. He referred questions to acting public information officer Megan Roush. She said the USDA would not speculate on ""hypothetical questions"" about a possible default.

State economic development leaders said temporary federal control of the campus could be a plus. The government would safeguard the interests of the community better than a private lender would, said Ted Brady, deputy secretary of the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development. Brady knows the program well: He's a former Leahy staffer who has helped several colleges obtain the loans. He is also a former Vermont director for the USDA Rural Development program.

He recalled rare instances when smaller recipients, from daycare centers to ambulance squads, defaulted.

""The common practice then was that you try to recover as much of the loan and as much of the taxpayers' money as possible while still ensuring you're looking after the best interests of the community,"" Brady said.

Two groups have made overtures about acquiring part or all of the Poultney campus, including alumni who have banded together with a campaign called SaveGMC. But with closure imminent, no offer with viable funding has been made, Allen said. The college paid its first $635,000 installment on the loan and is not in default — thus far.

The USDA is already starting to act like a landlord, albeit a reluctant one.

""They are anxious. They encouraged us to put it on the market, which we've done,"" Allen said, noting that the campus is listed with real estate firm Colliers International.

Allen also said that with the USDA's cooperation, the college has contracted with a trustee to oversee the campus after July 1. Massachusetts accounting firm Verdolino & Lowey will help manage the property, Allen said. ""The concern in town is, as you could imagine, who's going to cut the grass and maintain the buildings while they are unoccupied.""

Students are counting down the final days with a mix of emotions. Davis feels frustrated; she transferred to Poultney five months before the closure announcement. ""No one knew,"" she said. ""I almost feel, like, lied to, in a way.""

Sophomore Shalako Sharp has no regrets about his time at Green Mountain College. ""I wanted to go to the mountains, somewhere beautiful, in nature,"" said the young man from Louisiana.

Grants covered most of his tuition and he found the professors ""amazing,'' including those in his renewable energy and ecological design major.

He's transferring to Prescott College in Arizona, which is one of nine ""teach out"" colleges that have agreed to accept Green Mountain College students. Sharp said he will move west feeling ""so happy that I came here. It's been the best experience of my life."""
New York state sues IRS over NRA-supported rule change limiting donor disclosure,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/new-york-state-sues-irs-over-nra-supported-rule-change-limiting-donor-disclosure,"New York and New Jersey have sued the IRS to provide a rationale for dropping a requirement that political nonprofit organizations disclose their donors, a rule that applies to high-profile groups like the National Rifle Association, Americans for Prosperity, Planned Parenthood, and the AARP.

The rule change was pushed for by Koch Industries, the NRA, and other major politically active organizations.

In a release announcing the suit, New York Attorney General Letitia James argues that the Trump administration is breaking the law by withholding information about the rule change from her office.

“Not only was this policy change made without notice, the Treasury and the IRS are now refusing to comply with the law to release information about the rationale for these changes,” said James in the release. “No one is above the law — not even the federal government — and we will use every tool to ensure they comply with these regulations to provide transparency and accountability.""

The New York attorney general’s office filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the information in October, but Monday’s release claims that the IRS has only provided a small portion of the information requested and that the Treasury Department has yet to provide any at all.

The IRS and a Treasury representative did not have immediate comment."
Pompeo abruptly cancels trip to Germany,https://www.cnn.com,"['Devan Cole', 'Nicole Gaouette']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/politics/mike-pompeo-cancels-trip/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo abruptly canceled a scheduled trip to Germany, where he was planning to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel ""due to pressing issues,"" the State Department said early Tuesday.

No specific reason was given for the cancellation. The press pool traveling with Pompeo has not been told where they are going next, and have been warned they may not be able to report from the country they are going to until after their departure.

""Unfortunately, we must reschedule the Berlin meetings due to pressing issues. We look forward to rescheduling this important set of meetings. The Secretary looks forward to being in Berlin soon,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, according to the press pool traveling with Pompeo.

The sudden schedule change comes two days after the Pentagon deployed a carrier and a bomber task force to the Middle East, in response to ""specific and credible"" intelligence that suggested Iranian forces and proxies were planning to target US forces in Syria, Iraq and at sea.

The carrier group has been ordered to Strait of Hormuz in order to send a deterrent message to Iran, US officials said Sunday. The move is likely to heighten tensions as Tehran explicitly warned the US in April against any moves to block or interfere with the Strait. The 21-mile-wide waterway separates Iran from other Gulf countries and is a crucial conduit for the global economy, with 30% of the world's crude oil passing through it.

Justice Department releases redacted Mueller report — again,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-releases-redacted-mueller-report-again,"The Justice Department released a second copy of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Monday evening, following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed and the Electronic Privacy and Information Center.

The lightly-redacted version of Mueller's report appears to be identical to the 448-page document that was released in April, except it sheds more light on the redactions by explaining why the blacked-out information is exempted from release under FOIA.

Democrats in Congress are threatening to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for declining to provide them with an unredacted version of the report, and this successful move by BuzzFeed and EPIC may make it easier for their battle for the full report to move forward in federal court.

Along with the report itself, the Justice Department included a letter from senior counsel Vanessa Brinkman addressed to BuzzFeed reporter Jason Leopold, who had filed a FOIA request for the report back on March 21, 2019. Brinkman said the Office of Information Policy had processed the Mueller report under FOIA and had made it available on the Justice Department website. Brinkman also said she had “determined that the Report is appropriate for release with excisions” and listed the different reasons for redactions, including exemptions related to: protecting sources and methods, safeguarding law enforcement techniques, shielding ongoing law enforcement proceedings, keeping grand jury testimony confidential, ensuring deliberative process privilege, avoiding invasions of privacy, and ensuring a fair trial.

One example of how the latest version of Mueller's report adds a bit more clarity to the redaction process can be seen by comparing the short overview section on “Russian Hacking Operations” early in the document. In the originally released version, a few lines in the WikiLeaks section are said to be redacted due to “Harm to Ongoing Matter.” But in the version released Monday, DOJ explains those sentences are blacked out due to exemptions “(b)(6), (b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(B), (b)(7)(C)”, which are related to improper disclosures of information, interference with enforcement proceedings, deprivation of the right to fair trial, and invasion of privacy respectively.

Leopold tweeted earlier in the day: “We intend to challenge all of the redactions.”

Mueller wrapped up the Russia investigation in March and the DOJ released a redacted version of his report in mid-April. The report showed Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence showing criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 election. Mueller did not, however, clear Trump of obstruction of justice. Barr says he determined there is insufficient evidence to prove an obstruction crime, but Democrats argue Mueller's report, which outlines 10 instances of possible obstruction, leaves it up to Congress to investigate and decide.

Just days before Mueller's report was released the first time, the judge in the FOIA case appeared to be sympathetic to the arguments being made by BuzzFeed, leveling critiques at what he seemed to see as the secrecy being practiced by the Justice Department. ”Obviously there is a real concern about whether there will be transparency … I hope that the government will be as transparent as it can be,"" said Judge Reggie Walton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Taking aim at Barr directly, Walton said, “The Attorney General has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the American public to be concerned about whether there will be full transparency.” The release of the redacted report is just the beginning of this litigation, and the case will likely continue moving forward in federal court shortly.

The same night the Justice Department released this second version of the Mueller report, the Justice Department was also engaged in a high-profile back-and-forth with the Democrat-run House Judiciary Committee over the department's refusal to turn over an unredacted version of the report.

Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., released a statement late Monday evening saying, “I am pleased that the Department of Justice has agreed to meet with my staff tomorrow — and not Wednesday afternoon, as originally proposed by DOJ.”

“It remains vital that the Committee obtain access to the full, unredacted report and the underlying materials,” Nadler said. “At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand.”

Earlier in the day, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “The Department remains willing to accommodate Congress’s legitimate needs, but must do so consistent with the law.”"

"Administration announces additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/seasonal-worker-visas/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration is making an additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas available for 2019, according to a joint rule published Monday by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor.

The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.

The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on Monday.

The increase was expected, as USCIS alerted Capitol Hill in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.

In March, a group of senators asked Homeland Security to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that the Labor Department's website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

"As EPA stalls, 43 states have water sites contaminated with toxic chemicals",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/water-toxic-chemicals-pfas-states-2f68b1c6b7f3/,"Toxic chemicals found in nonstick cooking pans and other household items have contaminated more than 600 water sources across at least 43 states, according to a new report, with Michigan by far the most impacted.

The findings underscore the wider water crisis facing the United States and are likely to increase pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enact stricter limits on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), toxic chemicals that can increase the risk of cancer and other severe health problems.

New analysis published Monday by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Northeastern University finds that 610 water sources across the country contain PFAS. The water systems include drinking water sources that serve upwards of 19 million people, along with military and industrial sites, dumps, and airports. PFAS itself is found in everything from firefighting foam to rain jackets.

Using data from sources including the federal Safe Drinking Water Information System and the Pentagon, the authors mapped the nationwide prevalence of PFAS. The version released Monday reflects an updated map — the last version was released in July 2018 and found 172 contaminated sites in 40 states. And it is likely that the new report still doesn’t account for many contaminated sites around the country.

“We believe the locations shown on our map may be only the tip of a toxic iceberg,” said Bill Walker, EWG vice president and editor in chief, in an email to ThinkProgress.

CREDIT: EWG

Michigan, a state grappling with ongoing water crises, stands out as the most severely impacted state. The updated map identifies 192 contaminated sites in Michigan alone, the vast majority of which are drinking water sources.

An ongoing lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, is the state’s most well-known water problem. The city’s residents say that five years after their water first became contaminated, they are still experiencing health impacts associated with Flint’s water, like rashes and headaches. But PFAS has also become a problem in the state — last July, two communities in Kalamazoo County were given bottled water after their drinking source was found to contain dangerously high levels of the chemicals.

Under scrutiny over water issues in the aftermath of Flint, state officials have been hard at work testing the water for chemicals in an effort to identify the scope of the PFAS problem. That work has been critical; EWG credited a multi-agency effort overseen by the state as helping to identify impacted areas. Michigan environmental officials have said there may be as many as 11,000 PFAS-contaminated sites in the state.

According to the new report, California comes in second after Michigan with 47 known sites, while New Jersey is third with 43 sites. But Walker of EWG told ThinkProgress that without efforts like those underway in Michigan, gauging the full scale of the problem is a challenge.

“Most other states have not conducted the kind of comprehensive multi-agency detection effort that Michigan has,” he said.

For years, communities in states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania have struggled with staggering cancer rates and other health problems, trends residents now link to PFAS exposure. They have repeatedly lobbied for the EPA to act and several told ThinkProgress in March that they feel the agency is not doing enough — even as EPA officials argue the agency is taking the crisis seriously.

In February, then-Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler unveiled an “action plan” to tackle PFAS following more than two decades of alarm from impacted communities. But Wheeler’s announcement failed to establish a Maximum Containment Level (MCL) for PFAS in drinking water, something advocates say is critical to addressing the crisis. Currently, the agency has a non-enforceable health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion that applies to only two types of PFAS: PFOA and PFOS. Health experts have said that PFAS chemicals could pose a risk to humans at much lower levels.

Moreover, a draft of interim recommendations for PFAS cleanup released in April was panned by EWG and other groups as “woefully inadequate,” in no small part because it relies on the 70 parts per trillion guidance. The recommendations also do not legally require the Pentagon or the chemical industry to clean up contaminated sites. According to the Defense Department, at least 126 military bases have reported possibly harmful PFAS levels, and EWG identifies 117 military sites on its map. Chemical companies like DuPont are meanwhile associated with mass-PFAS contamination in areas like Parkersburg, West Virginia.

EPA testing has also historically set a level for detection that EWG says is too high. According to Walker, “more than 100 million Americans could have PFAS in their water supplies” if the detection level reflected the lower points at which studies have show averse health effects to occur.

It is unclear when or if the EPA will address such discrepancies. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA) last week introduced a bill that would require the agency to create a drinking water standard for all PFAS chemicals. But the bill would give the EPA two years to do so — a timeline unlikely to appease communities currently struggling with contamination."
Kamala Harris asks DOJ IG to probe whether Trump asked Barr to investigate political opponents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-doj-ig-bar-trump-political-opponents,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Friday sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Attorney General William Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

“I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate whether the Attorney General has received or acted upon such improper requests,” she said.

The letter comes days after Harris questioned Barr Tuesday at the Senate hearing over details in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report that noted instances where Trump had either suggested or called for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Harris quizzed Barr whether Trump or anyone at the White House had asked him to investigate anyone -- an exchange it detailed in its letter to Horowitz.

In that exchange, Harris asked: “Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?”

“I’m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of, of matters out there that, uh—they have not asked me to open an investigation,” Barr said.

When Harris asked if anyone had hinted, suggested or inferred, Barr said he didn’t know. Harris’ letter describes Barr as “unable or unwilling to answer the question.”

“There must be no doubt that the Department of Justice and its leadership stand apart from partisan politics, and resist improper attempts to use the power of federal law enforcement to settle personal scores,” she wrote.

The letter is the latest pushback from Democrats against Barr since the release of the Mueller report. In particular, they have zeroed in on Barr’s handling of the report’s release, alleging that he is biased toward the president in his presentation of the report in his initial four-page summary of its conclusions.

Harris criticized Barr’s decision not to personally review the underlying evidence before concluding that there was not enough evidence to establish that the president had committed obstruction of justice. She joined a number of Democrats saying that Barr should resign.

""This Attorney General lacks all credibility and has I think compromised the American public's ability to believe that he is a purveyor of justice,"" she told reporters after the hearing.
