Why Pence spiked a Trump judge,https://www.politico.com,['Eliana Johnson'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/mike-pence-kanne-judge-trump-1411915,"Vice President Mike Pence’s private political considerations cost the administration a chance to elevate a fresh conservative to the federal bench. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images white house Why Pence spiked a Trump judge The rare split between the president and his loyal sidekick offers a window into the vice president’s independent political ambitions.

In January 2018, Judge Michael Kanne received an unexpected call from the White House. Kanne, an Indiana native who sits on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, was then 79 years old.

Under leadership of Don McGahn, the White House counsel’s office was focused almost singularly on filling the federal bench with conservative judges, and in Kanne, Trump’s lawyers had spotted an opportunity to nudge out an old-timer and lock in a conservative who could serve on the federal bench for decades to come. Rob Luther, a McGahn deputy responsible for nominations, had phoned Kanne to suggest he retire. Luther told the judge the White House had a successor in mind: Tom Fisher, Indiana’s solicitor general and a former clerk for Kanne.

“I had not intended to take senior status because that wasn’t my plan, but if I had a former clerk who had the chance to do it, then I would,” Kanne said in an interview. “On the consideration that he would be named, I sent in my senior status indication to the president.”

Taking the status, a form of semi-retirement for judges, would allow Kanne to continue working while creating a vacancy on the bench for Trump to fill. It seemed like the perfect plan — until Vice President Mike Pence’s aides got wind of it and scuttled Fisher’s nomination, according to five people familiar with the events.

As solicitor general of Indiana, Fisher had defended Gov. Mike Pence’s policies in court, and aides to the now-vice president feared his nomination would dredge up events and information politically damaging to Pence.

In a series of tense conversations with the White House counsel’s office, Pence’s lawyers, Matt Morgan and Mark Paoletta, and his then chief of staff, Nick Ayers, objected to Fisher’s nomination, which died before it ever became a reality. Pence himself was kept apprised of the conversations.

The clash provides a rare glimpse into the vice president’s political calculations and ambitions, which he has been excruciatingly careful to conceal since signing on to the Trump ticket in the summer of 2016.

In this case, Pence’s private political considerations cost the administration a chance to elevate a fresh conservative to the federal bench when Kanne, who was nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, revoked his senior status upon learning that Fisher wouldn’t be nominated to replace him.

""A number of weeks later, I got a phone call from [Fisher] saying, ‘It’s off, I’m not going to be named,’” Kanne said. “And I said, ‘If you’re not going to be named, then I’m not going to take senior status.’”

The virtually unprecedented move turned heads in legal circles at the time, but the backstory went unreported.

Pence almost never airs any disagreements with the president, even in private, and lavishes him with praise in public. Since Trump’s inauguration, he has worked to position himself as the president’s natural heir.

Like most vice presidents, he has packed his calendar with political events, but Trump’s disinterest in some of the routine aspects of coalition building have provided an opening for Pence to build his own base of support.

Pence has regularly hosted dinners at the Naval Observatory for conservative movement leaders and played a central role in convening White House gatherings focused on religious liberty and opposition to abortion.

He also has embraced the role of sweet-talking deep-pocketed GOP benefactors, serving as the chief conduit between the administration and Republican donors the president has shown little interest in cultivating.

Pence has remained heavily involved with judicial nominations in his home state, and neither McGahn nor his deputies had consulted with the vice president’s office before striking the tentative deal with Kanne, a breach of protocol that rankled Pence and his aides, particularly Paoletta, who had a fraught relationship with McGahn.

Of particular concern to the vice president’s team was Fisher’s involvement in the litigation surrounding Pence’s attempt to stop Syrian refugees from settling in Indiana after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris — a move that ultimately was knocked down in court.

A three-judge panel on the 7th Circuit ripped into Fisher’s defense of the Pence policy in an unusually vicious manner when he attempted to convince the court that the state had a legitimate concern about the federal government’s ability to vet Syrian refugees — and that they should instead be sent to other states.

“Honestly, you are so out of it,” Judge Richard Posner, who has since retired from the bench, told Fisher during the proceeding. “You don’t think there are dangers from other countries?” The Pence administration was handed a stinging legal defeat in September 2016, while the then-governor was on the campaign trail with Trump.

Pence had been elected governor of Indiana in November 2012, following stints as a radio talk show host and a member of Congress. His tenure in Indianapolis was tumultuous and hit a low point in the spring of 2015 when he signed the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, a move cheered by religious conservatives but slammed by liberals and many businesses. A fix to the law passed by the Indiana Legislature left both groups unsatisfied, and Pence was in the midst of a difficult reelection battle when Trump tapped him as his running mate in July 2016.

Fisher, who became Indiana’s first solicitor general in 2005 under the state’s previous Republican governor, Mitch Daniels, continued on under Pence.

“The political issues that had been very controversial in Indiana while Pence was governor Fisher had also been very involved in because he was solicitor general, and that nomination would reignite those battles — and they could potentially embarrass the vice president,” said a former administration official involved in the conversations surrounding Fisher’s potential nomination.

Fisher did not respond to a request for comment."

‘This wasn’t just a briefing’: Pompeo grilled CIA analysts on Russia findings,https://www.politico.com,['Natasha Bertrand'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/pompeo-cia-russia-findings-1409190,"Mike Pompeo conducted a personal review of the CIA’s findings just after he took over as CIA director in 2017, but found no evidence of any wrongdoing. | Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images elections ‘This wasn’t just a briefing’: Pompeo grilled CIA analysts on Russia findings The DOJ is now reviewing those same findings after Mike Pompeo found no wrongdoing in how the agency concluded Russia wanted to help Trump in 2016.

Attorney General Bill Barr has ordered an investigation into whether the CIA was correct to determine that Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to boost Donald Trump during the 2016 election.

But that question has already been asked and answered at the CIA’s highest levels — by Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist, according to three people familiar with the matter.

Story Continued Below

Just after Pompeo took over as CIA director in 2017, he conducted a personal review of the CIA’s findings, grilling analysts on their conclusions in a challenging and at times combative interview, these people said. He ultimately found no evidence of any wrongdoing, or that the analysts had been under political pressure to produce their findings.

“This wasn’t just a briefing,” said one person familiar with the episode. “This was a challenging back and forth, in which Pompeo asked the officers tough questions about their work and how they determined Putin’s specific objectives.” Pompeo also asked about CIA’s work with the FBI on the Russia probe in 2016. Two U.S. officials further confirmed to POLITICO that the interview occurred and was robust.

Additionally, a congressional official said Pompeo and his deputies never gave any indication to lawmakers, even behind closed doors, that the CIA had acted improperly or drawn incorrect conclusions about Putin’s desire to help Trump get elected. Special counsel Robert Mueller and the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee also separately reaffirmed the intelligence community’s assessment of Moscow’s motivations in 2016.

Still, Barr in May tapped John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to investigate many of these same questions. Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign that drove suspicions of a Kremlin link.

But the wide latitude he’s given Durham to also examine analytic conclusions drawn by CIA officers has alarmed some in the national security community who worry about its effect on the apolitical nature of intelligence gathering. And given Pompeo’s prior review — not to mention that of Mueller and Congress — the move has sparked cries of hypocrisy from those who say Trump is seeking his own “do-over,” something the president frequently accuses Democrats of attempting with their ongoing congressional hearings on the subject and mounting subpoenas of Mueller’s witnesses.

Michael Morell, the former acting CIA director, said the Justice Department is “absolutely the wrong organization to do the review.”

“The Justice Department’s job is to see whether a crime has been committed, not to assess the quality of intelligence analysis,” said Morell, who now hosts the Intelligence Matters podcast. “They have no training or experience in that.”

Jeffrey Edmonds, a former CIA analyst who served as a Russia adviser on the National Security Council during both the Trump and Obama administrations, said he is “worried” that Durham’s CIA inquiry “is a political attempt to undermine the intelligence community’s assessment.”

“It’s telling that Pompeo walked away from [his] review agreeing with the agency’s high confidence assessment” about Putin’s objectives, Edmonds added.

Indeed, the congressional official said, Pompeo’s own examination of the CIA’s analysis “really does call into question the purpose of the entire Durham exercise.”

In a statement, a person familiar with the situation said that Pompeo “routinely asks employees for their unvarnished assessments and opinions on important issues. Although no votes were changed, Secretary Pompeo agrees with the Intelligence Community’s report that the Russian government attempted to sow discord in our democracy and undermine our election process.”

The intelligence community has not made an assessment either way about whether the Russian meddling campaign altered actual votes.

The CIA declined to comment.

Trump’s allies have been fixated on the question of how the intelligence community determined that Russia intervened specifically to help Trump win rather than to just sow chaos and distrust in the Democratic process.

At the heart of their criticism is the “Intelligence Community Assessment of Russian Activities and Intentions” released in January 2017. In it, the CIA and FBI concluded with high confidence that “Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.” The NSA reached the same conclusion with moderate confidence.

Notably, though, the FBI did not open its counterintelligence investigation into members of the Trump campaign because the CIA found that Putin was interfering to boost Trump’s candidacy, according to a person with knowledge of the probe. In fact, the CIA analysis of Putin’s motives appears to have followed, not preceded, the FBI’s probe, the person said.

House Intelligence Committee Republicans said in a report last year that the intelligence agencies “did not employ proper analytic tradecraft” when making those judgments about Putin’s motives. They stood by that assessment even after Putin announced during a joint news conference with Trump that he wanted the reality TV star to win “because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.”

The Senate Intelligence Committee, which reportedly interviewed CIA officers directly about the subject, implicitly rebuffed the House GOP in its own report.

""The Committee has spent the last 16 months reviewing the sources, tradecraft and analytic work underpinning the Intelligence Community Assessment and sees no reason to dispute the conclusions,"" the committee’s chairman, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, said at the time.

Mueller reaffirmed the intelligence community’s assessment, as well. His investigation determined that Russia “worked to secure” a Trump presidency, which it perceived would be more beneficial to the Kremlin, according to his final report.

In addition to Durham’s investigation, the DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General and Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber are also conducting their own probes into the origins of the Russia probe and related matters. Barr appointed Durham around the time Mueller was wrapping up his two-year-long Russia probe, which did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian intermediaries to disrupt the 2016 election.

It’s unclear what mandate Durham is operating under and whether he is looking at the intelligence agencies with an eye to recommending criminal charges. He has not been appointed to lead a criminal investigation, and the Justice Department has formally described the inquiry only as a “review.” Durham also won’t be leaving his day job in Connecticut.

It’s a setup that has unnerved intelligence veterans across the political spectrum.

“I don't think this is an appropriate job for the Justice Department,” said John McLaughlin, who served as the CIA’s deputy director and acting director under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

“Analysis inevitably includes an element of judgment on top of whatever hard data is amassed,” he added. “It's not something you can assess confidently with a standard prosecutorial yardstick.”

Morell agreed.

“Because they’re prosecutors, when they come knocking on an analyst’s door and say, ‘We want to talk to you about your judgment,’ it has a chilling effect,” he said. “Analysts might think twice in the future about making a tough call.”"
How Trump could win in 2020: Democrats nominate a very liberal candidate,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Harry Enten'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/politics/how-do-liberals-do-against-trump-2020-analysis/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's approval rating among voters has been stuck at or below 45% for pretty much his entire presidency. And, at this point in the campaign , a record percentage of voters say they'll vote against him .

So how does Trump win a second term? The answer may be that the Democrats nominate a very liberal candidate, something Democratic voters seem willing to do.

Further, Harris, Sanders and Warren are considerably further left of the 43 House Democrats who won seats from Republicans in 2018 -- the candidates who gave the Democrats their House majority.

The early evidence suggests that being seen as very left could make the difference. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that Trump would beat a candidate perceived as a socialist by a 49% to 43% margin. That same poll gave Biden a 10-point advantage over Trump, while all the other top Democrats were either tied with (Warren), up by a point (Sanders) or up by 2 (Harris) over Trump. While some of this is likely because of name recognition -- though, as I've noted before, Warren and Sanders are well known -- the more liberal candidates have consistently done worse than Biden has against Trump.

Biden's ahead of Trump 49% to 41% in an average of more than 20 national polls taken since January. In these same polls, this 8-point lead for the Democrat slims to 5 points against Sanders (47% to 42%) and to 1 point against Warren (44% to 43%). Biden's better standing in the general election polls is driven by him being far better liked by non-Democratic voters than Sanders or Warren.

These polls look a lot like what you'd expect given research on the topic. A hallmark study by Stanford University's Andrew Hall and Daniel Thompson looking at congressional races from 2006 to 2014 demonstrated that more moderate candidates performed more strongly. This is because extreme candidates on one side tend to raise the opposition's turnout. (This runs counter to the argument that base candidates raise turnout to help their side win. Instead, it may be the opposite.) My own simple examination of the 2006-2018 House returns indicates that incumbents with more moderate voting records continued to have an advantage, once we control for a district's voting history and money spent by the campaigns.

The sample size for presidential elections isn't anywhere as large, but ideology probably also matters there. FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver has shown that since the 1940s, more moderate presidential candidates do better on average

Ideology may have been part of the reason Trump won in 2016. He was seen as the least conservative Republican presidential nominee since at least Gerald Ford in 1976. Trump's ability to escape the very conservative label likely had to do with how he mixed in more moderate rhetoric on everything from infrastructure to the social safety net and even gay rights.

Now, to be clear, having a liberal voting record and being seen as liberal by the voters don't necessarily go hand-in-hand. After all, Clinton and Obama were both seen as quite liberal , even though their records weren't that liberal. Perhaps some of the more liberal Democrats won't be seen as liberal this time around.

Further, ideology is far from the only thing that matters for election outcomes. Good personal stories matter, for instance. Sometimes the fundamentals are so clearly pointing in one direction that extreme candidates win anyway. Sometimes strong candidates can overcome being far left or far right, and otherwise weak centrist candidates don't win. Obama won two terms, despite being seen as very liberal. George W. Bush actually did better in 2004 than in 2000, even though voters viewed him as considerably more conservative the second time around. And Jimmy Carter's perceived moderate views didn't solve him from a bad economy in 1980.

Nominating a very liberal candidate is a risky bet, though, especially given the polling so far. The well-known left candidates are doing worse than the more moderate one. Nominating one of them certainly strays from the playbook that Democrats used in the 2018 election to take back the House."
Trump officially issues executive order to tally citizens through the Commerce Department,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-officially-issues-executive-order-to-tally-citizens-through-the-commerce-department,"President Trump officially issued his executive order Thursday, which demands all other departments and agencies provide the Commerce Department with any information related to citizenship.

Trump issued the order after courts ruled against having the citizenship question on the 2020 census. The order was also issued to avoid delaying the census any longer.

""To achieve that goal, I have determined that it is imperative that all executive departments and agencies provide the Department the maximum assistance permissible, consistent with law, in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country, including by providing any access that the Department may request to administrative records that may be useful in accomplishing that objective,"" the executive order states.

All agencies are being ordered to provide the citizenship data to an interagency working group that will be created to process the information.

State information on citizens will also be sent to the Commerce Department.

In the order, Trump outlines which information will be sent by which federal agency:



Department of Homeland Security: National-level file of Lawful Permanent Residents, naturalizations, F1 and M1 nonimmigrant visas, national-level file of customs and border arrival/departure transaction data

Department of State: refugee and asylum visas, national-level passport application data

Social Security Administration: Master beneficiary records

Department of Health and Human Services: CMS Medicaid and CHIP Information System

Trump has instructed the Commerce Department begin planning the administrative processes necessary to add the citizenship question to the census in 2030."
Ocasio-Cortez wants to ax Homeland Security.

Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security.

The department’s creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast “the New Yorker Radio Hour.” She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an “egregious mistake.”

“People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies,” she told the New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick.

Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman’s proposal.

“Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb,” former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.

""Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.

The usefulness of a Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn’t always taken for granted. President George W. Bush’s administration initially had “zero interest” in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Richard B. Cheney thought it would needlessly increase the size of government.

“Creating a Cabinet post doesn’t solve the problem,” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.

Some members of Congress worried the White House was concealing the department’s true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of government, USA Today reported in 2002. Certain conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said they would not oppose Bush’s proposal but wanted to move slowly, according to The Houston Chronicle.

When the House of Representatives initially voted on the department’s creation the following July, 132 members opposed the move, including 10 Republicans. Congress eventually passed the Homeland Security Act and Bush signed it into law that November, creating the Department of Homeland Security.

Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that her proposal was “not that radical,” citing the reluctance of some members of Congress to support the department’s creation less than two decades ago.

“When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned — incl GOP — that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

It’s really not that radical.

Like some members of Congress, non-politicians also criticized the new department, which merged 22 federal agencies tasked with securing the country’s borders, protecting its infrastructure and guarding against terrorism.

James Bamford, a journalist and filmmaker who covers intelligence agencies, told CBS News in 2002 that creating Homeland Security was a public relations move that could actually decrease efficiency.

“Instead of moving people together, you should be moving information together,” Bamford told CBS. “You should be taking information and finding better ways to distribute it; faster ways to distribute it among people.”

In a 2003 article in National Review, conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru criticized Bush’s record as president, noting that Bush had “raised defense spending, given new powers to law enforcement, federalized airport security and created a new cabinet department for homeland security. . . . More people are working for the federal government than at any point since the end of the Cold War.”

Homeland Security was originally staffed by 180,000 employees from the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal offices. It also encompasses the agencies that oversee immigration, including Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security now has a workforce of more than 240,000, making it the government’s third-biggest department, behind Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Transportation Security Administration, which screens passengers at airports, was absorbed into Homeland Security just a year after it was created in response to 9/11 in November 2001. Conservatives at the time expressed concern that the new agency was unnecessarily bureaucratic and gave too much power to the government.

“Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust,” Slate reported. “The second most common opinion was fear.”

Republicans’ ire for the TSA survived a decade after the agency’s creation. Then-Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) in 2011 said Americans were “no safer today than they were before 9/11,” according to Forbes. The GOP’s 2012 presidential platform called for the privatization of airport security.

Calls to abolish Homeland Security are now made year after year, in publications ranging from policy journals to mainstream news outlets. In a tweet from 2018 shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) recalled a time when conservatives viewed Homeland Security as overly bureaucratic.

“Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS — as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government,” wrote Amash, who announced on the Fourth of July that he was leaving the Republican Party. “If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.”

Updated at 1:09 p.m. ET

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

CENSUS 2020: President Trump EXECUTIVE ORDER Citizenship FULL STATEMENT,https://www.youtube.com,[],,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGG_iL2Ab-g,"Published on Jul 11, 2019

President Trump, speaking at the White House on Thursday, announced that he would ""immediately"" issue an executive order to get an accurate count of non-citizens and citizens in the United States -- a measure Trump said would be ""far more accurate"" than relying on a citizenship question in the 2020 census.



The move would make use of ""vast"" federal databases and free up information sharing among all federal agencies concerning who they know is living in the country, Trump said.

Teachers union sues Betsy DeVos over loan forgiveness program,https://whnt.com,"['Cnn Wire', 'Tribune Media Wire']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://whnt.com/2019/07/11/teachers-union-sues-betsy-devos-over-loan-forgiveness-program/,"× Teachers union sues Betsy DeVos over loan forgiveness program

The American Federation of Teachers union sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos Thursday, alleging the department has mismanaged a federal program that grants teachers and other public service workers loan forgiveness after they make 10 years of payments.

About 1% of the more than 73,000 borrowers who have applied for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program have been granted relief since the program was created in 2007, according to department data.

The lawsuit blames the Department of Education for denying applicants “on arbitrary and capricious grounds” and failing to put a process in place to review erroneous decisions or ensure loan servicing companies provide accurate guidance to borrowers about their eligibility.

“Instead of helping the millions of Americans owed debt relief under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, DeVos has hurt and pauperized them. And instead of working with lawmakers to improve the program that millions of teachers, firefighters, nurses and first responders deserve, DeVos has vandalized it,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Education declined to comment on pending litigation.

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was meant to encourage people with student debt to stay in lower-paying jobs that serve the public. Teachers, social workers, public defenders and physicians are among those who can qualify. They must work for an eligible non-profit or government employer, as well as have the right kind of federal student loan and be enrolled in a specific type of repayment plan.

Eight educators are also named in the complaint, which seeks loan forgiveness in their specific cases. It also asks the department to fix the application process and come up with an appeals process.

After paying down her debt for 10 years, Kelly Finlaw, an art teacher at a New York public school, applied for forgiveness in 2017. At that point, she was told one of her loans was not eligible and that she would have to start over, Finlaw said on a call with reporters. The same thing happened to another plaintiff, Oklahoma music teacher Debbie Baker. The lawsuit claims her loan servicer incorrectly told her she would qualify.

Chicago public school teacher Cynthia Miller alleges in the complaint that she was denied forgiveness because her loan payments were miscounted.

Many borrowers have complained that the program’s rules are hard to navigate, and some have found out they don’t qualify only after the 10 years is up. About half of the applicants that have been rejected did not have enough qualifying payments, while a quarter had missing information, and 16% didn’t have eligible loans, according to department data.

DeVos has blamed Congress for creating a confusing program, but some Democratic lawmakers have accused the department of holding up the process.

The American Federation of Teachers previously sued the loan servicing company Navient over problems with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and other borrowers have filed lawsuits against the company and other servicers.

But the new lawsuit is different, putting blame on the Department of Education.

DeVos has proposed ending Public Service Loan Forgiveness for three years in a row in the budget request she makes to Congress, but lawmakers have continued to fund the program.

Last year, Congress set aside an additional $350 million to fix what they called a “glitch” in the enrollment process.

Some Democrats have proposed further expanding the program. A bill introduced in April by Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and presidential hopeful and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand would erase half of a borrowers’ debt after making five years of payments and forgive the remaining after 10 years.

Several other Democratic presidential candidates cosponsored the bill, including Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts."

The bill, H.R. 299, enables homebuyers using a VA loan to borrow above the 2019 limit of $484,350 for most counties, without any down payment.

A VA spokesperson told HousingWire that the loan limit will be lifted for loans that are guaranteed or appraised on or after January 1, 2020, and that guidance for lenders would be coming ahead of this date, published on the VA home loan circular page of its website.

The VA also clarified other changes that will go into effect as a result of the bill.

In addition to alleviating limits for veterans looking to purchase a home, H.R. 299 temporarily increase rates for certain loans by 0.15-0.30%, the VA said.

The slight bump in loan fees is intended to help finance health care costs for veterans who are suffering the effects of Agent Orange exposure as a result of their service.

Additional changes to the VA’s loan guaranty program include the elimination of funding fee differences for borrowers who are veterans versus those who are members of the Reserve.

It also removes the loan limit for the Native American Direct Loan Program, exempts Purple Heart recipients from paying loan fees, and authorizes VA-designated appraisers to rely on third parties for appraisal-related information.

The bill’s passage comes after years of lobbying on behalf of numerous trade groups, including the National Association of Realtors, which teamed with other housing industry trade groups to ensure veterans’ health care benefits would be extended without a significant increase to VA loan fees.

Now that the bill has passed, it is expected to “fast-track” disability compensation for as many as 90,000 affected former service members, according to military.com.

The VA said it does not have any formal projections as to how the changes brought on by the bill will its home loan guaranty program."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang/NPR Shuran Huang/NPR

Thursday marks one year since a divided Senate confirmed Brian Benczkowski to lead the Justice Department's criminal division.

The 51-48 vote reflected Democrats' worry that he'd try to interfere with the investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 election.

Things didn't work out that way.

Benczkowski promised to consult with career officials about any possible conflicts with the special counsel probe, but he said this week that never became necessary.

""I've kept the promises that I made,"" Benczkowski said. ""I didn't have anything to do with the Mueller investigation. Nothing came across my desk. There was nothing that I had to deal with.""

Instead, Benczkowski has spent the past year advancing the administration's priorities: punishing transnational gangs; cracking down on corrupt doctors and pharmacists who fuel the opioid crisis in Appalachia and beyond; and making the process of investigating companies and business executives more transparent.

United States v. Guzman

It started with what Benczkowski said could be the biggest criminal trial in U.S. history: the effort to bring to justice former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

That trial extended nearly three months and coincided with a federal government shutdown, bringing uncertainty to DOJ lawyers about whether their hotel bills would ever be paid.

In the end, prosecutors from the criminal division at Justice worked with their counterparts in U.S. attorney's offices in Brooklyn and Miami to secure conviction of Guzman on all 10 of the drug and conspiracy charges.

Authorities recently asked for forfeiture in the amount of $12,666,181,704. Guzman faces mandatory life imprisonment when he is sentenced in New York City on July 17.

Benczkowski said he plans to be in court to support the team.

DOJ's opioid strike force

Benczkowski expressed concern early in his tenure that DOJ wasn't targeting the region that was hardest hit by the opioid crisis. So the criminal division put together a strike force that spans 10 areas in Appalachia.

He secured approval and funding to send 14 health care fraud prosecutors into the region, culminating in dozens of indictments of doctors, pharmacists and other medical professionals last April.

That team continues to crunch data from health care providers and insurance programs to help uncover fraud. Benczkowski said he anticipates another round of prosecutions in Appalachia before the end of the year.

""We're going to keep going at it until we drive down the addiction rate and we drive down the overdose rate in those districts,"" he said.

The white-collar cases

Benczkowski said his third priority is bringing more ""transparency"" to white-collar crime investigations.

So the Justice Department issued new guidelines for prosecutors about recommending independent monitors to oversee errant corporations. Benczkowski also revamped the way that prosecutors assess whether a company is complying with the Justice Department.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang/NPR Shuran Huang/NPR

Now, DOJ publishes online the times it declines to bring charges against companies that have behaved appropriately and deserved credit for that.

That sends a message, he said, and it makes his own prosecutors work ""a little bit harder."" Lawyers defending companies can point to those decisions and fashion arguments for their own leniency.

""Certainly it's going to give outside lawyers a little bit more ammunition to advocate with,"" he said, arguing that transparency will make government decisions more just.

Benczkowski's comment may prove controversial with consumer protection and shareholder advocates, as well as critics who argue the Justice Department has abandoned its responsibility to police corporate misconduct.

But the Justice Department said it has charged 211 people with fraud so far this year, about half of whom have pleaded guilty, an increase from last year in the same period. Benczkowski also said financial recoveries from corporate resolutions this year will be ""well north"" of $2 billion, about double the amount in 2018.

Benczkowski said he expects to pick a new chief of the DOJ fraud section, which prosecutes such offenses, by the end of the month.

Robert Zink has been filling the job in an acting role since January and may be in line to get the job on a permanent basis, two sources told NPR.

The ransomware menace

Prosecutors are also in the middle of responding to a wave of ransomware attacks that have victimized small and midsize cities in Florida, Georgia, Maryland and elsewhere.

Benczkowski said criminal groups are becoming sophisticated in how they identify their targets: municipalities big enough to afford to pay ransom, but not so sophisticated they're prepared for these kinds of threats.

Benczkowski said he has a message for those cities:

""Invest in the basic cybersecurity protections for your systems that you need, have redundant offline systems that you can turn to in the event that you're attacked, come to law enforcement early in the process ... so that we can help you get better prepared."""

""I would say that Secretary Johnson is wrong, Vice President Biden is wrong on this and Congressman O’Rourke is wrong on this,"" Castro said.

""Secretary Johnson has suggested somehow that people will take that as open borders. Open borders are a right-wing talking point,"" he said, pointing to current enforcement mechanisms on the U.S. southern border, like existing fencing and the presence of Border Patrol agents.

WASHINGTON — A State Department intelligence analyst has resigned in protest after the White House blocked his discussion of climate science in Congressional testimony, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Rod Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, testified last month before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on the effects of climate change on national security. But, in a highly unusual move, the White House refused to approve Dr. Schoonover’s written testimony for entry into the permanent Congressional record.

The reasoning, according to a June 4 email reviewed by The New York Times, was that the science cited in Dr. Schoonover’s testimony did not correspond with White House views. Ultimately, Dr. Schoonover did deliver the oral testimony before the committee, but his accompanying written statement was not included in the official record of the hearing.

Dr. Schoonover did not respond to text message requesting comment. A policy expert familiar with his case confirmed that his resignation came as a direct result of the episode. His last day is expected to be Friday."

Steele was interviewed as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's probe of how the FBI used the unverified dossier, including its role in obtaining a surveillance warrant against then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Ex-State Department employee gets more than three years in prison over Chinese intel ties,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-employee-gets-more-than-three-years-in-prison-over-chinese-intel-ties,"A former State Department employee was sentenced to 40 months in prison for accepting thousands of dollars worth of gifts from Chinese intelligence agents in exchange for internal government documents.

Candace Marie Claiborne, 63, failed to disclose her repeated contacts with two agents of China’s intelligence service, who gave her cash, international travel and vacations, tuition at a Chinese fashion school, a furnished apartment, and more over five years.

In exchange, Claiborne, who was employed as an office management specialist, gave the agents copies of internal State Department documents on U.S. economic strategies and visits by dignitaries between the two countries, among other topics.

Claiborne then misled FBI and State Department investigators about her contacts with the agents and urged a co-conspirator to dispose of evidence connecting her to the agents.

She will also have three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000.

“This is not what I had envisioned for my life. … I still don’t know how I lost myself,” Claiborne told U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss on Tuesday. ""I lost my job, reputation and the trust of the government. I made a terrible mistake and now I'm paying the price.""

China has seen increasing success in recruiting Americans to pass along government secrets. Since March, at least three other Americans have pleaded guilty or were convicted of espionage or attempted spying on behalf of the Chinese.

“The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face, and today’s sentencing shows that those who betray the trust of the American people will be held accountable for their actions,” John Selleck, the acting assistant director of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, said in a statement Tuesday.

Claiborne, who held a top secret security clearance during her employment, joined the State Department in 1999, serving in posts in China, Sudan, and Iraq until she returned to the U.S. in 2015.

The Chinese agents began paying her in 2011 for information. Prosecutors said Claiborne was aware of the consequences of her agreement with the Chinese agents, but was motivated by the financial rewards.

When renewing her security clearance in 2014, Claiborne “deliberately excluded” her contacts with the Chinese agents, the criminal complaint said. She also omitted the contacts to investigators while she continued to communicate with the agents about additional benefits and tried to hide evidence of their agreement.

The FBI also sent an undercover agent, who posed as a Chinese intelligence officer, to her home in Washington, D.C., and Claiborne invited the undercover agent into her home but never reported the contact to the U.S. government, despite the government’s requirement to do so.

Claiborne was arrested in March 2017. She pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States."

U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel in Maryland wrote in a six-page order that he shared the concerns of a federal judge in New York who similarly blocked the Justice Department maneuver this week, but noted that in his district, unlike the other judge’s, attorneys do not have to provide “satisfactory reasons for withdrawal.” He wrote he was concerned that “a shift in counsel at this late stage may be disruptive to an already complicated and expedited case.”

But Hazel also wrote that he was “inclined to ultimately permit the withdrawal” — if the Justice Department would, among other things, provide assurances that the new team was “aware of and prepared to address potential conflicts between recent developments in this case and positions repeatedly taken before this Court by the withdrawing attorneys.”

[Federal judge rejects Trump administration’s bid to swap out lawyers for census case on citizenship question]

The decision marks yet another headache for the Justice Department in what has become a fraught case. Earlier this week, the department sought to replace the team of lawyers assigned to it, after at least some career attorneys on the case grew frustrated with the Trump administration’s sudden shift in position on whether it could keep fighting.

That fight, which once seemed at its end, intensified Wednesday when a group of conservative lawmakers wrote a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr urging him to support President Trump adding the question to the census by executive order.

The letter controversially states that assessing the citizenship question is “germane to carrying out our duty to apportion representatives.”

The Trump administration has denied that adding the question is meant to boost its political fortunes through redistricting, but many Democrats charge that the question is meant to scare away Latinos from participating in the census, resulting in an undercount of that population.

The department filed motions this week to remove the lawyers in cases that are ongoing in multiple federal courts.

U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York was the first judge to block the move, though he said the Justice Department could refile its request and provide more specific reasons for the change.

Hazel wrote that, because the Justice Department already had entered new lawyers into the case, his denying their request to replace the team would “not prevent the attorneys who have been representing the Defendants’ interests thus far from simply receding into the background as new counsel take the lead.”

He wrote he was “less focused on the formality of whose names appear at the bottom of future pleadings and more focused on the need for a transition of counsel that does not disrupt the orderly administration of justice.”

Hazel added that “while the Court is inclined to ultimately permit the withdrawal, under the unique circumstances of this request, more specific assurances will first need to be provided.”

The department, he wrote, would “need to provide specific assurances to the Court that one or more of the withdrawing attorneys are remaining available to the new DOJ team, as necessary, or provide detailed reasoning for why such an arrangement is untenable.” He questioned whether the new team could proceed without any help from the previous lawyers.

“As a practical matter, the Court cannot fathom how it would be possible, at this juncture, for a wholesale change in Defendants’ representation not to have some impact on the orderly resolution of these proceedings unless Defendants provide assurance of an orderly transition between the withdrawing attorneys and new counsel,” Hazel wrote. “This requires more than just the effort of the new DOJ team, but the involvement and availability of the withdrawing attorneys.”

Hazel also noted that the new lawyers should be prepared to address questions about the previous lawyers’ possibly misleading assertions to the court. Just last week, those lawyers believed the matter was over, because of an imminent deadline to start printing census forms and a Supreme Court decision that prevented the administration from adding a citizenship question. But Trump ordered the department to keep looking for ways to continue the fight, raising questions about what it had earlier told the court about the deadline.

“Defendants must realize that a change in counsel does not create a clean slate for a party to proceed as if prior representations made to the Court were not in fact made,” Hazel wrote. “A new DOJ team will need to be prepared to address these, and other, previous representations made by the withdrawing attorneys at the appropriate juncture.”

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.

25% said they valued Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement, the same percentage who said they valued 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's endorsement.

A number of progressive senators running for president are clamoring for the opportunity to collaborate with Ocasio-Cortez on legislation and vying for her endorsement.

""What I would like to see in a presidential candidate is one that has a coherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward,"" Ocasio-Cortez told CNN in May.

Ocasio-Cortez has collaborated with Sen. Bernie Sanders on a climate change resolution and legislation capping credit interest rates, shot a video with Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticizing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and is teaming up with Sen. Kamala Harris on a bill to reform federal public housing.

Several Democratic presidential candidates are actively courting the support of progressive star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — and Democratic primary voters polled by INSIDER say they value her 2020 endorsement the most out of all non ex-Democratic presidents.

As part of our recurring 2020 primary polling with SurveyMonkey Audience, INSIDER polled 1,105 respondents from July 9 to July 10. Of those, 421 said they would likely participate in their state's Democratic primary or caucus.

INSIDER asked those respondents ""Setting aside those already running for the presidency, which of the following figures' endorsement would you most value when it comes to the Democratic primary?"" allowing respondents to select up to five figures.

70% of respondents said they valued former President Barack Obama's endorsement.

28% valued former President Bill Clinton's endorsement.

27% valued former President Jimmy Carter's endorsement.

25% valued Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement.

24% valued former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's endorsement.

22% valued House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's endorsement.

Ocasio-Cortez's performance is well within the margin of error in this case, meaning that it's entirely possible among the total population of Democratic primary voters that Pelosi and Clinton are more highly prized, and it's also entirely possible the freshman congresswoman from New York's support means more than Presidents Carter or Clinton. The takeaway is that this is now the company she keeps.

Other high performers among those asked include philanthropist and billionaire Bill Gates (23%) and climate activist and former Vice President Al Gore (24%). There was then a considerable drop off, but other valued endorsements included:

Former Secretary of State John Kerry (13%)

Stacey Abrams, who was the Democratic nominee in a tough Georgia gubernatorial election (12%)

Former Ambassador and National Security Advisor Susan Rice (8%)

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (7%)

Although Ocasio-Cortez's support is valued in league with presidents and former presidential nominees, she's also handily surpassing fellow members of Congress and fellow New Yorkers with decades more political experience.

New Yorker and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein both notched 7%.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pulled in 5%.

Rep. Jim Clyburn, Rep. Steny Hoyer and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who all hold leadership positions within Congress, each fail to surpass 2%.

While former presidents and House Speakers typically don't weigh in to take sides in partisan primaries, a number of senators running for president are clamoring for the opportunity to collaborate with Ocasio-Cortez on legislation to bolster their credentials among progressives, and get a shot at earning her endorsement.

While Ocasio-Cortez has said she isn't planning on endorsing anyone in the primary for quite some time, she indicated that it may come down to either Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren in a recent interview with CNN.

""What I would like to see in a presidential candidate is one that has a coherent worldview and logic from which all these policy proposals are coming forward,"" she told CNN's Ryan Nobles in May. ""I think Sen. Sanders has that. I also think Sen. Warren has that.""

Ocasio-Cortez has partnered with Sanders, who she affectionately nicknames ""tío"" or Uncle Bernie, on climate issues, holding town halls to promote her Green New Deal resolution and more recently, partnering on legislation to cap credit card interest rates and drawing up a resolution to declare a national emergency over climate change.

In April, Ocasio-Cortez had lunch in DC with Warren, with the two later teaming up to shoot a video sharply criticizing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin over his role in the demise of department store Sears— and joked about their disappointment over the series finale of ""Game of Thrones.""

On July 10, Sen. Kamala Harris— who has faced scrutiny over her record on criminal justice — announced that she and Ocasio-Cortez were collaborating on legislation to allow Americans with criminal records to apply for government-subsidized housing, and eliminate the so-called ""no-fault eviction"" rule, which allows the government to evict entire families if someone in the unit, including guests, commits a crime.

Warren also wrote a blurb about Ocasio-Cortez for TIME Magazine, which named the young lawmaker as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019.

""A year ago, she was taking orders across a bar,"" Warren wrote. ""Today, millions are taking cues from her... she reminds all of us that even while greed and corruption slow our progress...in our democracy, true power still rests with the people.""

EPA employee protests union contract while receiving award from Admin.

Loreen Targos, an EPA employee in Chicago, unfurled a banner on stage next to Wheeler reading, “I care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health and climate change. Do you?”

Targos was on stage with the rest of a team being honored for cleaning up refinery waste near Muskegon Lake in Michigan.

released by American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 704, based in the Great Lakes region, Targos can be heard asking Wheeler if he supports a fair contract for EPA workers.

EPA employees have been outraged by a recent contract that went into effect Tuesday that remains unsigned by union leaders and scales back union protections.

In an interview with The Hill, Targos said Wheeler did briefly respond to her.

“I did look at him and ask him and ask if he was going to support a fair contract and he said something along the lines of agency talking points of ‘We tried to come to the bargaining table but you guys refused.’”

The fight between the EPA and the union began over how much of the contract was even negotiable. The EPA wanted to renegotiate the entire contract, while the union wanted to renegotiate a narrower slice.

Under the latest contract, union employees would have to give up office space within the EPA offices and union leaders would not be able to use the intranet or agency billboards to communicate with members. It would also limit the amount of time union leaders could spend helping rank-and-file employees with labor disputes and other issues by 75 percent. It also changes how employees can arbitrate their grievances.

Targos said the new contract was “unilaterally imposed.” The AFGE has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against the EPA.

“There was all this pomp and circumstance to highlight the good work of EPA employees,” Targos said. “Why take away the conditions that supported such award-winning work?”

The EPA said it issued the new contract after years of fruitless negotiations.

“Administrator Wheeler was proud to host the National Honor Awards ceremony for the first time in 10 years and recognize the outstanding achievements of more than 700 EPA staff,” a spokesman told The Hill. “This collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired 12 years ago, the Trump EPA has worked with AFGE for the past two-and-half years to reach a new CBA and EPA is not the party refusing to come to the negotiating table.”

Targos said a security officer stopped her later and asked if she was actually an EPA employee.

“When I said yes he asked if I was really here to receive an award for that team and if I had just snuck on stage, so I said, ‘Yes I was in that group and supposed to get an award with that team,’” she said.

Targos said she was hoping to get more of a response from Wheeler.

“There’s always a part of you that hopes they will be better than what they say about them in the media, and it’s a sad thing to always be disappointed and realize, 'Oh you’re as bad as they say you are.'”"
Trump Admin’s ‘Pro-Women’ Human Rights Panel Stacked With Anti-Abortion Figures,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Emily Shugerman', 'Gender Reporter']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-loads-pro-women-commission-on-unalienable-rights-with-abortion-opponents,"A new Trump administration commission on human rights will be filled with anti-abortion advocates, including a former ambassador to the Holy See who declared that abortion is “related to the coarsening of the social fabric.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the creation of the Commission on Unalienable Rights last week in a Wall St. Journal op-ed, in which he claimed the discussion around human rights had become diluted. The new group, he wrote, would “ground our discussion of human rights in America’s founding principles.”

The announcement drew concern from human rights groups like Amnesty International, who worried the commission would seek to limit the scope of human rights domestically and abroad. And while the State Department claims the group will not discuss abortion, the conservative makeup of the commission has reproductive rights advocates on edge.

“Appointing these ideologues to a commission purporting to safeguard human rights will have the opposite effect and will endanger the health and well-being of countless women,” Michelle Kuppersmith, director of reproductive rights group Equity Forward, said in a statement.

“This is a clear extension of the Trump administration’s anti-women, anti-reproductive health campaign, and a blatant attempt to restrict the rights of vulnerable populations around the globe.”

The chair of the 12-person commission, Harvard Professor Mary Ann Glendon, is a former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See who led the Vatican’s delegation to the United Nations Conference on Women in 1995. At the time, she told The New York Times she “could not agree more” with Pope John Paul II, who was known for his traditional Catholic stances on abortion and contraception. She later went on to receive Notre Dame’s Evangelium Vitae Medal for “Heroes Of The Pro-Life Movement.”

‘The whole question about abortion is related to the coarsening of the social fabric,” Glendon told the Times in 1995. “It promotes a certain callousness which has frightening implications for the future.”

Also serving on the commission is F. Cartwright Weiland, a Texas-based attorney who studied under Glendon at Harvard Law. Weiland helped write Supreme Court amicus briefs supporting Texas’s restrictions on abortion providers and served on the Council For Life’s “Role of Rights” education panel.

Commission member Shaykh Hamza Yusuf Hanson, the president of Zaytuna College, published an article last year calling abortion “an assault on a sanctified life,” while fellow member Christopher Olaf Tollefsen co-authored the book Embryo: A Defense of Human Life, which argues against stem-cell research and promotes the idea that life begins at conception.

“There is nothing potential about the life of the fetus, the embryo, or the zygote: it is actually alive,” he wrote in a 2010 journal article. “Nor is there anything potential about the humanity of that life: it is an actual human life.”

Commission member Jacqueline Rivers, a sociology lecturer at Harvard, spoke on a 2017 Harvard Law Students For Life Panel Entitled “Why We Are ProLife: Dignity, Equality, Human Rights,” where she discussed how her pro-life views are rooted in her Christian faith. (The year before, she had delivered a letter to Hillary Clinton from more than 20 black church leaders asking her to address “justice for the unborn.”) In 2016, commission member Paolo Carozza spoke about a pro-life approach to international develeopment on the Notre Dame Right To Life Panel.

A senior administration official did not answer The Daily Beast’s questions about whether any members of the commission support abortion rights. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the commission would be advisory in nature and would not address “policy questions” like abortion rights. Instead, the official said, it would attempt to ground human rights in the founding principles of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”

“This is really a commission devoted to principles of inalienable rights,” the official said. “The commission has nothing to do with those kinds of domestic policy debates of the day; it will not discuss them.”

“ The commission is the most pro-women commission in the world, because it doesn't distinguish between men and women. ” — Senior administration official

“The commission is the most pro-women commission in the world, because it doesn't distinguish between men and women,” the official added.

The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to reduce its commitment to reproductive rights internationally, pushing to remove references to “sexual and reproductive health” from U.N. documents and threatening to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution on rape as a weapon of war because it mentioned reproductive health services. The State Department has also removed all data on reproductive rights from its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.

In a press release, the Center for Reproductive Rights called the new commission “part of a comprehensive effort by this Administration to erase sexual and reproductive health and rights from global discourse.”

“Contrary to its asserted purpose, there is no need to redefine or develop foundational principles on human rights,” they said. “There is a clear and unequivocal consensus by U.N. human rights treaty bodies and independent experts that reproductive rights are human rights, grounded in the right to life, health, equality, non-discrimination and freedom from cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, among other rights.”

Amanda Kasling, the Human Rights Watch Acting Co-Director for Women’s Rights, added that interpretations of international law define abortion is a human rights issue. Even a limited discussion of of “inalienable rights,” she said, would have include access to health care—including access to family planning and abortion—as well as prevention of maternal mortality.

“For women to actually be able to fully enjoy and have a fulfillment of their human rights, you have to ensure access to reproductive health care, full stop,” she said."

Justice Department probing Deutsche Bank’s dealings with Malaysia’s 1MDB,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/11/justice-department-probing-deutsche-banks-dealings-with-malaysias-1mdb/,"The US Justice Department is investigating whether Deutsche Bank violated foreign corruption or anti-money-laundering laws in its work for state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday.

The news comes after the bank announced plans to scrap its global equities unit, cut some fixed-income operations and slash 18,000 jobs globally in an $8.34 billion restructuring program.

Deutsche Bank’s work for 1MDB included helping to raise $1.2 billion in 2014 as concerns about the fund’s management and financials had begun to circulate, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.

Prosecutors are mainly looking into the role of Tan Boon-Kee, a colleague of a former Goldman Sachs executive, Tim Leissner, who worked with him on 1MDB-related business, the paper said.

She left Goldman to become Asia-Pacific head of banking for financial institutions clients at Deutsche Bank, where she was involved with further 1MDB dealings, it added.

In an emailed statement, Deutsche Bank said it had fully cooperated with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies that made inquiries about the fund.

“As stated in asset forfeiture complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, 1MDB made ‘material misrepresentations and omissions to Deutsche Bank officials’ in connection with 1MDB’s transactions with the bank,” the bank told Reuters.

“This is consistent with the bank’s own findings in this matter,” it added.

A DoJ civil asset forfeiture complaint repeatedly describes Deutsche Bank as being misled by 1MDB officers, the WSJ said.

Tan left Deutsche Bank last year, after it discovered communications between her and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier whom the Justice Department has described as the central player in the 1MDB scandal, it added.

A representative of insurance company FWD Group, Tan’s current employer, said the company and Tan declined to comment.

The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters."
Interior Dept. says it spent $2.45M in public funds on Trump’s ‘Salute to America’,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://wtop.com/dc/2019/07/interior-dept-says-it-spent-2-45m-in-public-funds-on-trumps-salute-to-america/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of department's share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July 4 ""Salute to America"" at $2.45 million.

In a letter to lawmakers on Capitol Hill made public Thursday, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of the department’s share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July Fourth “Salute to America” at the Lincoln Memorial at $2.45 million.

Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations’ spending for concerts, parades and other celebrations in and around the National Mall.

Interior’s costs included crowd accommodations, such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.

The disclosure confirms what The Washington Post had previously reported: that close to $2.5 million was diverted from the National Park Service, which normally uses the money from entrance and recreation fees to make improvements to U.S. parks.

Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the public funds were used to “celebrate President Trump.”

There are further concerns from local leaders as well.

In a Tuesday letter to Trump, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the president’s Fourth of July event on the National Mall, as well as protests by others, have left the city’s security fund bankrupt, and that it will be running at a deficit of more than $6 million by the end of September.

She attributed the Emergency Planning and Security Fund (EPSF) numbers to estimates by the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency and said the total cost for the District is estimated at $1.7 million.

The EPSF covers public safety at events, anti-terror efforts and support for the Secret Service.

Security for the annual “A Capitol Fourth” concert, which was held the same day on the National Mall, was provided by the federal Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, not D.C. police.

Bowser also said D.C. still hasn’t been reimbursed the $7.3 million extra it spent for Trump’s 2017 inauguration.

“These overages can be attributed to declining reserves, increased demand for heightened security, and a one-time draw down of $7.3 million to cover security costs associated with the 2017 presidential inauguration,” Bowser wrote.

The White House debates that figure.

Reached for comment about Bowser’s letter, the White House said: “We have received the letter and will respond in a timely manner.”

Senators are also seeking to probe the cost of the event, which included military flyovers and tanks on the National Mall.

WTOP has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Park Service, via the Interior Department, to see a cost breakdown for the event.

A Defense Department spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the Pentagon spent $1.2 million on the “Salute to America” celebration, which does not factor in the cost of flyovers, since the flyovers are being listed as training flights to “facilitate flying hours, which are imperative to military readiness.”

That puts known cost estimates for “Salute to America” at $5.35 million.

"Bill Clinton 'knows nothing' about financier Jeffrey Epstein's 'terrible crimes,' former president's spokesman says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-clinton-knows-nothing-about-financier-jeffrey-epsteins-terrible-crimes-former-presidents-spokesman-says,"Bill Clinton ""knows nothing"" about the ""terrible crimes"" linked to Jeffrey Epstein, the former president's spokesman said Monday, in Clinton's first statement after new sex-trafficking charges were lobbed against the wealthy financier.

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old wealthy hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said. ""Staff, supporters of the foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and he has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.”

Separately, claims in court showed that President Trump may have flown on the jet at least once, as well.

CUSHY PLEA BARGAIN WITH EPSTEIN WAS SO BAD IT BROKE THE LAW, JUDGE RULES

Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr said he has recused himself from the matter ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

On Saturday evening, Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned conspicuously that it is ""quite likely that some of our faves are implicated"" in the ""horrific"" sex-trafficking case.

""This Epstein case is horrific and the young women deserve justice,"" Pelosi tweeted. ""It is quite likely that some of our faves are implicated but we must follow the facts and let the chips fall where they may - whether on Republicans or Democrats.""

For his part, Trump previously called attention to Clinton's dealings with the financier.

""Nice guy -- uh, got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island, with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2015, referring to Clinton's connections with Epstein. ""A lot of problems.""

Meanwhile, Trump biographer Tim O'Brien this weekend reposted an excerpt fom a 2002 profile of Epstein in New York Magazine, in which Trump told a reporter, ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago estate “because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” according to court documents filed by Bradley Edwards, the lawyer who has represented several Epstein accusers. That claim has not been confirmed by Trump or Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein appeared Monday in a hearing that lasted about 30 minutes wearing a blue prison top with a brown T-shirt underneath, in addition to orange slip-on sneakers. Prosecutors said in the 36 hours since Epstein's arrest, multiple attorneys and several individuals have come forward and said they were victims, none of whom had previously been spoken to.

FORMER FBI OFFICIAL: INDICTMENT OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN IS 'PLACEHOLDER,' EXPECT DOZENS MORE CHARGES IN NEAR FUTURE

Epstein allegedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other underage girls.

""This allowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference.

Berman added that nude photographs ""of what appeared to be underage girls"" were discovered at Epstein's Manhattan mansion during a search following his arrest Saturday. The hundreds of photos were discovered in a locked safe, according to officials.

Prosecutors also allege Epstein ""worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates"" who helped facilitate his conduct by contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 66-year-old at his mansion in New York City and Palm, Beach, Fla.

At Epstein's multi-story mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform a massage on him.

""The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the 'massage,'"" prosecutors wrote. ""During the encounter, Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals.""

In Monday's court appearance, prosecutors said that the massage room in New York was set up exactly as how the alleged victims described it 15 years ago.

CHRISTINE PELOSI WARNS IT'S 'QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF OUR FAVES ARE IMPLICATED' IN 'HORRIFIC' EPSTEIN CASE

Victims would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash by either Epstein or one of his associates or employees, according to prosecutors. The 66-year-old also allegedly ""incentivized his victims"" to become recruiters by paying the victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl brought to him.

""In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit,"" federal prosecutors said.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said that Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 5 p.m. on Saturday ""without incident."" Epstein is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail near the Manhattan courthouse where he appeared Monday afternoon.

Trump 'dossier' author grilled by Justice Department watchdogs: sources,https://www.reuters.com,"['Mark Hosenball', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/trump-dossier-author-grilled-by-justice-department-watchdogs-sources-idUSKCN1U410I,"(Reuters) - Federal lawyers probing the origins of the investigation of ties between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign have interviewed the author of a “dossier” that alleged misconduct between Trump and Moscow, prompting the lawyers to extend their inquiry.

Three attorneys from the Inspector General’s office of the U.S. Department of Justice met in person in early June with dossier author Christopher Steele in Britain, said two sources with direct knowledge of the lawyers’ travels.

The interview with Steele, a former top spy on Russia for Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, took place while Trump was in London for a formal state visit with Queen Elizabeth and a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May.

Steele’s dossier, made public in 2017, alleged that Moscow attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that there was potential collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign, along with other unverified and salacious claims about the president.

The Justice Department’s inspector general has been examining the earliest stages of an FBI investigation of Trump, his former 2016 presidential campaign rival Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Russia and former Trump adviser Carter Page.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose office is an internal Justice Department watchdog, launched his probe in March 2018 amid allegations by Republican lawmakers that the FBI erred in seeking a warrant to monitor Page.

Trump has described the Steele dossier as “bogus” and Republicans have long sought to discredit the FBI’s investigation, which was later taken over by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His final report on Russia and the Trump campaign was released in redacted form in mid-April.

In that same month, Attorney General William Barr, who now heads the Justice Department, told a congressional committee that the Horowitz probe would be completed by May or June.

One of the two sources said Horowitz’s investigators appear to have found Steele’s information sufficiently credible to have to extend the investigation. Its completion date is now unclear.

A key focus of the Horowitz probe is whether the FBI followed proper procedures when it applied for a warrant with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to secretly conduct surveillance on Page and his ties to Russia.

Declassified documents show that the FBI cited information in Steele’s dossier when it asked the secretive FISA court in late 2016 for a warrant to eavesdrop electronically on Page, a U.S. businessman with interests in Russia.

Horowitz’s office in Washington declined to comment.

A spokesman for Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele’s London investigations firm, declined to comment.

UK government agencies declined to disclose whether they were in contact with Horowitz’s team in London.

Moscow repeatedly rejected accusations of interfering in the election.

Mueller’s report, released on April 18, said that Russia did meddle in the election in an attempt to boost Trump’s candidacy. It said Trump campaign officials had multiple contacts with Russian officials. But it found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Moscow.

The report also described numerous attempts by Trump to impede Mueller’s inquiry, but it stopped short of declaring that he committed a crime. Mueller during his inquiry brought charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and ex-Trump aides.

Page, a foreign policy adviser during Trump’s campaign, drew scrutiny from the FBI, which said in legal filings in 2016 that it believed he had been “collaborating and conspiring” with the Kremlin. But he was not charged.

The department said last week it opposed testimony by Aaron Zebley and James Quarles before the Democratic-led House of Representatives' Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, a senior congressional official told the paper. A Justice Department official confirmed the account and had instructed the men not to appear, the paper said.

A person familiar with the matter told Reuters the former Mueller team members were in negotiations to testify before the two panels behind closed doors. The person could not confirm that the Justice Department had instructed them not to testify.

Mueller is due to testify in open session before the House of Representatives Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on July 17.

Justice Department representatives were not immediately available for comment on the report. Committee spokesmen did not respond to a request for comment.

Mueller issued a report in April that found Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that Republican President Donald Trump’s campaign team had had multiple contacts with Russian officials.

But the report found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Moscow.

Mueller, in his first public comments since starting the two-year investigation, said on May 29 his probe was never going to end with criminal charges against Trump, and indicated it was up to Congress to decide whether he should be impeached.

""If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,"" Mueller said.

The Judiciary and Intelligence panels led by U.S. Representatives Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff are conducting their own investigations into Russian interference and possible obstruction. (Reporting by David Morgan and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bernadette Baum)

Two deputy commissioners leaving DHS,https://blogs.mprnews.org,['Briana Bierschbach'],,,,https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2019/07/two-deputy-commissioners-leaving-dhs/,"Two top officials in the Minnesota Department of Human Services are leaving the agency.

The departures of deputy commissioners Chuck Johnson and Claire Wilson were confirmed Thursday in an emailed statement from DHS Commissioner Tony Lourey.

“I am grateful for the decades of service from Deputy Commissioners Chuck Johnson and Claire Wilson, and for their willingness to stay in their positions through the transition from the Dayton to Walz Administration,” said Lourey. “Their guidance, leadership and wisdom was invaluable during the legislative session. We are working to identify an interim deputy commissioner of policy and hope to announce that information in the coming days.”

Wilson’s last day is Aug. 1 and Johnson will stay on for a month or two, according to the department. DHS did not say why the two deputy commissioners are leaving. The departures are happening seven months into the administration of DFL Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed a slew of new commissioners and retained others to run two dozen state agencies as part of the transition from the previous administration.

Johnson has worked for DHS in some capacity since 1989, working on early welfare reform efforts and eventually rose to deputy commissioner of operations, overseeing the agency’s budget development. DHS is the state’s largest agency and receives the second largest slice of the state budget. The department is in charge of overseeing a broad range of health care services, from welfare and economic assistance, to services for the elderly and people with disabilities.

Sen. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka, said the departures seem “unplanned” and “hasty.”

“I’m very concerned about this. It leaves a very big hole in the leadership of DHS,” said Abeler, who chairs the chamber’s Health and Human Services Policy Committee. “He takes a lot of institutional knowledge with him. It’s a big agency with all kinds of tentacles. He knows all of the ins and outs.”

Wilson has been with the department since 2016 and was appointed deputy commissioner for policy by Lourey this year. She oversees the department’s policy administration and equity work.

“She really has a lot of credentials in caring with people with disabilities and a lot of credibility with me,” Abeler said. “I don’t know how they replace that.”

Lawsuit alleges ‘gross mismanagement’ of student-loan forgiveness by the Department of Education,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Andrew Keshner'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lawsuit-alleges-gross-mismanagement-of-student-loan-forgiveness-by-the-education-department-2019-07-11,"Too many student-loan borrowers are missing their chance to get the debt relief they deserve because Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her staff have botched the administration of a loan-forgiveness program, a new lawsuit charges.

A federal program allows teachers and certain government and non-profit workers to wipe away their student-loan debts if they fit the right criteria — most importantly, 10 years of repayment — but the lawsuit filed Thursday by a powerful teacher’s union and several borrowers alleges DeVos’ Education Department is engaging in “gross mismanagement.”

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, a 2007 initiative that started accepted applications in 2017, has allowed loan forgiveness for 518 borrowers applications out of the 73,554.

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, a 2007 initiative that started accepted applications in 2017, has allowed loan forgiveness for a mere 518 borrowers applications out of the 73,554 applications it has received as of late March, according to Education Department data.

The American Federation of Teachers’ lawsuit attributes the less than 1% success rate to the department’s alleged failure to correctly review the loan-forgiveness applications. The department is also disregarding how student-loan servicers are misrepresenting eligibility rules to borrowers, according to the lawsuit filed in Washington D.C. federal court.

Millions of workers are relying on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, but the Department of Education — “the very agency that is supposedly the champion of our nation’s education system — has failed to live up to its role in administering this program,” the suit said. As a result, the department “has eviscerated the statutory promise of loan forgiveness for those who have spent a decade or more in public service dutifully repaying their loans.”

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program has been drawing fire for its complicated set of rules and, what borrower advocates say, is a lack of communication about those rules — even alleged misdirection in some cases.

One of the lucky few applicants who did have her debts wiped away previously told MarketWatch that getting her loans forgiven turned into a personal “crusade.” The process was filed with dozens of calls and a folder that became stuffed with documents as the process wore on, Tamar-Mattis, a Sonoma County, Calif.-based attorney

The Department of Education has discharged $30.6 million in debts as of March, according to department data on the program. That’s a fraction of what student loan borrowers owe.

Student loans accounted for $1.49 trillion of the nearly $14 trillion in American household debt as of 2019’s first quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Within all those household debts, student loans can pack a particularly nasty punch, some say. Student loans can squelch career and life plans for young workers just finding their way in the workplace, according to critics. JP Morgan Chase JPM, +0.38% CEO Jamie Dimon recently called the student loan system “a disgrace, and it’s hurting America, we see it hurting household formation, mortgages etcetera.”

Randi Weingarten, AFT’s president and one of the case’s plaintiffs, said federal lawmakers created the forgiveness program to provide relief for people who made public service their career. “It shouldn’t be a crapshoot. But under Betsy DeVos that’s what it has become,” Weingarten told reporters. “DeVos has hurt them. She has betrayed them. She has ignored the laws and out and out sabotaged them,” she later added.

Two other plaintiffs, Kelly Finlaw, a New York City middle school art teacher, and Gloria Nolan, a family engagement liaison in the St. Louis, Mo. school system, told reporters they endured years of getting the run-around and mixed messages when applying for forgiveness.

Nolan said a college degree was pitched to her as a way she could pull herself up by the bootstraps and achieve the American Dream. “For me, this process is setting those boots in cement,” she said.

The $500 monthly debt payments Nolan still makes “without any end in sight” are sucking up money that would otherwise go to her young kids’ college savings accounts.

Finlaw, coping with $88,000 in student loan debt, said the bills are blocking her from buying an apartment. A realtor told Finlaw there was “no way” she could afford the mortgage, the teacher said.

The Education Department “doesn’t comment on pending litigation,” spokeswoman Liz Hill said, “but I would point out, that the Department is faithfully administering the complex program Congress passed.”

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently called the student loan system ‘a disgrace, and it’s hurting America, we see it hurting household formation, mortgages etcetera.’

The new lawsuit is the latest set of allegations to claim borrowers are getting turned away from the debt relief to which they are entitled.

In another lawsuit linked to the AFT, several teachers last year said the loan servicer Navient gave them bad information about how to successfully apply to the loan forgiveness program.

Earlier this week, a Manhattan federal judge tossed many of the teachers’ claims but said they could proceed with the argument Navient was violating New York’s law against deceptive practices.

Navient argued the lawsuit was defective from the start because federal laws overrode state consumer protection laws. Southern District of New York Judge Denise Cote called the argument “unavailing.”

Last month, a federal appeals court revived a similar class-action case against another loan servicer accused of offering questionable advice about the best payment plan for debtors with tight budgets. Like Navient, Great Lakes Educational Loan Services also argued that federal laws prevented state law claims. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said federal laws didn’t protect the servicer from allegedly going out of its way to misrepresent repayment options.

In both cases, the companies said a 2018 memo from DeVos bolstered their cases. The memo said state laws were basically null and void when it came to student loan servicers, because only federal laws applied to the servicers.

In both cases, the courts said they weren’t persuaded by the memo’s reasoning."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Thursday denied a published report that Secretary Stephen Mnuchin had urged any company to apply for exemptions to the U.S. Commerce Department’s Huawei blacklisting.

Earlier this week, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the U.S. government will issue licenses to companies seeking to sell goods to Huawei where there is no threat to national security.

DHS Admits It Doesn't Have to Reject Donations to Migrants,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Sam Brodey', 'Congressional Reporter']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-admits-it-doesnt-have-to-reject-donations-to-migrants,"Americans have responded to reports of abysmal conditions at federally-run government migrant detention centers—where many, including children, lack access to basic necessities—by sending them donations of supplies like soap, toothbrushes, diapers, and toys.

So far, those donations have been rejected by the Department of Homeland Security, leaving the public and lawmakers alike angry and scratching their heads as to why. But the agency, which runs many of these detention centers, is now acknowledging that there is little legal basis to justify turning down donations from the public to help improve conditions for migrants.

Former DHS officials have contended in the press that it would be against the law for the government to accept donations of supplies for migrants provided by private citizens due to an obscure law called the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from using anything that has not been paid for through funds appropriated by Congress.

Unless, of course, the agency is DHS, which could take advantage of a massive loophole provided for them to do just that in existing law.

An appropriations bill signed into law in 2004 authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to “accept, hold, administer, and utilize gifts and bequests… to facilitate the work of the Department of Homeland Security.” There is also an exception for emergencies involving “the safety of human life.”

In response to questions from The Daily Beast, a DHS spokesperson did not say whether or not the Antideficiency Act prohibits the agency from accepting donated supplies for the benefit of migrants currently held in detention.

“CBP must comply with Federal law and relevant DHS policy in order to receive and manage donations,” said the spokesperson, referencing U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that directly manages detention facilities. “At this time we are coordinating among relevant CBP offices, including our Office of Chief Counsel to determine how we can most efficiently accept and manage donations from the public, in compliance with law and policy.”

A House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast that DHS could easily apply this 2004 statute to the current situation, putting the agency on solid legal ground to accept the boxes of hygiene supplies and toys that charities and private citizens have been ferrying to overcrowded, needy facilities in places like Clint, Texas. “The bigger issue, they’ve told us, isn’t the legal issue here, it’s more the logistical issue,” the aide said.

A House Republican aide echoed concerns about logistics and the capacity of the agency, which just obtained an emergency infusion of $4.6 billion from Congress to handle the situation at the border.

“Processing donations takes manpower,” said the aide. “Employees have to inspect donations, launder clothes, etc., at a time when CBP is already stretched thin.” DHS would not comment on its communications with lawmakers.

To this point, lawmakers from both parties and both sides of the Capitol have pressed the department for an explanation of why donations from the public are going unused. “This is something we need to address in hours and days, not weeks and months,” read a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, sent on June 3 by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and signed by 13 GOP lawmakers and three Democrats.

That group asked DHS to tell them how they could provide resources to help them better process donations. But a spokesperson for Crenshaw said on Monday that they had not yet received a response to their inquiries.

In another letter to McAleenan, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also urged DHS to “establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody.”

In June, a DHS official told reporters that they might use donations — but argued they weren’t necessary. “We are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward,” said the official, according to CNN. “But those items, it's important to note, are available now.""

“I think they don’t want to create the idea they’re not capable of taking care of this on their own,” said the House Democratic aide."
Judge denies DOJ request to change lawyers in census citizenship question case,https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-judge-denies-doj-request-to-change-lawyers-in-census-citizenship-question-case,"A New York federal judge barred the Justice Department on Tuesday from changing its lawyers in a legal fight over the Trump administration's effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman, an Obama appointee, said government lawyers' motion for the change was ""patently deficient"" except in the case of two lawyers who have already left the department or the civil division which is handling the case.

""Defendants provide no reasons, let alone 'satisfactory reasons,' for the substitution of counsel,"" Furman wrote.

TOP DEMOCRAT ON HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS PANELS WILL FIGHT TO OPPOSE TRUMP CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON CENSUS

The Justice Department sought to switch out its legal team Monday after some of its attorneys seemed to be giving up on the legal fight. Attorney General Bill Barr told the Associated Press that he had learned from a top DOJ civil attorney leading the litigation effort that multiple people on the team preferred not to continue.

Trump reacted to the ruling hours after it was issued.

""So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won’t let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?"" he tweeted.

The American Civil Liberties Union praised Furman's ruling in a Tuesday statement.

TRUMP SLAMS 'FAKE' REPORTS THAT CITIZENSHIP QUESTION FIGHT IS OVER

“The Justice Department owes the public and the courts an explanation for its unprecedented substitution of the entire legal team that has been working on this case,"" said Dale Ho, ACLU voting rights project director. ""The Trump administration is acting like it has something to hide, and we won’t rest until we know the truth.”

Trump has vowed to continue his effort to include the question, even after the U.S. Supreme Court last month temporarily blocked him from introducing it. The president has indicated he would use his executive order power to add the question to the census.

Furman also questioned how the Justice Department would meet deadlines in the case if a batch of new attorneys came on board, noting that government lawyers have three days to submit written arguments in the case.

""As this court observed many months ago, this case has been litigated on the premise — based 'in no small part' on Defendants’ own 'insist[ence]' — that the speedy resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims is a matter of great private and public importance,"" he wrote. ""If anything, that urgency — and the need for efficient judicial proceedings — has only grown since that time.""

The judge ordered that any DOJ lawyer who wished to withdraw from the case submit a signed sworn affidavit with a sufficient reason.

On Tuesday, the president blasted the Supreme Court on Twitter over the citizenship question decision and its 2012 ruling that held the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- which he has tried to repeal -- in place.

""I have long heard that the appointment of Supreme Court Justices is a President's most important decision. SO TRUE!"" he posted.

Teachers union to sue Education Department over student loan forgiveness program,https://thehill.com,[],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/452570-teachers-union-to-sue-education-dept-over-student-loan-forgiveness,"The American Federation of Teachers is planning to file a lawsuit Thursday against the Education Department over the public service student loan forgiveness program, NPR reported.

The suit reportedly argues that the program, which is supposed to forgive student loans for millions of public service workers, is in such bad shape that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program over a decade ago.

The program promises to forgive the remainder of federal student loan debt for graduates who pay loans for 10 years and work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, told NPR. ""This is a debacle.""

According to the Education Department itself, only 1 percent of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told NPR. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson explained, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven."" He added that these workers made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves."" An Education Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, but did say that the “Department is faithfully administering the complex program Congress passed.” An Education Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, but did say that the “Department is faithfully administering the complex program Congress passed.”

© USDA oversight is the critical first step in ensuring lab-grown protein is fairly and accurately labeled, says NCBA President Kevin Kester, Parkfield, Calif.

The amount of uncertainty surrounding this year’s corn and soybean crops was reflected in today’s round of USDA reports. In its monthly Crop Production and World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) reports, USDA made few revisions, acknowledging more information will be shared in next month.

“The report was neutral,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “The USDA kind of just kick the can down the road and the number of respects.”

This month, USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) will collect updated information on 2019 acres planted, and if the newly collected data justify any changes, NASS will publish updated acreage estimates in the August Crop Production report.

For corn, USDA kept the national average corn yield at 166.0 bu. per acre. The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 10 cents to $3.70 per bu.

“USDA left the corn yield number unchanged versus last month, and they used the June 28 Acreage number, which a lot of people—including USDA—believed to be wrong,” Vaclavik says. “They use the June numbers until they know more, and they will not know more until that August report. So, this is kind of a placeholder until then.”

The corn outlook calls for larger production and beginning stocks, greater feed and residual use, lower food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use and increased ending stocks.

For soybeans, USDA did lower the national average yield to 48.5 bu. per acre—down 1 bu. based on delayed planting progress. The 2019/20 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.40 per bu., up 15 cents from last month.

This month’s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 include lower beginning stocks, production, exports and ending stocks.

Vaclavik says the downward revision in corn demand wasn’t surprising, but some cuts were larger than the trade expected. The demand cuts reflected the last few month’s higher corn prices.

“You've got a corn prices that are really $1 better than it would have been had this weather event never happened,” he says. “What sort of impact will these prices have on demand in six months, 10 months or a year out? We really don't know.”

Markets Look Forward

With this round of USDA reports behind us, Vaclavik says the market will key in on two key factors.

“We’re still very much in weather market,” he says. “Weather during the next couple months combined with an August report, those are going to be your two big focuses.”

Most years, Vaclavik says, the weather is easier for the market and trade to analyze.

“You can look at a weather forecast in July and say if it will be a bullish or bearish forecast,” he says. “This year because of the variability both in terms of crop maturity and crop conditions makes it is very, very difficult for traders or anybody to look at a weather forecast or pattern and say this is bullish or bearish.”

Don’t expect the markets to become flippant about the weather forecast.

“We're still very much in the process of price discovery, and we're trying to figure out what the production numbers are going to be, while at the same time trying to figure out what the implications will be on the demand side with these higher prices,” he says.

Stay focused on your marketing plan, Vaclavik suggests.

“I understand that a lot of farmers are probably friendly or bullish the market right now because they understand that that we're in for a light crop,” he says. “Just because the crop is like doesn’t necessarily mean that prices will go higher. You don't want to totally abandon a marketing plan. These are prices that we had hoped and wished for every year for the last five or six years—here they are in corn.”

The best way to be bullish in this market, he says, is to own put options. “Buy your insurance, protect the downside, leave the upside totally open, and have a lot of flexibility.”

Also, be ready for volatility. “We're still in a higher volatility environment, and that's going to continue to we know more,” he says.

Mining company rejects EPA order for Superfund cleanup work,https://www.sltrib.com,['The Associated Press'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/07/11/mining-company-rejects/,"Durango • A mining company says it won’t carry out cleanup work ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as part of a Superfund project in southwest Colorado.

The Durango Herald reported Wednesday that Sunnyside Gold Corp. sent the EPA a letter saying the company isn’t responsible for pollution flowing from inactive mines in the area.

The EPA wants Sunnyside to help pay for some of the initial investigations into the Bonita Peak Superfund cleanup, citing the company's previous mining activity there.

The EPA says it will review Sunnyside's letter before deciding its next step.

Justice Dept. Seeks to Halt Democrats’ Suit Over Trump’s Profits in Office,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sharon Lafraniere'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/trump-emoluments-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Monday asked a federal appeals court to issue an emergency order halting a lawsuit by congressional Democrats that alleges that President Trump has illegally profited from his family business while in office.

In a court filing, the department’s lawyers asserted that Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia had committed a series of “clear and indisputable” legal errors in allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The most glaring of them, the department said, was his decision that members of Congress had legal standing to sue the president.

Judge Sullivan, they argued in a filing to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, wrongly treated a complaint based on novel and flawed legal constitutional arguments as if it were “a run-of-the-mill commercial dispute.” If the appeals court refuses to intervene, they argued, the case will proceed into the evidence-gathering phase, in which Mr. Trump will be forced to reveal details of his financial affairs."

To fix this immigration problem requires immediate changes to our laws, not just funding: Opposing view

Since last fall, the Department of Homeland Security has consistently stated that Border Patrol’s temporary holding spaces were not designed nor ever intended to detain the record numbers of migrants illegally crossing the border, including tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and families every month.

During multiple border trips, our panel consistently observed alarming conditions at holding facilities despite Border Patrol’s valiant efforts to feed, clothe and improve medical care for migrants, many of whom arrived diseased or ill from the perilous journey.

With dangerous, illegal border crossings continuously rising, in April our bipartisan panel of the Homeland Security Advisory Council issued its public report urging emergency funding and legislative fixes to address this surge and the nation’s broken immigration system.

Our recommendations included establishing temporary regional centers near the southwest border and another in Guatemala with sufficient living space, judges, security and medical support to humanely care for families and children and timely process their claims. Today, our panel still awaits congressional action on our emergency recommendations from April 16.

The numbers are staggering. This fiscal year, more than 266,000 children illegally crossed our border primarily from Central America, exceeding the past two fiscal years combined.

Because of an outdated legal framework, there are few options for unaccompanied children from Central America. Under current law, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is prevented from keeping children together with close relatives who aren’t their parent or legal guardian. Only Congress can change that. Legally, these children cannot be repatriated back home nor can they simply be released into the interior of the USA. They must be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for placement with a sponsor.

This year’s backlogs in transferring children ages 12 and under from Border Patrol custody to HHS did not exist last year. But, as the numbers of families and children illegally crossing the border repeatedly spiked to historic levels, it exceeded the fixed space and beds of HHS. That’s why, in April, federal agencies that had exhausted their budgets for housing children requested emergency funding to avoid this very crisis of children held at inadequate Border Patrol facilities.

Unfortunately, Congress didn’t pass emergency funding until June 27, almost two months later.

Based on our review, Homeland Security has done all it reasonably could with limited resources to care for children who should have been transferred from Border Patrol to HHS custody within 72 hours, and ideally for tender aged children within 24 hours. The Border Patrol did not cause this crisis; our broken immigration system did.

To fix this problem requires immediate changes to our laws, not just funding. With passage of the supplemental funding, Congress has demonstrated that it has the capacity to change the law if members have the will.

Mueller III, is joining a law firm in New York. (Courtesy of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher/Dave Cross)

Zainab Ahmad, a member of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s prosecution team who worked the probe of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, is leaving the Justice Department for a job at a private law firm, she said Wednesday.

Ahmad, a veteran New York prosecutor of complex terrorism cases, said in an interview that she is joining Gibson Dunn & Crutcher to work on international legal matters.

“It just felt like the right moment, in terms of wanting a new challenge,” she said.

Like many of her former Mueller team colleagues who have remained tight-lipped about their work for him, Ahmad declined to discuss her time in the two-year pressure cooker of the special counsel’s office.

“I think that Bob Mueller is an amazing public servant and he assembled a great team who worked incredibly hard, with the highest level of integrity,” she said. “That is something that I hope the American public knows.”

Mueller is scheduled to testify next week to Congress about his investigation — a much-anticipated public hearing that Democrats hope will refocus public attention on President Trump’s conduct.

Ahmad said she had no particular hope or expectation for Mueller’s testimony, and declined to comment when asked if she had any interest in testifying about the investigation.

Ahmad brought to the special counsel experience negotiating with foreign governments to gather evidence and interview witnesses. And she looks to do similar work in private practice.

She said some of her “greatest thrills” as a prosecutor came in securing witnesses or arranging the extradition of foreign terrorist suspects to the United States.

“I really enjoy navigating the divide between countries and cultures and languages and backgrounds, and I hope to do a lot of international work,” she said.

In addition to the probe of Flynn, which led to his guilty plea for lying to the FBI, Ahmad worked on a prolonged subpoena fight with a still-unidentified company controlled by a foreign government. That battle went to the Supreme Court, and in January a judge imposed a $50,000-a-day fine on the firm for not complying with Mueller’s subpoena. Those penalties stopped the following month, when the company turned over nearly 1,000 pages of documents.

Ahmad declined to comment on the case.

She said she would be open to someday going back to work at the Justice Department but had no specific goal to do so.

Ahmad said she’s still adjusting to life after the Justice Department, and after working for Mueller, whose office was so secure it was designated a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. That meant that when prosecutors showed up for work, they had to check their cellphones at the door. Before joining Mueller’s team, Ahmad spent much of her time as a terrorism prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York inside similarly secure workspaces.

“I have gotten so used to not having my cellphone with me, that now I find it overwhelming to have it with me and be expected to respond to things in a timely manner,” she said. “I miss having the ‘SCIF excuse’ for poor communication.”"
"Trump intervention delaying EPA biofuel waiver action, sources say",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-ethanol/trump-intervention-delaying-epa-biofuel-waiver-action-sources-say-idUSKCN1U52BP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s request for a review of the administration’s expanded use of biofuel waivers for oil refiners is holding up its decisions on 2018 applications, according to three sources familiar with the matter, two of whom said Trump may soon host a meeting on the issue.

Trump had ordered (here) members of his Cabinet to review the controversial waiver program, which exempts small refiners in financial turmoil from their obligation to blend ethanol into gasoline, last month after hearing from farmers angry about the issue during his recent Midwest tour.

Since Trump took office, the Environmental Protection Agency has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refiners, saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging another key constituency - corn growers - who claim the move threatens ethanol demand.

Since Trump’s request for a review, the EPA has been scrambling to come up with a solution to move forward with 40 pending applications for the waivers, called Small Refinery Exemptions or SREs, covering 2018.

“The SRE decision is being held up because the President wants to have this conversation,” one of the sources familiar with the issue said.

Two sources said the White House could host a meeting next week on the issue that would include Trump, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, and senators from both oil and farm states.

There was no final decision yet on whether a meeting would be held, or when, they said.

All three of the sources said that the 2018 SRE decisions were nearly finalized before Trump became involved.

The White House declined to comment.

The EPA responded to a request for comment by saying it was implementing biofuel policy in accordance with the law.

“We will work with the White House, DOE, USDA, members of Congress and other stakeholders to ensure the proper administration of the (Renewable Fuel Standard),” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in an emailed statement.

The Department of Energy provided the EPA its scoring results for the 40 outstanding 2018 applications in late April, sources told Reuters. EPA is required to decide on applications no later than 90 days after receiving them.

Some refiners say they filed their applications far earlier than April, and say the EPA is already late.

POLITICAL TIGHTROPE

The Renewable Fuel Standard, a more than decade-old regulation that is aimed at helping farmers and reducing U.S. dependence on oil, has been a big point of contention between the rivaling oil and corn industries, leaving Trump struggling to find a balance between the two important constituencies as he eyes a bid for re-election next year.

The regulation requires refiners to blend increasing volumes of ethanol and other biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase credits from those that do. But it also allows refining facilities of less than 75,000 barrels per day to request waivers if they can prove that complying with the law would cause them disproportionate financial hardship.

Small refineries owned by giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, along with a facility owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn have secured waivers from Trump’s EPA, according to Reuters reporting.

Trump’s request that Cabinet members, including Agriculture Secretary Perdue, help hash out a fix to the waiver program has become a source of concern for lawmakers representing oil refining states. Perdue has often publicly criticized the EPA’s administration of the waiver program, siding with farmers.

Last week, Republican senators representing oil states wrote to Trump asking him to keep Perdue away from any decision-making process over the petitions. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy also wrote to Perdue saying he will block confirmation of agency nominations until Perdue “stops interfering.”"
DOD wants to place virtual sensors in AWS’s commercial cloud for a secure connection,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.fedscoop.com/aws-dod-sensors-scca-cloud-security/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to clarify that the sensors in use are virtual.

Regardless of how the ongoing $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud procurement plays out in the next month or so, the Defense Information Systems Agency is prepping for more adoption of Amazon Web Services’ commercial cloud.

DISA issued a sources sought solicitation Tuesday saying that it plans to integrate its Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) into AWS’s Secret Region, which is approved to host Department of Defense data and services up to impact level 6 for Secret-level classified information.

To do so, DISA will place software-based, firewall-like virtual sensors in AWS’s cloud “to monitor DoD workloads hosted therein. These sensors inspect traffic to and from those DoD workloads and route inspected traffic to the [Defense Information System Network].”

The SCCA is essentially DISA’s model for securing the Department of Defense’s workloads hosted in the commercial cloud. The agency describes it as “a set of services that provides the same level of security the agency’s mission partners typically receive when hosted in one of the DISA’s physical data centers.”

To be clear, this solicitation doesn’t mean the Pentagon is buying more commercial cloud services from AWS — though it certainly could play out that way if JEDI is awarded to AWS. However, it signals that DOD is looking to secure its connection to AWS’s cloud because it’s possible, if not likely, the two will do more work together.

“DISA does not determine where DoD mission owners chose to host their cloud-based DoD workloads but is charged with protecting those workloads in the CSPs they select,” the solicitation says. AWS “currently hosts existing DoD workloads, and has strong demand for additional DoD workloads.”

It’s likely DISA will soon look to other cloud providers next to integrate with the CSSA, as each commercial cloud provider military services do business with will need its own sensors. In this case, AWS, because of its more advanced security authorization, appears to be one of the first. “Those CSPs with existing and forecast workloads are the first to be integrated with the SCCA and have boundary defense established for those DoD workloads,” the solicitation says.

DISA wants to hear from AWS resellers by July 23. The eventual contract will be for a year with two optional renewal years.

This comes as the Pentagon’s JEDI procurement looms. AWS and Microsoft are currently faced off as the only contenders for the landmark commercial cloud contract. DOD CIO Dana Deasy said recently the Pentagon plans to make an award in August.

Meanwhile, Oracle has filed a lawsuit against the single-award nature and technical requirements of the contract; it also alleged that conflicts of interest between DOD and AWS steered the contract toward Amazon as the frontrunner to win. The Court of Federal Claims is hearing oral arguments on that protest this week. If the court were to rule in Oracle’s favor, it would certainly throw a wrench into the JEDI award timeline."
