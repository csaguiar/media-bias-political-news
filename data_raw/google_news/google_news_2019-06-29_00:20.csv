Jimmy Carter suggests Trump is an illegitimate president,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/28/politics/jimmy-carter-trump-russia-interference/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former President Jimmy Carter suggested Friday that a full investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would show that Donald Trump didn't win the presidency.

""There's no doubt that the Russians did interfere in the election. And I think the interference, although not yet quantified, if fully investigated would show that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,"" Carter said at the Carter Center's retreat in Leesburg, Virginia.

Asked if he believes Trump is an illegitimate president, Carter paused for a moment.

""Based on what I just said, which I can't retract,"" Carter said to audience laughter.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's report found that Russia waged a ""sweeping and systematic"" influence campaign during the 2016 election with the goal of electing Trump, but did not establish a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Moscow."
"Trump and Putin Share Joke About Election Meddling, Sparking New Furor",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Peter Baker', 'Michael Crowley']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/trump-putin-election.html,"OSAKA, Japan — They were having a good time. Like old friends reuniting, they warmly shook hands, smiled and chatted amiably. And then President Trump brushed off Russia’s interference in American democracy with a joke as President Vladimir V. Putin chuckled.

The first encounter between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin since the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III reported that Russia conducted a “sweeping and systematic” operation to sway the 2016 election proved more convivial than confrontational. Rather than challenge Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump treated it as a laughing matter.

In the process, he triggered a fresh furor over his accommodating approach to Russia and brought back old questions that have haunted him since he took office: Angry at perceived challenges to his legitimacy, he has long dismissed the conclusions of American intelligence agencies that Russia sought to help his campaign.

But while Mr. Trump once hoped to leave the investigation behind and finally recalibrate the Russian-American relationship, he instead put the issue back in the spotlight as House Democrats prepare to question Mr. Mueller on camera next month."
Megan Rapinoe Cannot Make This Any Clearer,https://deadspin.com,"['Barry Petchesky', 'About The Author', 'Deputy Editor']",,,,https://deadspin.com/megan-rapinoe-cannot-make-this-any-clearer-1835936942,"Photo: Marc Atkins (Getty)

Megan Rapinoe does not want to go to the White House. Megan Rapinoe does not want to go to the White House if the U.S. Women’s National Team wins the World Cup, because Donald Trump is the president. She does not want to visit Donald Trump because of his record and statements on racial issues, gender issues, LGBTQ issues, immigration, sexual harassment, sexual assault—take your pick, or pick all of them: If there’s a marginalized group, the president has said or done something to degrade it, marginalize it further, or outright harm it. Megan Rapinoe disagrees with all of this, because she appears to be a decent human being, and doesn’t really want to hang out with Trump because of that. This seems pretty clear-cut.



On Tuesday, when Rapinoe told Eight By Eight, “I’m not going to the fucking White House,” it wasn’t even the first time. In a May Sports Illustrated profile, Rapinoe had run down the list of causes and movement she supports, and said in plain language that those issues matter more to her than a White House visit.

“I am not going to fake it,” she said, “hobnob with the president, who is clearly against so many of the things that I am [for] and so many of the things that I actually am. I have no interest in extending our platform to him.” That last sentence is the key, isn’t it? When Trump invites championship-winning athletes to a fast-food shindig at his office, he’s glomming onto their fame and success and implicitly boasting their imprimatur. The USWNT, should it win the World Cup, will be able to choose the manner of their fêting, and its members will have the platforms to say what they want to say and celebrate what they want to celebrate without having the president’s self-satisfied grinning face looming over everything. They don’t need him. And while there are those people who will tell you that a championship-winning athlete visiting the White House is apolitical, that athlete has explicitly made the decision that the president’s beliefs, words, and actions aren’t odious enough to turn down the visit. That’s a political calculation. Rapinoe is expressing her politics, and she’s being honest about them, and she’s doing it in a way that will get attention. No different than her refusal to sing the national anthem before matches.



Of course all of this got Trump’s attention, because someone was talking about him in a setting large enough to eventually end up on Fox & Friends, and on Wednesday he pooped out some tweets at Rapinoe but also about NBA owners and black unemployment because...? Also he tweeted at the wrong person. He formally invited the USWNT to the White House, win or lose, because Trump instinctually understands what a lot of people still deny: this is a political opportunity. And if the USWNT aren’t going to extend their platform to him, he’s just going to clamber atop their platform, or perhaps be hoisted onto it it via a complicated series of ropes and pulleys.

This isn’t a he-said she-said. Rapinoe doesn’t have to respond to the president’s tweets, or clarify yet again her problems with a White House visit. And so on Thursday, at a media availability a day ahead of the de facto tournament final against France, Rapinoe tried to head off the back-and-forth with a statement.

“I stand by the comments that I made about not wanting to go to the White House, with exception of the expletive,” she said. “My mom would be very upset about that. “But I think obviously answering with a lot of passion, considering how much time and effort and pride we take in the platform that we have, and using it for good, and for leaving the game in a better place and hopefully the world in a better place — I don’t think that I would want to go and I would encourage my teammates to think hard about lending that platform or having that co-opted by an administration that doesn’t feel the same way and fight for the same things we fight for.”

Supreme Court to decide whether Trump administration can end DACA program,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Shannon Bream', ""Shannon Bream Currently Serves As Anchor Of Fox News Channel'S"", 'Fnc']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-to-decide-whether-trump-administration-can-end-daca-program,"The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether plans by the Trump administration to end the so-called DACA program for young undocumented immigrants can proceed.

The justices announced Friday they will hear oral arguments on the appeal in its next term, which begins in October. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues.

COURT SAYS IT HAS NO ROLE IN POLICING GERRYMANDERING

Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program, known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA.

DACA was created under executive order, and gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

The Trump administration in 2017 announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

GORSUCH SIDES AGAIN WITH LIBERAL BLOC

The Supreme Court took the unusual step of taking up the cases before they had been fully heard at the lower court level.

The cases are DHS v. Regents of the University of California (18-587); Trump v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (18-588); and McAlleenan v. Vidal (18-589)."
DHS acting chief predicts up to 25 percent drop in border crossings after new Mexico agreement,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dhs-chief-predicts-25-percent-drop-in-border-numbers-after-agreement-with-mexico,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security on Friday said that he expects the number of migrants apprehended at the border will be lower by up to 25 percent in June than in previous months after Mexico increased its enforcement measures.

“It’s become clear that over the past three weeks since the administration reached a new agreement with Mexico that we’ve seen a substantial increase in the number of interdictions on the Mexican southern border, and a sincere effort to address the transportation networks coming through Mexico,” Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan told reporters.

DEMS RUN LEFT ON IMMIGRATION: DEBATE FEATURES VOWS OF HEALTH CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED, DEPORTATION CURBS

The U.S. and Mexico reached agreement this month on a deal that sees Mexico take “unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration” in exchange for the U.S. dropping proposed sanctions on Mexican imports.

McAleenan said the U.S. was looking to see Mexico increase its deployment of National Guard members to the border, and for the expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) -- which allow for illegal immigrants to be returned to Mexico while their immigration proceedings are held.

""These initiatives are making an impact and we are now anticipating a significant reduction in border crossing numbers from June, as much as 25 percent when compared to the record level in May,” he said.

NEW LEADERS INSTALLED AT TOP IMMIGRATION AGENCIES AMID QUESTIONS OVER DHS SECRETARY'S FUTURE

Customs and Border Protection said that it encountered more than 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. NBC News reports that in 2018 there was a 17 percent decrease from May to June.

McAleenan also said the U.S. is working with Northern Triangle countries to deal with root causes of the migration crisis and increase efforts to tackle organized smuggling organizations in the region.

His remarks come a day after the House passed the Senate version of a $4.5 humanitarian aid bill. It passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed down from a push to include restrictions on immigration enforcement that could have scuttled the measure. Trump is expected to sign the bill early next week.

McAleenan thanked congressional leaders for getting the bill passed, and said that while it didn’t include everything DHS wanted in it -- specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention beds for single adults -- it “substantially addresses” the request for funding.

He also took issue with media reports that children at detention centers were not being given vital supplies while in detention, leading to an outcry from lawmakers on Capitol Hill about alleged conditions at the centers. He said that while he has testified for months about concerns over the ability of DHS to handle the vast number of migrants crossing the border, those calls received little attention. But he said that some reports were ""missing the story.""

""Contrary to the reporting, children in CBP custody at the border are receiving access to key supplies, including toothbrushes, appropriate meals, blankets, showers as soon as they can be provided, and medical screening,"" McAleenan said."
Pentagon facing possibility of third acting defense secretary in less than a month,https://www.cnn.com,"['Barbara Starr', 'Cnn Pentagon Correspondent']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/28/politics/pentagon-vacancies-acting-secretary/index.html,"(CNN) With military tensions rising in the Middle East , more than a dozen of the most senior roles at the Pentagon lack permanent appointees and President Donald Trump is likely to be forced to name, at least temporarily, a third acting defense secretary in the coming weeks.

The Department of Defense is struggling to establish an unprecedented transition plan aimed at ensuring continuity of leadership at the highest levels while there is still no confirmed secretary of defense.

It is now increasingly likely Navy Secretary Richard Spencer will be named acting defense secretary for a brief period when Mark Esper , who is currently in the acting position following the dramatic implosion of Patrick Shanahan's nomination , is formally nominated for the permanent role. There are already plans to give Spencer highly classified briefings and secure communications to carry out the job.

The turmoil has only been heightened by the fact more than a dozen of the most senior and critical jobs at the Pentagon are filled by temporary officials.

Right now, there is no secretary of the Air Force, or permanent senior official in charge of issues as crucial as personnel and readiness; international security affairs; special operations and strategy and planning.

If Esper, who was serving as Army secretary is confirmed as Secretary of Defense, then his deputy at Army, Ryan McCarthy will have to be confirmed to fill that job as well.

In addition it is possible the Pentagon will not have a Senate confirmed vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the second highest military adviser to the President. General Paul Selva, the current vice chairman retires at the end of July and there is growing concern inside the department that unless General John Hyten, the expected successor can be quickly confirmed, the job will be unfilled for an extended period due to the summer congressional recess.

If it is unfilled by early September it means Hyten, a highly respected four star general who has decades of nuclear weapons experience could potentially have to revert to being a two star general until he is confirmed.

Priority to get Esper's confirmation hearing scheduled

However, the top priority is to get Mark Esper's nomination to the Senate Armed Services Committee so a confirmation hearing can be scheduled quickly.

A senior defense official emphasized key decisions are still to be made about what happens as soon as Esper's nomination goes to the Hill.

The official said the administration is expected to formally submit his nomination to the Senate in the coming days in hopes of having a confirmation vote by mid-July. However, one congressional official said given the Senate July 4 recess and the legislative schedule, it more likely a vote would take place at the end of the month.

Due to federal regulations, Esper is expected to have to instantly step down as the acting secretary of defense during that confirmation process, several officials have said. Government lawyers are looking to see if there are any loopholes that could keep him in the job through a confirmation vote, the defense official said.

It is not clear what would happen if this interim situation continues past July 31. Under federal regulations there is supposed to be a permanent secretary of defense by that date.

It is not yet clear there if there is a legal loophole, the congressional official said. They added that given the scramble was prompted by Shanahan's sudden withdrawal, the Senate Armed Services Committee is not likely to be in the mood to unduly rush the Esper confirmation even though members want a confirmation hearing scheduled as quickly as reasonably possible.

The assumption right now is that Esper steps down as soon as the nomination is submitted. The traditional practice is that the nomination would sit with the committee for seven days so there is time to schedule a hearing, ensure senators are available and receive answers to written questions submitted to Esper.

Plan to have navy secretary step in

So with the assumption Esper steps down in the interim, there is now intense internal Pentagon planning to have Navy Secretary Spencer step in as the interim acting secretary.

This would mean Spencer will have to start being completely briefed on all key issues, ranging from nuclear command and control to ongoing covert operations, to the latest intelligence on Iran. The official said the department is trying to figure out exactly when the process of briefing Spencer to be a fully qualified defense chief will begin so he is ready if Esper steps down in the interim.

If this all happens it means Esper likely will vacate the secretary of defense suite of offices in the Pentagon and go back to his former office as Army secretary. Spencer likely will leave the Navy secretary's office and move into the secretary of defense suite on the third floor of the Pentagon which has 24/7 global highly secure communications, until Esper is confirmed.

The official said as soon as the transition plan is finalized and approved by the White House, the Pentagon leadership wants to make it public so the country, as well as adversaries know exactly who holds the authorities of secretary of defense.

The transition plan currently even includes obtaining new official photographs and office door signs for Spencer, though he may only have the top job for a few days the official said.

A similar transition plan is being worked out for David Norquist who is being nominated to become deputy secretary of defense."
Elizabeth Warren says no wealthy donors as ambassadors in State plan,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/28/19102522/elizabeth-warren-state-department-plan-2020,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) just released her vision for how she would run the State Department from the Oval Office — and it’s a dramatic change from how President Donald Trump has handled America’s diplomatic corps.

In a Friday Medium post, Warren vowed to pursue a “diplomacy-first strategy” as president as opposed to conducting US foreign policy mostly through the better-funded Pentagon. To do that, she says, her administration would invest much more in the current and future diplomats that serve in roughly 270 posts around the world.

“American security and prosperity depend on robust diplomacy,” she wrote. “Our diplomats are the front line of our engagement with the world.”

Her piece details that she won’t allow wealthy campaign donors to become ambassadors, how she aims to double the size of the diplomatic corps while improving diversity in its ranks, and how she’d create a diplomatic equivalent of ROTC programs in universities, among other moves.

It makes sense for Warren to put out a vision like this. First, having a plan for every aspect of governance is kind of her thing. Second, her overall foreign policy views prioritize diplomacy over using the military. And third, the Trump administration has caused much heartburn at the State Department by proposing lower budgets and failing to nominate qualified people for key positions, although that’s starting to change.

But because it’s a relatively short Medium post, the senator’s State Department plan is lacking many details about how, exactly, she would turn her aspirations into reality. There’s no mention about how she’d fight a GOP-led Senate to spend more and confirm nominees, there’s no real connection (yet) with how these views intersect with her thoughts on defense and development, and no discussion of tradeoffs she might face while prioritizing the State Department’s revamp.

Still, offering a State Department plan makes her the leading candidate on the issue during the 2020 cycle (for now). And what she offers are some concrete proposals that would let Warren put her mark on one of America’s oldest governmental professions.

How Warren wants to fix the State Department

Warren’s plan comes down to three main proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the way the State Department has been managed under Trump — and that represent something of a departure from how the department was run under President Barack Obama, too.

1) No wealthy donors become ambassadors

This is likely the part of Warren’s plan that will get the most attention. There’s a long tradition of presidents in both parties nominating some of their richest financial supporters to plum ambassadorial posts. In Obama’s second term, for example, he named 31 campaign “bundlers” — people who raised at least $50,000 for his campaign — as an embassy’s top diplomat.

“Nearly all of these bundlers ... serve in Western European nations or other highly developed and stable countries such as Canada and New Zealand,” the Center for Public Integrity reported in January 2017.

Trump continued the practice by nominating 14 inauguration donors — who gave on average about $350,000 — as ambassadors. What’s worse, the people he nominated for top embassy posts were less qualified than in administrations past, as the February chart from Axios below shows. (The nominated ambassadors also gave more money to his campaign, on average, than previous rich donors gave other presidents.)

Warren says that trend would end under her watch. “I’ll make my ambassadorial appointments based on only one thing: finding the most qualified person for the job,” she wrote. “I won’t give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers — period,” she continued, calling on other candidates to promise the same.

That said, it’s somewhat easy for Warren to make this pledge. She’s already not taking money from high rollers or speaking at big fundraisers, so her bench of wealthy supporters is already thin. Still, her vow, if enacted, would end a long-standing problem of pay-for-play at some of America’s most important embassies.

2) Revamp the diplomatic corps

Warren blames Trump for many diplomats recently leaving the government, but she also notes that’s been a problem for a while. “Years of hiring freezes and spending cuts have caused many talented diplomats to head for the doors,” she wrote.

So Warren proposes two ways to change that: double the size of the foreign service and improve the diversity in the diplomatic corps.

Those go hand in hand. Right now, America’s diplomats are mainly white and male. “[T]he Foreign Service is not sufficiently representative of the American people with respect to race, gender, socioeconomic background, and regional origin,” a May 2018 Congressional Research Service report noted.

That means there’s a vast, untapped pool of people around the country that may be interested in a diplomatic posting. To reach out to them, Warren says she’ll “dedicate recruiting resources to applicants from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and other minority-serving institutions, women’s colleges, and community colleges. And I’ll double the size of fellowships designed to recruit minority and low-income diplomats.”

She’ll also push for universities to have a ROTC-like program for diplomats as well as double the size of the Peace Corps.

Trump, meanwhile, has consistently proposed cuts to the State Deparment budget and recruited secretaries of state that seem intent on lowering diplomatic ranks. Multiple diplomats I’ve talked to since the start of this administration have consistently noted the poor morale among the corps and just how understaffed — and therefore overworked — they all are.

Warren’s changes, then, will certainly require tons of effort and a decent chunk of money (although surely a lot, lot less than the Pentagon spends). It’s unlikely she could completely alter the face of the US diplomatic corps in four or even eight years. But she seems intent on making structural tweaks quickly in hopes of long-term change.

3) Improve the lives of diplomats

Diplomats have to deal with two big institutional challenges. First, they work for a large, impersonal bureaucracy that doesn’t always let the best talent rise to the top. Second, their service in major cities around the world makes it harder to raise a family and strike a normal work-life balance.

Warren wants to alter all that.

She proposes creating a “core professional development curriculum” which would help diplomats improve in their jobs and prepare for more senior roles. That will help her make at least one Deputy Secretary — a position right under the secretary of state — a career ambassador, one of the corps’ top designations.

The senator also aims to “enhance workplace flexibility to retain a diverse workforce.” She’d do that, in part, by “expanding parental leave and preferential postings for new parents.” That means new mothers and fathers wouldn’t be penalized as much for starting a family in the hyper-competitive State Department. What’s more, raising a kid in a more developed country could make an upbringing easier than, say, growing up in a warzone.

None of this is to say Warren’s plan is perfect; no plan is. But even in a short Medium post, Warren has given more thought about what to do with the State Deparment than many (if not all) of her Democratic opponents. The question now is if any other presidential candidate — including Trump — can come up with a better plan in the months ahead."
"U.S. Corn Acreage Way Above Trade Expectations, Market Falls, USDA/WASDE Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/us-corn-acreage-to-drop-to-record-low-usdawasde-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The USDA sees the U.S. 2019 corn acreage nearly unchanged from its March estimate, according to its June Acreage Report released Friday.

As a result, the corn dropped 'limit down’ 25¢, basis the Sept. futures contract, while the soybean market moved up 11¢ per bushel, following the report.

•Note: USDA announced Friday that it will resurvey 14 states, regarding planting acreage, due to flooding and inclement weather. The results of the survey will be released August 12, 2019.

At the close, the Sep. corn futures finished 21¢ lower at $4.24¾, bouncing off a daily limit low of $4.20. Dec. corn futures closed 19½¢ lower at $4.31¼.



Aug. soybean futures closed 10¾¢ higher at $9.04½. November soybean futures finished 10¾¢ higher at $9.23.

Sep. wheat futures closed 19½¢ lower at $5.27¼.

August soymeal futures closed $2.10 per short ton higher at $315.30. August soy oil futures ended 0.44¢ higher at 28.37¢ per pound.

In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.55 lower, the U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 50 points higher.

Trade Reaction

Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that USDA gave the markets another shocker today.

“Everyone was looking for more beans and less corn and got exactly the opposite. That is why the big reaction, and it is perfectly understandable. A 25¢ range in corn in less than 3 minutes is something. No one understands the corn planted and harvested area, as USDA had not shown that type of progress in the weekly data. The stocks reports are kind of friendly, but the planted area report is the headline and most likely not in a good way for a lot of traders and brokers. These are wild numbers. I do have one farmer who has been telling me that a lot of corn got planted early in the month, but even so, these numbers are hard to believe,” Scoville says.

Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that the USDA corn acreage estimate is telling.

“Farmers were clearly incentivized to plant corn in order to capture government benefits contingent on getting something into the ground this season. Look for the July WASDE to reflect a slightly improved corn balance sheet and to tighten the soybean balance sheet perhaps more than was anticipated prior to today’s acreage report,” Gilbertie says.

Gilbert adds, “Wheat disappearance reflects the healthy rate of wheat exports we’ve seen so far this year.”

Britt O’Connell, cash adviser for Commodity Risk Management Group, says that not a lot of people will believe today’s USDA corn acreage estimate.

“I don’t think anyone saw this coming. I doubt there is much belief in the published numbers. Trade is telling us that as well. Touched limit down and now trading down 17 to 18,” O’Connell says. “What a wild ride. At one point, we were up 14¢ to 15¢.”

The confusion is occurring because USDA starts March with planting intentions of 92.4 million acres. After a wet spring with delayed planting, the USDA takes 3.0 million corn acres out of production in its May WASDE, O’Connell says.

“That’s not a typical move, but nonetheless something that was very easy to rationalize and warrant. Today, USDA places planted acres at 91.7 million acres. Effectively saying that we planted all of the acres that we originally had planned,” O’Connell says.

A further dive into the numbers on a state-by-state look, points to states that have struggled tremendously – Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, to be planting either the same amount of acres of more than last year, O’Connell says.

“It simply doesn’t add up. This should be viewed as a buying opportunity on corn. Bean number could hold some water, with burdensome stocks continuing to loom over that market. Even with this bullish news in beans, they can only muster up a 10¢ rally.

Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says that today’s USDA Report continues to give shock waves in the grains.

“Last month the large drop in yield for corn, due to poor planting conditions, was considered friendly. The shock today, with an anticipated 4- to 5-million-acre drop in corn, was that USDA reduced corn acreage by only 1.1 million. But the soybean acre number was lowered by 4.6 million acres, with these numbers being shifted by the USDA. The large stocks on beans could be jeopardized. Weather will be watched closer now than most markets we have seen in modern times.”"
Reporters erupt after DHS chief McAleenan walks out of presser after four questions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/reporters-erupt-after-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-walks-out-of-presser-after-four-questions,"Reporters erupted in frustration with Kevin McAleenan after the acting homeland security secretary abruptly departed a rescheduled press conference after taking only four questions amid crossfire over questions about his leadership.

After reading Friday from a prepared statement for 11 minutes, McAleenan opened the floor to questions. He took four of them over seven minutes then cut off the briefing and said ""thanks"" before exiting.

""This is ridiculous! We get no..."" one reporter in the front row yelled as McAleenan walked out.

""Seriously, Andrew, it's so unprofessional,"" another reporter said, directing her comment to the only DHS official still onstage, acting Public Affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan.

""Four questions and we haven't had a press conference in months,"" one person said, referring to McAleenan's installation in his current role nearly three months earlier.

""We'll be more engaging in the future,"" Meehan responded.

""Why don't we keep rolling and you keep answering our questions?"" one of the reporters asked.

Reporters immediately began asking a handful of additional questions before Meehan excused himself after four minutes of it.

McAleenan was accused by five current and former senior administration officials, in comments published by the Washington Examiner over the weekend, of attempting to sabotage a federal immigration operation by leaking details to a media outlet.

Since then, top officials at DHS and across the administration have used various press outlets, including the Washington Examiner, to try to undermine McAleenan by calling for him to resign and charging he is a liar for an alleged cover-up of what they claim was his own leak.

The Friday afternoon press conference was announced in an email from DHS around 9:30 a.m. The Washington Examiner, which received an invitation to attend the same event a day earlier, did not receive an invitation Friday.

On Thursday, the Washington Examiner reported that McAleenan was expected to lay the blame on Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Mark Morgan for the revelation in a Washington Post story of details about immigration raids. The report was published a half-hour before the Thursday briefing was scheduled to take place. Moments before it began, DHS abruptly called off the briefing.

A DHS spokesman claimed it was because the department did not want McAleenan's comments to interfere with Capitol Hill negotiations for supplemental border funding, even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had publicly announced nearly an hour before the briefing the chamber would pass the Senate's supplemental bill, according to reporters.

Trump’s Latest Acting Pentagon Chief Faces Immediate Stress Test,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas Gibbons-Neff'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/world/europe/esper-pentagon-nato.html,"BRUSSELS — It has been a taxing week for Mark T. Esper, the acting defense secretary, who did not have that title just a few days ago.

Last Thursday, Mr. Esper, 55, was still Army secretary, sitting in the White House as officials weighed launching airstrikes against Iran. Four days later he assumed the role of Pentagon chief to fill a sudden leadership void from the departure of Patrick M. Shanahan after just four months.

And on Wednesday Mr. Esper took the stage at NATO headquarters in Brussels, wedged between what could be a looming conflict in the Middle East and convincing America’s top allies that he was the right person for the job.

Mr. Esper’s opening statement during a news briefing Thursday tried to do just that, ensuring that nothing has changed at the Pentagon — despite his seemingly overnight ascension. He implored allies to take a harder stance on Iran after a spate of incidents in the Strait of Hormuz, including the downing of an American drone by Iranian forces."
Whistleblower exposes $7 billion no-bid Defense Department contract,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/halliburton-whistleblower-on-exposing-7-billion-no-bid-defense-contract-2019-06-28/,"At the height of the Iraq war, a top official at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers risked her career by standing up to some of the most powerful men in America. She believed one well-connected company was benefitting from a series of sweetheart contracts that were costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse.

Although she was warned against it by supervisors, she blew the whistle on national TV in front of a Senate committee. ""My name is Bunnatine H. Greenhouse. I have agreed to voluntarily appear at this hearing,"" she addressed the committee.

Bunny Greenhouse was an unlikely whistleblower. In 2005, Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

""When I took my oath of office it said that you will conduct the business of contracting impartially … and with preferential treatment toward none. I saw preferential treatment toward KBR,"" she told ""Whistleblower"" host Alex Ferrer in ""Bunny's War: The Case Against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.""

KBR was Kellogg Brown and Root — back then, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the oil services firm Halliburton. In the weeks prior to the invasion, Greenhouse learned that KBR was being considered for a massive no-bid contract known as Restore Iraqi Oil, or RIO.

""What was the size of this contract?"" Ferrer asked.

""Seven billion dollars,"" she replied.

What Greenhouse didn't know is that even more powerful forces may have been involved.

""A lot of attention fell on Dick Cheney, the vice president, and the fact was that he had been the head of Halliburton for … six years,"" Vanity Fair journalist Michael Shnayerson explained. ""So, the suspicion began to grow that perhaps Cheney was steering government contracts to KBR.""

A spokesperson for Dick Cheney told CBS News that the former vice president severed all ties with Halliburton and KBR in the summer of 2000 when he became candidate for vice president.

A representative for KBR said ""it's unfortunate that misinformation and myths about KBR's role in supporting the military in Iraq continue to be circulated. These assertions have repeatedly been shown to be false.""

For Greenhouse, biting her tongue was never an option. ""I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career,"" she told the Senate committee.

A 2004 government report decided the RIO contract was properly awarded. But the Army eventually split up the contract and, as Greenhouse had requested from the beginning, opened it up to competition.

""Eventually, your enemies at the Army Corps of Engineers caught up with you,"" Ferrer commented.

""I felt that I was physically being threatened,"" Greenhouse replied. ""They set up a booby trap that caused me to fall,"" she added.

Born and raised in Rayville, Louisiana, Greenhouse and her six siblings grew up poor in the segregated south. Her parents instilled in her and her siblings a strong sense of morals, integrity and honor; no excuse for being less than the best. In the 1960s, she became the first African American teacher at the newly integrated Unity H.S.

In 1997, she accepted a job with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She was hired by Lt. General Joe Ballard and was the first African American woman to become the head of contracting within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Greenhouse started to notice a ""good ole boys club"" forming again at USACE after her boss and mentor, Lt. General Ballard, retired in 2000. Then, in the weeks leading up to the Iraq War in 2003, she attended a top-secret meeting at the Pentagon to discuss details of the Restore Iraqi Oil contract. Present in the room were representatives of Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, Cheney's former employer.

Greenhouse was concerned about awarding KBR with the no-bid, 5-year contract and urged to accept other bids and limit the duration of the deal. But her objections were never addressed, and KBR received the contract. Later, it was revealed in a draft audit that the company had overcharged the government for fuel purchases by $61 million. She ultimately testified in front of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee.

Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the Army Corp and she was incredibly good at her job. Because the top brass at USACE couldn't actually fire her, which was a perk of having a high station in the government, they demoted her. When this happened, she was stripped of her security clearance and sent off to a remote cubicle somewhere; she was basically condemned to oblivion. After she filed her whistleblower lawsuit, someone placed a trip wire placed around her cubicle and she fell, permanently damaging her knee.

The Defense Authorization Act Of 2009 reformed some of the very contracting practices that Greenhouse had objected to five years earlier and it limited the duration of certain no-bid contracts.

Greenhouse filed a mixed case lawsuit against the Department of Defense and the Army Corps of Engineers. The whistleblower case claimed that Greenhouse had been retaliated against for speaking out and had faced discrimination based on race, age, and gender. In July 2011, she agreed to a settlement of $970,000.

""I would not, have not, ever leaked details of a sensitive law enforcement operation,"" acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said during an appearance on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle.""

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

""My primary responsibility is the safety of the men and women who go out there every day to protect the American people. And so it's just not true."" — Kevin McAleenan, acting DHS secretary

McAleenan was accused last week of leaking plans for raids scheduled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a unit of the DHS, after supposedly expressing fierce opposition to the plan and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

The source also said Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

McAleenan also denied that anyone in his office leaked the information after host Laura Ingraham pressed further, saying that as the operation date nears ""you have to push information out into the field.""

""So tonight you're saying these rumors are wrong false and you did not do that?"" Ingraham asked.

""Absolutely not,"" McAleenan responded.

The acting secretary also commented on the Democratic presidential candidates advocating for decriminalizing illegal border crossings, saying it would ""further undermine our efforts at the border"" and increase the numbers of those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""Decriminalizing crossing between ports of entry when we know it's associated with criminal smugglers ... when they know they bring drugs behind those people that are crossing, it would just add to the problem,"" McAleenan said.

Roger Stone’s lawyers punch back at DOJ over charges of violating gag order,https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/roger-stone-lawyer-gag-order-1386122,"Former Trump adviser Roger Stone's lawyers argued he was within his First Amendment rights with his social media activity. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images legal Roger Stone’s lawyers punch back at DOJ over charges of violating gag order

Roger Stone’s lawyers swung back Thursday at federal prosecutors accusing the longtime Donald Trump adviser of violating a court-imposed gag order that could send him to jail.

In an 11-page reply, Stone’s attorneys argued their client was well within his First Amendment rights when he recently posted several times on social media his criticism of the press coverage surrounding his case.

Story Continued Below

A federal judge in Washington D.C. ordered Stone in February to cease commenting about the charges he’s fighting — which center around allegedly making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering — so as to not destroy the possibility of a fair trial in his case later this fall.

But the U.S. attorney’s office that took over the prosecution originally brought by former special counsel Robert Mueller last week flagged several Stone Instagram posts, including some questioning why the press wasn’t paying more attention to his lawyers' recent legal filings.

Responding on Thursday, Stone’s lawyers argue that he has indeed respected the court’s order and that the posts in dispute “are not ‘statements’, nor do they pose a danger to the fair trial concern which was (and is) the constitutional raison d’etre of the Order.”

Stone’s lawyers questioned the government’s focus on three specific social media posts, which they say “exhibits a willful blindness to the tens of thousands of hostile-to-Stone articles which have been authored by others about the ‘investigation’ and Stone’s ‘case;’ articles, animated cartoons, comments, editorials, television and radio programs, panels, celebrity ‘dark comedy’ readings of the Special Counsel Report, and even a comedic portrayal of Roger Stone by Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live which satirically portrayed Stone as a caricature of himself.” The SNL skit has tallied more than 4.4 million views on YouTube, the attorneys noted.

“The ‘prejudice’ to be concerned about is prejudice against Stone; his lonely voice presents no threat to a fair trial under this Court’s supervision. Of more concern should be the Washington Post’s unrelenting coverage of Roger Stone,” his lawyers argued.

The Stone lawyers’ combative response to the alleged gag order violations marks a far different tone than the one the defense took the last time Stone found himself in trouble on the same issue. In February, Judge Amy Berman Jackson restricted Stone’s public speech after he posted a photo of her on social media with what looked like gun-sight crosshairs.

During a hearing on the matter where he also faced the prospect of jail time, Stone apologized for the post. ""I let you down,” he told Jackson. “I let myself down. I let my family down. I let my attorneys down. I can only say I'm sorry. It was a momentary lapse in judgment. Perhaps I talk too much.""

Jackson ended that hearing by expanding the gag order on Stone — originally, he was allowed to discuss his case, so long as it wasn’t in the immediate vicinity of the Washington D.C. courthouse where he’ll go on trial Nov. 5 — to cover all speech about the case. The judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, also gave him an ultimatum. ""No, Mr. Stone, I'm not giving you another chance,"" she said. ""I have serious doubts about whether you've learned any lesson at all. It is my job to make sure this trial does not devolve into a circus.""

The latest posts to potentially land Stone in trouble center around messages asking why several major news organizations didn't cover a recent filing his lawyers made arguing that the government did not independently verify that Russian operatives hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Stone posted several more articles touting his attorneys' work, tagging one, ""Funny, No @nytimes or @washingtonpost coverage of this development.""

Prosecutors have since filed a separate document refuting Stone's claims that the government didn't independently confirm that Russia was behind the DNC hack.

The government has also flagged a Stone comment, written on Instagram, about a May report in POLITICO describing Jackson's order to see an unredacted version of any still-secret portions of the Mueller report related to his case.

""The Judge has ruled but @Politico gets most of the story wrong because they are biased elitist snot-nosed fake news shitheads who's [sic] specialty is distortion by omitting key facts to create a false narrative. #rogerstonedidnothingwrong #rogerstone #fakenews,"" Stone's post said.

The Stone reply on Thursday argued that the at-issue posts only included headlines from other media backing up his arguments, but he never posted a link to the actual story. They explained that a Stone post from April that the government flagged to Jackson — drawing attention to a CNN story about the FBI refusing a public records request for emails to CNN — only raises a “rhetorical question.” And his post about the POLITICO story is simply criticism of that media outlet.

“The government’s offer of this posting reveals the government’s desire to tarnish Stone, not to try him here on the facts,” his attorneys wrote. “Stone’s language may be indecorous at times, but that does not obscure the content’s non-culpability under the Order. Criticism of the media is not a violation of the Order.”

More broadly, Stone’s attorneys argue that their client “is the most minor of participants” who generates far less media attention to his case compared with Mueller himself, Attorney General William Barr or many others pulled into the wider Russia probe.

“The 2,402 ‘likes’ of the June 18- 19 Stone postings are but a speck compared to the torrent of publicity, commentary and commotion generated by persons, publications and politicians over which, and over whom, Stone has no control,” his attorneys wrote. “Even witnesses who will be called to testify in this case are contributing to the cacophony.”

Here, the Stone attorneys cited Randy Credico, a New York-based political satirist and radio host whose contacts with WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange make him a central figure in the Stone case. Credico, named in the Stone indictment as one of the witnesses he attempted to intimidate, has said he’s received a subpoena to appear at the upcoming Stone trial.

Despite the defense’s unapologetic tone and the insistence that none of the Instagram posts ran afoul of Jackson’s gag order, the new filing indicates Stone has deleted the post attacking POLITICO as well as two of the other seven posts to which the government recently objected. No explanation was given for the deletions.

Jackson has yet to signal what her next steps will be — including possibly holding a public hearing — on the Stone gag order issue. In an order last Friday, she gave Stone’s attorneys until Thursday to file any response in writing “why the Court should not find that the defendant has violated the Court's order dated February 21, 2019 and his conditions of release.”

USDA reports large U.S. soybean sale to China ahead of Trump-Xi meeting,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karl Plume', 'Min Read']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-soybeans/usda-reports-large-us-soybean-sale-to-china-ahead-of-trump-xi-meeting-idUSKCN1TT2ET,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Friday reported a large soybean sale to China, an apparent goodwill gesture a day before the first meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in seven months.

The trade war has curbed exports of U.S. crops to China and looms over the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Japan. Expectations have dimmed that the world’s two biggest economies can ease tensions when Trump and Xi meet in Osaka on Saturday.

The USDA said Chinese importers bought 544,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans for shipment in the 2018/19 marketing year which expires Aug. 31. It was the largest U.S. soybean sale to China since late March, USDA data showed.

The USDA said in a statement the sale was new and not a change of destination of a previously announced sale.

The deal surprised some traders as soybean export premiums for late-summer shipments were unchanged this week, showing little evidence that a large purchase was occurring, and because recent large purchases have come only after talks between the two countries.

A sharp drop in China’s hog herd, which consumes most of the soybeans processed by the world’s largest pork market, due to a deadly hog disease called African swine fever has also reduced demand for the oilseed.

“To me it looks like a good faith purchase, which we’ve seen before, although in the past they came after the two presidents shook hands. Today it’s coming before they do so it may be trying to influence talks,” said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for INTL FCStone.

“All this comes against a backdrop of China having ample supplies of soybeans and talk of them delaying shipment of July beans into August because of the big supplies,” he said.

Beijing had agreed to buy nearly 14 million tonnes from American farmers over December to March during a temporary truce in the trade spat.

More than 8 million tonnes of those have already been shipped to China, but about 6 million tonnes, including Friday’s sale, still need to be delivered.

Trump said on Friday he hopes for productive talks but made no promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs that have cast a shadow on global growth.

U.S. soybean exports to China have plunged by more than 80 percent since Beijing slapped steep tariffs on shipments last July. China, the world’s top soybean importer, is on pace for its smallest U.S. soybean imports in 11 years as importers there have increased purchases from South America, mainly from top exporter Brazil."
"Trump playfully tells Putin, ""don't meddle in the election""",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-putin-meet-g20-summit-japan-today-2019-06-28/,"President Trump had a closed-door meeting on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan. Before the two leaders met privately with their senior aides, they sat together in front of journalists for a photo opportunity. One of the reporters asked Mr. Trump if he would press the Russian leader to ensure his country does not interfere again in the U.S. democratic process.

""Of course I will,"" said Mr. Trump with a smirk, before pointing in Putin's direction and saying, ""don't interfere in the election."" It was unclear whether Mr. Trump followed his sardonic response in front of the cameras with a more serious warning to the Russian leader behind closed doors. The White House did not respond to an inquiry about whether the president's warning was sincere.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian government carried out an orchestrated campaign aimed at influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Mr. Trump acknowledged that interference, but rejected the intel communities' findings that the Russians ""developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,"" and tried to help him.

In a May tweet, the president appeared to acknowledge ""Russia helping me get elected,"" before walking back the statement later in the day.

Trump gives apparent invitation to interfere in 2020 election

Before the question on election meddling, the president lauded his ""very, very good"" relationship with Putin and said a lot of ""positive things"" were going to come from it.

Shortly before the leaders spoke to reports – and before the U.S. pool was brought in – Mr. Trump referred to the press contingent as ""fake news,"" and congratulated himself for promoting the term.

""I think there might be some media out there. What do you think?"" Mr. Trump was seen saying to state TV reporters before the U.S. reporters were admitted.

""Fake news,"" Mr. Trump said as the pool entered. ""Great term, isn't it? You don't have that. We have it. You don't have it,"" he said.

""Yes, we have it too,"" Putin appeared to reply in English. ""Same.""

Putin later referred to the meeting as a ""great opportunity to follow up on Helsinki"" -- the July 2018 Trump-Putin summit during which the U.S. president appeared to accept Putin's insistence that Russia had not interfered in U.S. politics. The Friday meeting was the first formal one between Mr. Trump and Putin since Helsinki.

Other issues to discuss

The meeting lasted about an hour, and came amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which has been backed by Moscow in the standoff.

In the room with the two presidents were various Russian and U.S. officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Advisor John Bolton, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump threatened the ""obliteration"" of parts of Iran if it attacks anything belonging to the U.S. Mr. Trump authorized new sanctions against Iran's supreme leader and a cyberattack on Iran after Iran shot down a U.S. drone last week.

""Iran's very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality,"" Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. ""Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.""

A senior administration official told CBS News negotiating a new arms control agreement with Russia could be a topic of discussion. Mr. Trump told reporters Wednesday that what he talks about with Putin is ""none of your business.""

The official described plans to update and expand limits on nuclear weapons as a ""high priority,"" but that when it comes to Mr. Trump, it is impossible to ""pretend to know what is in his mind.""

Senior administration officials also said Mr. Trump hoped to discuss including China as a party to any new agreement. Beijing has expressed zero interest in such a deal, but these aides told CBS News the president might still raise the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Mr. Trump has been criticized for his relationship with Putin, which Democrats have characterized as too friendly. The president made headlines when he told ABC News he would probably take a look at information from foreign governments that could hurt his opponents as he seeks re-election.

Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded in his report that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Mr. Trump's campaign, although he could not establish that campaign officials conspired with Moscow to influence the election. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed doubt about whether Russia interfered in the election and insisted there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia.

In February, Mr. Trump argued that he has been ""tougher on Russia than any president"" in an interview with ""Face the Nation.""

Mr. Trump said he will meet with Xi Saturday, among other world leaders. A trade deal with China has yet to come to fruition, and Mr. Trump tweeted that he would discuss sanctions with Indian President Narendra Modi, as well.

"Senate vote requires military, EPA to deal with harmful 'forever chemicals'",https://thehill.com,[],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450706-senate-vote-requires-military-epa-to-deal-with-harmful-forever,"The Senate passed a defense bill Thursday that would require an increased response from the government to harmful chemicals that have leached into water in at least 43 states.

Included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is language that would push the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a national drinking water standard for a class of chemicals known as PFAS that have been linked with cancer and other health problems.

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether to regulate the chemicals that are so persistent in the environment they’ve been deemed “forever chemicals.”

PFAS is used in a staggering number of products, including firefighting foam, which the bill directs the military to stop using.

A move by Congress to force a drinking water standard would be significant and ultimately require local governments to keep PFAS in water below a certain level. Currently, the EPA recommends water contain no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS, but many states, tired of waiting for the EPA, have set more stringent standards far below that figure.

The bill also directs the Department of Defense to take more aggressive action on PFAS following accusation that the Pentagon was trying to weaken EPA regulations that would force the military to take on expensive cleanup costs now estimated at around $2 billion.

The bill pushes the Pentagon to finalize agreements with states for cleaning up PFAS contamination caused by the military largely through the use of firefighting foam. The military would have three years to phase out use of the foam.

Other provisions would also force the EPA to consider barring new uses of PFAS and require PFAS manufacturers to share data on their production.

But the Senate version does not make Superfund cleanup money available for places where PFAS has contaminated drinking water, something Sen.

“The provisions we secured in this legislation will improve both the federal government’s understanding of and response to PFAS contamination. The Department of Defense’s use of firefighting foam containing PFAS is a significant source of this contamination,"" he said. ""The use of these chemicals in firefighting foam has undoubtedly saved lives, but the cruel irony is that those same life-saving chemicals can endanger lives when they wind up in a glass of drinking water.""

He added, ""While the provisions we included in this package are an important start, I am disappointed that we were unable to successfully include the legislation I introduced with Senator Capito that would designate PFAS as hazardous substances under the Superfund law, and I will continue to fight to ensure that important measure is enacted into law.”

Environmental groups hailed the bill as an important first step in dealing with the growing PFAS problem.

“The first step to addressing this catastrophe is knowing where PFAS pollution is coming from and understanding how far it has spread. This legislation will go a long way in doing just that. Much more needs to be done to address the crisis, but monitoring the scope of PFAS pollution will lay the groundwork for further progress,” Scott Faber, with the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement.

The Senate version also includes a number of other environmental measures, including funding for research into carbon capture."
The Census Case Shows Why We Need a Defender General,https://slate.com,['Matthew R. Segal'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/doj-noel-francisco-lies-census-case-supreme-court-defender-general.html,"Noel Francisco attends his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in D.C. on May 10, 2017. Mark Wilson/Getty Images

It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Department of Justice lawyers representing the Trump administration. Last week, career DOJ attorney Sarah Fabian came under intense criticism for an argument in which she equivocated when federal appellate judges asked her whether it would be “safe and sanitary” for the government to deny detained migrant children access to toothbrushes, soap, and blankets. And on Thursday, citing evidence that the Trump administration “contrived” its explanations to courts, the Supreme Court largely upheld a district court’s decision to block a citizenship question on the 2020 census. This opinion is a powerful, though tacit, rebuke of the DOJ attorneys who failed to acknowledge that their clients’ proffered rationale for adding the citizenship question—enforcing the Voting Rights Act—was pretextual. Essentially, the government lied about why it was taking a certain action in the census case, and the government’s attorneys failed to acknowledge those lies to the Supreme Court. This is not what our country’s top government lawyers should be doing.

I’ve litigated against Fabian and respect her public service, so I share the dismay that so many have expressed about her “safe and sanitary” argument. But the crucial lesson of the DOJ’s recent actions isn’t that we should be disappointed in a particular DOJ lawyer, or even Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued the government’s position in the census case. It’s that DOJ lawyers aren’t going to save us. As the census case shows, there are serious and ongoing institutional problems with the DOJ’s defense of Trump administration policies. These problems demand an institutional solution—one that will empower government lawyers to stand up for what’s right.

Part of the solution should be to create a new legal office—a defender general—to represent the interests of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, and to push back against faulty legal arguments by government attorneys that advance the president’s political interests.

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Let’s start with the DOJ. It has spent two-plus years utterly failing to serve as a bulwark against the Trump administration’s wanton cruelty. Sadly, we now know that, no matter what cruel policies Trump undertakes, skilled lawyers will not only take prestigious political jobs like solicitor general and attorney general, but use those jobs to paper over the Trump administration’s discriminatory intent.

For example, although in theory the solicitor general’s office has a practice of “confessing error” when it believes the government should lose a case, Francisco has not seen fit to concede the illegality of any Trump administration policy. Not the Muslim ban. Not the ban on transgender service personnel. Not family separation (where an appeal has been held in abeyance following a district court ruling against the practice). And not the citizenship question, even when confronted with what the Supreme Court just called “an explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking process.”

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Career DOJ lawyers like Fabian can’t be expected to fix what those in leadership are breaking. These lawyers are in a difficult situation because their political clients and bosses often direct the positions they take in court. If they stay in their jobs, their legal skills might be exploited to defend a cruel practice or launder Trump’s discriminatory intent. If they quit in protest, they will inevitably be replaced by lawyers who are less troubled by Trump’s actions.

Indeed, as a civil rights lawyer representing immigrants against the Trump administration, I’ve been frustrated by the tactics and arguments that some career DOJ lawyers have deployed to keep my clients from the justice they deserve. But I don’t think the career DOJ lawyers are calling the shots.

To protect the rule of law, and to save the legal profession from being debased by the next Trump, we need to look beyond individual attorneys and toward the health of our institutions.

Here’s where the Office of the Defender General would come in. The concept of a defender general has been floated in legal circles as a means of improving representation for indigent criminal defendants. Consistent with these aims, Valparaiso University Law School professor Andrea Lyon has proposed that a defender general could serve as a “voice at the policy table for the accused, incarcerated and paroled.” And Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would create a “Defender Office for Supreme Court Advocacy” to help criminal defendants in the U.S. Supreme Court and state courts of last resort.

The events of the Trump era point to another reason to create a defender general’s office: the need to counteract the DOJ during times of moral rot.

A defender general’s office could serve precisely this function if it were afforded some independence—Booker’s bill would make it a nonprofit corporation—and if its mission were understood to go beyond criminal defense. We need a government-sponsored institution whose lawyers will stand up in court, and stand athwart DOJ lawyers, to articulate our country’s interests in the liberty of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, from prisons and jails to immigration detention.

Properly empowered, a defender general could pressure the DOJ to make more responsible legal arguments, and then publicly and loudly call out the DOJ—within government and in court—when it falls short. Would DOJ leaders have sent a career lawyer to quibble with federal judges about soap and blankets for detained kids if they had understood that a prestigious government-funded law office was prepared to tell the court that the DOJ’s position was meritless?

Another virtue of creating a defender general office is that it would generate alumni who could speak out in public when the government oversteps. A weird feature of the Trump era has been that so many “resistance” heroes are former prosecutors. This is partly because media outlets favor people who have been powerful lawyers, and there are almost no powerful government law jobs devoted to criminal defense or civil rights. As a result, the voices of lawyers who have devoted their careers to freeing people, instead of advancing reasons to keep them locked up, tend to be disproportionately drowned out, not only in government but in the public square.

None of this means that a quasi-governmental defender general could easily halt the Department of Justice’s dismaying slide toward defending the indefensible. But it’s clear that the remedy for what ails the DOJ must include institutional reform of some kind. And if the defender general can’t protect the rule of law, then maybe, by publicly confronting the failure of DOJ lawyering, she can avenge it.

New leaders installed at top immigration agencies amid questions over DHS secretary’s future,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-leaders-installed-at-top-immigration-agencies-amid-questions-over-dhs-secretarys-future,"The Trump administration named new leaders Thursday to top immigration agencies amid a deepening crisis at the border -- and swirling speculation over the future of the Homeland Security secretary who oversees it all after he was accused of leaking a highly sensitive operation.

Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday announced that Mark Morgan, who was serving as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be shifted over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to replace former Commissioner John Sanders, who abruptly resigned from his post this week. ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence was tapped to replace Morgan at that agency.

But bigger questions now surround McAleenan himself.

Two senior administration officials told Fox News that high-level discussions were underway with top administration and White House officials regarding McAleenan’s future in light of the accusations against him -- which the secretary strongly denies. The officials said there is uncertainty as to how much longer the secretary could remain in his post.

A White House official declined to comment on these claims when asked by Fox News.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

McAleenan had come under fire after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

One senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday that after the alleged leak, ""He’s lost the confidence and trust of both the workforce and his superiors, with no viable path to proceed with any confidence and credibility.""

The official lamented the state of morale at the department, saying: “DHS has devolved into chaos and employee morale is abysmal.”

Another senior administration official also told Fox News Thursday that McAleenan has “completely lost his credibility leading the Department.”

“I can’t imagine the White House has an interest in keeping him in place much longer when they know he opposes most of their immigration policies,” the official said.

McAleenan, though, has adamantly denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

Meanwhile, one of the officials told Fox News that McAleenan spent several days in Guatemala this week for multilateral meetings with Central American allies, while other top administration officials negotiated on Capitol Hill for additional funding for the agencies as part of a major piece of legislation -- which has not yet cleared Congress.

The official told Fox News that “support for a spending package vital to the department coalesced, was debated, and voted on in his absence.” That official also said that McAleenan has been “cut out of the process.”

Another administration official noted that McAleenan was slated to host a press conference on Thursday afternoon on the supplemental spending bill. “It’s interesting that he is standing alone. This is him trying to save his job, and taking a victory lap on the supplemental bill when he has been absent for the last few days.”

The event, though, was later canceled."

3. Heat Warnings Issued in Parts of Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Nebraska

From excessive rainfall to weather that’s too hot, parts of the Midwest can’t seem to catch any normal weather this year.

A heat advisory has been issued for much of northeastern Kansas and northwestern Missouri, as temperatures are expected to climb into the mid-90s, which will push heat index values as high as 105˚F., according to the National Weather Service.

The area has seen major flooding for the past several weeks after excessive rainfall pushed the Missouri River and its tributaries over their banks. Flood warnings are still in effect for the region.

It’s not just the heat; another round of thunderstorms is possible in northern Missouri tonight. Small hail and gusty winds are expected.

A heat advisory also has been issued for parts of southeastern South Dakota, northeastern Nebraska, and a few counties in western Iowa.

Heat index values are expected to reach 103˚F. this afternoon, the NWS said in a report early this morning."

Bill Wehrum is leaving his post as the Environmental Protection Agency's top air policy official. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Bill Wehrum spent only a year and a half as the Environmental Protection Agency’s top air official before announcing plans to resign Wednesday amid scrutiny over possible violations of federal ethics rules.

But during that time, Wehrum served as one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the ambition and reach of the EPA, and to retreat from President Obama’s push to slash emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. He oversaw efforts to ease regulation of the coal industry, slow requirements that cars and trucks become more fuel efficient and overhaul how the agency calculates costs and benefits to favor industry.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s announcement Wednesday did not cite a specific reason for the departure of Wehrum, who as an attorney represented power companies seeking to scale back air pollution rules. But Wehrum has privately expressed concern about how an ongoing House Energy and Commerce Committee probe was affecting his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, according to individuals familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

“While I have known of Bill’s desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,” Wheeler said Wednesday, praising Wehrum for “his service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship.”

Environmental groups, Democrats on Capitol Hill and other critics were quick to celebrate Wehrum’s departure, calling him an integral part of the “swamp” that President Trump had vowed to drain in Washington.

“William Wehrum was emblematic of the administration’s struggles to remain ethical,"" Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in a statement. ""While it’s a good thing that Wehrum’s potential ethics problems will no longer affect the agency, the tone is set at the top, and if the EPA is to clean up the mess started by Scott Pruitt, the Trump administration needs to get serious about policing its ethical failures.”

Wehrum, who was confirmed in November 2017, is the latest Trump appointee to depart after coming under investigation for possible misconduct. Four Cabinet members — EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin — have all left under an ethics cloud, along with other senior staffers such as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator William “Brock” Long.

Interior’s Office of Inspector General is currently investigating seven current or former top appointees for improperly engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business, including Secretary David Bernhardt. Bernhardt has denied any wrongdoing, and the other officials have not commented publicly on the allegations.

The Energy and Commerce Committee launched its inquiry of Wehrum after The Washington Post reported in February that questions had been raised about his compliance with the Trump ethics pledge, which requires political appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years. If an appointee does meet with a former client, the pledge dictates that the gathering should be open to all interested parties — a requirement that has been interpreted to mean four other participants who were not clients.

Less than one month after joining the EPA, Wehrum met with two former clients at his old firm without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. That same month, Wehrum weighed in on a decision that appeared to benefit a former client, DTE Energy.

Wehrum, who heads the air and radiation office at the EPA, acknowledged both incidents in an interview with The Post but said he had determined that he did not violate federal ethics rules.

“I have, from day one, tried to be absolutely strict and assiduous as to what I do about complying with my ethical obligations,” Wehrum said, “because it doesn’t do me any good, and it doesn’t do the agency any good, to be doing things that people see as unethical.”

Still, the fallout from the disclosure about Wehrum’s ties to his former firm and the utility industry by The Post and other outlets — including Politico, the New York Times and E&E News — has continued to reverberate. The Utility Air Regulatory Group, a collection of power companies that paid Hunton Andrews Kurth millions in membership dues, disbanded earlier this year.

Wehrum has said he represented the group as its own entity, rather than the individual utilities that made up its membership. But investigators on Capitol Hill have explored whether he and his former firm represented the power companies as well, according to one person familiar with the inquiry, raising the prospect that Werhum’s meetings could have violated ethics rules on multiple counts. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because it is ongoing.

Both Wehrum’s supporters and his critics say that he has accomplished some of industry’s long-sought goals. In doing so, he has rolled back some of President Barack Obama’s most sweeping air policies. Last week the EPA finalized a rule targeting power plants that cuts carbon emissions by less than half of what experts say is needed to avoid catastrophic global warming. He has advanced other controversial proposals as well, including one that would slow efforts to improve gas mileage for cars and light trucks. Another would limit how the EPA calculates public health benefits in proposed regulations, which could make it tougher to limit pollution sources.

“No assistant administrator at EPA had more on their plate than Bill,"" Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. ""He executed the job with a steady hand and got big things done.”

But what some industry officials saw as Wehrum’s reasonable measures to reduce the regulatory burden on companies, critics describe as undermining the agency’s mission to protect public health and the environment.

“It is, at the very least, going to take years to undo the damage that has been done,” said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for the Sierra Club.

In a phone interview, Coequyt said that as Wehrum returns to the private sector, corporate clients could face blowback for enlisting Wehrum’s help. “We believe he’s toxic to their interests, and anyone who hires him will be publicly criticized for doing so.""

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who joined other Democrats in February in asking EPA’s inspector general to investigate Wehrum, predicted that he would end up representing one of the companies that has sought regulatory relief from Trump’s EPA.

“I can’t wait to see where Bill Wehrum lands once he’s out the door,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “What do you bet it’s with one of the fossil fuel interests he has served so well as air chief, delivering one big handout after another?”"

Rob Wallace is the first assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks since 2011, a position that oversees both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service.

Wallace stood out in his confirmation process after a long line of controversial picks to a department that has faced numerous ethics controversies since President Trump Donald John TrumpSenate rejects attempt to curb Trump's Iran war powers Sarah Sanders: I will walk out of the White House 'with my head held high' Atlanta mayor endorses Biden for president MORE took office.

He has worked to conserve wildlife and protect our national parks in both Wyoming and Washington.”

Wallace currently works as president of the Upper Green River Conservancy and as a partner at the investment firm i2Capital.

Some environmental groups raised questions about Wallace’s nearly two decades as a lobbyist for General Electric Energy and income from stock in the oil industry, but many conservation groups offered letters in support of his nomination.

The Senate also confirmed Aimee Jorjani to a post on the the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Like Wallace, Jorjani received words of praise from Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee

Her husband, Daniel Jorjani, has also been nominated to a position at Interior reviewed by that committee, but he does not enjoy bipartisan support.

Daniel Jorjani, currently the top lawyer for Interior, has been nominated to fill the vacant role as solicitor for the department.

But he has been criticized by Democrats for his role in Interior’s controversial public records review process and responses to questions about it they said lacked candor.

One day before Minu Aghevli testified at a House committee hearing about official Department of Veterans Affairs misconduct, she received a thick packet of documents that shook her life.

It amounted to a pink slip more than 170 pages long, including about 140 pages outlining reasons VA plans to fire her, according to Kevin Owen, her lawyer. The packet arrived on Monday. She testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli, 42, is a District native who has spent her entire 20-year career with VA. She is a clinical psychologist with a department opioid treatment program in Baltimore.

But the moniker that matters now for her is VA whistleblower. Aghevli has made disclosures that she said led department officials to dismiss her, despite her Gold VA Pins for excellent customer service.

Aghevli’s allegations are serious. They include phony-wait-list assertions of the type that have bedeviled VA since it was consumed by a scandal that broke in 2014. She also accused department officials of lying to Congress.

“In order to reduce the wait list, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic wait list by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,” she told the House Veterans’ Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations. “This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits. . . . The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.” Aghevli said she protested and did not do as instructed.

Other actions to seemingly reduce the number of veterans awaiting care, she said, included coding indigent patients as “care no longer needed” without confirming that.

When lawmakers demanded information about VA wait lists in September 2015, she said, “the VA deliberately sent these incorrect numbers to Congress.”

A VA statement said Aghevli’s proposed firing “is in no way related to any whistleblower activity. Rather, it is due to a number of serious clinical practice allegations against the employee.”

The Office of Special Counsel has moved to block Aghevli’ s firing while it reviews her case. This special counsel protects federal whistleblowers and is not related a better-known special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who led a probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.

Aghevli is not alone in making recent allegations about VA misconduct. At the House Veterans’ Affairs oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing, Chairman Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) said the panel is investigating secret-wait-list charges made in a Federal Insider column last month by Jereme Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management.

Only whistleblowers and their advocates testified at the hearing. Pappas said VA officials would be invited to a later session.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie in a letter to the panel expressed disappointment that officials were not included this week. “When the committee holds a hearing to air criticisms of the Department, while simultaneously preventing the Department from participating to offer context and defend itself,” he wrote, “the Committee’s efforts risk appearing more like a political news conference than a hearing aimed at a balanced look at serious issues.”

Jeffery Dettbarn, an Iowa City VA Medical Center employee, said he had an “unblemished record before blowing the whistle on the improper mass cancellation of what turned out to be tens of thousands of radiology orders.”

The retaliation against him, he said, is a “banishment” from patient care as a radiologic technologist that began in July 2017 and continues. “My current situation is unbearable. . . . I am forced to forgo about one-third of my salary” because he no longer gets on-call pay. “But worst of all,” he added, “the VA won’t let me care for veterans.”

Dettbarn said VA has attempted to fire him and also filed “bogus complaints to my licensing agencies. . . . All these allegations were unfounded, but these attacks are incredibly damaging and threaten my professional livelihood.”

VA said complaints about his clinical performance were raised by other VA whistleblowers and the decision regarding his disciplinary action was made before his disclosures.

Charges such as these led Tom Devine, legal director of the advocacy group Government Accountability Project, to tell the panel that VA “remains a free-speech Death Valley for government witnesses. . . . Retaliation is ingrained in the culture” of the department. Forty percent of the 25 whistleblowers he represents are VA clients, he said, “an extraordinary number for an agency that comprises less than 20 percent of the executive branch workforce.”

A department statement said “there is no other agency in the federal government that puts more of a focus on the importance of protecting whistleblowers.”

Aghevli said the retaliation against her caused episodes of severe panic and prolonged tachycardia, an abnormally rapid heart rate. She is on medical leave. Testifying for the first time before Congress was nerve-racking. “I felt both horrified and heartbroken, but also relieved,” she said, to have told her story.

Getting a notice of proposed termination the day before her testimony, when she told her office about it weeks before, was “deliberately intimidating towards me,” she said in an interview, and an effort to frighten other whistleblowers.

Aghevli said she was removed from patient care in April, a few weeks after her complaint about a patient safety issue. She is eager to return to “my veterans.”

“I love my job and the veterans that I treat,” she told the subcommittee. “I can’t imagine any job I’d rather do.”

She might have to start thinking about that. VA doesn’t want her anymore.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been pushing back against the move, concerned about losing an agency that has cybersecurity and investigative components.

USDA identifies unapproved GMO wheat growing wild in Washington,https://www.upi.com,['Jessie Higgins'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/06/27/USDA-identifies-unapproved-GMO-wheat-growing-wild-in-Washington/6441561660173/,"No genetically engineered wheat is approved for use in the United States. Photo by Alexandr Dobysh/Shutterstock

June 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified the genetically modified, unapproved wheat found growing wild in Washington state as a grain created by Monsanto.

The wheat was genetically engineered to withstand the company's Roundup herbicide, which would allow farmers to better kill other plants without affecting their wheat crops. It's called Roundup Ready wheat.

The company also makes Roundup Ready corn and soybeans, both of which are approved by the USDA.

The wheat, also called MON 71800, does not have USDA approval -- no genetically engineered wheat is approved from commercial use anywhere in the world.

RELATED Unapproved GMO wheat found growing wild in Washington

Monsanto petitioned for its approval in 2002 and 2004, but chose to withdraw its applications before the agency issued a ruling, said Rick Coker, a USDA spokesman.

However, the Food and Drug Administration completed a ""voluntary consultation"" of MON 71800 in 2004, ""concluding that this GE wheat is as safe as food and feed as non-GE wheat currently on the market,"" Coker said.

The Roundup Ready wheat was found growing wild in eastern Washington state in early June in an area that was ""possibly on the site of a former [Monsanto] field trial,"" Charla Lord, a spokeswoman for Bayer, which recently purchased Monsanto, said shortly after it was found.

The USDA still is reviewing the situation, and anticipates the investigation will take between six and nine months, Coker said.

Bayer had no comment on the USDA's most recent findings. Shortly after the USDA announced the discovery June 7, the company issued the statement, ""We are cooperating with USDA to gather more information and facts as the agency reviews the situation. We will provide more information when possible."""

Dwight Adams, dwight.adams@indystar.com

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency misled the public about the risks of cancer-causing contamination in Franklin's groundwater by claiming on its website that the situation was ""under control,"" the agency’s Office of Inspector General said Thursday.

The OIG advised the agency to remove and update the information on its website to help protect the health of residents in Franklin, where a cluster of childhood cancers has raised public concern about an industrial site.

The oversight arm of the agency considered the situation so urgent that it released its findings immediately, rather than waiting for completion of a multi-city review of the EPA, whose release is anticipated in December.

The contamination in Franklin is a combination of trichloroethylene, or TCE, and tetrachloroethylene, or PCE. Both are volatile organic compounds that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists as known carcinogens, meaning they can cause cancer in humans.

A local community group has documented at least 58 cases of childhood cancer – often rare forms of blood and brain cancer – in Franklin and surrounding towns since 2008. Researchers have so far failed to find a direct link between the contamination and the cancer cluster.

But the EPA has known for decades that the former Amphenol industrial site has been contaminated with the chemicals. Yet little has been done to address the problem or to communicate the risk to the public — which the OIG says is not OK.

“The EPA’s communication of inaccurate and outdated human health exposure and groundwater migration information for the Amphenol site may impact human health,” according to the IG’s letter to the EPA. “The OIG is issuing this report because the EPA should convey the most accurate, reliable and up-to-date information on matters related to public health.”

Dr. Mary Beth Hensley, a doctor in Franklin, shows officials from the EPA Office of Inspector General a map of cancer cases around the city in relation to a known contaminated site.

The Inspector General visited Franklin in May as part of an eight-city review of the EPA's efforts to inform residents when environmental risks are discovered. Officials told residents at that time that they could expect the report at that end of the year.

They would only release something sooner if it was a more serious problem that needed an immediate response, the inspectors told the community.

The OIG issued just such an alert on Thursday. The alert claims that the agency’s website inaccurately stated that the contamination in Franklin was “controlled” when, in fact, the agency was still testing to determine the extent of the toxins and how they should be fixed.

The situation became public in May, when an IndyStar review of EPA communication guidelines showed that the EPA stated publicly that the contamination was “under control” without any scientific testing to back up that claim.

The review also found several other reasons for concern in the agency’s handling of contamination in Franklin, including not informing residents about upcoming testing that created confusion and caused some in the community to decline sampling.

In an emailed statement to IndyStar, the EPA said it has taken steps to implement the recommendations from the Inspector General’s June 27 management alert, which included updating the language on the website.

However, when IndyStar checked the Cleanup in My Communities website after receiving EPA’s statement, the site still referred to the contamination as “controlled.” The OIG has asked that EPA to respond with planned corrective actions within 15 days.

In its statement, the EPA also said that “properly communicating risk to the public is a fundamental part of EPA’s mission. EPA has placed a renewed emphasis on this aspect of our mission.""

Risk communication is critical because it allows residents in contaminated communities to take steps to protect their health. The OIG alert stated that, “Individuals may consult the EPA’s website and use the outdated information to make decisions about whether, when and how they may want to take protective measures to limit their exposure while living, working and playing near the site.”

Not having accurate information “is not consistent with” EPA’s guidance and “does not provide the public with a complete picture of the EPA’s work to address current contamination at the site,” the OIG wrote in it’s alert.

Attempts to reach the OIG’s audit director of land cleanup, Tina Lovingood, who is a leader on the multi-city review, were unsuccessful.

Stacie Davidson — one of the co-founders of the community group tracking cancer cases — was surprised to see the alert just two months after the IG meeting. But she and co-founder Kari Rhinehart also felt validated, she said.

“EPA was the very agency that everyone was excited to bring into Franklin because we looked at them as the savior, the one to protect the environment and public health and our community,” said Davidson, whose stepson Zane, 14, is now in remission after a three-year battle with a rare form of leukemia. Rhinehart lost her 13-year-old daughter, Emma Grace Findley, in 2014 from a rare brain tumor.

“So it has been really disheartening and bred a lot of distrust to keep falling short on telling us what’s going on,” she added.

In the absence of thorough EPA communication, Davidson and Rhinehart’s group If It Was Your Child has taken up the charge. Many community members credit the nonprofit with opening their eyes to the problem.

One such resident is Kathy Carlson, who has lived down the street from the Amphenol site since before the contamination was found. But the Franklin College professor and her husband never heard anything from the EPA when it discovered the contamination in the 1980s or put in a treatment system 11 years later.

The effectiveness of that system was called into question as the contamination moved offsite — something the EPA claimed hadn’t happened until testing in fall of last year confirmed its spread.

The EPA continues to work at the site, including sewer replacements expected to begin in August. It also announced that it would work to improve communication with residents, setting up a regular progress reports to community leaders.

Davidson said that has yet to be done but she is hopeful, particularly given the alert and OIG review. She also is happy to see that other communities could be improved by the alert, as the Inspector General has recommended the EPA update its contamination status reports for all sites.

The FTC’s Qualcomm Case Reveals Concerning Divide with DOJ on Patent Hold-Up,https://www.ipwatchdog.com,['The Author'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/06/28/ftcs-qualcomm-case-reveals-concerning-divide-doj-patent-hold/id=110764/,"“For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty.”

On May 2, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took the unusual step of submitting a Statement of Interest in the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) case against Qualcomm to take a position contrary to the FTC. The DOJ argued that “[b]ecause an overly broad remedy could result in reduced innovation, with the potential to harm American consumers, this Court should hold a hearing and order additional briefing to determine a proper remedy that protects competition while working minimal harm to public and private interests.” In response, the FTC informed the court that it “did not participate in or request” the DOJ’s filing, that it “disagree[d] with a number of contentions” made by the DOJ, and that the DOJ “misconstrues applicable law and the record.” In the end, the court agreed with the FTC and issued injunctive relief against Qualcomm without conducting the further remedy proceedings the DOJ advocated.

Underscoring the Divide

The public feuding between the two federal antitrust enforcement agencies about how to resolve a case litigated by one them was a remarkable spectacle. It also brought into focus a broader divide between the FTC and DOJ on the role of antitrust law in addressing patents that are essential to industry standards (SEPs) and subject to commitments to license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

Since being confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division in September 2017, Makan Delrahim has shifted the DOJ’s longstanding focus on the risks of patent hold-up—where SEP owners take advantage of large investments by companies to develop products using a standard to extract unreasonable, non-FRAND licensing terms—to address what he views as the greater risk of patent hold-out—which he defines as potential licensees colluding on issues such as licensing terms for SEPs. In a March 16, 2018 speech, Delrahim said that “hold-up is fundamentally not an antitrust problem, and therefore antitrust law should not be used as a tool to police FRAND commitments that patent-holders make to standard setting organizations” and offered his view that “implementer hold-out poses a more serious threat to innovation than innovator hold-up.”

Joseph Simons, the FTC Chairman, addressed this divide in a September 25, 2018 speech. While he noted that “[c]onsistency across the two federal enforcement agencies is . . . beneficial,” he observed that treatment of SEPs may be an area for “some potential inconsistency” between the agencies. He elaborated that “we agree with the Division that hold-out in the standard-setting process can raise serious concerns under antitrust law when such hold-out is the result of collusion among potential adopters/licensees. But we also believe that hold-up raises potential antitrust issues, as well.” Simons committed that the FTC “will continue our economically grounded and fact-based enforcement of the antitrust laws in this area.” Consistent with that approach, the FTC contended in a December 2018 filing in the Qualcomm case that “Qualcomm’s refusal to make SEP licenses available to competitors in breach of its voluntary commitments to standard-setting organizations is anticompetitive conduct.”

Although the DOJ submission in the Qualcomm case did not take a position on the merits, it appears to have been motivated by, and is consistent with, Delrahim’s efforts to downplay the potential for harm from patent hold-up. (Delrahim, who lobbied for Qualcomm, is reportedly recused from matters involving Qualcomm and did not sign the DOJ’s Qualcomm filing.) The DOJ filing highlighted the divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this important issue. It was not always so. For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty regarding what had been a consensus area of concern for the agencies.

The Roles of the DOJ and FTC

Before turning to how the DOJ and FTC have previously addressed patent hold-up, it is worth briefly examining the dual roles of the DOJ and FTC in enforcing the antitrust laws.

Among other statutes, the DOJ Antitrust Division is charged with criminal and civil enforcement under the Sherman Act and civil enforcement under the Clayton Act. The DOJ also provides guidance on the application of antitrust laws, including by issuing business review letters advising on how it may respond to particular proposed joint ventures or other business conduct.

The FTC was created with the passage of the FTC Act, which directs the agency to prevent “unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(2). As interpreted by the FTC, Section 5 of the FTC Act “encompasses not only those acts and practices that violate the Sherman or Clayton Act but also those that contravene the spirit of the antitrust laws and those that, if allowed to mature or complete, could violate the Sherman or Clayton Act.” Unlike the DOJ, the FTC does not conduct criminal enforcement.

The jurisdictions and roles of the FTC and DOJ thus overlap, including in merger reviews, investigations of anticompetitive conduct, and offering guidance on the antitrust laws. The agencies employ a “clearance” process to ensure that they do not undertake duplicative investigations that would, among other problems, subject targets to competing demands from the agencies and potentially lead to conflicting outcomes.

When it comes to the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property, both agencies have oversight responsibilities and they have collaborated to issue guidance on their shared approach to enforcement. For example, in 1995, the agencies jointly issued Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property setting forth their policy on antitrust treatment of licensing intellectual property.

The DOJ and FTC Have Traditionally Agreed on the Dangers of Patent Hold-Up

Over the course of more than a decade—across both the Republican Bush Administration and the Democratic Obama Administration—the DOJ and FTC both consistently recognized that SEPs present a danger of hold-up, and that this was a proper subject for antitrust agency enforcement.

As early as 2006, the DOJ warned of the dangers of patent hold-up in a business review letter to a standard-setting organization (SSO): “Once a particular technology is chosen and the standard is developed . . . it can be extremely expensive or even impossible to substitute one technology for another. . . . Thus, those seeking to implement a given standard may be willing to license a patented technology included in the standard on more onerous terms than they would have been prior to the standard’s adoption in order to avoid the expense and delay of developing a new standard around a different technology.”

In 2007, the DOJ and FTC partnered to issue a report called Antitrust Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights: Promoting Innovation and Competition. The agencies described the “potential for ‘hold up’ by the owner of patented technology after its technology has been chosen by the SSO as a standard and others have incurred sunk costs which effectively increase the relative cost of switching to an alternative standard.” The agencies warned that this “power to extract higher royalties or other licensing terms” could harm consumers “if those higher royalties were passed on in the form of higher prices.”

In 2013, the DOJ partnered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office on a Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments. The Policy warned of the risk that SEPs could be used “to pressure an implementer of a standard to accept more onerous licensing terms than the patent holder would be entitled to receive consistent with the F/RAND commitment.” A DOJ official explained that the Statement “was informed by over a decade of thinking by the [DOJ Antitrust Division], the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the PTO about standards-setting activities and the IP policies of standard-setting organizations (SSOs).” (Delrahim announced in December 2018 that the DOJ was withdrawing its assent to the Statement.)

Beyond issuing guidance, the DOJ also accounted for patent hold-up in enforcement. In 2012, when the DOJ closed its investigation of Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings and a consortium’s acquisition of Nortel Networks’ SEPs, it explained that it had “focused on whether the acquiring firms would have the incentive and ability to exploit ambiguities in the SSOs’ F/RAND licensing commitments to hold up rivals, thus preventing or inhibiting innovation and competition,” including by “seeking to prevent or exclude products from practicing those SEPs from the market altogether.”

For its part, the FTC has challenged hold-up through seven enforcement actions over two decades. Those include a 2005 consent order with Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) after the FTC accused it of monopolizing a market for low-emission gasoline by misrepresenting in state regulatory standard-setting proceedings that an approach to reducing emissions was in the public domain when Unocal was actively pursuing patents on the technology that would later allow it to charge hold-up royalties to its competitors.

A Cause for Concern

The DOJ’s turn away from its long-held position on the risks of patent hold-up is a cause for serious concern.

First, it is bad policy. In explaining the DOJ’s about-face, Delrahim has referred to a “so-called ‘hold-up’ problem in the context of SSOs” and contended that concerns with hold-up “rely on models devoid of economic or empirical evidence that hold-up is a real phenomenon.” But the DOJ’s prior recognition of the risks of patent hold-up was well supported.

U.S. courts have long recognized that SEPs pose a hold-up threat. In 2007, for example, the Third Circuit observed that “[t]o guard against anticompetitive patent hold-up, most [standards development organizations] require firms supplying essential technologies for inclusion in a prospective standard to commit to licensing their technologies on FRAND terms.” Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 313 (3d Cir. 2007). More recently, the Ninth Circuit explained that “[t]he development of standards . . . creates an opportunity for companies to engage in anti-competitive behavior” and that “[u]sing that standard-development leverage, the SEP holders are in a position to demand more for a license than the patented technology, had it not been adopted by the SSO, would be worth.” Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 795 F.3d 1024, 1031 (9th Cir. 2015); see also, e.g., Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“SEPs pose two potential problems that could inhibit widespread adoption of the standard: patent hold-up and royalty stacking”).

As to the economics of patent hold-up, the DOJ observed in a 2015 business review letter that the “economic bargaining model underlying claims of hold-up has been studied extensively and applied to the standard-setting context,” citing scholarship dating back decades. That conclusion echoed the views of the DOJ and FTC in their 2007 report that patent hold-up is simply a “variant of the classic ‘hold-up problem’.” The DOJ also noted in its 2015 letter that “litigated cases demonstrate the potential for hold up when owners of RAND-encumbered standards-essential patents make royalty demands significantly above the adjudicated RAND rate” and provided examples where licensors’ demands were on the order of about 170 to 230 times what courts determined were RAND rates.

Recognition of the dangers of hold-up is thus well supported as a matter of law and economics. To be sure, if competitors collude in an SSO to fix the terms on which they will license technology, antitrust enforcement would be appropriate. But simply because one can envision the possibility of an alternative form of anticompetitive conduct relating to standard setting does not mean that the DOJ should simply ignore the well-documented existence of another form of harm.

Second, the DOJ’s abrupt shift away from over a decade of guidance on hold-up creates uncertainty for the many industries that rely on standards. While the shift in policy has been cast as being motivated by a concern for fostering innovation, it threatens to have the opposite effect. Companies planning investments in standardized products now face greater uncertainty about whether they can count on established rules, particularly as articulated in the DOJ’s business review letters, to safeguard their ability to license SEPs on FRAND terms.

Third, that a change in administration has led the DOJ to turn away from a long-held, bipartisan approach plays into the perception that antitrust enforcement is increasingly a political tool. While there may be higher profile examples of the politicization of antitrust enforcement, any step that suggests that a change in administration, not law and economics, will lead to wholesale departure from existing antitrust policy is troubling."
Tillerson claims Kushner conducted diplomacy behind his back in congressional testimony,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tillerson-claims-that-kushner-conducted-diplomacy-behind-his-back-in-congressional-testimony/,"Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cited an awkward encounter with President Donald Trump's son-in-law in a restaurant as an example of diplomacy being conducted behind his back when he was in the administration, according to a newly released transcript of a congressional hearing.

Tillerson, who was fired by Trump in March 2018 , mentioned the story during a day of closed-door testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee about his rocky, 13-month tenure as secretary of state. He described his surprise to find that he happened to be dining in the same Washington restaurant while Jared Kushner and Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Luis Videgaray had a private meal.

The former top U.S. diplomat and CEO of ExxonMobil said he ""could see the color go out"" of the Mexican official's face when Tillerson greeted them at their table with a smile.

""And I said: 'I don't want to interrupt what y'all are doing,'"" Tillerson recalled for the committee. ""I said 'Give me a call next time you're coming to town. And I left it at that.""

The account from the transcript released Thursday suggests that Trump's top diplomat was in the dark as the new administration was grappling with major foreign policy issues.

Trump had harsh words for his former top diplomat in December after Tillerson said in rare public remarks that the president was ""undisciplined"" and did not like to read briefing reports. Trump called him ""dumb as a rock"" in a tweet.

Tillerson described the restaurant incident as an example of one of the challenges he faced as secretary of state until Trump abruptly fired him over social media.

He said it was a ""unique situation"" to have the president's son-in-law as a White House adviser, saying ""there was not a real clear understanding"" of Kushner's role and responsibilities.

""No one really described what he was going to be doing,"" he said. ""I just knew what his title was.""

Tillerson said there other examples. He noted that Kushner ""met often"" with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and that the president's son-in-law requested that the secretary speak with an official from the kingdom to discuss a document they had been developing that was ""kind of a roadmap"" for the future of the relationship between the two countries.

The foreign trips raised concerns, the former secretary said, because Kushner would not coordinate with the State Department or the local embassy in the countries he visited. Tillerson said he raised the issue with him but ""not much changed.""

A committee member asked about a private dinner in May 2017 attended by Kushner, Steve Bannon, bin Salman and Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates in which they discussed the plans by Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. to blockade the neighboring Gulf nation of Qatar, which hosts the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, in the coming weeks.

Tillerson said he didn't know about any such dinner but that it would have made him ""angry"" if it had occurred, since he and others in the administration were caught off guard by the blockade a few weeks later. The committee did not cite a source for their information about the dinner. The White House said it did not occur and disputed the former secretary's broader criticism of Kushner.

""This story is false and a cheap attempt to rewrite history. The alleged 'dinner' to supposedly discuss the blockade never happened, and neither Jared, nor anyone in the White House, was involved in the blockade,"" presidential spokesman Hogan Gidley said. ""The White House operated under the belief the Secretary of State at the time, Mr. Tillerson, would and should know what his own team was working on.""

Gidley added that Kushner ""consistently follows proper protocols"" with the National Security Council and the State Department, ""and this instance is no different.""

Bannon did not respond to a request for comment.

The testimony, with Tillerson accompanied by a personal lawyer and a State Department attorney, took place in private last month. A transcript was released Thursday. There were large sections redacted, including some where he discusses issues related to an Oval Office meeting that involved the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak .

He was prohibited from discussing private conversations with Trump and avoided certain highly publicized incidents, including reports he once referred to the president as a ""moron.""

He told the committee he had never met Trump before being urged by him to take the job and he was stunned by the offer after his long career as an oil industry executive with extensive overseas experience, especially in Russia and the Middle East.

Tillerson, who had been acquainted with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the late 1990s, said he told the leader during his first visit as secretary of state that relations with the United States were bad but could be improved if they worked to build trust.

""I said the relationship is the worst it's been since the Cold War but I looked him in the eye and I said but it can get worse and we can't let that happen,"" he said."
"Democratic senator blocks DHS nominations, citing border conditions",https://www.cnn.com,['Priscilla Alvarez'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/politics/democratic-senator-holds-dhs-nominations/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is blocking two of President Donald Trump's Department of Homeland Security nominees, citing ""inhumane and substandard"" conditions for children at the department's facilities, according to her office.

Rosen said she will delay the nominations of Chad F. Wolf for DHS under secretary for strategy, policy, and plans and Troy D. Edgar for chief financial officer. Earlier this month, the two appeared before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

The future of their nominations now remain on hold, ""until the inhumane and substandard conditions for children at DHS processing and detention facilities improve significantly,"" Rosen said in a statement.

""I will maintain these holds until a nongovernmental third party certifies that DHS has complied. I will use all tools available to hold this Administration accountable for their treatment of vulnerable children and families,"" she added.

The move is yet another setback for the Trump administration which has been occupying several roles in DHS with acting heads, particularly in leadership.

Architect of clean-air rollbacks resigns at EPA,https://www.greencarreports.com,"['Eric C. Evarts', 'Eric C. Evarts - Contributor', 'Bengt Halvorson - Senior Editor']",,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123829_architect-of-clean-air-rollbacks-resigns-at-epa,"EPA Office of Air and Radiation Administrator Bill Wehrum, an attorney who formerly represented power companies in their effort to roll back clean-air regulations, has resigned.

The biggest air-quality issues that the Office of Air and Radiation oversees are tailpipe emissions from cars, and emissions from power plants that increasingly provide power for electric cars.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler made the announcement Wednesday. He didn't cite a reason for Wehrum's departure, but the air-office chief had expressed concern about the effects of a Congressional investigation into his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, according to a Washington Post report.

In his year and a half on the job, the office has drafted new regulations rolling back signature climate control programs from the Obama administration, including ratcheting up fuel-economy requirements from cars and the Clean Power Plan, which would have required coal-fired powerplants to capture carbon or convert to cleaner fuels. (The latter is mostly happening anyway for economic reasons.)

The long-anticipated final rule to freeze federal emissions and fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through 2026 is expected to be released at any time, though the EPA exchanged heated words with California officials in Congress last week.

Last Wednesday, the agency released the new Affordable Clean Energy rule, designed to replace the Clean Power Plan, which critics say will reduce global warming emissions from power plants by less than half the amount required to meet global climate-change reduction goals.

Under Wehrum, the agency also proposed a new rule that would change the way health benefits from proposed regulations are calculated to make it harder to pass new clean-air regulations.

Wehrum was confirmed under former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned last year under a cloud of ethical investigations over his relationships with lobbyists.

Automakers have been lobbying Congress and the Trump administration to work with California and come up with new vehicle emissions rules. Companies are okay with annual increases but want more flexibility in meeting them and more uniformity between the EPA, NHTSA, and California.

Environmental groups were quick to celebrate Wehrum's departure at the end of the month. No replacement has yet been named."
Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

""This has nothing to do with who’s in office. Things got worse two years ago because the media's attention turned off whistleblowers and turned on to politics and other things,"" she said Tuesday.

""It has nothing to do with who's in the president's office or who controls Congress. This is a malignant leadership culture that will outlast us all unless someone has the courage to break rank in leadership and finally change it."""

As President Trump heads into a crucial meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, sitting by his side will be Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is quietly but steadily pushing U.S.-China policy into a more competitive and often confrontational position.

Pompeo’s first year as the nation’s top diplomat focused largely on North Korea and Iran, but he is now spending more time and attention on dealing with China. For example, Pompeo often attends “Saturday morning seminars” at the State Department, where outside experts come in to talk about strategic issues detached from the daily crises — and where China is the most frequent topic.

Increasingly, Pompeo has been speaking out about China’s malign activities, while privately asking his staff to produce an overarching analysis of the motivations behind the Chinese Communist Party’s conduct and strategies to respond.

Their challenge is to take the Trump administration’s various actions on China and weave them into a broader strategy that can gain bipartisan support and outlive the current administration. “We are trying to create an intellectually persuasive argument about China being the number one challenge to the United States,” a senior State Department official told me.

The project, led by State Policy Planning Director Kiron Skinner and Miles Yu, a U.S. Naval Academy history professor, faced criticism after Skinner described the U.S.-China competition as “a fight with a really different civilization and ideology” in April. Critics of the Trump administration’s China approach seized upon those remarks, as did the Chinese government. State Department officials said her remarks, which also referred to China as “not Caucasian,” were taken out of context.

But Pompeo’s State Department has concluded that decades of engagement-focused U.S. policy have failed, and now the United States and its partners must change course and respond to the Chinese government’s strategy and behavior.

“We fundamentally erred by underestimating and misunderstanding China’s true intention, which is to create a Chinese Communist Party-dominated world order to replace the world order created by the U.S. and its allies,” the official said. “It’s not a clash of civilizations, it’s a clash of political systems.”

Critics like to say Trump’s China approach represents a Cold War mentality or a zero-sum game. That misunderstands what the U.S. government is trying to do. Pompeo’s approach is to separate the areas of the U.S.-China relationship where confrontation is needed from those where cooperation is mutually beneficial.

And while Pompeo hasn’t given a headline China speech such as the one Vice President Pence gave last year, he has ramped up his public criticism of Beijing. He called for Beijing to release more than 1 million ethnic minorities held in internment camps and heavily criticized Beijing’s human rights practices on the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

In a May speech in Finland, Pompeo warned against Chinese encroachment in the Arctic. Two days later in London, he linked China’s internal repression, economic aggression and technological ambition as part of one comprehensive strategy and called on allies to help confront it by shunning Chinese tech companies.

“In China, we face a new kind of challenge. It’s an authoritarian regime that’s integrated economically into the West in ways the Soviet Union never was,” he said.

As secretary of state, Pompeo must balance confronting China with maintaining Beijing’s cooperation on issues such as North Korea and Iran. He must also balance limited diplomatic resources. Officials say he plans to shift personnel and expertise broadly and within each embassy to increase the focus on China.

Shortly after taking office, Pompeo sought to replace Rex Tillerson’s choice for assistant secretary of state for East Asia, Susan Thornton, whose pro-engagement views clashed with those of her Trump administration colleagues. The replacement effort took a year, but this month retired Air Force Gen. David Stilwell, whose views on China track Pompeo’s, was finally confirmed by the Senate for the job.

There’s a sense that Pompeo’s argument is directed internally, as well. Some officials, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are resisting a more confrontational China policy. Trump wants to be tough on China on trade and economic aggression but shows little interest in China’s human rights violations or its coercion of Taiwan, for example.

Skinner compared the State Department’s effort to George Kennan’s Long Telegram, which formed the basis for the Cold War containment approach. But she was not saying China is like the Soviet Union; she was saying the China challenge is more complex and, in a way, more daunting.

Kennan, in fact, was a realist who believed in accommodating the Soviet Union. Pompeo is no Kennan; he’s much more hawkish.

The truth is, nobody knows where Trump will end up on China on any specific point. But Pompeo’s twin approach of confronting China now while planning for longer-term resilience against Beijing’s strategy is meant to ensure that the ongoing shift in Washington over China is not dependent on any one administration.

Bush and Bill Clinton made several subtle digs at the current administration while discussing hot-button issues Thursday night during a conversation recognizing graduates of their leadership program.

""I disagree with so much of what's happening today,"" Clinton said. ""I think diversity is a godsend. I think it's one of America's great blessings.""

Their conversation was held at the George W. Bush Presidential Center as a part of the graduation ceremony for the 2019 class of Presidential Leadership Scholars, celebrating the almost 60 people who completed the former presidents' leadership program.

Two former scholars -- Lisa Hallett, CEO of Wear Blue: Run to Remember, and Jay Bhatt, senior vice president and chief marketing officer of the American Hospital Association -- joined Clinton and Bush onstage. The discussion was centered on health care and veterans' affairs, but both former presidents also bemoaned the perceived lack of bipartisanship in America.

""I've been concerned for a long time about how we keep drifting apart,"" Clinton said. ""We all say we want people to work together, but at least in politics, we don't always vote for what we say we want."""

FedEx sues the US government over Huawei ban confusion,https://www.theinquirer.net,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3077964/fedex-sues-us-gov-over-huawei-ban-confusion,"FedEx is lining up to take on the US government

PARCEL FLINGER FedEx has launched a lawsuit against the US government arguing that it isn't its place to screen packages for products banned under export rules.

The suit was filed in the aftermath of an incident which saw a number of packages containing Huawei devices 'mishandled' by the company, with one unit actually refused for delivery.

FedEx has argued that its 'common carrier rights' have been breached by being forced to assume liability for handling packages covered by laws such as the recent White House Executive Order which effectively bans Huawei from the US.

In a message to the Department of Commerce, FedEx argued that ""the increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden on FedEx and common carriers.""

In one specific incident, a UK tech journalist sent a Huawei handset to colleagues in the US via FedEx, only to have it returned due to ""a government issue"". FedEx later admitted it had made an error by refusing.

Meanwhile, Bejing authorities also began investigating FedEx after two packages bound for China were diverted to the US.

In a statement, the company said: ""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" whilst the lawsuit argues that the rules ""essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally,"".

A US government spokesman said: ""We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting US national security,"".

FedEx has said that Huawei is just one significant example of a wider issue for carriers in the 21st century. It also demonstrates just how unclear the rules over Huawei's US ban actually are, and they don't seem to be getting much clearer. μ"
Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign,https://www.politico.com,"['Ted Hesson', 'Nancy Cook']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/26/dhs-chief-immigration-1557047,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo employment & immigration Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/2544/1155968404_6052675317001_6052674030001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."

Two State officials told CNN that Lawler was called into the office of the deputy secretary on Monday afternoon and told he needed to leave due to the status of the investigation.

On the same afternoon, senior staff in the protocol office met with State Department management and were told that Lawler had to leave over personnel issues, according to the officials.

They were also told in this meeting that their new acting chief of protocol is Mary-Kate Fisher, and her acting deputy is Cathy Fenton, who served as social secretary in the George W. Bush White House and also handled social affairs‎ for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush. State Department sources said both are highly respected.

One of the State Department officials described what multiple others told CNN was a pattern of behavior on Lawler's part. ""In my decade of government service, I have never seen someone so unprofessional, abrasive and rude as him,"" the official said. ""His bad behavior was terrible, and it was obvious. I personally saw it myself, as did a good chunk of the office.

"So deep in student debt, they're suing Betsy DeVos over delays in loan forgiveness",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Sarah Min'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/betsy-devos-former-students-sue-betsy-devos-and-department-of-education-over-loan-forgiveness-delays/,"Seven plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, alleging they're illegally stalling on processing more than 158,000 applications for student loan forgiveness.

Under the ""borrower defense"" rule, defrauded students can apply for loan relief if their schools were found to have misled them.

The Education Department blamed a constant stream of politicized litigation for any holds on processing claims.

Alicia Davis feels like she was scammed. As a student at Florida Metropolitan University from 2006 to 2008, she said she was told the cost of her online criminal justice program would be covered by Pell grants and scholarships. She was told her credits could be transferred to other schools. Graduating from the school, a subsidiary of the for-profit Corinthian Colleges, would lead to a job and a decent wage.

None of it was true, said Davis, who accrued more than $22,000 in student loans from FMU. The 36-year-old is now one of seven plaintiffs suing the U.S. Department of Education and its chief, Betsy DeVos, for allegedly failing to offer relief to more than 158,000 student-loan borrowers who claim they were defrauded by for-profit colleges.

""They pretty much sold me a lie and a dream,"" Davis told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Turns out pretty much all of it was a lie.""

More than 158,000 pending claims for loan forgiveness

Davis and her co-plaintiffs are pinning their lawsuit on the ""borrower defense"" rule, which allows students to apply for loan forgiveness if their schools were found to have misled them. The rule was expanded during the Obama administration after Corinthian Colleges collapsed in 2015, spotlighting widespread fraud at some for-profit schools. Over 200,000 former students have applied for loan cancellation since 2015 — and the suit says three-quarters of those claims are still pending.

Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending, which filed the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, said the Department of Education has illegally halted processing forgiveness applications under DeVos's tenure, neither rejecting nor approving any claims. According to the complaint, the department ""intentionally adopted a policy of inaction and obfuscation."" The Education Department last approved a borrower-defense application in June 2018.

Financial tips for new college grads with student debt

""The Department of Education has knowingly enabled for-profit colleges to defraud students,"" Eileen Connor, legal director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending, said in a statement. ""It recklessly continued to act as a loan broker for disreputable schools despite clear records of abuse and misconduct,"" Connor added.

The Harvard Law project, which also released an open call for testimonials from former for-profit students, said the online form received more than 200 submissions in 24 hours. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco.

Previously delayed

The Education Department disputes the allegations, saying it's ready to finalize borrower-defense claims when other pending litigation over student loans is resolved and the courts allow it to proceed. Department officials also blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of claims, saying it failed to put into place an effective process to review a flood of applications.

""The only thing stopping the Department from finalizing thousands of these claims is the constant stream of litigation brought by ideological, so-called student advocate special interests,"" spokeswoman Liz Hill said in a statement.

DeVos has been sued before for her stance on the Obama-era borrower-defense policy, which she tried to delay from being implemented in 2017, saying it too easily allows students to ""raise his or her hand"" to get ""free money."" A federal judge ruled against the delay last September, finding it unlawful and calling it ""arbitrary and capricious.""

Instead, DeVos rolled out a more restrictive tiered relief system in December to partially compensate defrauded students based on their earnings. The plan has been frozen as part of a separate lawsuit.

Key issue in 2020

The latest lawsuit against DeVos has already won praise among dozens of progressive groups and Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren, who tweeted her support Tuesday saying, ""If she doesn't care about helping defrauded students, then let's hope a federal judge will make her care.""

I’m glad students cheated by shady for-profit colleges are fighting back against @BetsyDeVosED in court. If she doesn’t care about helping defrauded students, then let’s hope a federal judge will make her care. https://t.co/nJp0mwbw4S — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 25, 2019

The lawsuit comes as student loan debt becomes a key issue on the presidential campaign trail. Both Senators Warren and Bernie Sanders announced plans to forgive student loan debt, which has climbed to nearly $1.6 trillion nationwide for 44 million Americans. While proposing different solutions, both presidential candidates seek to erase a burden making it difficult for Americans to reach traditional milestones, like owning a home or a car or starting a family.

U.S. Reps. Susie Lee and Rosa DeLauro released joint legislation Wednesday to improve protections of students, including veterans, at for-profit colleges, including bolstering and enforcing borrower defense against repayment.

Today, along w/@Rosa_DeLauro, I introduced the PROTECT Students Act to finally give student protections from #4profit colleges.@BetsyDevosED has rolled back for-profit oversight, leaving students open to all kinds of predatory practices. No more. Let's put our students first. — Rep. Susie Lee (@RepSusieLee) June 26, 2019

Davis, with her $22,000 in federal loans to attend FMU, said she had to start her education over from scratch after learning her college credits weren't transferable and her certifications were not recognized. She went on to amass an additional $75,000 in loans to get her bachelor's and master's degrees and is now a crime analyst at a law enforcement agency.

But Davis, an Orlando resident, said her time at FMU continues to dog her in other ways: Even after establishing a borrower-defense claim in 2016, she received notices from the U.S. Department of Education threatening to garnish her wages. Having defaulted on her FMU loans at that time, she has had to explain her poor credit score to employers before any hiring offer. It has also prevented her from buying a car.

She hopes her suit can help others who may feel embarrassed or ashamed to move forward: ""Then we can do the next step and close this next part of our lives and hopefully recover financially, emotionally and become stable,"" she said."
Commerce Dept. ordered ex-official not to answer House panel questions,https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Desiderio'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/commerce-house-panel-questions-1380209,"James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross (pictured), was instructed not to answer questions from the House Oversight and Reform Committee. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images congress Commerce Dept. ordered ex-official not to answer House panel questions

A former senior Commerce Department official refused to answer more than 100 questions during an interview with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that centered on the Trump administration’s controversial decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, according to a transcript released Tuesday.

Commerce Department lawyers instructed James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Secretary Wilbur Ross, not to answer the committee’s questions about his contacts with the White House and his conversations with Ross.

Story Continued Below

Uthmeier was also directed not to discuss the contents of a memo he wrote to a senior Justice Department official, John Gore, that purportedly outlines legal arguments surrounding the addition of a citizenship question to the census. On several occasions, Uthmeier was also blocked from disclosing details about his own conversations with Gore.

The Trump administration has sought to block several witnesses from cooperating with House Democrats’ investigations, including the Oversight Committee’s investigation of the census and the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. In both cases, the Trump administration has asserted that current and former officials are immune from testifying about their conversations with the president and their tenure in the administration.

Earlier this month, the Oversight Committee voted to hold Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents about the citizenship question and the Justice and Commerce departments’ coordination in creating it. The vote came after Trump asserted executive privilege over all of the documents.

Late Monday night, the committee officially filed its contempt report.

Uthmeier, who worked at a law firm that counted Trump’s presidential campaign as a client, told the committee during his June 11 interview that he “spoke with White House personnel” about the citizenship question, but Commerce Department lawyers blocked him from stating the names of those White House officials. Uthmeier also acquiesced to the department’s demands that he refuse to answer questions about his conversations with Ross.

But Uthmeier did tell the committee that both Ross and Earl Comstock, Ross’ policy chief, asked him to look into the legal arguments about a citizenship question in early 2017. Commerce Department lawyers objected to every follow-up question seeking more details about those conversations, but Democrats said Uthmeier’s response showed that Ross lied to Congress about the true origins of the citizenship question when he said it was added to the census “solely” at the request of the Justice Department.

Uthmeier delivered his memo analyzing those legal questions to Gore, who then formally asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question.

Administration officials have said that the citizenship question was added to the 2020 census in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have been skeptical of that claim. Uthmeier did not answer a question about whether the memo he wrote for Gore discusses the Voting Rights Act.

When asked why he wrote the memo, Uthmeier said: “In my research, the Voting Rights Act came up, and I am not very familiar with the Voting Rights Act and all of its nuances, and thus, I was hoping John [Gore] would provide legal advice that dealt with the memo and the topics that I was investigating.” Uthmeier did not answer follow-up questions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the committee, said in a statement: “Official after official appearing before the committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-whites. The census is the foundation of our democracy, and our committee will continue doing everything in its power to ensure that it counts every single person in the United States.”

The committee has made the census probe — and the reasons a citizenship question was added — a central focus in its various investigations, which are also targeting Trump’s personal finances and the White House security clearance process.

Democrats say they’ve uncovered evidence supporting their claim that the Trump administration added the citizenship question in order to boost Republicans in future elections. Excluding noncitizens from the official census count, they say, would lead to redrawn congressional districts that favor Republicans.

Their investigation has revealed that administration officials spoke with immigration hard-liners known for their views on the citizenship question, including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, now-deceased GOP operative Thomas Hofeller, and John Baker, a law professor.

The White House blocked Kobach from answering the committee’s questions about his conversations with Trump and other senior officials, arguing that they are privileged. Hofeller opined frequently about how Republicans would benefit from a citizenship question. And Uthmeier told the committee that Baker, who espoused similar views, was a “long-time mentor.”"
Justice Department allocates $10M for 'law enforcement emergency' in Alaska,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Jeff Mordock']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/28/justice-department-allocates-10m-law-enforcement-e/,"Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday declared a law enforcement emergency in rural Alaska, as the state grapples with an alarmingly high crime rate and a shortage of police.

The move opens up more than $10 million in federal funds to bolster police efforts. Mr. Barr made the announcement roughly one month after touring Alaska. During the trip, Mr. Barr toured remote towns plagued with violence and drug crimes, but lacked law enforcement to deal with the problem.

“With this emergency declaration, I am directing resources where they are needed most and needed immediately, to support the local law enforcement response in Alaska Native communities, whose people are dealing with extremely high rates of violence,” Mr. Barr said in a statement.

Alaska has the highest per capita crime rate in the country, according to the Justice Department. In some of the remote tribal areas cases of domestic violence are 10 times the national average and sexual assaults are 12 times the national average.

“In many of these rural communities or villages, there isn’t a road. There is nothing,” Katie Sullivan, who heads the Justice Department’s Office of Justice Programs, told reporters. “Because of the geography, your state trooper may be up to two days away from being able to get in.

“If you are in a village or tribe and you have the courage to come forward [and report a crime] who do you report it to if there is no village police officer or tribal office and how do we preserve the evidence to successfully prosecute that case when your state trooper is far away,” she continued.

The move makes $6 million in emergency funding immediately available to strengthen law enforcement in Native Alaskan villages. That money will go towards hiring, buying equipment and training local law enforcement organizations, including tribal police officers and village public safety officers.

An additional $45 million has been allocated to fund 20 new law enforcement positions in the Native Alaska communities,

The Justice Department has also made another $162,000 available to U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder to create a Safe Neighborhoods site in Alaska. Safe neighborhoods is a Justice Department program to combat violent crime.

Additional steps taken by the Justice Department include the creation of a working group aimed at reducing the high rate of domestic violence in Alaska. The group will focus on domestic violence and crimes against children in rural communities, the department said. Mr. Schroder will lead the working group.

Mr. Barr is also requiring every law enforcement agency in Alaska to submit a plan to improve public safety, prioritizing drug and sexual assaults. The agencies must also work to improve their response times.
